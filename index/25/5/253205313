For remote collaboration, it is essential to intuitively grasp the situation and spatial location. However, the difficulty in grasping information about the remote user’s orientation can hinder remote communication. For example, if a remote user turns his or her head to the right to operate a device on the right, and this sensation cannot be shared, the image sent by the remote user suddenly appears to flow laterally, and it will lose the positional relationship like Figure 1 (left). Therefore, we propose a device using the ”hanger reflex” to experience the sensation of head rotation intuitively. The ”hanger reflex” is a phenomenon in which the head turns unconsciously when a wire hanger is placed on the head. It has been verified that the sensation of turning is produced by the distribution of pressure exerted by a device worn on the head. This research aims to construct a mechanism to verify its effectiveness for telecommunication that can unconsciously experience the remote user’s rotation sensation using the hanger reflex phenomenon. An inertial measurement unit(IMU) grasps the remote user’s rotation information like Figure 1 (right).
