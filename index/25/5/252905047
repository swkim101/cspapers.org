In this paper, we study the task of cold-start sequential recommendation, where new users with very short interaction sequences come with time. We cast this problem as a few-shot learning problem and adopt a meta-learning approach to developing our solution. For our task, a major obstacle of effective knowledge transfer that is there exists significant characteristic divergence between old and new interaction sequences for meta-learning. To address the above issues, we purpose a Multimodal MetaLearning (denoted as MML) approach that incorporates multimodal side information of items (e.g., text and image) into the meta-learning process, to stabilize and improve the meta-learning process for cold-start sequential recommendation. In specific, we design a group of multimodal meta-learners corresponding to each kind of modality, where ID features are used to develop the main meta-learner and the rest text and image features are used to develop auxiliary meta-learners. Instead of simply combing the predictions from different meta-learners, we design an adaptive, learnable fusion layer to integrate the predictions based on different modalities. Meanwhile, we design a cold-start item embedding generator, which utilize multimodal side information to warm up the ID embeddings of new items. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that MML can significantly improve the recommendation performance for cold-start users compared with baseline models.
