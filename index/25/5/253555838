In this paper, two lightweight cryptography methods were introduced and developed on hardware. The PRESENT lightweight block cipher, and the DM-PRESENT lightweight hash function were implemented on Intel FPGA. The PRESENT core with 64-bit block data and 80-bit data key consumes 2,945 logic element, 1,824 registers, and 273,408 memory bits. Meanwhile, the DM-PRESENT core with 64-bit input and 80-bit key consumes 2,336 logic element, 1,380 registers, and 273,408 memory bits. The PRESENT core with 128-bit key and DM-PRESENT based on this core were also implemented. These cores were simulated for functional verification and embedded in NIOS II for implementation possibility on hardware. They consumed less logic resources and power consumption compared with conventional cryptography methods.
