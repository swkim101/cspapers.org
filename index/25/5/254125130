Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging retrieval task under complex modality changes. Existing methods usually focus on extracting discriminative visual features while ignoring the reliability and commonality of visual features between different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework named Progressive Modality-shared Transformer (PMT) for effective VI-ReID. To reduce the negative effect of modality gaps, we first take the gray-scale images as an auxiliary modality and propose a progressive learning strategy. Then, we propose a Modality-Shared Enhancement Loss (MSEL) to guide the model to explore more reliable identity information from modality-shared features. Finally, to cope with the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences, we propose a Discriminative Center Loss (DCL) combined with the MSEL to further improve the discrimination of reliable features. Extensive experiments on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets show that our proposed framework performs better than most state-of-the-art methods.
