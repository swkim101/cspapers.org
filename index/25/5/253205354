3D content authoring in immersive environments has the advantage of allowing users to see a design result on its actual scale in real time. We present a system to intuitively create and modify 3D curve networks using bimanual gestures in virtual reality (VR). Our system provides a rich vocabulary of interactions in which both hands are used harmoniously following simple and intuitive grammar, and supports comprehensive manipulation of 3D curve networks.
