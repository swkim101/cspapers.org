Despite advancements with intelligence and connectivity in the workspace, productivity tools, such as to-do list applications, still, measure workers’ performance by a binary state—completed, yet completed, and thus the number of tasks completed. Such quantitative measurements can often overlook human values and individual well-being. While concepts such as positive computing and digital well-being are on the rise in the HCI community, few systems have been proposed to effectively integrate holistic considerations for mental and emotional well-being into productivity tools. In this work, we depart from the classic task list management tool and explore the construction of well-being-centered to-do list software. We propose a task management system–TaskScape—, which allow users to have awareness on the following two aspects: (1) how they plan and complete tasks and (2) how they feel towards their work. With the proposed system, we will investigate if having holistic view on their tasks can facilitate reflection on what they work on, how they stick to their plans, and how their tasks portfolio support their emotional well-being, nudging users to reflect upon their work, planning performance, and their emotional values towards their work. In this poster, we share the design, development, and ongoing validation progress of TaskScape, which is aimed to nudge workers to holistically view work productivity, reminding users that work is more than just work but life.
