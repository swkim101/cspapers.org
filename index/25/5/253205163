To complete successfully a high percentage of free throws in basketball, the shooter must achieve a stable trajectory with the ball. A player must practice shooting repeatedly to shoot a ball with a stable trajectory. However, traditional practice methods require the preparation of a real basketball hoop, which has made it difficult for some players to prepare a practice environment. We propose a training method for free throws using a virtual basketball hoop. In this paper, we present an implementation of the proposed method and experimental results showing its effectiveness.
