We investigate the use of deep learning to classify smart contract code vulnerabilities. We use different variants of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Five classes of vulnerabilities were employed. Our results suggest that the CNNs are able to provide a good level of accuracy, thus showing the viability of the proposed approach.
