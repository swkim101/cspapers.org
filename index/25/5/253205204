This study demonstrates a portable, low-noise system that utilizes electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) to present a body-sensory acoustic experience similar to that experienced during live concerts. Twenty-four participants wore head-mounted displays (HMDs), headphones, and the proposed system and experienced a live concert in a virtual reality (VR) space to evaluate the system. We found that the system was not inferior to a system with loudspeakers and subwoofers, where ambient noise concerns precision in rhythm and harmony. These results could be explained by the user perceiving the EMS experience as a single signal when the EMS stimulation is presented in conjunction with visual and acoustic stimuli (e.g., the kicking of a bass drum, the bass sound generated from the kicking, and the acoustic sensation caused by the bass sound). The proposed method offers a novel EMS-based body-sensory acoustic experience, and the results of this study may lead to an improved experience not only for live concerts in VR space but also for everyday music listening.
