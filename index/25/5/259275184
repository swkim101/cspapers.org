Agents must be able to adapt quickly as an environment changes. We find that existing model-based reinforcement learning agents are unable to do this well, in part because of how they use past experiences to train their world model. Here, we present Curious Replay -- a form of prioritized experience replay tailored to model-based agents through use of a curiosity-based priority signal. Agents using Curious Replay exhibit improved performance in an exploration paradigm inspired by animal behavior and on the Crafter benchmark. DreamerV3 with Curious Replay surpasses state-of-the-art performance on Crafter, achieving a mean score of 19.4 that substantially improves on the previous high score of 14.5 by DreamerV3 with uniform replay, while also maintaining similar performance on the Deepmind Control Suite.
