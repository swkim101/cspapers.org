Robots that are supposed to interact with or manipulate objects in the world must be able to track the poses of objects in their sensor data. Thus, Detecting and tracking the 6-DoF poses of targeted objects is important for aerial manipulation and is still in the early stage due to the high dynamics and limited onboard capacity of such systems. In this paper, we propose ICK-Track, a novel method for onboard category-level object 6-DoF pose tracking that can be applied to aerial manipulation without using any pre-defined object CAD models. It first utilizes a semi-supervised video segmentation to detect objects in the eye-in-hand RGB-D camera stream to segment the 3D points of objects. Then, canonical keypoints are extracted using iterative farthest point sampling. We propose a novel inter-frame consistent keypoints generation network to generate the corresponding keypoint pairs, which are used together with ICP to estimate the pose changes of objects for tracking. Experimental results show that our method is more robust to viewpoint changes and runs faster than the state-of-the-art methods on category-level pose tracking. We further test our proposed method on a real aerial manipulator. A demo video showing the use of our method on a real aerial manipulator and the implementation of our method are available at: https://github.com/S-JingTao/ICK-Track.
