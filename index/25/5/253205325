We present PassengXR, an open-source toolkit for creating passenger eXtended Reality (XR) experiences in Unity. XR allows travellers to move beyond the physical limitations of in-vehicle displays, rendering immersive virtual content based on - or ignoring - vehicle motion. There are considerable technical challenges to using headsets in moving environments: maintaining the forward bearing of IMU-based headsets; conflicts between optical and inertial tracking of inside-out headsets; obtaining vehicle telemetry; and the high cost of design given the necessity of testing in-car. As a consequence, existing vehicular XR research typically relies on controlled, simple routes to compensate. PassengXR is a cost-effective open-source in-car passenger XR solution. We provide a reference set of COTS hardware that enables the broadcasting of vehicle telemetry to multiple headsets. Our software toolkit then provides support to correct vehicle-headset alignment, and then create a variety of passenger XR experiences, including: vehicle-locked content; motion- and location-based content; and co-located multi-passenger applications. PassengXR also supports the recording and playback of vehicle telemetry, assisting offline design without resorting to costly in-car testing. Through an evaluation-by-demonstration, we show how our platform can assist practitioners in producing novel, multi-user passenger XR experiences.
