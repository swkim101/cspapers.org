Prototyping a shape-changing interface is challenging because it requires knowledge of both electronics and mechanical engineering. In this study, we introduced a prototyping platform using a soft pneumatic artificial muscle(PAMs) and modular 3D printed reinforcement. To facilitate a wide variety of applications we propose six types of reinforcement modules capable of either shape deformation and/or variable stiffness. Users can create an approximate prototype using lego-built modules with magnetic connectors. A modeling toolkit can then be used to recreate and customize the prototype structure. After 3D printing, the shape-changing interface can be assembled by threading the PAMs through holes in the reinforcement. We envision that this prototyping platform can be useful in shape-changing interface exploration, where researchers can create working prototypes easily, rapidly, and at a low cost.
