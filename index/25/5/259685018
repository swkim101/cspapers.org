Dialogue rewriting aims to transform multi-turn, context-dependent dialogues into well-formed, context-independent text for most NLP systems. Previous dialogue rewriting benchmarks and systems assume a fluent and informative utterance to rewrite. Unfortunately, dialogue utterances from real-world systems are frequently noisy and with various kinds of errors that can make them almost uninformative. In this paper, we first present Real-world Dialogue Rewriting Corpus (RealDia), a new benchmark to evaluate how well current dialogue rewriting systems can deal with real-world noisy and uninformative dialogue utterances. RealDia contains annotated multi-turn dialogues from real scenes with ASR errors, spelling errors, redundancies and other noises that are ignored by previous dialogue rewriting benchmarks. We show that previous dialogue rewriting approaches are neither effective nor data-efficient to resolve RealDia. Then this paper presents Skeleton-Guided Rewriter (SGR), which can resolve the task of dialogue rewriting via a skeleton-guided generation paradigm. Experiments show that RealDia is a much more challenging benchmark for real-world dialogue rewriting, and SGR can effectively resolve the task and outperform previous approaches by a large margin.
