This hands-on demonstration enables participants to experience single-handed “dexterous gestures”, a novel approach for the physical manipulation of a phone using the fine motor skills of fingers. A recognizer is developed for variations of “full” and “half” gestures that spin (yaw axis), rotate (roll axis), and flip (pitch axis), all detected using the built-in phone IMU sensor. A functional prototype demonstrates how recognized dexterous gestures can be used to interact with a variety of current smartphone applications.
