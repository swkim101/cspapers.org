This work deals with a measure of importance of the components in complex system and of the basic events in fault tree. Our goal is to ensure that the system is reliable, available and safe as possible at the minimum maintenance cost. Measuring the importance of components is used to determine which components needs monitoring and development to improve system reliability and predicting the failure. Our Contribution is to extend the method of component importance factor proposed by Birnbaum several to minimal cut sets defined from the constructed fault tree. Our proposal approach is devoted to an application on an academic example for the calculation of the factors of components related to the structure and reliability of the system.
