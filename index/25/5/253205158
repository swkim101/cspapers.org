We introduce LUNAChair, a remote control and communication system that uses omnidirectional video to connect a remote caregiver to a wheelchair user and a third person around the wheelchair. With the recent growing need for wheelchairs, much of the wheelchair research has focused on wheelchair control, such as fully automatic driving and remote operation. For wheelchair users, conversations with caregivers and third persons around them are also important. Therefore, we propose a system that connects a wheelchair user and a remote caregiver using omnidirectional cameras, which allows the remote caregiver to control the wheelchair while observing both the wheelchair user and his/her surroundings. Moreover, the system facilitates communication by using gaze and hand pointing estimation from an omnidirectional video.
