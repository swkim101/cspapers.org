Programming and computation are powerful tools for manipulating visual forms, but working with these abstractions is challenging for artists who are accustomed to direct manipulation and manual control. The goal of my research is to develop visual art tools that extend programmatic capabilities with manual craft. I do so by exposing computational abstractions as transparent materials that artists may directly manipulate and observe in a process that accommodates their non-linear workflows. Specifically, I conduct empirical research to identify challenges professional artists face when using existing software tools—as well as programming their own—to make art. I apply principles derived from these findings in two projects: an interactive programming environment that links code, numerical information, and program state to artists’ ongoing artworks, and an algorithm that automates the rigging of character clothing to bodies to allow for more flexible and customizable 2D character illustrations. Evaluating these interactions, my research promotes authoring tools that support arbitrary execution by adapting to the existing workflows of artists.
