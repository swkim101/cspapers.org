In this paper, we propose a transformative solution that uses a low-cost light sensor and commodity smartphone to support fast self-assessment of blood perfusion of ulcer regions in daily life. By harnessing the knowledge of light polarization, our system can "see-through" the skin to quantify the spatio-temporal properties of subdermal vasculature in terms of pulsation and hemoglobin. Our evaluation results show that our system can achieve 78.6% accuracy to detect poor and good blood perfusion.
