We present LipLearner, a lipreading-based silent speech interface that enables in-situ command customization on mobile devices. By leveraging contrastive learning to learn efficient representations from existing datasets, it performs instant fine-tuning for unseen users and words using one-shot learning. To further minimize the labor of command registration, we incorporate speech recognition to automatically learn new commands from voice input. Conventional lipreading systems provide limited pre-defined commands due to the time cost and user burden of data collection. In contrast, our technique provides expressive silent speech interaction with minimal data requirements. We conducted a pilot experiment to investigate the real-time performance of LipLearner, and the result demonstrates that an average accuracy of is achievable with only one training sample for each command.
