We propose a 3D printed zoetrope mounted on a bike wheel where users can watch the 3D figures come to life in front of their eyes. Each frame of our animation is a 9 by 16 cm 3D fabricated diorama containing a small scene. A strobed flashlight synced with the spinning of the wheel shows the viewer each frame at just the right time, creating the illusion of 3D motion. The viewer can hold and shine the flashlight into the scene, illuminating each frame from their own point of view. Our zoetrope is modular and can have different 16 frame animations substituted in and out for fast prototyping of many cinematography, fabrication, and strobe lighting techniques. Our interactive truly 3D movie experience will push the zoetrope format to tell more complex stories and better engage viewers.
