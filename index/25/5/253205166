Here, we demonstrate DataLev, a data physicalisation platform with a physical assembly pipeline that allows us to computationally assemble 3D physical charts using acoustically levitated contents. DataLev consists of several enhancement props that allow us to incorporate high-resolution projection, different 3D printed artifacts and multi-modal interaction. DataLev supports reconfigurable and dynamic physicalisations that we animate and illustrate for different chart types. Our work opens up new opportunities for data storytelling using acoustic levitation.
