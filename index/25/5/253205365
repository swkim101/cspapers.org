Traditional physical souvenirs in museums have three major limits: monotonous interaction, lack of personalization, and disconnection to the exhibition. To conquer these problems and to make personalized souvenirs a part of the visiting experience, we create a hybrid tangible Augmented Reality(AR) souvenir that combines a physical firework launcher and AR models. An application called AR Firework is designed for customizing the hybrid souvenir as well as interactive learning in an exhibition in the wild. Multiple interaction methods including mobile user interface, hand gestures, and voice are adopted to create a multi-sensory product. As the first research to propose tangible AR souvenirs, we find that they establish a long-lasting connection between visitors and their personal visiting experiences. This paper promotes the understanding of personalization, socialization and tangible AR.
