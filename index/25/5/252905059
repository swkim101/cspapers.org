Task-oriented chatbots have been drawing a major demand in industry. In this demo, we present FinBot, a Chinese intelligent financial assistant, which is designed to help customers solve various financial investment problems with good expertise. Our FinBot may automatically understand user queries and respond with proper information accordingly in a dialogue session. To solve the difficulties of modeling financial dialogue histories, we adopt a multi-task model jointly capturing the intent and slots, in which the memory from previous dialogue turns and external user behaviors are exploited to further promote the performance of the dialogue response for better interpretability and user experience. The presented FinBot has been deployed in a mobile application that serves hundreds of millions of users.
