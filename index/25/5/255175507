Control of an articulated spine is important for humanoids' dynamic and balanced motion. Although there have been many spinal structures for humanoids, their actuation is still limited due to the usage of geared motors for joints. This paper introduces position control of a distributed electrome-chanical spine in a vertical plane. The spine dynamics model is approximated as an open chain. Gravitational and spring torques are compensated for the control. Moreover, torque-to-current conversion for the actuator is developed. Experimental results show the implemented control of the electromechanical spine for undulatory motions.
