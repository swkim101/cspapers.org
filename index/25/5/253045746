The PacketLab universal measurement endpoint interface design facilitates vantage point sharing among experimenters and measurement endpoint operators [1]. We have continued working on fleshing out the design details of PacketLab components and adding enhancements to facilitate adoption. These include designing the PacketLab certificate system, adding support for measurement creation via a wrapper tool and a C library module, enhancement of reference endpoint ability for measurement flexibility and experiment scheduling, and devising a proxy program to accommodate experimenters without a public IP address. With the code base stabilizing, we are ready to announce our first open release of the PacketLab software package (available at pktlab.github.io). We invite network measurement researchers to try out our tools and welcome any feedback from the research community.
