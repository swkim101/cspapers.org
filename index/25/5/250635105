In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware representation Learning (UARL) method for action segmentation. Most existing action segmentation methods exploit continuity information of the action period to predict frame-level labels, which ignores the temporal ambiguity of the transition region between two actions. Moreover, similar periods of different actions, e.g., the beginning of some actions, will confuse the network if they are annotated with different labels, which causes spatial ambiguity. To address this, we design the UARL to exploit the transitional expression between two action periods by uncertainty learning. Specially, we model every frame of actions with an active distribution that represents the probabilities of different actions, which captures the uncertainty of the action and exploits the tendency during the action. We evaluate our method on three popular action prediction datasets: Breakfast, Georgia Tech Egocentric Activities (GTEA), and 50Salads. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the performance with state-of-the-art.
