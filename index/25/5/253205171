Recent advances in smart materials have enabled displays to move beyond planar surfaces into the fabric of everyday life. We propose reflective light-diffuser modules for non-emissive flexible display systems. Our system leverages reflective-backed polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC), an electroactive material commonly used in smart window applications. This low-power non-emissive material can be cut to any shape, and dynamically diffuses light. We present the design & fabrication of two exemplar artifacts, a canvas and a handbag, that use the reflective light-diffuser modules. We also describe our content authoring pipeline and interaction modalities. We hope this work inspires future designers of flexible displays.
