Chocolate is a great food loved around the world. Methods to decorate chocolate with patterns drawn in structural colors have been developed; however, the methods which requires precision molds with nanoscale processing takes a lot of cost and time. In this paper, I propose a new method to decorate chocolate with structural color using a laser engraving machine and a replica diffraction grating film. The proposed method is composed of two simple steps: 1) molding chocolate on a replica diffraction grating film and 2) melting chocolate with structural color with a laser to draw a design. The proposed method allows creation of chocolates decorated with structural color with only a simple manufacturing process and inexpensive equipment without special precision molds.
