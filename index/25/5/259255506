With the growing prevalence of cloud computing, providing secure access to information stored in the cloud has become a critical problem. Due to the complexity of access control policies, administrators may inadvertently allow unintended access to private information, and this is a common source of data breaches in cloud based services. In this paper, we present a quantitative symbolic analysis approach for automated policy repair in order to fix overly permissive policies. We encode the semantics of the access control policies using SMT formulas and assess their permissiveness using model counting. Given a policy, a permissiveness bound, and a set of requests that should be allowed, we iteratively repair the policy through permissiveness reduction and refinement, so that the permissiveness bound is reached while the given set of requests are still allowed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our automated policy repair technique by applying it to policies written in Amazon's AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy language.
