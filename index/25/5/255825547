The recently proposed Vision transformers (ViTs) have shown
very impressive empirical performance in various computer vision tasks,
and they are viewed as an important type of foundation model. However, ViTs are typically constructed with large-scale sizes, which then
severely hinder their potential deployment in many practical resources constrained applications. 
To mitigate this challenging problem, structured pruning is a promising solution to compress model size and enable
practical efficiency. However, unlike its current popularity for CNNs and
RNNs, structured pruning for ViT models is little explored.
In this paper, we propose GOHSP, a unified framework of Graph and
Optimization-based Structured Pruning for ViT models. We first develop
a graph-based ranking for measuring the importance of attention heads,
and the extracted importance information is further integrated to an
optimization-based procedure to impose the heterogeneous structured
sparsity patterns on the ViT models. Experimental results show that
our proposed GOHSP demonstrates excellent compression performance.
On CIFAR-10 dataset, our approach can bring 40% parameters reduction
with no accuracy loss for ViT-Small model. On ImageNet dataset, with
30% and 35% sparsity ratio for DeiT-Tiny and DeiT-Small models, our
approach achieves 1.65% and 0.76% accuracy increase over the existing
structured pruning methods, respectively.
