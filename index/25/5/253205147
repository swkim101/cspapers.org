We outline how to improve common 3D-editing workflows such as modeling or character animation by utilizing an acoustic levitation kit as an interactive 3D display. Our proposed system allows users to directly interact with models in 3D space and perform multi-point gestures to manipulate them. Editing of complex 3D objects can be enabled by combining the 3D display with an LCD, projector or HMD to display additional context.
