Vibration sensors are commonly used for condition monitoring and early detection of mechanical failures in predictive maintenance applications. They are favored in industry for their wireless deployment, which is both cost-effective and fast. However, reliable condition monitoring and failure prognosis still require additional information about machine operating conditions. The research investigates the possibility of determining operational parameters solely from vibrations without requiring supplementary sensors and apparatus since changes in machine operating conditions define the variability in machine vibrations. The study focuses on the nose gearbox of AH-64 Apache helicopters as a use case, treating the estimation as an inverse problem since vibrations are the output of the system with operating conditions as the input. Three regression methods, namely Ridge, Support Vectors, and Deep Learning regression, are tested and achieve high accuracy in estimating operating conditions, with a slight increase in accuracy for nonlinear models. The study thus demonstrates the feasibility of the idea on the specific use case of helicopter nose gearbox, with the need for further research to extend the analysis to other types of equipment and to assess the impact of machine failures and maintenance on estimation accuracy.
