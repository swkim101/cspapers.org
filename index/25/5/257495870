A long line of work in the past two decades or so established close connections between several different pseudorandom objects and applications, including seeded or seedless non-malleable extractors, two source extractors, (bipartite) Ramsey graphs, privacy amplification protocols with an active adversary, non-malleable codes and many more. These connections essentially show that an asymptotically optimal construction of one central object will lead to asymptotically optimal solutions to all the others. However, despite considerable effort, previous works can get close but still lack one final step to achieve truly asymptotically optimal constructions.In this paper we provide the last missing link, thus simultaneously achieving explicit, asymptotically optimal constructions and solutions for various well studied extractors and applications, that have been the subjects of long lines of research. Our results include:•Asymptotically optimal seeded non-malleable extractors, which in turn give two source extractors for asymptotically optimal min-entropy of $O(\log ~n)$, explicit constructions of K-Ramsey graphs on N vertices with $K=\log ^{O(1)} N$, and truly optimal privacy amplification protocols with an active adversary.•Two source non-malleable extractors and affine non-malleable extractors for some linear min-entropy with exponentially small error, which in turn give the first explicit construction of non-malleable codes against 2-split state tampering and affine tampering with constant rate and exponentially small error.•Explicit extractors for affine sources, sumset sources, inter-leaved sources, and small space sources that achieve asymptotically optimal min-entropy of $O(\log ~n)$ or $2s+O(\log ~n)$ (for space s sources).•An explicit function that requires strongly linear read once branching programs of size $2^{n-O(\log ~n)}$, which is optimal up to the constant in $O(\cdot)$. Previously, even for standard read once branching programs, the best known size lower bound for an explicit function is $2^{n-O\left(\log ^{2} n\right)}$.
