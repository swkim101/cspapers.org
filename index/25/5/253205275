Most widespread haptic feedback devices for augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) fall into one of two categories: simple hand-held controllers with a single vibration actuator, or complex glove systems with several embedded actuators. In this work, we explore haptic feedback on the wrist for interacting with virtual objects. We use Tasbi, a compact bracelet device capable of rendering complex multisensory squeeze and vibrotactile feedback. Leveraging Tasbiâ€™s haptic rendering, and using standard visual and audio rendering of a head mounted display, we present several interactions that tightly integrate sensory substitutive haptics with visual and audio cues. Interactions include push/pull buttons, rotary knobs, textures, rigid body weight and inertia, and several custom bimanual manipulations such as shooting an arrow from a bow. These demonstrations suggest that wrist-based haptic feedback substantially improves virtual hand-based interactions in AR/VR compared to no haptic feedback.
