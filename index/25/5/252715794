Human pose transfer synthesizes new view(s) of a person for a given pose. Recent work achieves this via self-reconstruction, which disentangles a personâ€™s pose and texture information by breaking the person down into parts, then recombines them for reconstruction. However, part-level disentanglement preserves some pose information that can create unwanted artifacts. In this paper, we propose Pose Transfer by Permuting Textures (PT2), an approach for self-driven human pose transfer that disentangles pose from texture at the patch-level. Specifically, we remove pose from an input image by permuting image patches so only texture information remains. Then we reconstruct the input image by sampling from the permuted textures for patch-level disentanglement. To reduce noise and recover clothing shape information from the permuted patches, we employ encoders with multiple kernel sizes in a triple branch network. Extensive experiments on DeepFashion and Market-1501 PT2 reports significant gains on automatic metrics over other self-driven methods, and even outperforms some fully-supervised methods. A user study also reports images generated by our method are preferred in 68% of cases over self-driven approaches from prior work. Code is available at https://github.com/NannanLi999/pt_square
