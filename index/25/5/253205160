The development of music synthesis technology has created a way to enjoy listening to music and actively manipulate it. However, it is difficult for an amateur to combine sounds or change pitches to operate a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Therefore, we focused on ultrasonic levitation and haptic feedback to develop an appropriate interface for DAW. We propose "DAWBalloon", a system that uses ultrasonic levitation arrays to visualize rhythms using floating balloons as a metaphor for musical elements and to combine sounds by manipulating the balloons. DAWBalloon realizes the intuitive manipulation of sounds in three dimensions, even for people without knowledge of music.
