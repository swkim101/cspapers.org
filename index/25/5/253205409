Preference and tolerance towards spicy food may vary depending on culture, location, upbringing, personality and even gender. Due to this, spicy food can often effect the social interaction on the dining table, especially if it is presented as a cultural dish. We propose SpiceWare, a thermally adjustable spoon that alters the perception of spice to improve cross-cultural communication. SpiceWare is a 3D-printed aluminium spoon that houses a thermal peltier that provides thermal feedback up to 45Â°C which can alter the taste perception of the user. As an initial evaluation, we conducted a workshop among participants of varying cultural backgrounds and observe their interaction when dining on spicy food. We found that the overall interaction was perceived to be more harmonious, and we discuss potential future works on improving the system.
