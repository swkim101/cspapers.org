Place recognition is a challenging but crucial task in robotics. Current description-based methods may be limited by representation capabilities, while pairwise similarity-based methods require exhaustive searches, which is time-consuming. In this paper, we present a novel coarse-to-fine approach to address these problems, which combines BEV (Birdâ€™s Eye View) feature extraction, coarse-grained matching and fine-grained verification. In the coarse stage, our approach utilizes an attention-guided network to generate attention-guided descriptors. We then employ a fast affinity-based candidate selection process to identify the Top-K most similar candidates. In the fine stage, we estimate pairwise overlap among the narrowed-down place candidates to determine the final match. Experimental results on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released publicly soon.
