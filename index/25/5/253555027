The DC, small-signal AC and breakdown characteristics of the GaN high electron mobility transistor with a few-layer graphene heat-removal system were simulated. The effect of the distance between the gate and the graphene heat-removal element on the device behavior was analyzed. The simulations reveal that extending the graphene layers towards the gate does not influence the DC characteristics but enhances greatly the AC performance quantities. From the other side, a close proximity between the gate and the graphene layers leads to a higher electric field and, consequently, to a reduced breakdown voltage.
