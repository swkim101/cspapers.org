Performing precise, repetitive motions is essential in many robotic and automation systems. Iterative learning control (ILC) allows determining the necessary control command by using a very rough system model to speed up the process. Functional iterative learning control is a novel technique that promises to solve several limitations of classic ILC. It operates by merging the input space into a large functional space, resulting in an over-determined control task in the iteration domain. In this way, it can deal with systems having more outputs than inputs and accelerate the learning process without resorting to model discretizations. However, the framework lacks so far a validation in experiments. This paper aims to provide such experimental validation in the context of robotics. To this end, we designed and built a one-link flexible arm that is actuated by a stepper motor, which makes the development of an accurate model more challenging and the validation closer to the industrial practice. We provide multiple experimental results across several conditions, proving the feasibility of the method in practice.
