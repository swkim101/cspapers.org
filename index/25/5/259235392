This work presents the first design of a new-space prototype housekeeping system for a suborbital satellite launcher. The electronics' architecture and layout are provided, as well as its casing which will protect the system and isolate it from the outside environment. The entire system is object of mechanical simulation (launch environment simulations), regarding acceleration and random vibration loads and the results are presented. The system is now on preliminary design phase and further optimizations are expected.
