Integration of renewables into the power grid imposes several challenges owing to their intermittence. In this regard, the optimal operational planning becomes a tedious as well as highly uncertain. This projects a negative impact on the market potential and integrative feasibility of renewables energy sources. In this paper, a stochastic robust optimization (SRO) is formulated to develop an intermediate optimization framework between the stochastic and robust optimization. The problem description includes unit commitment, economic dispatch, conventional generation-replacement with solar PV-Battery, and optimal management of battery. The proposed framework is tested and validated on an IEEE 14 bus system. The results obtained proves the suitability and efficacy of the SRO by obtaining a moderate optimal operation of the system between a stochastic and robust optimization framework.
