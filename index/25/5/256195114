Visible Light Backscatter Communication (VLBC) presents an emerging ultra-low-power IoT connectivity solution with high spatial-spectral efficiency and intrinsic human-perceivable privacy advantages. However, research progress on enhanced data rate and sophisticated device coordination of state-of-the-art VLBC systems still cannot meet the low-latency requirement (sub-second level for an IoT network) for massive connections. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of RetroMUMIMO, the first visible light backscatter network that enables physical-layer concurrency to minimize network latency. We propose a pulse feature extraction scheme to enable concurrent transmissions with the unexplored pulse diversity of tags. We design a low-latency demodulation algorithm assisted by such features to demodulate the concurrent symbols efficiently and effectively. Based on the physical-layer concurrency, we further design a MAC layer with contention-based transmission and minimal protocol overhead for low-latency networking. Our evaluation shows that the prototype system achieves up to 8 concurrent VLBC uplinks with real-time demodulation and up to 92.0% latency reduction compared with the state-of-the-art VLBC systems.
