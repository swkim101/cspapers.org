Magnetic properties of AlGaN/GaN/Si HEMTs are sensitive to power electronics solicitations. This paper presents the modeling of magnetic behavior of high electron mobility transistor. The study focuses on hysteresis loop of devices to determine the relationship between magnetic induction and magnetic field.
