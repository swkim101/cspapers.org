This paper considers cascaded H-bridge $l$-level inverters and presents a pulse active width modulation capable to eliminating, if Selective Harmonic Elimination is applied, or to reducing, if Selective Harmonic Mitigation is applied, the harmonic content from the multilevel inverter output voltages. In the second case, it satisfies the European harmonic standards for medium-voltage level applications EN 50160 and CIGRE WG 36â€“05. Some experimental results have been included comparing the performances of the presented two modulation techniques.
