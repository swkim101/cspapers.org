Distributed training of foundation models, especially large language models (LLMs), is communication-intensive and so has heavily relied on centralized data centers with fast interconnects. Can we train on slow networks and unlock the potential of decentralized infrastructure for foundation models? In this paper, we propose C OCKTAIL SGD, a novel communication-efficient training framework that combines three distinct compression techniques—random sparsification, top-K sparsification, and quantization—to achieve much greater compression than each individual technique alone. We justify the benefit of such a hybrid approach through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we show that C OCKTAIL SGD achieves up to 117 × compression in fine-tuning LLMs up to 20 billion parameters without hurting convergence. On a 500Mbps network, C OCKTAIL SGD only incurs ∼ 1 . 2 × slowdown compared with data center networks.
