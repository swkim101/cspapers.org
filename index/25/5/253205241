When exploring the shape of interactive objects, existing prototyping methods can conflict with the iterative process. In this paper, we present FormSense: a simple, fast, and modifiable fabrication method to support the exploration of shape when prototyping interactive objects. FormSense enables touch and pressure sensing through a multi-layer coating approach and a custom touch sensor built from commodity electronic components. We use FormSense to create four interactive prototypes of diverse geometries and materials.
