In most instances, flapping wing robots have emulated the “synchronous” actuation of insects in which the wingbeat timing is generated from a time-dependent, rhythmic signal. The internal dynamics of asynchronous insect flight muscle enable high-frequency, adaptive wingbeats with minimal direct neural control. In this paper, we investigate how the delayed stretch-activation (dSA) response of asynchronous insect flight muscle can be transformed into a feedback control law for flapping wing robots that results in stable limit cycle wingbeats. We first demonstrate - in theory and simulation - the mechanism by which asynchronous wingbeats self-excite. Then, we implement the feedback law on a dynamically-scaled robophysical model as well as on an insect-scale robotic flapping wing. Experiments on large- and small-scale robots demonstrate good agreement with the theory results and highlight how dSA parameters govern wingbeat amplitude and frequency. Lastly, we demonstrate that asynchronous actuation has several advantages over synchronous actuation schemes, including the ability to rapidly adapt or halt wingbeats in response to external loads or collisions through low-level feedback control.
