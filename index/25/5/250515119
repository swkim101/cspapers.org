3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in efficient and safe operation of automatic driving, especially in scenarios of occlusion or poor visibility. Most 3D MOT methods leverage only positional distance, which is insufficient for scenes with high density of objects or drastic changes in the motion state. In order to address this, we propose a new 3D MOT model which fuses information pertaining to positional distance and geometric similarity. Our proposed solution comprises of four parts: a) a feature extraction mechanism integrated into a commonly used detector to extract individual features for each detection, b) computation of two distance matrices based on Euclidean distance and feature similarity, c) conversion of the distance matrices to probability matrices by a cluster based Earth-Mover Distance (EMD) algorithm, and d) a data association method that fuses both sources to boost the tracking accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes tracking dataset, with extensive experiments attesting to an improved tracking accuracy over baselines that operate solely on positional distance.
