We demonstrate ex-CHOCHIN which is a cylindrical shape/texture-changing display inspired by the chochin, a traditional Japanese foldable lantern. Ex-CHOCHIN achieves complex control over origami such as local deformation and control in the intermediate process of folding by attaching multiple mechanisms to the origami tessellation. It thereby results in flexible deformations that can be adapted to a wide range of shapes, a one-continuous surface without gaps, and even changes in texture. It creates several deformed shapes from a crease pattern, allowing flexible deformation to function as a display. We have also produced an application using ex-CHOCHIN. During this hands-on demo at UIST, attendees will manipulate the amount of change in shape and texture and interact with ex-CHOCHIN by seeing and touching.
