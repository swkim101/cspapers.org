A proper parametrization of state transition matrices of linear state-space models (SSMs) followed by standard nonlinearities enables them to efficiently learn representations from sequential data, establishing the state-of-the-art on a large series of long-range sequence modeling benchmarks. In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.
