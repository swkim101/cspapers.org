Machine learning methods for fraud detection have achieved impressive prediction performance, but often sacrifice critical interpretability in many applications. In this work, we propose to learn interpretable models for fraud detection as a simple rule set. More specifically, we design a novel neural rule learning method by building a condition graph with an expectation to capture the high-order feature interactions. Each path in this condition graph can be regarded as a single rule. Inspired by the key idea of meta learning, we combine the neural rules with rules extracted from the tree-based models in order to provide generalizable rule candidates. Finally, we propose a flexible rule set learning framework by designing a greedy optimization method towards maximizing the recall number of fraud samples with a predefined criterion as the cost. We conduct comprehensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets. Interestingly, we find that the neural rules and rules extracted from tree-based models can be complementary to each other to improve the prediction performance.
