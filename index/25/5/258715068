In order to build artificial intelligence systems that can perceive and reason with human behavior in the real world, we must first design models that conduct complex spatio-temporal reasoning over motion sequences. Moving towards this goal, we propose the HumanMotionQA task to evaluate complex, multi-step reasoning abilities of models on long-form human motion sequences. We generate a dataset of question-answer pairs that require detecting motor cues in small portions of motion sequences, reasoning temporally about when events occur, and querying specific motion attributes. In addition, we propose NSPose, a neuro-symbolic method for this task that uses symbolic reasoning and a modular design to ground motion through learning motion concepts, attribute neural operators, and temporal relations. We demonstrate the suitability of NSPose for the HumanMotionQA task, outperforming all baseline methods.
