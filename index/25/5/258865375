Feature matching is an important computer vision task that involves estimating correspondences between two images of a 3D scene, and dense methods estimate all such correspondences. The aim is to learn a robust model, i.e., a model able to match under challenging real-world changes. In this work, we propose such a model, leveraging frozen pretrained features from the foundation model DINOv2. Al-though these features are significantly more robust than local features trained from scratch, they are inherently coarse. We therefore combine them with specialized ConvNet fine features, creating a precisely localizable feature pyramid. To further improve robustness, we propose a tailored transformer match decoder that predicts anchor probabilities, which enables it to express multimodality. Finally, we propose an improved loss formulation through regression-by-classification with subsequent robust regression. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments that show that our method, RoMa, achieves significant gains, setting a new state-of-the-art. In particular, we achieve a 36% improvement on the extremely challenging WxBS benchmark. Code is provided at github.com/Parskatt/RoMa.
