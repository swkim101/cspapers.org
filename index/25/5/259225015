Due to the difficulty of acquiring large-scale 3D human keypoint annotation, previous methods for 3D human pose estimation (HPE) have often relied on 2D image features and sequential 2D annotations. Furthermore, the training of these networks typically assumes the prediction of a human bounding box and the accurate alignment of 3D point clouds with 2D images, making direct application in real-world scenarios challenging. In this paper, we present the 1st framework for end-to-end 3D human pose estimation, named LPFormer, which uses only LiDAR as its input along with its corresponding 3D annotations. LPFormer consists of two stages: firstly, it identifies the human bounding box and extracts multi-level feature representations, and secondly, it utilizes a transformer-based network to predict human keypoints based on these features. Our method demonstrates that 3D HPE can be seamlessly integrated into a strong LiDAR perception network and benefit from the features extracted by the network. Experimental results on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance, and improvements even compared to previous multi-modal solutions.
