The use of cables for aerial manipulation has shown to be a lightweight and versatile way to interact with objects. However, fastening objects using cables is still a challenge and human is required. In this work, we propose a novel way to secure objects using hitches. The hitch can be formed and morphed in midair using a team of aerial robots with cables. The hitch's shape is modeled as a convex polygon, making it versatile and adaptable to a wide variety of objects. We propose an algorithm to form the hitch systematically. The steps can run in parallel, allowing hitches with a large number of robots to be formed in constant time. We develop a set of actions that include different actions to change the shape of the hitch. We demonstrate our methods using a team of aerial robots via simulation and actual experiments.
