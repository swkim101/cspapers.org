The application of the method of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) for producing a highly dispersed powder ceramic composition TiN-SiC using the combustion process of mixtures of powder reagents: sodium azide (NaN3), halide salt (NH4)2TiF6, titanium, silicon and carbon at different ratios of reagents, in an atmosphere of nitrogen gas at a pressure of 4 MPa was considered. Thermodynamic calculations using the THERMO computer program confirmed the possibility of synthesis of TiN-SiC compositions of different compositions in the combustion mode. However, experimental studies of combustion products using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction phase analysis have yielded other results. The use of the azide SHS method did not allow synthesizing the target composition of TiN-SiC powders in its pure form, without the secondary nitride phase of silicon of two modifications (a-Si3N4 and Î²-Si3N4) in the composition. However, for the first time, the possibility of using combustion for the synthesis of compositions of ultrafine ceramic powders TiN-Si3N4 and TiN-Si3N4-SiC with a particle size from 100 to 500 nm was experimentally demonstrated.
