In this demonstration, in collaboration with licensed therapists, we introduce an AI therapist that takes advantage of the smart-home environment to screen day-to-day functioning and infer mental wellness of an occupant. Our system can assess a user's daily functioning and mental wellness based on a combination of direct conversation with users and information obtained from smart home devices using psychological rubrics proposed in [1]. We demonstrate that our system can converse with a user in a natural way (through a smartphone or smart speaker) and analyze a user's response semantically and sentimentally. In addition, we show that our system can provide preliminary interventions to help improve the user's wellness. In particular, when abnormal behavior is detected during the conversation or by smart home devices, the system provides psychotherapeutic consolations during the conversation and will check on the occupant's condition by actuating a home robot.
