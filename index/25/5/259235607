Snowmobiles employ two-stroke engines and continuously variable transmissions (CVT) to transfer power to the snowmobile track. To gain insight into the influence of the CVT on the vehicle's acoustic emission during constant acceleration, a transient vibroacoustic analysis of the CVT is necessary. To address this, an adaptive controller for a two-stroke engine test bench was implemented to simulate constant acceleration conditions for the CVT. Vold-Kalman order tracking (VKF-OT) with a phase locked loop (PLL) was utilized to analyze the non-stationary periodic noise components generated by the CVT. Experimental results using two CVTs, one with a damper and one without, demonstrated the effectiveness of this experimental tool for analyzing the attenuation of certain lower-order intensities during the acceleration phase.
