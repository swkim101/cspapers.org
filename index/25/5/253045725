Since 2003, the ANT Lab at ISI has used active measurements to conduct a census of the IPv4 address space [1]. Each census lasts approximately 2--3 months, scanning the entire IPv4 address space using ICMP ping probes and recording replies. To date, there have been 85 surveys. One of the by-products of these surveys is the address history dataset [5], which contains the ICMP responses from more than 1.4 billion IPv4 addresses over an 18 year period, starting in 2006.
