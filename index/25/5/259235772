This paper describes a computational investigation on the use of a standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to design a model-free optimal feedback control law based only on input-output data. The considered case study involves vibration suppression of a thin-walled rotating cylinder with collocated piezoelectric actuator/sensor patches. To assess the optimization algorithm performance, comparisons were made with a model-based optimal feedback control law for linear quadratic regulation, obtained by solving the associated algebraic Riccati equation. The simulations include examining the effect of different rotational speeds and parameter uncertainty. The results show a good match between the PSO-based feedback control law and the model-based optimal feedback control law. At the same time, an informed choice of parameter ranges for the PSO algorithm should be made.
