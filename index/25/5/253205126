When users use Virtual Reality (VR) in nontraditional postures, such as while reclining or lying in relaxed positions, their views lean upwards and need to be corrected, to make sure they see upright contents and perceive the interactions as if they were standing. Such upright redirection is excepted to cause visual-vestibular-proprioceptive conflict, affecting users’ internal perceptions (e.g., body ownership, presence, simulator sickness) and external perceptions (e.g., egocentric space perception) in VR. Different body reclining angles may affect vestibular sensitivity and lead to the dynamic weighting of multi-sensory signals in the sensory integration. In the paper, we investigated the impact of upright redirection on users’ perceptions, with users’ physical bodies tilted at various angles backward and views upright redirected accordingly. The results showed that upright redirection led to simulator sickness, confused self-awareness, weak upright illusion, and increased space perception deviations to various extents when users are at different reclining positions, and the situations were the worst at the 45° conditions. Based on these results, we designed some illusion-based and sensory-based methods, that were shown effective in reducing the impact of sensory conflict through preliminary evaluations.
