This paper presents a data-driven three-phase fault diagnosis algorithm for inverter open-circuit faults in electric vehicle powertrains and its validation by using real-time simulation. Firstly, the K-nearest neighbors-based unsupervised anomaly point detection algorithm extracts the fault phase in the original current signal. Secondly, five machine learning classifiers, including support vector machine, random forest, decision tree, logistic regression, and XGBoost, are used to classify the four types of open-circuit fault and normal operating states. According to the performance evaluation, these algorithms are suitable: the lowest accuracy rate is 91.67%, and the highest accuracy rate can reach 98.61%. Thirdly, by taking advantage of the symmetry of the three-phase inverter, the classifier trained only with a-phase fault data can be extended to other phases for fault diagnosis. Finally, the algorithm realized by Python is embedded into the Simulink environment. The online validation of fault diagnosis is achieved, and the running time of each algorithm is obtained and compared.
