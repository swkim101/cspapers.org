With emerging technologies bringing Internet of Things (IoT) devices into domestic environments, trigger-action programming such as IFTTT with its simple if-this-then-that pattern provides an effective way for end-users to connect fragmented intelligent services and program their own smart home/work space automation. While the simplicity of trigger-action programming can be effective for non-programmers with its straightforward concepts and graphical user interface, it does not allow the algorithmic expressivity that a programming language has. For instance, the simple if-this-then-that structure cannot cover complex algorithms that arise from real world scenarios involving multiple conditions or keeping track of a sequence of conditions (e.g., incrementing counters, triggering one action if two conditions are both true). In this exploratory work, we take an alternative approach by creating a programmable channel between application programming interfaces (APIs), which allows programmers to preserve states and to use them to write complex algorithms. We propose iThem, which stands for intelligence of themâ€”internet of things, that allow programmers to author any complex algorithms that can connect different IoT services and fully unleash the freedom of a general programming language. In this poster, we share the design, development, and ongoing validation progress of iThem, which piggybacks on existing programmable IoT system IFTTT, and which allows for a programmable channel that connects triggers and actions in IFTTT with versatility.
