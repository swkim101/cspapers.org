Safety-critical systems such as self-driving cars (SDCs) must be rigorously tested. Especially electronic control units (ECUs) of SDCs should be tested with realistic input data. In this context, a communication protocol called Controller Area Network (CAN) is typically used to transfer sensor data to the SDC control units. A challenge for SDC maintainers and testers is the need to manually define the CAN inputs that realistically represent the state of the SDC in the real world. To address this challenge, we developed TEASER; a tool that generates realistic CAN signals for SDCs obtained from sensors from state-of-the-art car simulators. We evaluated TEASER based on its integration capability into a DevOps pipeline of aicas GmbH, a company in the automotive sector. Concretely, we integrated TEASER in a Continous Integration (CI) pipeline configured with Jenkins. The pipeline executes the test cases in simulation environments and sends the sensor data over the CAN bus to a physical CAN device, the test subject. Our evaluation shows the ability of TEASER to generate and execute CI test cases that expose simulation-based faults (using regression strategies); the tool produces CAN inputs that realistically represent the state of the SDC in the real world. This result is critically important for increasing the automation and effectiveness of simulation-based CAN bus regression testing for SDCs.
