Several electric circuit prototyping techniques have been proposed. While most focus on creating the conductive traces, we focus on the bonding technique needed for this kind of circuit. Our technique is an extension of existing work in that we use the traces themselves as the bonding material for the components. The bonding process is not soldering but yields joints of adequate connectivity. A hot soldering iron is used to activate the traces and bond the component to the circuit. Simple circuits are created on MDF, paper, and acrylic board to show the feasibility of the technique. It is also confirmed that the resistance of the contact points is sufficiently low.
