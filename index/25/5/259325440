Crop inspection is a critical part of modern agricultural practices that helps farmers assess the current status of a field and then make crop management decisions. Current crop inspection methods are labour-intensive tasks, which makes them rather slow and expensive to apply. In this paper, we exploit recent advancements in implicit mapping to tackle the challenging context of agricultural environments to create dense maps of crop rows with high enough fidelity to be useful for automated crop inspection. Specifically, we map strawberry and sweet pepper crop rows using RGB images captured by a wheeled mobile field robot inside a greenhouse and then use this data to build 3D maps to document the development of plants and fruits. Our Target-Aware Implicit Mapping system (TAIM) uses a SLAM-based pose initialization strategy for robust pose convergence, an efficient information-guided training sample selection framework for faster loss reduction, and focuses on exploiting training samples for fruit regions of the scene, which are critical for crop inspection tasks, to create more accurate maps in less time.
