This paper discusses the robust identification issue of the reduced second order NARX-Laguerre model. The latter model, result of the expansion of the second order NARX model parameters on independent Laguerre bases, is characterized by five parameters called Laguerre poles. The optimal values of these poles are identified using Genetic Algorithm. Special attention is given to the UBBE (Unknown But Bounded Error) approach. This technique involves updating the domain to which belong the Fourrier Coefficients in order to achieve a membership set which is a set of parameter vectors consistent with the structure of the model and the bounds of the errors. The proposed technique is illustrated by a simulation example.
