This paper proposes a decentralized path-following guidance algorithm for the tracking formation of multiple fixed-wing UAVs. In particular, our proposal adopts the decoupled control technique to separate the lateral and longitudinal channels. Using the well-known vector-field law, the former is in charge of making UAV track a defined path with wind disturbances. The latter guarantees that a group of fixed-wing UAVs reaches the desired formation by modifying the commanded airspeed of UAVs. The decentralized communication network handles the shared information between a ground control station (GCS) and UAVs. Finally, numerical simulation results for a five-UAV group verify the feasibility and benefits of our proposed approach.
