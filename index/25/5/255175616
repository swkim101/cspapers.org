This paper presents a unified approach to the design of Model Predictive Controllers (MPC), custom-tailored for path following by Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). The approach can be applied in a unified manner to several relevant AGV kinematic configurations, including tricycle, differential, and double steer-drive. By leveraging Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) MPC, it provides maximum maneuverability and industrial-grade positioning accuracy. We incorporate state-of-the-art optimized velocity planning, to maximize vehicle utilization. Experimental validation is performed on three different kinematic configurations, including a real forklift with tricycle configuration, using industrially-relevant positioning maneuvers.
