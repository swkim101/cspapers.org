Top-Levi is a public multi-user interactive system that requires a pair of users to cooperate with an audience around them. Based on acoustic levitation technology, Top-Levi leverages a unique attribute of dynamic physical 3D contents displayed and animated in the air: such systems inherently provide different visual information to users depending on where they are around the device. In Top-Levi, there are two primary users on opposite (left/right) sides of the device, and audience members to the front. Each sees different instructions displayed on a floating cube. Their collective task is to cooperate to move the cube from a start point to a final destination by synchronizing their responses to the instructions.
