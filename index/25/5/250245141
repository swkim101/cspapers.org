It is an open problem to compile DNN models on GPU and improve the performance. A novel framework, GTuner, is proposed to jointly learn from the structures of computational graphs and the statistical features of codes to find the optimal code implementations. A Graph ATtention network (GAT) is designed as the performance estimator in GTuner. In GAT, graph neural layers are used to propagate the information in the graph and a multi-head self-attention module is designed to learn the complicated relationships between the features. Under the guidance of GAT, the GPU codes are generated through auto-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous arts remarkably.
