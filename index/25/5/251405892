objective preference at inference time. We name this learning setup Pareto front learning (PFL). We implement our idea using hypernetwork and evaluated on a large and diverse set of tasks and datasets. Our experiments show signiﬁcant gains in both runtime and performance on all datasets. This novel approach provides the user with the ﬂexibility of selecting the operating point at inference time, and open new possibilities where user preferences can be tuned and changed at deployment.
