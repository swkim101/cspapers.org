A high-performance tracking controller which exploits adaptive control and extended state observer technique via the command filtered backstepping design procedure will be proposed for a family of nonlinear systems with input saturation, uncertain parameters and external disturbances. Specially, the adaptive laws are synthesized to address parametric uncertainties and the extended state observers are incorporated to reject lumped disturbances. With the command filtered backstepping procedure, the controller design process and control law will be greatly simplified.
