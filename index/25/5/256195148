Blockchain technology is becoming a promising technological solution for enterprise applications with the rise of interoperable solutions. A cross-chain architecture facilitates interoperability, thus improves its chain efficiency, reduces fragmentation, and allows users and features to flow more freely across multiple blockchains. However, enabling interoperability in silo networks will make a significant functional trade-off on the security and performance of the system. This paper review trade-offs in blockchain technologies related to interoperability.
