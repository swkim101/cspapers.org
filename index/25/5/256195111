Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have emerged as an increasingly important technology with wide application in fields such as industrial automation, transportation, smart cities, and similar areas. LoRa based LPWAN provides long range, robust, economical, and reliable communication with high link budget compared to other LPWAN technologies. However, LoRa based networks are usually deployed using a star topology (LoRaWAN). This type of network topology is not suitable for long range wireless communication and is also subject to single point of failure at the LoRaWAN gateway. In this study we evaluate the potential of LoRa as links in linear networks. We have addressed the potential applications, design considerations and current challenges in adaptation of LoRa technology for linear networks. This survey presents a detailed analysis of LoRa technology as a linear network and provides recommendations to researchers and practitioners to explore LoRa technology as a linear network technology for various IoT applications.
