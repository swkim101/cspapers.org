This demo presents a triangular actuating device stand that can automatically adjust the height and tilt angle of a mounted mobile device (e.g., smartphone) to adapt to the user’s varying interaction needs (e.g., touch, browsing, and viewing). We employ a unique mechanism to deform the stand’s triangular shape with two extendable reel actuators, which enables us to reposition the mobile screen mounted on the hypotenuse side. Each actuator is managed by the mobile device and controls the height and base of the stand’s triangular shape, respectively. To demonstrate the potential of our new actuating device stand, we present two types of interaction scenarios: manual device repositioning based on the user’s postures or gestures captured by the device’s front camera and automatic device repositioning that adapt to the on-screen contents the user will interact with (i.e., touch-based menus, web browsers, illustrator, and video viewers).
