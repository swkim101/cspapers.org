Hybrid Renewable Energy Sources (HRES) are widely employed to create power because of the constant rise in electricity usage and environmental concerns. Their benefits include cleanliness, accessibility, affordability, and availability. To combat the variability and randomness of a single RES, such as solar and wind power, hybrid RESs have been developed with a battery for the storage of extra throughout the day and the support of load demand during erratic and nighttime hours and/or the use of a more traditional source such as a diesel generator (DG) in the effect of climate change or during the event of a blackout. This paper reviews recent literature and the most effective methods and approaches for sizing and optimizing hybrid PV/WT/DG/batteries systems for a rural zone. The most popular topologies for the implementation of this system are compared in this paper. The characteristics of the classic, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and hybrid methodologies were evaluated along with software tools.
