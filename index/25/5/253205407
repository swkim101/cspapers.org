Debugging printed circuit boards (PCBs) can be a time-consuming process, requiring frequent context switching between PCB design files (schematic and layout) and the physical PCB. To assist electrical engineers in debugging PCBs, we present ARDW, an augmented reality workbench consisting of a monitor interface featuring PCB design files, a projector-augmented workspace for PCBs, tracked test probes for selection and measurement, and a connected test instrument. The system supports common debugging workflows for augmented visualization on the physical PCB as well as augmented interaction with the tracked probes. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the system with 10 electrical engineers from industry and academia, finding that ARDW speeds up board navigation and provides engineers with greater confidence in debugging. We discuss practical design considerations and paths for improvement to future systems. A video demo of the system may be accessed here: https://youtu.be/RbENbf5WIfc .
