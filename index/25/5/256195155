We demonstrate how to leverage Apple's Find My protocol, most well known as the underlying protocol of the AirTag, for arbitrary data-muling. This provides a new "infrastructure-free" deployment option, where areas with frequent human activity can take advantage of this zero-cost backhaul network. While there are severe limitations (e.g. no acknowledgement channel back to the sending device), Find My-based networking could still be a highly reliable backhaul with sufficient transmission redundancy and knowledge of deployment context. In this demo, we allow users to send arbitrary data to devices that will forward the data to the Find My network. The data is then recovered from Apple's servers and displayed on a status page. Critically, we will not deploy any of our own intermediate infrastructure and will instead rely on a sufficient density of iPhones and other Apple devices from the demo audience to backhaul data from our demo.
