With the spread of virtual reality (VR) attractions, vector generation techniques that enhance the sense of realism are gaining attention. Additionally, mixed reality (MR) attractions, which overlay VR onto a real-world display, are expected to become more prevalent in the future. However, with MR, it is impossible to move all the coordinates of the visual stimuli to generate proper vection effects. Therefore, we have created an optical illusion method that provides a three-dimensional impression of a two-dimensional visual stimulation. The technique amplifies the sensation of vertical movement by placing the illusion on the floor.
