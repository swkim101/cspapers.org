Two classes of intermittency have emerged in the batteryless intermittent research community: hard intermittency and soft inter-mittency. While conceptually similar, these two intermittencies represent very different approaches to the intermittency problem. In this position paper, we examine these two intermittencies in detail. We discuss the tradeoffs and evaluate the performance potential of the two intermittencies in the context of communication between intermittent nodes. Finally, we conclude that both types of intermittency have merits under different conditions and application requirements, and we argue for greater understanding of how these two disparate classes of intermittencies may interact and coexist within a single network.
