For image local forgery detection, the existing methods require a large amount of labeled data for training, and most of them cannot detect multiple types of forgery simultaneously. In this paper, we firstly analyzed the JPEG compression traces which are mainly caused by different JPEG compression chains, and designed a trace extractor to learn such traces. Then, we utilized the trace extractor as the backbone and trained self-supervised to strengthen the discrimination ability of learned traces. With its benefits, regions with different JPEG compression chains can easily be distinguished within a forged image. Furthermore, our method does not rely on a large amount of training data, and even does not require any forged images for training. Experiments show that the proposed method can detect image local forgery on different datasets without re-training, and keep stable performance over various types of image local forgery.
