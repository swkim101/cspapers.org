Data-driven machine learning approaches have become increasingly used in human-computer interaction (HCI) tasks. However, compared with traditional machine learning tasks, for which large datasets are available and maintained, each HCI project needs to collect new datasets because HCI systems usually propose new sensing or use cases. Such datasets tend to be lacking in amount and lead to low performance or place a burden on participants in user studies. In this paper, taking hand gesture recognition using wrist-worn devices as a typical HCI task, I propose a self-supervised approach that achieves high performance with little burden on the user. The experimental results showed that hand gesture recognition was achieved with a very small number of labeled training samples (five samples with 95% accuracy for 5 gestures and 10 samples with 95% accuracy for 10 gestures). The results support the story that when the user wants to design 5 new gestures, he/she can activate the feature in less than 2 minutes. I discuss the potential of this self-supervised framework for the HCI community.
