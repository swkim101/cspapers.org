This article discusses the development of a semi-empirical model of the acoustic characteristics of porous polyurethane foam PPU-40-08, which can be used in rocket and space equipment. An experimental test bench for determining the resistance to blowing with an air flow is described. The experimental values of the specific resistance to blowing with air flow and the values of the sound absorption coefficient of the specified material have been obtained. A comparison of the experimental data and the sound absorption coefficient, calculated using the developed model, was carried out.
