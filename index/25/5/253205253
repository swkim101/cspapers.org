Data visualizations are an increasingly common way to communicate information online. However, not everyone has the data literacy skills necessary to interpret complex visualizations effectively. We present Expert Goggles, a Chrome browser extension that provides just-in-time guidance to help non-experts interpret the visualizations they encounter on the web. Expert Goggles uses a machine learning classifier to automatically determine the visualization type and uses this context to deliver relevant learning materials. We discuss how this approach to automatically detect the context and provide just-in-time support might transform everyday experiences into informal learning opportunities.
