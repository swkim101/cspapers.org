Hypergraph-based collaborative filtering for recommendations has emerged as an important research topic due to its ability to model complex relations among users and items. However, most existing methods typically construct the hypergraph structures using heuristics (e.g., motifs and jump connections) based on existing graphs (e.g., user-item bipartite graphs and social networks). From a learning perspective, we argue that the fixed heuristic topology of hypergraph may become a limitation and thus potentially compromise the recommendation performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel dynamic hypergraph learning framework for collaborative filtering (DHLCF), which learns hypergraph structures and makes recommendations collectively in a unified framework. In the hypergraph learning process, we solve two main challenges, i.e., 1) optimization issue and 2) regularization issue. Firstly, we propose a differentiable hypergraph learner to adaptively learn the optimized hypergraph structures dynamically for the hypergraph convolutions during the training process. Secondly, to better regularize dynamic hypergraph learning, we introduce a novel hypergraph learning objective, which forces the learned hypergraphs to retain the original graph topology. Extensive experiments on public datasets from different domains are provided to show that our proposed model significantly outperforms strong baselines.
