In this paper, we analyze the convergence of gradient flow on a multi-layer linear model with a loss function of the form f ( W 1 W 2 · · · W L ) . We show that when f satisfies the gradient dominance property, proper weight initialization leads to exponential convergence of the gradient flow to a global minimum of the loss. Moreover, the convergence rate depends on two trajectory-specific quantities that are controlled by the weight initialization: the imbalance matrices , which measure the difference between the weights of adjacent layers, and the least singular value of the weight product W = W 1 W 2 · · · W L . Our analysis exploits the fact that the gradient of the overparam-eterized loss can be written as the composition of the non-overparametrized gradient with a time-varying (weight-dependent) linear operator whose smallest eigenvalue controls the convergence rate. The key challenge we address is to derive a uniform lower bound for this time-varying eigenvalue that lead to improved rates for several multi-layer network models studied in the literature.
