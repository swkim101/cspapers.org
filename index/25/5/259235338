Electro-Hydraulic ServoMechanism (EHSM) is a nonlinear system with tentative dynamics, whose control is a difficult task. In this research, an alternative to the existing technique, a fractional order PID control-based approach, is presented. Initially, a SIMULINK based nonlinear model is constructed. The linear model is obtained by approximating the non-linearity using the bilinear transformation. Pole placement is blended with the Ziegler-Nichols tuning method to carry out the controller design and controller parameter tuning. The results are compared with conventional PID, and stability analysis is also analyzed. The results of the fractional order controller show satisfactory improvement than the results of conventional PID.
