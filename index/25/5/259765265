The soaring number of personal mobile devices and public cameras poses a threat to fundamental human rights and ethical principles. For example, the stolen of private information such as face image by malicious third parties will lead to catastrophic consequences. By manipulating appearance of face in the image, most of existing protection algorithms are effective but irreversible. Here, we propose a practical and systematic solution to invertiblely protect face information in the full-process pipeline from camera to final users. Specifically, We design a novel lightweight Flow-based Face Encryption Method (FFEM) on the local embedded system privately connected to the camera, minimizing the risk of eavesdropping during data transmission. FFEM uses a flow-based face encoder to encode each face to a Gaussian distribution and encrypts the encoded face feature by random rotating the Gaussian distribution with the rotation matrix is as the password. While encrypted latent-variable face images are sent to users through public but less reliable channels, password will be protected through more secure channels through technologies such as asymmetric encryption, blockchain, or other sophisticated security schemes. User could select to decode an image with fake faces from the encrypted image on the public channel. Only trusted users are able to recover the original face using the encrypted matrix transmitted in secure channel. More interestingly, by tuning Gaussian ball in latent space, we could control the fairness of the replaced face on attributes such as gender and race. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our solution could protect privacy and enhance fairness with minimal effect on high-level downstream task.
