We study the problem of episodic reinforcement learning in continuous state-action spaces with unknown rewards and transitions. Specifically, we consider the setting where the rewards and transitions are modeled using parametric bilinear exponential families. We propose an algorithm, that a) uses penalized maximum likelihood estimators to learn the unknown parameters, b) injects a calibrated Gaussian noise in the parameter of rewards to ensure exploration, and c) leverages linearity of the bilinear exponential family transitions with respect to an underlying RKHS to perform tractable planning. We provide a frequentist regret upper-bound for our algorithm which, in the case of tabular MDPs, is order-optimal with respect to H and K, where H is the episode length and K is the number of episodes. Our analysis improves the existing bounds for the bilinear exponential family of MDPs by square root of H and removes the handcrafted clipping deployed in existing RLSVI-type algorithms.
