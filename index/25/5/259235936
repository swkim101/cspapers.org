This study proposes a methodology for a time-domain analysis of vibration signals of a rotating machine with present defects, under varying load conditions. MaFaulda vibration dataset is used, which consists of measured vibration signals under six operating conditions and various levels of severity for each fault. First, optimal sampling frequency is determined, and appropriate filtering of raw data is performed. Next, Time Synchronous Averaging (TSA) of the signals with present faulty bearing is conducted. Obtained TSA signals are used for estimation of the level of importance of ten statistical functions. The level of importance of the statistical parameters is evaluated using two proposed methods. The first method tests the ability of the parameters to distinguish a faulty from a healthy condition. The second method tests the ability of the parameters to differentiate ten different bearing conditions. Results from both methods show that Peak Value, Root Mean Square (RMS) and Standard Deviation are the most influential statistical parameters for the analyzed study case. Consequently, their significance is tested at various load conditions. In other words, this paper concentrates on the proper performance of initial phases of creating classification algorithms for fault identification, which results in increasing the overall algorithm accuracy.
