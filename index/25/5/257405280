Vision-based object tracking has boosted extensive autonomous applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the dynamic changes in flight maneuver and viewpoint encountered in UAV tracking pose significant difficulties, e.g., aspect ratio change, and scale variation. The conventional cross-correlation operation, while commonly used, has limitations in effectively capturing perceptual similarity and incorporates extraneous background information. To mitigate these limitations, this work presents a novel saliency-guided dynamic vision Transformer (SGDViT) for UAV tracking. The proposed method designs a new task-specific object saliency mining network to refine the cross-correlation operation and effectively discriminate foreground and background information. Additionally, a saliency adaptation embedding operation dynamically generates tokens based on initial saliency, thereby reducing the computational complexity of the Transformer architecture. Finally, a lightweight saliency filtering Transformer further refines saliency information and increases the focus on appearance information. The efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach have been thoroughly assessed through experiments on three widely-used UAV tracking benchmarks and real-world scenarios, with results demonstrating its superiority.
