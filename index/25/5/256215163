The aim of the research is to simulate the effect of hydrodynamic cavitation in a jet-cavitation fluid mass flow stabilizer. The paper discusses jet fluid mass flow stabilizers that use cavitation to obtain a positive effect. The presence of cavitation in these devices provides a constant value of the liquid flow rate in a certain range with a variable value of the pressure at the outlet of the stabilizer. A numerical model of cavitation and KT model of cavitation mass transfer are presented. The KT model takes into account the viscosity of the liquid. The processes taking place in the flow path of the fluid mass flow stabilizers have been studied. The results of numerical modeling and experimental research of the fluid mass flow stabilizers are presented.
