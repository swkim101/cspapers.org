The main purpose of this work is to conduct experimental studies of the combustion of a pre-prepared mixture of aviation kerosene and its surrogate with air. The study of the combustion of a homogeneous mixture was carried out in a swirling flow. In this study, the determined characteristics of the flame blowout, visual parameters of the torch in open space, as well as the concentration of combustion products were compared Russian TS-1 surrogate and its surrogate SU4. The main combustion products (N2, O2, CO2, H2O) was used to evaluate the completeness of combustion or the degree of completion of chemical reactions. It was found that the average discrepancy between the TS-1 aviation kerosene and the studied surrogate SU4 in terms of flame blowout characteristics is about 5%, in terms of fuel unburned hydrocarbons is 10 %, in terms of the concentration of carbon monoxide CO -12%.
