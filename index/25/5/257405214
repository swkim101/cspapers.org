Open-world Instance Segmentation (OIS) is a challenging task that aims to accurately segment every object instance appearing in the current observation, regardless of whether these instances have been labeled in the training set. This is important for safety-critical applications such as robust autonomous navigation. In this paper, we present a flexible and effective OIS framework for LiDAR point cloud that can accurately segment both known and unknown instances (i.e., seen and unseen instance categories during training). It first identifies points belonging to known classes and removes the back-ground by leveraging close-set panoptic segmentation networks. Then, we propose a novel ellipsoidal clustering method that is more adapted to the characteristic of LiDAR scans and allows precise segmentation of unknown instances. Furthermore, a diffuse searching method is proposed to handle the common over-segmentation problem presented in the known instances. With the combination of these techniques, we are able to achieve accurate segmentation for both known and unknown instances. We evaluated our method on the SemanticKITTI open-world LiDAR instance segmentation dataset. The experimental results suggest that it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, especially with a 10.0% improvement in association quality. The source code of our method will be publicly available at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/ElC-OIS.
