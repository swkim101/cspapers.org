The rapid growth in the number of entry-level smartphones and mobile broadband subscriptions in developing countries has served as a motivation for several projects focused on improving mobile users' quality of experience (QoE). One such initiative is the development of Android Go, a customized operating system designed to run over entry-level smartphones. Today, more than 80% entry-level Android smartphones run Android Go. Despite its growing popularity, its effectiveness in improving the Web QoE remains unclear. This paper presents the first independent empirical analysis of Android Go's causal impact on mobile Web performance. We use a combination of controlled experiments and a set of methodological approaches from the econometrics literature to find unbiased estimates of the average causal effect. Our analysis provides insights that have implications for different stakeholders in the ecosystem of entry-level devices.
