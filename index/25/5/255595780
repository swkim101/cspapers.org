Temporal information extraction (TIE) has attracted a great deal of interest over the last two decades. Such endeavors have led to the development of a significant number of datasets. Despite its benefits, having access to a large volume of corpora makes it difficult to benchmark TIE systems. On the one hand, different datasets have different annotation schemes, which hinders the comparison between competitors across different corpora. On the other hand, the fact that each corpus is disseminated in a different format requires a considerable engineering effort for a researcher/practitioner to develop parsers for all of them. These constraints force researchers to select a limited amount of datasets to evaluate their systems which consequently limits the comparability of the systems. Yet another obstacle to the comparability of TIE systems is the evaluation metric employed. While most research works adopt traditional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1, a few others prefer temporal awareness -- a metric tailored to be more comprehensive on the evaluation of temporal systems. Although the reason for the absence of temporal awareness in the evaluation of most systems is not clear, one of the factors that certainly weighs on this decision is the need to implement the temporal closure algorithm, which is neither straightforward to implement nor easily available. All in all, these problems have limited the fair comparison between approaches and consequently, the development of TIE systems. To mitigate these problems, we have developed tieval, a Python library that provides a concise interface for importing different corpora and is equipped with domain-specific operations that facilitate system evaluation. In this paper, we present the first public release of tieval and highlight its most relevant features. The library is available as open source, under MIT License, at PyPI and GitHub.
