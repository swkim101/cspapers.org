Sequential recommendation is the task of predicting the next interacted item of a target user, given his/her past interaction sequence. Conventionally, sequential recommenders are evaluated offline with the last item in each sequence as the sole correct (relevant) label for the testing example of the corresponding user. However, little is known about how this sparsity of preference data affects the robustness of the offline evaluation's outcomes. To help researchers address this, we collect additional preference data via crowdsourcing. Specifically, we propose an assessment interface tailored to the sequential recommendation task and ask crowd workers to assess the (potential) relevance of each candidate item in MovieLens 1M, a commonly used dataset. Toward establishing a more robust evaluation methodology, we release the collected preference data, which we call ML-1M++, as well as the code of the assessment interface.
