Predictive control is an advanced control method that is used successfully in industrial control applications. One of the most fundamental demands for predictive control is the accurate forecasting of a ''controlled sequence" using exogenous sequences which consist of multiple attributes (manipulated variables and operation signals). Given a controlled sequence and exogenous sequences, how can we effectively forecast the future behavior of a controlled sequence? In this paper, we present C-Cast, an efficient and effective method for forecasting a time-evolving controlled sequence with exogenous sequences. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Adaptive: it captures important time-evolving patterns and operation shift in a time-evolving controlled sequence (b) Effective: it performs accurate forecasting. (c) Practical: it enables real-time controlled sequence forecasting fast enough to satisfy the limitation required for predictive control. Extensive experiments on a real dataset demonstrate that C-Cast consistently outperforms the best existing state-of-the-art methods as regards accuracy, and the execution speed is sufficiently fast.
