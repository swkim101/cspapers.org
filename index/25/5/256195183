In many countries, there are local efforts and incentives to further increase the adoption of greener buildings. This highlights the critical need for buildings to be green and for tools to facilitate their transformation for new and existing building owners. Thus, this work curates a dataset regarding the actions and features implemented by building stakeholders to attain the Green Mark (GM) certification which promotes the adoption of numerous green building technologies. Public data from 3,583 entries over 17 years was extracted and pre-processed. Green features of each certified entry were identified and labeled accordingly using a list of keywords created from the GM certification assessment criteria. We present an overview of the dataset and key insights into the building retrofitting landscape. The dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/record/7198276
