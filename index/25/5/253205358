Currently, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic makes physical contact, such as handshakes, difficult. However, physical contact is effective in strengthening the bonds between people. In this study, we aim to compensate for the physical contact lost during the COVID-19 pandemic by presenting a pseudo-heartbeat through a speaker to reproduce entrainment and the synchronized state of heartbeats induced by physiological synchronization. We evaluated the effects of the device in terms of speech rhythm and heart rate. The experimental results showed that a presentation of 80 BPM significantly reduced the difference in heart rate between the two participants, bringing them closer to a synchronized heart rate state. The heart rates of participants were significantly lower when 45 BPM and 80 BPM were presented than when no stimulus was given. Furthermore, when 45 BPM was presented, the silent periods between conversations were significantly more extended than when no stimulus was given. This result indicates that this device can intentionally create the entrainment phenomenon and a synchronized heart rate state, thereby producing the same effect of physical contact communication without contact.
