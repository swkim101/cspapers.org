In oral communication, it is important to speak at a speed appropriate for the situation. However, we need a lot of training in order to control our speech rate as intended. This paper proposes a speech rate control system which enables the user to speak at a pace closer to the target rate using Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF). We implement a prototype and confirm that the proposed system can slow down the speech rate when the user speaks too fast without giving any instructions to the speaker on how to respond to the audio feedback.
