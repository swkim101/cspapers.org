The DNS maps human-readable identifiers to computer-friendly identifiers and relies on a reverse tree architecture to achieve this mapping. Backed by economic incentives, the DNS has become increasingly complex with data being shared among multiple autonomous stakeholders. The diversity of autonomous stakeholders limits data collection, access and sharing to researchers. For instance, each of stakeholder controls limited parts of the DNS space, thereby limiting analysis of real-world DNS behaviour. We aim to design and develop a software framework to unify diverse and large-scale public DNS data sources. The platform will facilitate the access to public DNS data by providing an efficient way of processing and analyzing large amounts of distributed data regardless of the DNS data format. Thus, the framework will help enable reproducibility in DNS studies.
