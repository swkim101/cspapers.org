We introduce the concept of “Magic Drops”, the process which is all using ultrasound levitation to mix multiple liquid drops into a single one in the air and move it specified position and let it free fall below. For molecular gastronomy application, mixture drops with sodium alginate solution are free-fall into a container filled with calcium lactate solution. With this, drops encased in a calcium alginate film are formed in the container, these are edible and the color and flavor of mixture are also controlled through the process. We will also demonstrate stack these drops to create larger edible structure. Our novel mixture drop control technology has other potential applications such as painting techniques and drug development. Thus, we believe that this concept will become a new technology for mixing liquids in the future.
