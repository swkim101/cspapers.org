Although CNNs are believed to be invariant to translations, recent works have shown this is not the case due to aliasing effects that stem from down-sampling layers. The existing architectural solutions to prevent the aliasing effects are partial since they do not solve those effects that originate in non-linearities. We propose an extended antialiasing method that tackles both down-sampling and nonlinear layers, thus creating truly alias-free, shift-invariant CNNs11Our code is available at github.com/hmichaeli/alias_free_convnets/.. We show that the presented model is invariant to integer as well as fractional (i.e., sub-pixel) translations, thus outperforming other shift-invariant methods in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.
