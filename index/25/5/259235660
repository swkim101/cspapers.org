Numerical realization of optimal consensus control is important for multi-agent systems. In this study we formulate a nonlinear multi-agent system based on Cucker-Smale model and develop consensus control to resolve the dynamic problem of flocking. The validation of the framework is performed with random initial position and velocities considering two cases, that is, 5 and 13 birds. Based on the results obtained and presented for 40 iterations it is observed that the agent's position and velocities have successfully converged.
