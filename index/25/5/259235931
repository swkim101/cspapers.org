With the advancement on automated vehicle technology, the highly automated driving is expected to work in complicated traffic situations such as urban intersections and traffic incidents. However, the traffic incidents still remain a comprehensively challenging situation especially in the mixed traffic. To resolve this problem, a sophisticated control strategy is required to support the automated driving in these unexpected traffic situations. From this background, this study mainly focuses on developing a generalized control strategy to manage the automated vehicles driving in traffic incident situations. First, the representative scenarios are analyzed, and a generalized control strategy is elaborated based on the framework of cooperative driving automation. The proposed control strategy can be extended to more complicated situations, and it is expected to extend the operational design domain of automated vehicles.
