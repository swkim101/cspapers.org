Bayesian hierarchical models are probabilistic models that have hierarchical structures and use Bayesian methods for inferences. In this paper, we extend Fittsâ€™ law to be a Bayesian hierarchical pointing model and compare it with the typical pooled pointing models (i.e., treating all observations as the same pool), and the individual pointing models (i.e., building an individual model for each user separately). The Bayesian hierarchical pointing models outperform pooled and individual pointing models in predicting the distribution and the mean of pointing movement time, especially when the training data are sparse. Our investigation also shows that both noninformative and weakly informative priors are adequate for modeling pointing actions, although the weakly informative prior performs slightly better than the noninformative prior when the training data size is small. Overall, we conclude that the expected advantages of Bayesian hierarchical models hold for the pointing tasks. Bayesian hierarchical modeling should be adopted a more principled and effective approach of building pointing models than the current common practices in HCI which use pooled or individual models.
