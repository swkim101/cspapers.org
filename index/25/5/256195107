Obtaining fine-grained structural information about building through ubiquitous sensors is crucial for assessing their aging and damage. However, due to the energy requirements, traditional sensors deployed in the building structure need frequent maintenance works which are easy to produce irreversible damage to the building. Besides, the larger volume of sensors also brings the difficulty of deployment in buildings with complex structures. To solve these problems, we propose a novel sensing system to obtain fine-grained structural information based on ubiquitous deployed meta-material sensors. Specifically, meta-material sensors are small pieces of PCB printed with metal structure, which work without a power supply and suit wide deployment. The experiment realizes the humidity sensing with a spatial resolution of 0.5m, while existing methods for dispersing sensors achieve space intervals of 10m at the same cost. With this framework, the need of providing information support for assessing structural failure can be met.
