This paper presents the design of a functional observer for delayed linear systems with an unknown input in the frequency domain. The unknown input is considered in the dynamic and output equations. The delay is present in the state and input vectors. The main interest is that the proposed observer estimates a functional state and an unknown input vector. The design of the frequency domain procedure is based on a polynomial approach using Matrix Fraction Descriptions (MFDs). A numerical example is given to show the efficiency of the proposed approach.
