Despite the potential of quantum computing for drastically accelerating suitable real-time applications, response time analysis is still required to guarantee that quantum programs running on quantum computers satisfy application-specific timing requirements. This paper describes an inaugural project to determine whether a quantum program running on a quantum computer satisfies the timing constraints of a realtime application, that is, is quantum computing punctual and reliable in this time-sensitive application domain? Can this timing guarantee be formally verified? We leverage the existing work on the functional reactive programming (FRP) model to predict the worst-case response time (WCRT) of fault-tolerant classical computing systems since the timing analysis of re-executions for fault recovery plus transient-faults-induced wasted execution times is similar to determining the response time of FRP tasks. Ongoing work shows that accounting for wasted execution times due to errors in quantum computers resulting from quantum decoherence and state fidelity can be treated similarly and develops a mapping from quantum programs to FRP programs for efficient timing analysis.
