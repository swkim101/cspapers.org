Sequential recommender systems aim to recommend the next items in which target users are most interested based on their historical interaction sequences. In practice, historical sequences typically contain some inherent noise (e.g., accidental interactions), which is harmful to learn accurate sequence representations and thus misleads the next-item recommendation. However, the absence of supervised signals (i.e., labels indicating noisy items) makes the problem of sequence denoising rather challenging. To this end, we propose a novel sequence denoising paradigm for sequential recommendation by learning hierarchical item inconsistency signals. More specifically, we design a hierarchical sequence denoising (HSD) model, which first learns two levels of inconsistency signals in input sequences, and then generates noiseless subsequences (i.e., dropping inherent noisy items) for subsequent sequential recommenders. It is noteworthy that HSD is flexible to accommodate supervised item signals, if any, and can be seamlessly integrated with most existing sequential recommendation models to boost their performance. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HSD over state-of-the-art denoising methods and its applicability over a wide variety of mainstream sequential recommendation models.
