The article compares the accuracy parameters of two neural network architectures that can be used in industrial machine vision systems. The first architecture is a deep neural network without convolutional layers. The second is a convolutional network of the VGG family. Both networks have a ReLu activation function, the output uses a SoftMax layer. The VGG architecture has shown the best applicability to the problem of classifying parts by their images.
