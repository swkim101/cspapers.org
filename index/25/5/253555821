This paper proposes a network quality-based navigation routing algorithm to facilitate users to enjoy seamless access to mobile services in 5G and beyond networks. The proposed algorithm is capable of finding K multiple optimum paths satisfying multiple Quality of Service (QoS) metrics required for a particular mobile application. Relevant QoS parameter values obtained from the data network are projected to road network links. A modified A * based algorithm is developed to find the navigation route that has the minimum travel distance which satisfies the QoS constraints required by the user. Simulation results show that the proposed solution is capable of successfully routing a user while satisfying the QoS requirements. A mobile application-based implementation also validates the proposed algorithm as a viable solution for QoS-based navigation routing.
