Weiser has predicted the third generation of computing would result in individuals interacting with many computing devices and ultimately can “weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it” [17]. However, how to achieve this seamlessness and what associated interaction should be developed are still under investigation. On the other hand, the material composition, structures and operating logic of a variety of physical objects existing in everyday life determine how we interact with them [13]. The intelligence of the built environment does not only rely on the encoded computational abilities within the “brain” (like the controllers of home appliances), but also the physical intelligence encoded in their “body” (e.g., materials, mechanical structures). In my research, I work on creating computational materials with different encoded material properties (e.g., conductivity, transparency, water-solubility, self-assembly, etc.) that can be seamlessly integrated into our living environment to enrich different modalities of information communication.
