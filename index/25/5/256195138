Circuit breakers are a fundamental safety device in all residential and industrial electrical distribution installations. The harsh environmental conditions of industrial circuit breakers can lead to unwanted resistance, i.e., due to the build-up of dirt, between the circuit breaker terminals and the conducting metal bars that supply power from the grid. This can lead to excessive heat through the circuit breaker mechanics, which over time, may degrade the lifetime of the circuit breaker. In order to mitigate this, a monitoring system is needed to remotely monitor the temperature of the circuit breaker contact terminals, thus improving scheduled maintenance and minimizing downtime. We present the system design of a battery-less wireless temperature sensor for industrial circuit breakers. We follow well established embedded system design principles, and advocate a refinement to existing design methodologies specific to low-power energy harvesting wireless embedded systems. In this work, we detail each step in the proposed design methodology and present an evaluation of the system prototype in an industrial environment.
