Haptic displays that can convey various material sensations and physical properties on conventional 2D displays or in virtual reality (VR) environments, have been widely explored in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). We introduce a fabrication technique of haptic apparatus using 3D printed hairs, which can stimulate the users’ sensory perception with hair-like bristles mimicking furry animals. Design parameters that determine 3D printed hair’s properties such as length, density, and direction, can affect the stiffness and roughness of the contact area between the hair tip and the user’s sensory receptors on their skin, thus changing stimulation patterns. To further explore the expressivity of this apparatus, we present a haptic display built with controlling mechanisms. The device is constructed by threading many 3D printed hairs through a perforated plate, manipulating the length and direction of hairs via the connected inner actuator. We present the design specifications including printing parameters, assembly, and electronics through a demonstration of prototypes, and future works.
