The IoT ecosystem is an intricate and complex network of stakeholders that includes platforms, developers, ad networks and cloud providers. However, the ability of smart home platforms and devices to interact and exchange data, together with the data-driven business models adopted by most IoT stakeholders open the ground for unknown and unexpected privacy risks. Existing black-box testing approaches to audit IoT platforms cannot identify data dissemination through side- and covert-channels, and for this reason they are not well suited for rich execution environments where a wide range of devices and applications can co-operate using multiple network protocols and interfaces. This poster proposes ImposTer, a cost-effective and extensible privacy framework for exhaustively testing the IoT ecosystem. Our framework is able to capture, model and emulate horizontal interactions that occur across the different devices in a consumer household.
