In near future, we envision instant and ubiquitous access to the VR worlds. However, existing highly portable VR devices usually lack rich and convenient input modality. In response, we introduce TouchVR, a system that enables BoD interaction in instant VR supported by mobile HMDs. We present the overall architecture and prototype of the TouchVR system in Android platform, capable of being easily integrated to Unity-based mobile VR applications. Furthermore, we implement a sample application (360Â° video player) to demonstrate the usage of our system. Through TouchVR, we expect it to be a step for enriching interaction methods in instant VR.
