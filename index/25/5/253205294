Humans are increasingly able to work side-by-side with desktop-scale digital fabrication machines. However, much of the software for controlling these machines does not support live, interactive exploration of their capabilities. We present Dynamic Toolchains, an extensible development framework for building parametric machine control interfaces from reusable modules. Toolchains are built and run in a live environment, removing the repetitive import and export bottleneck between software programs. This enables humans to easily explore how they can use machine precision to manipulate physical materials and achieve unique aesthetic outcomes. In this demonstration, we build a toolchain for computer-controlled watercolor painting and show how it facilitates rapid iteration on brush stroke patterns.
