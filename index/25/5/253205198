Despite the importance of utilizing forces when interacting with objects, sensing force interactions without active force sensors is challenging. We introduce Fringer, a finger sleeve that physically visualizes the force to allow a camera to estimate the force without using any active sensors. The sleeve has stripe-pattern slits, a sliding paper with stripe pattern, and a compliant layer that converts force into sliding paper movements. The patterns of the slit and the paper have different frequencies to create Moir√© fringes, which can magnify the small displacement caused by the compliant layer compression for webcams to easily capture such displacement.
