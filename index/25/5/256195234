Intelligent systems commonly employ vision sensors like cameras to analyze a scene. Recent work has proposed a wireless sensing technique, wireless vibrometry, to enrich the scene analysis generated by vision sensors. Wireless vibrometry employs wireless signals to sense subtle vibrations from the objects and infer their internal states. However, it is difficult for pure Radio-Frequency (RF) sensing systems to obtain objects' visual appearances (e.g., object types and locations), especially when an object is inactive. Thus, most existing wireless vibrometry systems assume that the number and the types of objects in the scene are known. The key to getting rid of these presumptions is to build a connection between wireless sensor time series and vision sensor images. We present Capricorn, a vision-guided wireless vibrometry system. In Capricorn, the object type information from vision sensors guides the wireless vibrometry system to select the most appropriate signal processing pipeline. The object tracking capability in computer vision also helps wireless systems efficiently detect and separate vibrations from multiple objects in real time.
