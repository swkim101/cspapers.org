Explanation for the deep learning model is necessary for high-stake decision-making, particularly in the context of fault detection and isolation (FDI). This is especially crucial in situations where incorrect FDI decisions can have serious consequences. This paper presents FDI-X (explainable FDI), an occlusion/masking-based approach to explain the decision made by the deep-learning model, increasing the trustworthiness of the model and making it suitable for use in industrial applications. It presents a hybrid fault diagnosis method that combines bond-graph-based residuals with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying system faults in PV-cell. The proposed explanation method is demonstrated using a PV-cell simulation and various types of faults, showing that the CNN gives greater importance to the residuals that are most sensitive to the fault being diagnosed. The occlusion-based explanation method proves to be a valuable tool for improving the interpretability and reliability of deep learning models in FDI tasks.
