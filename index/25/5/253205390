In recent years, more and more time has been spent watching videos for online seminars, lectures, and entertainment. In order to improve time efficiency, people often adjust the playback speed to a speed that suits them best. However, it is troublesome to adjust the optimal speed for each video and even more challenging to change and adjust the speed for each speaker within a single video. Therefore, we propose ”AIx speed,” a system that maximizes the playback speed within the range where the speech recognition model can recognize and flexibly adjusts the playback speed for the entire video. This system makes it possible to set a flexible playback speed that balances playback time and content comprehension, compared to fixing the playback speed for the entire video.
