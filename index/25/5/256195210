Visible Light Communication (VLC) is widely considered a promising technology for the coming 6G networks. Recent studies show that a VLC transmitter not only emits visible light signals but also leaks RF signals during the transmission. In this work, we devote effort to harvesting the free leaked RF energy from VLC transmissions. We observe that the surrounding objects could help a coil antenna harvest significantly more RF energy. Based on this observation, we propose our system Bracelet+, which involves the human body in the harvesting system to increase the harvested power. After careful analysis of the influence of the human body on the harvested power, we prototype the coil antenna as a bracelet that achieves both high harvested power and convenience for wearing. The average power of the RF energy harvested by our design is 10Ã— larger than that of the conventional coil antenna, without causing any interference to the communication of VLC systems. The harvested power can reach up to micro-watts in our tested scenarios. Such a micro-watt level of harvested energy has the potential to power up ultra-low-power sensors such as temperature sensors and glucose sensors.
