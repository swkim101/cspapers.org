Wireless sensing is an emerging technology that can obtain rich context information of human targets in a contact-free manner. Though promising, a missing component of current wireless sensing is sensing under device motions. In this work, we propose to integrate wireless sensing with the mobility of a robot. This is non-trivial because we find that device motions can severely degrade the sensing performance and even completely fail existing wireless sensing systems. In this paper, we propose novel signal processing schemes to address the impact of device motions to enable sensing with device mobility. For the first time, we integrate the robot's mobility with LoRa sensing to enlarge the sensing coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. We employ two representative sensing applications, i.e., fine-grained respiration monitoring and coarse-grained human walking sensing, to showcase the performance of our system. The proposed system is able to achieve accurate sensing in the presence of device motions, moving wireless sensing one step forward towards truly ubiquitous sensing for real-life adoption.
