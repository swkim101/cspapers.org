Viewpoint planning is an important task in any application where objects or scenes need to be viewed from different angles to achieve sufficient coverage. The mapping of confined spaces such as shelves is an especially challenging task since objects occlude each other and the scene can only be observed from the front, posing limitations on the possible viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that generates promising views aiming at reducing the map entropy. Additionally, the pipeline extends standard viewpoint planning by predicting adequate minimally invasive push actions to uncover occluded objects and increase the visible space. Using a 2.5D occupancy height map as state representation that can be efficiently updated, our system decides whether to plan a new viewpoint or perform a push. To learn feasible pushes, we use a neural network to sample push candidates on the map based on training data provided by human experts. As simulated and real-world experimental results with a robotic arm show, our system is able to significantly increase the mapped space compared to different baselines, while the executed push actions highly benefit the viewpoint planner with only minor changes to the object configuration.
