Augmented Reality (AR) can enable new forms of self-expression and communication. However, little is known about how AR experiences should be designed to complement face-to-face communication. We present an initial set of insights derived from the iterative design of a mobile AR app called Wemoji. It enables people to emote or react to one another by spawning visual AR effects in a shared physical space. As an additional communication medium, it can help add volume and dimension to what is exchanged. We outline a design space for AR complementary communication systems, and offer a set of insights from initial testing that points towards how AR can be used to enhance same-time same-place social interactions.
