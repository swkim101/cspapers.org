As a convenient, economical and low carbon transport mode, ride hitching has gained tremendously prevalent in the globe. This paper presents PRID that offers an efficient ride hitching service with sufficient results analysis. In general, PRID is implemented by a publish/subscribe service, which provides a user-friendly web browser client that allows users (e.g., company managers and data analysts) to perform the performance analysis for ride hitching through simple interactive operations. Moreover, the server side of the PRID system consists of three modules including a top-k initialization module, an order dispatch module, and a top-k maintenance module, which can process the matching between drivers and riders efficiently. PRID system aims at continuously maintaining the update-to-date k best matched ride orders for each driver with less time cost, and monitoring their matching efficiency and effectiveness meanwhile. Finally, we demonstrate the PRID system on a real-world dataset, showing its good performance. The source code of the demonstration has been shared on https://github.com/wuqingshun/PRID.
