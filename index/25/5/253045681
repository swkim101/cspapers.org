Scrutinizing BGP routes is part of the everyday tasks that network operators and researchers conduct to monitor their networks and measure Internet routing. This task is facilitated by the expansion of routing information services such as RIPE RIS [2] and Route-Views [3] that collect BGP routes from an increasing number of Vantage Points (VPs). Unfortunately, while more data is often beneficial, in the case of BGP, it involves downloading and processing large volumes of route updates that exhibit a high level of redundancy. Today with more than one billion route updates collected every day, users often have no other option than to focus on a subset of the VP. Because of the highly skewed location of the VP, randomly selecting them may result in a lot of missing information.
