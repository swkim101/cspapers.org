In this paper, we perform the first large-scale study of how people spend time on the web. Our study is based on anonymous, aggregate telemetry data from several hundred million Google Chrome users who have explicitly enabled sharing URLs with Google and who have usage statistic reporting enabled. We analyze the distribution of web traffic, the types of websites that people visit and spend the most time on, the differences between desktop and mobile browsing behavior, the geographical differences in web usage, and the most popular websites in regions worldwide. Our study sheds light on online user behavior and how the research community can more accurately analyze the web in the future.
