Neural fields are receiving increased attention as a geometric representation due to their ability to compactly store detailed and smooth shapes and easily undergo topological changes. Compared to classic geometry representations, however, neural representations do not allow the user to exert intuitive control over the shape. Motivated by this, we leverage boundary sensitivity to express how perturbations in parameters move the shape boundary. This allows to interpret the effect of each learnable parameter and study achievable deformations. With this, we perform geometric editing: finding a parameter update that best approximates a globally prescribed deformation. Prescribing the deformation only locally allows the rest of the shape to change according to some prior, such as semantics or deformation rigidity. Our method is agnostic to the model its training and updates the NN in-place. Furthermore, we show how boundary sensitivity helps to optimize and constrain objectives (such as surface area and volume), which are difficult to compute without first converting to another representation, such as a mesh.
