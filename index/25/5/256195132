Sensing and data collection platforms are the crucial components of high-quality datasets that can fuel advancements in research. However, such platforms usually are ad-hoc designs and are limited in sensor modalities. In this paper, we discuss our experience designing and deploying a multi-modal multi-node sensor data collection platform that can be utilized for various data collection tasks. The main goal of this platform is to create a modality-rich data collection platform suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) applications with easy reproducibility and deployment, which can accelerate data collection and downstream research tasks.
