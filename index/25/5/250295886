This paper presents SimCTC, a simple contrastive learning (CL) framework that greatly advances the state-of-the-art text clustering models. In SimCTC, a pre-trained BERT model first maps the input sequence to the representation space, which is then followed by three different loss function heads: Clustering head, Instance-CL head and Cluster-CL head. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SimCTC remarkably outperforms 6 competitive text clustering methods with 1%-6% improvement on Accuracy (ACC) and 1%-4% improvement on Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). Moreover, our results also show that the clustering performance can be further improved by setting an appropriate number of clusters in the cluster-level objective.
