Reliable statistical analyses are critical for making scientific discoveries, guiding policy, and informing decisions. To author reliable statistical analyses, integrating knowledge about the domain, data, statistics, and programming is necessary. However, this is an unrealistic expectation for many analysts who may possess domain expertise but lack statistical or programming expertise, including many researchers, policy makers, and other data scientists. How can our statistical software help these analysts? To address this need, we first probed into the cognitive and operational processes involved in authoring statistical analyses and developed the theory of hypothesis formalization. Authoring statistical analyses is a dual-search process that requires grappling with assumptions about conceptual relationships and iterating on statistical model implementations. This led to our key insight: statistical software needs to help analysts translate what they know about their domain and data into statistical modeling programs. To do so, statistical software must provide programming interfaces and interaction models that allow statistical non-experts to express their analysis goals accurately and reflect on their domain knowledge and data. Thus far, we have developed two such systems that embody this insight: Tea and Tisane. Ongoing work on rTisane explores new semantics for more accurately eliciting analysis intent and conceptual knowledge. Additionally, we are planning a summative evaluation of rTisane to assess our hypothesis that this new way of authoring statistical analyses makes domain experts more aware of their implicit assumptions, able to author and understand nuanced statistical models that answer their research questions, and avoid previous analysis mistakes.
