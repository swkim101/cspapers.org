Recent work has shown the promise of creating generalist, transformer-based, models for language, vision, and sequential decision-making problems. To create such models, we generally require centralized training objectives, data, and compute. It is of interest if we can more flexibly create generalist policies by merging together multiple, task-specific, individually trained policies. In this work, we take a preliminary step in this direction through merging, or averaging, subsets of Decision Transformers in parameter space trained on different MuJoCo locomotion problems, forming multi-task models without centralized training. We also demonstrate the importance of various methodological choices when merging policies, such as utilizing common pre-trained initializations, increasing model capacity, and utilizing Fisher information for weighting parameter importance. In general, we believe research in this direction could help democratize and distribute the process that forms multi-task robotics policies.
