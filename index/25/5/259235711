This article investigates the stabilization problem of delayed memristive neural networks (DMNNs) driven by mixed deception attacks. It is noted that information is extremely vulnerable to deception attacks when it is transmitted in open network channels, this paper considers the situation of mixed deception attacks on network channels, which will have an effect on both state signals and control signals, and lead to a decline in the control accuracy, as well as affect the performance of actuator. In addition, it will cause system instability. This study proposes a control method that can successfully defend against deception attacks and guarantee system stability. By constructing Lyapunov functional and implementing proposed controllers, the stabilization criteria are derived for MNNs. Finally, the viability of our scheme is demonstrated with a numerical example.
