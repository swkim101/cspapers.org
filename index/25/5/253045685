In the last years, Real-Time media transport using QUIC has aroused general interest. Ongoing research is studying protocol mechanisms to transport media with QUIC to build a new streaming protocol or to map existing ones like RTP onto QUIC. Our work focuses on the transport of RTP packets generated by WebRTC over QUIC and investigates the combination of the QUIC and WebRTC congestion control algorithms. To do so, we devised a testbed to study various combinations of congestion control algorithms, for different QUIC implementations, when sending RTP packets from an un-modified WebRTC client (Chrome).
