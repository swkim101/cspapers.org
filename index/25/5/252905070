Disinformation is one of the main threats that loom on social networks. Detecting disinformation is not trivial and requires training and maintaining fact-checking teams, which is labor-intensive. Recent studies show that the propagation structure of claims and user messages allows a better understanding of rumor dynamics. Despite these findings, the availability of verified claims and structural propagation data is low. This paper presents a new dataset with Twitter claims verified by fact-checkers along with the propagation structure of retweets and replies. The dataset contains verified claims checked during the Chilean social outbreak, which allows for studying the phenomenon of disinformation during this crisis. We study propagation patterns of verified content in CLNews, showing differences between false rumors and other types of content. Our results show that false rumors are more persistent than the rest of verified contents, reaching more people than truthful news and presenting low barriers of readability to users. The dataset is fully available and helps understand the phenomenon of disinformation during social crises being one of the first of its kind to be released.
