This study evaluated the performance of various channel estimation techniques for the physical uplink control channel, which plays a crucial role in the state-of-the-art telecommunication 5G NR technology. We considered the conventional least-square (LS), DFT-based LS, moving-average LS, and minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) algorithms with various receive antennas numbers (2Rx, 16Rx, and 32Rx) in relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. A simulation model was developed for block error rate (BLER) evaluation of two test cases with Reed-Muller and Polar codes. Simulation results show that the MMSE algorithm provides the best performance for all considered receive antennas numbers. However, the moving-average LS algorithm should be a suitable choice since it provides a good trade-off between performance and complexity. Finally, it is shown that the energy efficiency of the system can be significantly increased by 12â€“14 dB when using 32Rx instead of 2Rx. The results in this paper can provide specific system-oriented information for designing and implementing 5G NR systems.
