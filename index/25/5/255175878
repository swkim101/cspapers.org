Traditional gimbal-based bionic eye systems usually use a multi-degree-of-freedom mechanical platform to move the camera freely, which makes the structure complex and bulky. The galvanometer-based reflective bionic eye system uses a galvanometer to replace the traditional mechanical rotation structure, which separates the camera from the gimbal system, greatly simplifying the structure. However, there are currently few methods for calibrating such systems, mostly for object detection and tracking. In this paper, a flexible method for high-precision calibration of a galvanometer-based reflective bionic eye system is proposed. In this method, a planar target is used for the calibration of the bionic eye system. The effectiveness and accuracy of the method are evaluated by the reprojection error of the control voltage and the spatial localization of the binocular system. Experiments show that the error of the control voltage after calibration is less than 0.2%. At an indoor distance of about 7 m, the RMSE of spatial visual localization is less than 0.3 cm.
