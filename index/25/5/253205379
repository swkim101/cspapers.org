We propose Garnish into Thin Air, dynamic and three-dimensional food presentation with acoustic levitation. In contrast to traditional plating on the dishes, we make the whole garnishing process an interactive experience to stimulate users’ appetite by leveraging acoustic levitation’s capacity to decorate edibles dynamically in mid-air. To achieve Garnish into Thin Air, our system is built to orchestrate a range of edible materials, such as flavored droplets, edible beads, and rice paper cutouts. We demonstrate Garnish into Thin Air with two examples, including a glass of cocktail named “The Floral Party” and a plate of dessert called “The Winter Twig”.
