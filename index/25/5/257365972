Domain generalization in semantic segmentation aims to alleviate the performance degradation on unseen domains through learning domain-invariant features. Existing methods diversify images in the source domain by adding complex or even abnormal textures to reduce the sensitivity to domain-specific features. However, these approaches depends heavily on the richness of the texture bank and training them can be time-consuming. In contrast to importing textures arbitrarily or augmenting styles randomly, we focus on the single source domain itself to achieve the generalization. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive texture filtering mechanism to suppress the influence of texture without using augmentation, thus eliminating the interference of domain-specific features. Further, we design a hierarchical guidance generalization network equipped with structure-guided enhancement modules, which purpose to learn the domain-invariant generalized knowledge. Extensive experiments together with ablation studies on widely-used datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, and reveal its superiority over other state-of-the-art alternatives.
