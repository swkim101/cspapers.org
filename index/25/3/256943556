Given a set of points $P$ and a set of regions $\mathcal{O}$, an incidence is a pair $(p,o ) \in P \times \mathcal{O}$ such that $p \in o$. We obtain a number of new results on a classical question in combinatorial geometry: What is the number of incidences (under certain restrictive conditions)? We prove a bound of $O\bigl( k n(\log n/\log\log n)^{d-1} \bigr)$ on the number of incidences between $n$ points and $n$ axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, if no $k$ boxes contain $k$ common points, that is, if the incidence graph between the points and the boxes does not contain $K_{k,k}$ as a subgraph. This new bound improves over previous work, by Basit, Chernikov, Starchenko, Tao, and Tran (2021), by more than a factor of $\log^d n$ for $d>2$. Furthermore, it matches a lower bound implied by the work of Chazelle (1990), for $k=2$, thus settling the question for points and boxes. We also study several other variants of the problem. For halfspaces, using shallow cuttings, we get a linear bound in two and three dimensions. We also present linear (or near linear) bounds for shapes with low union complexity, such as pseudodisks and fat triangles.
