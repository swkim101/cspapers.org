As a direct depth sensor, radar holds promise as a tool to improve monocular 3D object detection, which suffers from depth errors, due in part to the depth-scale ambiguity. On the other hand, leveraging radar depths is hampered by difficulties in precisely associating radar returns with 3D estimates from monocular methods, effectively erasing its benefits. This paper proposes a fusion network that addresses this radar-camera association challenge. We train our network to predict the 3D offsets between radar returns and object centers, enabling radar depths to enhance the accuracy of 3D monocular detection. By using parallel radar and camera backbones, our network fuses information at both the feature level and detection level, while at the same time leveraging a state-of-the-art monocular detection technique without retraining it. Experimental results show significant improvement in mean average precision and translation error on the nuScenes dataset over monocular counterparts.
