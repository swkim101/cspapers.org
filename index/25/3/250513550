This paper introduces an intelligent system which composes music following the users' instructions. Current auto-matic music generation models are lack of stability. Meanwhile, they cannot satisfy the preference of different people. To overcome these challenges, we train a Transformer-based neural network to generate short music segments using a dataset. A user can compose music pieces by interacting with a well-trained generator. Our system collects the user's feedback during the interactions, and fine-tunes the neural network to optimize the generator. After a large number of interactions, our system can learn the musical taste of the user and customize a personal automatic music composer for him or her. Our work enhances the application value of generative models significantly, which enables people to compose music with the assistance of artificial intelligence.
