 Advances in additive manufacturing enable rational design and fabrication of multiscale architectures composed of microstructures with extreme mechanical properties. The parameterization of microstructures determines the computational cost for rational design and connectivity between different microstructures, in turn, the mechanical performance of the fabricated multiscale architectures. In this paper, we propose a periodic composite function (PCF)-based approach for designing microstructures. The shape of the microstructures is characterized by the sign of the periodic composite functions. The proposed method can program Poisson’s ratio of the microstructures with a small number of parameters. Furthermore, due to its implicit representation, the proposed method allows for continuously tiling of microstructures with different mechanical properties. As such, by designing the distribution of the scalar parameters, we are able to project spatially varying microstructures onto an object of arbitrary geometry and control its deformation. Based on the proposed approach, multiple groups of microstructures with Poisson’s ratio ranging from negative to positive are presented. Numerical examples are also presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in controlling elastic deformation through spatially varying microstructures. Due to its compact representation, the proposed method can be readily reproduced by other researchers and extended to practical applications in designing two-scale architectures for additive manufacturing.
