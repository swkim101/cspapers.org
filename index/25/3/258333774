Continual text classification is an important research direction in Web mining. Existing works are limited to supervised approaches relying on abundant labeled data, but in the open and dynamic environment of Internet, involving constant semantic change of known topics and the appearance of unknown topics, text annotations are hard to access in time for each period. That calls for the technique of weakly supervised text classification (WSTC), which requires just seed words for each category and has succeed in static text classification tasks. However, there are still no studies of applying WSTC methods in a continual learning paradigm to actually accommodate the open and evolving Internet. In this paper, we tackle this problem for the first time and propose a framework, named Continual Learning for Weakly Supervised Text Classification (CL-WSTC), which can take any WSTC method as base model. It consists of two modules, classification decision with delay and seed word updating. In the former, the probability threshold for each category in each period is adaptively learned to determine the acceptance/rejection of texts. In the latter, with candidate words output by the base model, seed words are added and deleted via reinforcement learning with immediate rewards, according to an empirically certified unsupervised measure. Extensive experiments show that our approach has strong universality and can achieve a better trade-off between classification accuracy and decision timeliness compared to non-continual counterparts, with intuitively interpretable updating of seed words.
