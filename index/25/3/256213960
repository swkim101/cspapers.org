The laser tracker was included in the automated technological system to improve the robot manipulator positioning accuracy at the incremental forming the process. Based on the measurement mathematical mode, 1 the Monte-Carlo method is used to evaluate the measurement uncertainty of robot tool center coordinates estimation. Through simulation, the optimal measuring system configuration with minimal measurement uncertainty is obtained.
