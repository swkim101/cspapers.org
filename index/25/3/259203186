A variety of autonomous navigation algorithms exist that allow robots to move around in a safe and fast manner. Many of these algorithms require parameter re-tuning when facing new environments. In this paper, we propose PTDRL, a parameter-tuning strategy that adaptively selects from a fixed set of parameters those that maximize the expected reward for a given navigation system. Our learning strategy can be used for different environments, different platforms, and different user preferences. Specifically, we attend to the problem of social navigation in indoor spaces, using a classical motion planning algorithm as our navigation system and training its parameters to optimize its behavior. Experimental results show that PTDRL can outperform other online parameter-tuning strategies.
