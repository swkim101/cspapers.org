In the information-overloaded era of the Web, recommender systems that provide personalized content filtering are now the mainstream portal for users to access Web information. Recommender systems deploy machine learning models to learn users’ preferences from collected historical data, leading to more centralized recommendation results due to the feedback loop. As a result, it will harm the ranking of content outside the narrowed scope and limit the options seen by users. In this work, we first conduct data analysis from a graph view to observe that the users’ feedback is restricted to limited items, verifying the phenomenon of centralized recommendation. We further develop a general simulation framework to derive the procedure of the recommender system, including data collection, model learning, and item exposure, which forms a loop. To address the filter bubble issue under the feedback loop, we then propose a general and easy-to-use reinforcement learning-based method, which can adaptively select few but effective connections between nodes from different communities as the exposure list. We conduct extensive experiments in the simulation framework based on large-scale real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed reinforcement learning-based control method can serve as an effective solution to alleviate the filter bubble and the separated communities induced by it. We believe the proposed framework of controllable recommendation in this work can inspire not only the researchers of recommender systems, but also a broader community concerned with artificial intelligence algorithms’ impact on humanity, especially for those vulnerable populations on the Web.
