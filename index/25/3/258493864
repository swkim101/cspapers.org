This paper aims to study the tensile behavior of a woven [0/90]7 hemp/Elium composite after three different conditionings: “Ambient storage”, “Saturated at 60 °C” and “15 wet/dry cycles”. Instrumented repeated progressive tensile loading tests were carried out and showed an unexpected increase in the secant modulus for the aged samples at the end of the test. An in-situ micro-CT tensile test was then performed on a “15 wet/dry cycles” aged sample. The analysis of the tomographic images showed the damage development with interfacial debonding and matrix cracks in the specimen volume, and also the decrease in the curvature radius of the warp yarns during tensile loading facilitated by the plasticization of the resin. Finite element calculations were thus performed and demonstrated that the increase in the modulus is directly linked to the straightening of warp yarns, showing that the evolution of the modulus on a macroscopic scale can be explained by the deformations of the yarns on a microscopic level. These results allow us to better understand the mechanical behavior and the damage mechanisms that occur in biocomposites during tensile testing after water aging.
