Recent work has shown that current text classification models are vulnerable to small adversarial perturbation to inputs, and adversarial training that re-trains the models with the support of adversarial examples is the most popular way to alleviate the impact of the perturbation. However, current adversarial training methods have two principal problems: worse model generalization and ineffective defending against other text attacks. In this paper, we propose a Keyword-bias-aware Adversarial Text Generation model (KATG) that implicitly generates adversarial sentences using a generator-discriminator structure. Instead of using a benign sentence to generate an adversarial sentence, the KATG model utilizes extra multiple benign sentences (namely prior sentences) to guide adversarial sentence generation. Furthermore, to cover more perturbation used in existing attacks, a keyword-bias-aware sampling is proposed to select sentences containing biased words as prior sentences. Besides, to effectively utilize prior sentences, a generative flow mechanism is proposed to construct latent semantic space and learn a latent representation for the prior sentences. Experiments demonstrate that adversarial sentences generated by our KATG model can strengthen the victim model's robustness and generalization.
