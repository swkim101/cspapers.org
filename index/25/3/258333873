Products contribute to carbon emissions in each phase of their life cycle, from manufacturing to disposal. Estimating the embodied carbon in products is a key step towards understanding their impact, and undertaking mitigation actions. Precise carbon attribution is challenging at scale, requiring both domain expertise and granular supply chain data. As a first-order approximation, standard reports use Economic Input-Output based Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) which estimates carbon emissions per dollar at an industry sector level using transactions between different parts of the economy. EIO-LCA models map products to an industry sector, and uses the corresponding carbon per dollar estimates to calculate the embodied carbon footprint of a product. An LCA expert needs to map each product to one of upwards of 1000 potential industry sectors. To reduce the annotation burden, the standard practice is to group products by categories, and map categories to their corresponding industry sector. We present CaML, an algorithm to automate EIO-LCA using semantic text similarity matching by leveraging the text descriptions of the product and the industry sector. CaML uses a pre-trained sentence transformer model to rank the top-5 matches, and asks a human to check if any of them are a good match. We annotated 40K products with non-experts. Our results reveal that pre-defined product categories are heterogeneous with respect to EIO-LCA industry sectors, and lead to a large mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 51% in kgCO2e/$. CaML outperforms the previous manually intensive method, yielding a MAPE of 22% with no domain labels (zero-shot). We compared annotations of a small sample of 210 products with LCA experts, and find that CaML accuracy is comparable to that of annotations by non-experts.
