This work demonstrates the effects of the active use of renewable energy sources (RES) in the unified energy system (UES) of Ukraine, in particular, maintaining the balance in the network for its reliable and high-quality operation. In the energy strategy for the development of renewable energy sources in Ukraine until 2035, a rapid increase of the installed RES capacity is planned, i.e. the task of maintaining balance sheet reliability in the conditions of an increase in the share of RES in the UES of Ukraine is quite urgent. Forecasting of the electricity balance is based on the generation forecast, electricity consumption in a given period of time, as well as fuel reserves and the volume of generating capacity reserves. Renewable energy sources have a non-uniform nature of generation, and therefore endanger aspects of balance reliability. This problem is key for Ukraine in light of the integration of Ukraine's energy system into the European ENTSO-E network. As a result of the conducted research, it can be stated that the improvement of the situation is possible only with an integrated approach and the implementation of appropriate technologies, namely: technical, economic and institutional technologies. The introduction of technologies will make it possible to improve monitoring and management of energy systems; economic implementations will contribute to the reform of retail pricing and taxation of electricity supplies, taking into account the payment they supply for electricity and covering part of the cost of the general infrastructure; institutional innovations will change the functions and responsibilities of management subjects. Improving coordination between transmission and distribution network operators will become a priority.
