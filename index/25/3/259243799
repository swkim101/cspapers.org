Autonomous robots are increasingly utilized in realistic scenarios with multiple complex tasks. In these scenarios, there may be a preferred way of completing the tasks, but it is often in conflict with optimal execution. Recent work studies preference-based planning, however, they have yet to extend the notion of preference to the behavior of the robot with respect to each task. In this work, we introduce a novel notion of preference that provides a generalized framework to express preferences over individual tasks as well as their relations. We perform an optimal trade-off (Pareto) analysis between behaviors that adhere to the user's preference and the ones that are resource optimal. We introduce an efficient planning framework that generates Pareto-optimal plans given user's preference by extending A* search. Further, we show a method of computing the entire Pareto front (the set of all optimal trade-offs) via an adaptation of a multi-objective A* algorithm. We also present a search heuristic to enable scalability. We illustrate the power of the framework on both mobile robots and manipulators. Our benchmarks show the effectiveness of the heuristic with up to 2-orders of magnitude speedup.
