The results of thermodynamic study of the combustion synthesis conditions of titanium carbide from $T$i+C elements with the activating addition of 2 wt. % Na2TiF6 salt in the aluminum melt using traditional and new nanostructured allotropic forms of carbon: carbon black, graphite, diamond, carbine, C60 and C70 fullerenes, multilayer carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are presented. The calculations were carried out using the computer program THERMO, based on the method of minimizing the thermodynamic potential. The dependences of the reaction adiabatic temperature, the amounts of the target $T$iC phase, the side phases Al4C3 and Al3Ti, and the impurity of easily gasified compounds of Al, Na, and F2 with a refining effect are found on the initial temperature of the reagents. Based on the results obtained, recommendations are given for experimental verification of the use of the considered carbon forms as initial components for the combustion synthesis of $T$iC in the aluminum melt to fabricate a cast Al-TiC composite.
