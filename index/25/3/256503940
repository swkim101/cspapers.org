An infinite set is orbit-finite if, up to permutations of the underlying structure of atoms, it has only finitely many elements. We study a generalisation of linear programming where constraints are expressed by an orbit-finite system of linear inequalities. As our principal contribution we provide a decision procedure for checking if such a system has a real solution, and for computing the minimal/maximal value of a linear objective function over the solution set. We also show undecidability of these problems in case when only integer solutions are considered. Therefore orbit-finite linear programming is decidable, while orbit-finite integer linear programming is not.
