In this paper, we have investigated characteristics of ultraviolet and visible radiation generated by the 2.7 MeV electrons. It is shown that the Cherenkov radiation (ChR) intensity predominates over scintillations including wavelength shifting and cathodoluminescence quenching in pure poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) for such electron energy. To separate ChR and scintillations, we measured emission spectra and orientation dependence of the PMMA samples and compared with GEANT4 model taking into account only ChR mechanism.
