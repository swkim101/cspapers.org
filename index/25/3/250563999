Accelerated by telemedicine, advances in Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) are beginning to offer a viable path toward non-contact physiological measurement. Unfortunately, the datasets for rPPG are limited as they require videos of the human face paired with ground-truth, synchronized heart rate data from a medical-grade health monitor. Also troubling is that the datasets are not inclusive of diverse populations, i.e., current real rPPG facial video datasets are imbalanced in terms of races or skin tones, leading to accuracy disparities on different demographic groups. This paper proposes a scalable biophysical learning based method to generate physio-realistic synthetic rPPG videos given any reference image and target rPPG signal and shows that it could further improve the state-of-the-art physiological measurement and reduce the bias among different groups. We also collect the largest rPPG dataset of its kind (UCLA-rPPG) with a diverse presence of subject skin tones, in the hope that this could serve as a benchmark dataset for different skin tones in this area and ensure that advances of the technique can benefit all people for healthcare equity.
