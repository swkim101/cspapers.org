Containerization promises to strengthen platform-independent development, better resource utilization, and secure deployment of software. As these benefits come with negligible overhead in CPU and memory utilization, containerization is increasingly being adopted in mobile robotic applications. An open challenge is supporting software tasks that have mixed-criticality requirements. Even more challenging is the combination of real-time containers with orchestration, which is an emerging paradigm to automate the deployment, networking, scaling, and availability of containerized workloads and services. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a framework that extends the de-facto reference standard for container orchestration, Kubernetes, to schedule tasks with mixed-criticality requirements. Quantitative experimental results on the software implementing the mission of a Robotnik RB-Kairos mobile robot demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
