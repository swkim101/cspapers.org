We present Chipmunk, a new framework to test persistent-memory (PM) file systems for crash-consistency bugs. Using Chipmunk, we discovered 23 new bugs across five PM file systems; most bugs have been confirmed and fixed by developers. The discovered bugs have serious consequences, including making the file system un-mountable or breaking rename atomicity. We present a detailed study of the bugs found using Chipmunk and discuss important lessons learned for designing and testing PM file systems.
