This article presents a comprehensive vision of particularities and constraints of the Paja Formation in the Northern Andes of Colombia, supported by personal, institutional, and academic experiences, including a doctoral thesis in completion (geomorphology and risks research line). Such fine-grained marine rocks cause severe damage in diverse zones, with little spread, and are very unfavorable, especially within the Eastern Cordillera (departments of Santander and Cundinamarca), whose socio-environmental problems motivated a popular legal action in the municipality of Vélez due to the cracking and collapse of houses, damage to roads and landslides in the urban area, as well as flows, subsidence, and high hydrogeochemical dynamism or rare earths, although they also presented spontaneous ignition at the rural area. Understanding how these problems originate and interrelate is the main objective of the work. At the beginning, we include some brief definitions, terms, and key approaches to understand the consolidated geomaterials, location, and background of the problem; then, the results of meso–macro–micro studies, obtained by combining the field techniques and conventional instrumental laboratory analyses (tests on the chemistry of water and soil, description of samples with magnifying glasses, petrography with a polarized light microscope, micromorphology of regoliths–colluvions) of nanoscientists (emphasizing RXD-RXF, SEM, IR-Raman spectroscopy, TOC-TS) are presented. These characterizations and new knowledge must be socially and institutionally appropriated and applied in land use planning and risk management for the sustainability of challenging environments with the stratiforms of Lower Cretaceous rocks and associated Quaternary deposits in populated mountainous areas and contrasting intertropical hydroclimatological regimes, geologically active, so unstable and insecure.
