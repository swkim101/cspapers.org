Increasing artwork plagiarism incidents underscores the urgent need for reliable copyright protection for high-quality artwork images. Although watermarking is helpful to this issue, existing methods are limited in imperceptibility and robustness. To provide high-level protection for valuable artwork images, we propose a novel invisible robust watermarking framework, dubbed as IRWArt. In our architecture, the embedding and recovery of the watermark are treated as a pair of image transformationsâ€™ inverse problems, and can be implemented through the forward and backward processes of an invertible neural networks (INN), respectively. For high visual quality, we embed the watermark in high-frequency domains with minimal impact on artwork and supervise image reconstruction using a human visual system(HVS)-consistent deep perceptual loss. For strong plagiarism-resistant, we construct a quality enhancement module for the embedded image against possible distortions caused by plagiarism actions. Moreover, the two-stagecontrastive training strategy enables the simultaneous realization of the above two goals. Experimental results on 4 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our IRWArt over other state-of-the-art watermarking methods. Code: https://github.com/1024yy/IRWArt.
