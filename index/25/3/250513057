Most human activities in daily living or professional work rely on upper body motion. Measuring upper body motion is essential for many applications such as health evaluation, rehabilitation, human power augmentation, skill transferring, etc. Computer vision-based systems have been widely used to directly capture upper limb motion but are usually constrained in a restricted area. Wearable sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) are promising to enable ambulant and out-of-lab measurements but also suffer from issues such as magnetic distortion and drifting. Some visual-inertial systems have been proposed recently to fuse these two complementary measurements but mostly apply in a restricted area. In this paper, we propose a fully wearable egocentric visual-inertial system to estimate the upper-limb pose. Magnetometers are not used to allow the system to work in complex industrial and daily living scenarios or to be integrated with motorized assistive devices. Methods to automatically calibrate the sensor-to-segment alignment and estimate upper body motion is presented and validated with an optical motion capture system. Experimental results showed the system can estimate the joint angles without drift and obtain accurate wrist position even with occlusion, verifying the efficacy of the proposed system and method.
