The aerodynamic design of a nose cone aircraft section is an important component in subsonic condition as it contribute to its weight and drag. The air data sensor of a fixed-wing type Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) also located on the nose cone. Thus, by focusing to the design of the nose cone the drag force of the entire aircraft body can be reduced and the flow separation can be minimized or delayed which can affect the efficiency of an aircraft. This research aims to identify the nose cone design that suitable for the air data sensor with the minimum value of drag force and observe the pressure contour of each nose cone design. Each design simulated in velocity of 10m/s, 20m/s and 30m/s with seven angles of attack from -30ยบ to 30ยบ. CAD software is used to design the nose cone and CFD is used to simulate the airflow as well to obtain the drag force of several design of nose cone. The original nose cone of FT Guinea Pig model and elliptical nose cone design shows the lowest value of drag coefficient compared with other proposed designs; conical and tangent ogive. The selected nose cone design will be used for implementing the air data system for the next phase of the research.
