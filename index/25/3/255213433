This paper is devoted to the determination of the value of the maximum specific power of capacitive electrostatic micromotors based on nanometer working gaps. The motors under consideration were developed earlier. They have the following structure: a metal—thin crystalline ferroelectric layer with a high dielectric constant—a nanometer working gap—a movable electrode. The mechanism limiting the magnitude of the maximum field in the gap have also been determined in previous works. The mechanism is the stripping of atoms from the surface of the movable electrode under the action of electrostatic forces. It was shown that the maximum energy density in the working gap can be as high as 1.6 × 109 J/m3. In the presented paper, a maximum frequency of electromechanical energy conversion as high as 10 MHz is estimated for these motors, with a maximum specific power of 5 × 108 W/kg. The application of the proposed motors for micromachines is discussed.
