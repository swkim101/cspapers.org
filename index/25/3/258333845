Variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) is a promising deep probabilistic model in graph representation learning. However, most existing VGAEs adopt the mean-field assumption, and cannot characterize the graphs with noise well. In this paper, we propose a novel deep probabilistic model for graph analysis, termed Multi-head Variational Graph Autoencoder Constrained by Sum-product Networks (named SPN-MVGAE), which helps to relax the mean-field assumption and learns better latent representation with fault tolerance. Our proposed model SPN-MVGAE uses conditional sum-product networks as constraints to learn the dependencies between latent factors in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce the superposition of the latent representations learned by multiple variational networks to represent the final latent representations of nodes. Our model is the first use sum-product networks for graph representation learning, extending the scope of sum-product networks applications. Experimental results show that compared with other baseline methods, our model has competitive advantages in link prediction, fault tolerance, node classification, and graph visualization on real datasets.
