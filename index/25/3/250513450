We present a whole-body control architecture for the generation of stable task-oriented motions in Wheeled Inverted Pendulum (WIP) robots. Controlling WIP systems is challenging because the successful execution of tasks is subordinate to the ability to maintain balance. Our feedback control approach relies both on partial feedback linearization and Model Predictive Control (MPC). The partial feedback linearization reshapes the system into a convenient form, while the MPC computes inputs to execute the desired task by solving a constrained optimization problem. Input constraints account for actuation limits and a stability constraint is in charge of stabilizing the unstable body pitch angle dynamics. The proposed approach is validated by simulations on an ALTER-EGO robot performing navigation and loco-manipulation tasks.
