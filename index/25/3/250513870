In this paper, we consider the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) as a System-of-Systems (SoS) and propose modeling it using colored Petri nets. We formally control the European rail transport, while guaranteeing a set of cross-border security properties. This becomes an essential and challenging task since each of them have mainly developed safety and trackside rules regardless of its neighbors. The feature of this work lies in the approach that considers ERTMS Level 2 as an SoS and addresses the cross-border railway as a mode management problem. In addition, the aspects of mode activation/deactivation, starting state and handling of resource states common to multiple operating modes are taken into account in the proposed model.
