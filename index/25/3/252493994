Video-conferencing applications impose high loads and stringent performance requirements on the network. To better understand and manage these applications, we need effective ways to measure performance in the wild. For example, these measurements would help network operators in capacity planning, troubleshooting, and setting QoS policies. Unfortunately, large-scale measurements of production networks cannot rely on end-host cooperation, and an in-depth analysis of packet traces requires knowledge of the header formats. Zoom is one of the most sophisticated and popular applications, but it uses a proprietary network protocol. In this paper, we demystify how Zoom works at the packet level, and design techniques for analyzing Zoom performance from packet traces. We conduct systematic controlled experiments to discover the relevant unencrypted fields in Zoom packets, as well as how to group streams into meetings and how to identify peer-to-peer meetings. We show how to use the header fields to compute metrics like media bit rates, frame sizes and rates, and latency and jitter, and demonstrate the value of these fine-grained metrics on a 12-hour trace of Zoom traffic on our campus network.
