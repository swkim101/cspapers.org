In the practical application of point cloud completion tasks, real data quality is usually much worse than the CAD datasets used for training. A small amount of noisy data will usually significantly impact the overall system's accuracy. In this paper, we propose a quality evaluation network to score the point clouds and help judge the quality of the point cloud before applying the completion model. We believe our scoring method can help researchers select more appropriate point clouds for subsequent completion and reconstruction and avoid manual parameter adjustment. Moreover, our evaluation model is fast and straightforward and can be directly inserted into any model's training or use process to facilitate the automatic selection and post-processing of point clouds. We propose a complete dataset construction and model evaluation method based on ShapeNet. We verify our network using detection and flow estimation tasks on KITTI, a real-world dataset for autonomous driving. The experimental results show that our model can effectively distinguish the quality of point clouds and help in practical tasks.
