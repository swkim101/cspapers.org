The problems of algorithmic modeling and research of nonlinear hydro-mechanical systems of automatic control are considered. The mathematical model of one of the considered objects of research (controller of indirect action) is given. The analysis of the linear and nonlinear method of solving the problem in generalized parameters is described.
