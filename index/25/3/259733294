Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is essential to large-scale robotic coordination tasks. Planning-based algorithms show their advantages in collision avoidance while avoiding exponential growth in the number of agents. Reinforcement-learning (RL)-based algorithms can be deployed efficiently but cannot prevent collisions entirely due to the lack of hard constraints. This paper combines the merits of planning-based and RL-based MAPF methods to propose a deployment-efficient and collision-free MAPF algorithm. The experiments show the effectiveness of our approach.
