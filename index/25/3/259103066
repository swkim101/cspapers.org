In physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) it is essential to reliably estimate and localize contact forces between the robot and the environment. In this paper, a complete contact detection, isolation, and reaction scheme is presented and tested on a new 6-dof industrial collaborative robot. We combine two popular methods, based on monitoring energy and generalized momentum, to detect and isolate collisions on the whole robot body in a more robust way. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our implementation on the LARA 5 cobot, that only relies on motor current and joint encoder measurements. For validation purposes, contact forces are also measured using an external GTE CoboSafe sensor. After a successful collision detection, the contact point location is isolated using a combination of the residual method based on the generalized momentum with a contact particle filter (CPF) scheme. We show for the first time a successful implementation of such combination on a real robot, without relying on joint torque sensor measurements.
