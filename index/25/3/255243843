Serializable systems often perform poorly under high contention. In this work, we analyze this performance limitation through a novel take on conflict windows. Through the lens of these windows, we develop a new concurrency control technique that leverages transaction re-execution to improve throughput scalability under high contention. Our system, Morty, achieves up to 1.7x-96x the throughput of state-of-the-art systems, with similar or better latency.
