Traditional low-rank methods overlook residuals as corruptions, but we discovered that low-rank residuals actually keep image edges together with corrupt components. Therefore, filtering out such structural information could hamper the discriminative details in images, especially in heavy corruptions. In order to address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel method named ESL-LRR, which preserves image edges by finding image projections from low-rank residuals. Specifically, our approach is built in a manifold learning framework where residuals are regarded as another view of image data. Edge preserved image projections are then pursued using a dynamic affinity graph regularization to capture the more accurate similarity between residuals while suppressing the influence of corrupt ones. With this adaptive approach, the proposed method can also find image intrinsic low-rank representation, and much discriminative edge preserved projections. As a result, a new classification strategy is introduced, aligning both modalities to enhance accuracy. Experiments are conducted on several benchmark image datasets, including MNIST, LFW, and COIL100. The results show that the proposed method has clear advantages over compared state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, such as Low-Rank Embedding (LRE), Low-Rank Preserving Projection via Graph Regularized Reconstruction (LRPP_GRR), and Feature Selective Projection (FSP) with more than 2% improvement, particularly in corrupted cases.
