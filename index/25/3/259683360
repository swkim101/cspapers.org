This paper studies the problem of exploring the user intent for session-based recommendations. Its challenges come from the uncertainty of user behavior and limited information. However, current endeavors cannot fully explore the mutual interactions among sessions and do not explicitly model the complex high-order relations among items. To circumvent these critical issues, we innovatively propose a HyperGraph Convolutional Contrastive framework (termed HGCC) that consists of two crucial tasks: 1) The session-based recommendation (SBR task) that aims to capture the beyond pair-wise relationships between items and sessions. 2) The self-supervised learning (SSL task) acted as the auxiliary task to boost the former task. By jointly optimizing the two tasks, the performance of the recommendation task achieves decent gains. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art methods.
