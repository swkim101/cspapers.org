The field of deep clustering combines deep learning and clustering to learn representations that improve both the learned representation and the performance of the considered clustering method. Most existing deep clustering methods are designed for a single clustering method, e.g., k-means, spectral clustering, or Gaussian mixture models, but it is well known that no clustering algorithm works best in all circumstances. Consensus clustering tries to alleviate the individual weaknesses of clustering algorithms by building a consensus between members of a clustering ensemble. Currently, there is no deep clustering method that can include multiple heterogeneous clustering algorithms in an ensemble to update representations and clusterings together. To close this gap, we introduce the idea of a consensus representation that maximizes the agreement between ensemble members. Further, we propose DECCS (Deep Embedded Clustering with Consensus representationS), a deep consensus clustering method that learns a consensus representation by enhancing the embedded space to such a degree that all ensemble members agree on a common clustering result. Our contributions are the following: (1) We introduce the idea of learning consensus representations for heterogeneous clusterings, a novel notion to approach consensus clustering. (2) We propose DECCS, the first deep clustering method that jointly improves the representation and clustering results of multiple heterogeneous clustering algorithms. (3) We show in experiments that learning a consensus representation with DECCS is outperforming several relevant baselines from deep clustering and consensus clustering.
