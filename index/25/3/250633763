Precise segmentation of polyps from colonoscopic images is extremely significant for the early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. However, it is still a challenging task due to: (1)the boundary between the polyp and the background is blurred makes delineation difficult; (2)the various size and shapes causes feature representation of polyps difficult. In this paper, we propose an integration context-based reverse-contour guidance network (ICGNet) to solve these challenges. The ICGNet firstly utilizes a reverse-contour guidance module to aggregate low-level edge detail information and meanwhile constraint reverse region. Then, the newly designed adaptive context module is used to adaptively extract local-global information of the current layer and complementary information of the previous layer to get larger and denser features. Lastly, an innovative hybrid pyramid pooling fusion module fuses the multi-level features generated from the decoder in the case of considering salient features and less background. Our proposed approach is evaluated on the EndoScene, Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ColonDB datasets with eight evaluation metrics, and gives competitive results compared with other state-of-the-art methods in both learning ability and generalization capability.
