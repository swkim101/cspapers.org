Transformers are considered one of the most important deep learning models since 2018, in part because it establishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) records and could potentially replace existing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Despite the remarkable triumphs, the prolonged turnaround time of Transformer models is a widely recognized roadblock. The variety of sequence lengths imposes additional computing overhead where inputs need to be zero-padded to the maximum sentence length in the batch to accommodate the parallel computing platforms. This paper targets the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and proposes a coherent sequence length adaptive algorithm-hardware co-design for Transformer acceleration. Particularly, we develop a hardware-friendly sparse attention operator and a length-aware hardware resource scheduling algorithm. The proposed sparse attention operator brings the complexity of attention-based models down to linear complexity and alleviates the off-chip memory traffic. The proposed length-aware resource hardware scheduling algorithm dynamically allocates the hardware resources to fill up the pipeline slots and eliminates bubbles for NLP tasks. Experiments show that our design has very small accuracy loss and has 80.2 × and 2.6 × speedup compared to CPU and GPU implementation, and 4 × higher energy efficiency than state-of-the-art GPU accelerator optimized via CUBLAS GEMM.
