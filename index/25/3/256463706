The understanding of chaotic systems is challenging not only for theoretical research but also for many important applications. Chaotic behavior is found in many nonlinear dynamical systems, such as those found in climate dynamics, weather, the stock market, and the space-time dynamics of virus spread. A reliable solution for these systems must handle their complex space-time dynamics and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. We develop a deep learning framework to push the time horizon at which reliable predictions can be made further into the future by better evaluating the consequences of local errors when modeling nonlinear systems. Our approach observes the future trajectories of initial errors at a time horizon to model the evolution of the loss to that point with two major components: 1) a recurrent architecture, Error Trajectory Tracing, that is designed to trace the trajectories of predictive errors through phase space, and 2) a training regime, Horizon Forcing, that pushes the modelâ€™s focus out to a predetermined time horizon. We validate our method on classic chaotic systems and real-world time series prediction tasks with chaotic characteristics, and show that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.
