To learn influence relationships between nodes in a diffusion network, most existing approaches resort to precise timestamps of historical node infections. The target network is customarily assumed as an one-aspect diffusion network, with homogeneous influence relationships. Nonetheless, tracing node infection timestamps is often infeasible due to high cost, and the type of influence relationships may be heterogeneous because of the diversity of propagation media. In this work, we study how to infer a multi-aspect diffusion network with heterogeneous influence relationships, using only node infection statuses that are more readily accessible in practice. Equipped with a probabilistic generative model, we iteratively conduct a posteriori, quantitative analysis on historical diffusion results of the network, and infer the structure and strengths of homogeneous influence relationships in each aspect. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks are conducted, and the results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
