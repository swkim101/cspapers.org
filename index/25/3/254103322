Reassembly, a branch of static binary rewriting, has become a focus of research today. However, despite its widespread use and research interest, there have been no systematic investiga-tions on the techniques and challenges of reassemblers. In this paper, we formally deﬁne different types of errors that occur in current existing reassemblers, and present an automated tool named R EASSESSOR to ﬁnd such errors. We attempt to show through our tool and the large-scale benchmark we created the current challenges in the ﬁeld and how they can be approached.
