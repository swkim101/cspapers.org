Thanks to the amazing semiconductor scaling, incredible design complexity makes the synthesis-centric very large-scale integration (VLSI) design flow increasingly rely on electronic design automation (EDA) tools. However, invoking EDA tools especially the physical synthesis tool may require several hours or even days for only one possible parameters combination. Even worse, for a new design, oceans of attempts to navigate high quality-of-results (QoR) after physical synthesis have to be made via multiple tool runs with numerous combinations of tunable tool parameters. Additionally, designers often puzzle over simultaneously considering multiple QoR metrics of interest (e.g., delay, power, and area). To tackle the dilemma within finite resource budget, designing a multi-objective parameter auto-tuning framework of the physical design tool which can learn from historical tool configurations and transfer the associated knowledge to new tasks is in demand. In this paper, we propose PPATuner, a Pareto-driven physical design tool parameter tuning methodology, to achieve a good trade-off among multiple QoR metrics of interest (e.g., power, area, delay) at the physical design stage. By incorporating the transfer Gaussian process (GP) model, it can autonomously learn the transfer knowledge from the existing tool parameter combinations. The experimental results on industrial benchmarks under the 7nm technology node demonstrate the merits of our framework.
