 Thermal metamaterials are gaining increasing popularity, especially for heat flux manipulation purposes. However, due to the high anisotropy of the structures resulting from the transformation thermotics or scattering cancellation methods, researchers are resorting to topology optimization as an alternative to find the optimal distribution of constituent bulk materials to realize a specific thermal function. This paper proposes to design a thermal cloak using the level-set-based shape and topology optimization. The thermal cloak design is considered in the context of pure heat conduction. The cloaking effect is achieved by reproducing the reference temperature field through the optimal distribution of two thermally conductive materials. The structural boundary is evolved by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The feasibility and validity of the proposed method to design thermal meta-devices with cloaking functionality are demonstrated through two numerical examples. The optimized structures have clear boundaries between constituent materials and do not exhibit thermal anisotropy, making it easier for physical realization. The first example deals with a circular cloaking region as a benchmark design. The robustness of the proposed method against various cloaking regions is illustrated by the second example concerning a human-shaped cloaking area. This work can inspire a broader exploration of the thermal meta-device in the heat flux manipulation regime.
