We present TangibleGrid, a novel device that allows blind users to understand and design the layout of a web page with real-time tangible feedback. We conducted semi-structured interviews and a series of co-design sessions with blind users to elicit insights that guided the design of TangibleGrid. Our final prototype contains shape-changing brackets representing the web elements and a baseboard representing the web page canvas. Blind users can design a web page layout through creating and editing web elements by snapping or adjusting tangible brackets on top of the baseboard. The baseboard senses the bracketsâ€™ type, size, and location, verbalizes the information, and renders the web page on the client browser. Through a formative user study, we found that blind users could understand a web page layout through TangibleGrid. They were also able to design a new web layout from scratch without the help of sighted people.
