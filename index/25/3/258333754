Existing methods for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) mainly focus on integrating multimodal data effectively on limited multimodal data. Learning more informative multimodal representation often relies on large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult and unrealistic to obtain. To learn informative multimodal representation on limited labeled datasets as more as possible, we proposed TMMDA for MSA, a new Token Mixup Multimodal Data Augmentation, which first generates new virtual modalities from the mixed token-level representation of raw modalities, and then enhances the representation of raw modalities by utilizing the representation of the generated virtual modalities. To preserve semantics during virtual modality generation, we propose a novel cross-modal token mixup strategy based on the generative adversarial network. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, verify the superiority of our model compared with several state-of-the-art baselines.
