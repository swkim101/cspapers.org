Tactile robots shall be deployed for dynamic task execution in production lines with small batch sizes. Therefore, these robots should have the ability to respond to changing conditions and be easy to (re-)program. Operating under uncertain environments requires unifying subsystems such as robot motion and force policy into one framework, referred to as tactile skills. In this paper, we propose the enhancement of these skills for passivity-based skill motion learning in stiffness-adaptive unified force-impedance control. To achieve the increased level of adaptability, we represent all tactile skills by three basic primitives: contact initiation, manipulation, and contact termination. To ensure passivity and stability, we develop an energy-based approach for unified force-impedance control that allows humans to teach the robot motion through physical interaction during the execution of a tactile task. We incorporate our proposed framework into a tactile robot to experimentally validate the motion adaptation by interaction performance and stability of the control. While the polishing task is presented as our use case through the paper, the experiments can also be carried out with various tactile skills. Finally, the results show the novel controller's stability and passivity to contact-loss and stiffness adaptation, leading to successful programming by interaction.
