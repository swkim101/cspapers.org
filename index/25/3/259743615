Detecting fraud is an urgent task to avoid transaction risks. Especially when expanding a business to new cities or new countries, developing a totally new model will bring the cost issue and result in forgetting previous knowledge. This study proposes a novel solution based on heterogeneous trade graphs, namely HTG-CFD, to prevent knowledge forgetting of cross-regional fraud detection. Specifically, a novel heterogeneous trade graph is meticulously constructed from original transactions to explore the complex semantics among different types of entities and relationships. Motivated by continual learning, we present a practical and task-oriented forgetting prevention method to alleviate knowledge forgetting in the context of cross-regional detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HTG-CFD promotes performance in both cross-regional and single-regional scenarios.
