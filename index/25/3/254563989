The concept of walkable urban development has gained increased
attention due to its public health, economic, and environmental
sustainability benefits. Unfortunately, land zoning
and historic under-investment have resulted in spatial inequality
in walkability and social inequality among residents.
We tackle the problem of Walkability Optimization through
the lens of combinatorial optimization. The task is to select
locations in which additional amenities (e.g., grocery stores,
schools, restaurants) can be allocated to improve resident access
via walking while taking into account existing amenities
and providing multiple options (e.g., for restaurants).
To this end, we derive Mixed-Integer Linear Programming
(MILP) and Constraint Programming (CP) models. Moreover,
we show that the problem’s objective function is submodular
in special cases, which motivates an efficient greedy
heuristic. We conduct a case study on 31 underserved neighborhoods
in the City of Toronto, Canada. MILP finds the
best solutions in most scenarios but does not scale well with
network size. The greedy algorithm scales well and finds
high-quality solutions. Our empirical evaluation shows that
neighbourhoods with low walkability have a great potential
for transformation into pedestrian-friendly neighbourhoods
by strategically placing new amenities. Allocating 3 additional
grocery stores, schools, and restaurants can improve the
“WalkScore” by more than 50 points (on a scale of 100) for 4
neighbourhoods and reduce the walking distances to amenities
for 75% of all residential locations to 10 minutes for all
amenity types. Our code and paper appendix are available at
