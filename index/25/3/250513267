Presented is a new 10-mm diameter wrist designed for robotic surgery. Featuring greater dexterity than current designs, entirely new procedures may be possible. An innovative, parallel mechanism, it offers 180 degrees of singularity-free pitch/yaw motion. The wrist is also a new form of high angulation, constant velocity, universal joint and is capable of continuous 360 degrees of roll rotation at any angle to enable drilling, reaming, milling, filing, deburring, or inserting fasteners. Z-axis motion is incorporated into the wrist itself, a unique feature. In addition, a gripper, scissors, stapler or other open/close device may be added. A thru-hole allows for passing wires, fiber optics, or flexible tubes. Stainless steel rotary shafts drive the wrist and also enable force reflection useful for providing haptic feedback to the operator. Eliminating difficult to sterilize woven steel cables/pulleys and bearings, the wrist may be sterilized in an autoclave. A simple construction, the wrist lends itself to CNC machining and automated assembly.
