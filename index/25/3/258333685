The success of many web services relies on the large-scale domain-specific high-quality labeled dataset. Insufficient public datasets motivate us to reduce the cost of data labeling while maintaining high accuracy in support of intelligent web applications. The rule-based method and the learning-based method are common techniques for labeling. In this work, we study how to utilize the rule-based and learning-based methods for resource-effective text labeling. We propose CoTel, the first ontology-neural co-enhanced framework for text labeling. We propose critical ontology extraction in the rule-based module and ontology-enhanced loss prediction in the learning-based module. CoTel can integrate explicit labeling rules and implicit labeling models and make them help each other to improve resource efficiency in text labeling tasks. We evaluate CoTel on both public datasets and real applications with three different tasks. Compared with the baseline, CoTel can reduce the time cost by 64.75% (a 2.84Ã— speedup) and the number of labeling by 62.07%.
