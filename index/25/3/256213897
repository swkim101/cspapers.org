The correct choice and substantiation of rational parameters of the working process of a gas turbine engine with heat recovery at the stage of conceptual design are one of the ways to ensure maximum efficiency of the engine and the aircraft as a whole. This work is devoted to optimizing the parameters of the working process of turbofan engines with heat recovery. The results of the influence of various factors on the optimal values of the parameters of the working process of the turbofan engine and the criteria for evaluating the engine in the system of a medium-haul passenger aircraft are carried out and presented based on the method of multi-criteria optimization by numerical modeling in ASTRA simulation tools.
