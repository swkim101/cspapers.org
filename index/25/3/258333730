Sequential Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has been popularly studied to utilize different domain knowledge and users’ historical behaviors for the next-item prediction. In this paper, we focus on the cross-domain sequential recommendation problem. This commonly exist problem is rather challenging from two perspectives, i.e., the implicit user historical rating sequences are difficult in modeling and the users/items on different domains are mostly non-overlapped. Most previous sequential CDR approaches cannot solve the cross-domain sequential recommendation problem well, since (1) they cannot sufficiently depict the users’ actual preferences, (2) they cannot leverage and transfer useful knowledge across domains. To tackle the above issues, we propose joint Internal multi-interest exploration and External domain alignment for cross domain Sequential Recommendation model (IESRec). IESRec includes two main modules, i.e., internal multi-interest exploration module and external domain alignment module. To reflect the users’ diverse characteristics with multi-interests evolution, we first propose internal temporal optimal transport method in the internal multi-interest exploration module. We further propose external alignment optimal transport method in the external domain alignment module to reduce domain discrepancy for the item embeddings. Our empirical studies on Amazon datasets demonstrate that IESRec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models.
