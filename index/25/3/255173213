Professional human drivers usually have more than one driving strategy to handle incoming traffic situations. These different strategies activate different performance characteristics of the vehicle, enabling the driver to minimize the risk in a variety of situations by optimizing the strategy selection. In the same spirit, we define a novel concept of strategy-wise performance metric and creatively combine this performance metric with reachability analysis to evaluate candidate control strategies. Such a performance evaluation produces solid guarantees on which strategies will not qualify for the given traffic scenario. Then we automate the strategy selection process by weighing and minimizing the overall risk of each strategy candidate.
