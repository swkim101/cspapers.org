As a long-standing and challenging task, image deblurring aims to reconstruct the latent sharp image from its degraded counterpart. In this study, to bridge the gaps between degraded/sharp image pairs in the spatial and frequency domains simultaneously, we develop the dual-domain attention mechanism for image deblurring. Self-attention is widely used in vision tasks, however, due to the quadratic complexity, it is not applicable to image deblurring with high-resolution images. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel spatial attention module by implementing self-attention in the style of dynamic group convolution for integrating information from the local region, enhancing the representation learning capability and reducing computational burden. Regarding frequency domain learning, many frequency-based deblurring approaches either treat the spectrum as a whole or decompose frequency components in a complicated manner. In this work, we devise a frequency attention module to compactly decouple the spectrum into distinct frequency parts and accentuate the informative part with extremely lightweight learnable parameters. Finally, we incorporate attention modules into a U-shaped network. Extensive comparisons with prior arts on the common benchmarks show that our model, named Dual-domain Attention Network (DDANet), obtains comparable results with a significantly improved inference speed.
