The key to personalized search is modeling user intents to tailor returned results for different users. Existing personalized methods mainly focus on learning implicit user interest vectors. In this paper, we propose ExpliPS, a personalized search model that explicitly incorporates query subtopics into personalization. It models the user’s current intent by estimating the user’s preference over the subtopics of the current query and personalizes the results over the weighted subtopics. We think that in such a way, personalized search could be more explainable and stable. Specifically, we first employ a semantic encoder to learn the representations of the user’s historical behaviours. Then with the historical behaviour representations, a subtopic preference encoder is devised to predict the user’s subtopic preferences on the current query. Finally, we rerank the candidates via a subtopic-aware ranker that prioritizes the documents relevant to the user-preferred subtopics. Experimental results show our model ExpliPS outperforms the state-of-the-art personalized web search models with explainable and stable results.
