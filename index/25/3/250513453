In this paper a novel full state feedback approach for control of compliant actuated robot with nonlinear spring characteristics is presented. A multi-DOF elastic robot arm is a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) under-actuated system. By the new novel controller, which is based on motor coordinate transformation and motor inertia shaping, the MIMO system can be converted into a set of decoupled single-input single-output (SISO) systems. Using full state feedback controller, we can configurate the poles of each SISO system. The controller is validated by an 3-DOF elastic robot with nonlinear spring characteristics in simulation of MATLAB/Simulink.
