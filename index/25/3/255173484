The fit of a wearable device, such as a prosthesis, can be quantitatively characterized by the mechanical coupling at the user-device interface. It is thought that the mechanical impedance, specifically the stiffness and damping, of wearable device interfaces can significantly impact human performance while using them. To test this theory, we develop a forearm-mounted testbed with a motorized, two degree of freedom (2-DOF) gimbal to simulate variations in the mechanical fit of an upper-extremity wearable device during pointing and target tracking tasks. The two gimbal motors are impedance-controlled to vary the mechanical stiffness and damping between the user and the device's laser pointer end-effector. In this paper, experiments are conducted to determine the torque constants of the motors before implementation in the testbed, and to validate the accuracy of the joint impedance controller. The completed impedance-controlled wearable interface testbed is validated further by comparing the gimbal joint displacements and torques, recorded during 2-DOF base excitation experiments, to MATLAB Simulink simulation data.
