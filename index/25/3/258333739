Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to leverage the source domain information to provide better recommendation for the target domain, which is widely adopted in recommender systems to alleviate the data sparsity and cold-start problems. However, existing CDR methods mostly focus on designing effective model architectures to transfer the source domain knowledge, ignoring the behavior-level effect during the loss optimization process, where behaviors regarding different aspects in the source domain may have different importance for the CDR model optimization. The ignorance of the behavior-level effect will cause the carefully designed model architectures ending up with sub-optimal parameters, which limits the recommendation performance. To tackle the problem, we propose a generic behavioral importance-aware optimization framework for cross-domain recommendation (BIAO). Specifically, we propose a behavioral perceptron which predicts the importance of each source behavior according to the corresponding itemâ€™s global impact and local user-specific impact. The joint optimization process of the CDR model and the behavioral perceptron is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. In the lower optimization, only the CDR model is updated with weighted source behavior loss and the target domain loss, while in the upper optimization, the behavioral perceptron is updated with implicit gradient from a developing dataset obtained through the proposed reorder-and-reuse strategy. Extensive experiments show that our proposed optimization framework consistently improves the performance of different cross-domain recommendation models in 7 cross-domain scenarios, demonstrating that our method can serve as a generic and powerful tool for cross-domain recommendation1.
