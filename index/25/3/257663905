Event-based cameras offer reliable measurements for preforming computer vision tasks in high-dynamic range environments and during fast motion maneuvers. However, adopting deep learning in event-based vision faces the challenge of annotated data scarcity due to recency of event cameras. Transferring the knowledge that can be obtained from conventional camera annotated data offers a practical solution to this challenge. We develop an unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm for training a deep network for event-based data image classification using contrastive learning and uncorrelated conditioning of data. Our solution outperforms the existing algorithms for this purpose.
