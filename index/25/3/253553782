Training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a strict 1-Lipschitz constraint under the $l_{2}$ norm is useful for adversarial robustness, interpretable gradients and stable training. 1-Lipschitz CNNs are usually designed by enforcing each layer to have an orthogonal Jacobian matrix (for all inputs) to prevent the gradients from vanishing during backpropagation. However, their performance often significantly lags behind that of heuristic methods to enforce Lipschitz constraints where the resulting CNN is not \textit{provably} 1-Lipschitz. In this work, we reduce this gap by introducing (a) a procedure to certify robustness of 1-Lipschitz CNNs by replacing the last linear layer with a 1-hidden layer MLP that significantly improves their performance for both standard and provably robust accuracy, (b) a method to significantly reduce the training time per epoch for Skew Orthogonal Convolution (SOC) layers (>30\% reduction for deeper networks) and (c) a class of pooling layers using the mathematical property that the $l_{2}$ distance of an input to a manifold is 1-Lipschitz. Using these methods, we significantly advance the state-of-the-art for standard and provable robust accuracies on CIFAR-10 (gains of +1.79\% and +3.82\%) and similarly on CIFAR-100 (+3.78\% and +4.75\%) across all networks.
