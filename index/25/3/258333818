The problem of constrained subset selection from a large data stream for profit maximization has many applications in web data mining and machine learning, such as social advertising, team formation and recommendation systems. Such a problem can be formulated as maximizing a regularized submodular function under certain constraints. In this paper, we consider a generalized k-system constraint, which captures various requirements in real-world applications. For this problem, we propose the first streaming algorithm with provable performance bounds, leveraging a novel multitudinous distorted filter framework. The empirical performance of our algorithm is extensively evaluated in several applications including web data mining and recommendation systems, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiorities of our algorithm in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
