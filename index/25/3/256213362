The paper presents an analytical solution of the heat transfer boundary value problem for a plate with a time-varying boundary condition of the 1st kind using the Kantorovich method. The solution involving a power-law algebraic polynomial with coefficients that are exponentially stabilized in time is characterized by high accuracy. So, already in third approximation in the range from 0 to 4, the discrepancy from the exact solution does not exceed 1%. The time-varying boundary condition of the 1st kind is recovered by solving the inverse heat transfer problem using experimental data on the temperature in the center of the plate.
