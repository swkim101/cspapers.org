Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is composed of a series of facts related to timestamps in the real world and has become the basis of many artificial intelligence applications. However, the existing TKG is usually incomplete. It has become a hot research task to infer missing facts based on existing facts in a TKG; namely, Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC). The current mainstream TKGC models are embedded models that predict missing facts by representing entities, relations and timestamps as low-dimensional vectors. In order to deal with the TKG structure information, there are some models that try to introduce attention mechanism into the embedding process. But they only consider the structure information of entities or relations, and ignore the structure information of the whole TKG. Moreover, most of them usually treat timestamps as a general feature and cannot take advantage of the potential time series information of the timestamp. To solve these problems, wo propose a new Hierarchical Self-Attention Embedding (HSAE) model which inspired by self-attention mechanism and diachronic embedding technique. For structure information of the whole TKG, we divide the TKG into two layers: entity layer and relation layer, and then apply the self-attention mechanism to the entity layer and relation layer respectively to capture the structure information. For time series information of the timestamp, we capture them by combining positional encoding and diachronic embedding technique into the above two self-attention layers. Finally, we can get the embedded representation vectors of entities, relations and timestamps, which can be combined with other models for better results. We evaluate our model on three TKG datasets: ICEWS14, ICEWS05-15 and GDELT. Experimental results on the TKGC (interpolation) task demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results.
