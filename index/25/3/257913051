On a shutter press, modern handheld cameras capture multiple images in rapid succession and merge them to gen-erate a single image. However, individual frames in a burst are misaligned due to inevitable motions and contain mul-tiple degradations. The challenge is to properly align the successive image shots and merge their complimentary in-formation to achieve high-quality outputs. Towards this direction, we propose Burstormer: a novel transformer-based architecture for burst image restoration and enhancement. In comparison to existing works, our approach exploits multi-scale local and non-local features to achieve improved alignment and feature fusion. Our key idea is to enable inter-frame communication in the burst neighborhoods for information aggregation and progressive fusion while modeling the burst-wide context. However, the input burst frames need to be properly aligned before fusing their information. Therefore, we propose an enhanced de-formable alignment module for aligning burst features with regards to the reference frame. Unlike existing methods, the proposed alignment module not only aligns burst features but also exchanges fea-ture information and maintains focused communication with the reference frame through the proposed reference-based feature enrichment mechanism, which facilitates handling complex motions. After multi-level alignment and enrichment, we re-emphasize on inter-frame communication within burst using a cyclic burst sampling module. Finally, the inter-frame information is aggre-gated using the proposed burst feature fusion module followed by progressive upsampling. Our Burstormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods on burst super-resolution, burst denoising and burst low-light enhance-ment.
