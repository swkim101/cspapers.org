Social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube connect people with communities that reflect their own values and experiences. People discover new communities either organically or through algorithmic recommendations based on their interests and preferences. We study online journeys users take through these communities, focusing particularly on ones that may lead to problematic outcomes. In particular, we propose and explore the concept of gateways, namely, entities associated with a higher likelihood of subsequent engagement with problematic content. We show, via a real-world application on Facebook groups, that a simple definition of gateway entities can be leveraged to reduce exposure to problematic content by 1% without any adverse impact on user engagement metrics. Motivated by this finding, we propose several formal definitions of gateways, via both frequentist and survival analysis methods, and evaluate their efficacy in predicting user behavior through offline experiments. Frequentist, duration-insensitive methods predict future harmful engagements with an 0.64–0.83 AUC, while survival analysis methods improve this to 0.72–0.90 AUC.
