The article suggests the use of the energy efficiency index (ENEX) of the industrial energy consumer as a metric of ESG sustainable development and present a scope of application of the ENEX index for consumers of energy resources. The energy efficiency index is expressed both numerically and energy consumption labelling scheme of energy efficiency classes from A++ to E in the reporting where A++ being the most energy efficient, E the least efficient. The report also give other useful information to the stakeholders who compare different energy consumers at the one production sector. This gives ENEX access to indicators of the level of excellence in the use of energy resources. The index is a target for determining the capacity of energy efficiency programs. Despite the similarity with the E (ESG) environment metrics of GRI, NASDAQ, UNGC and others, ENEX has significant differences in the evaluation parameters. ENEX is a comprehensive indicator that contains a set of indicators (metrics) that are responsible for a wide range of criteria that determine the effective consumption of energy resources and the level of efficiency of the energy consumer as a whole object. The ENEX assessment parameters allow us to consider the reasons that affect the efficiency of energy use in the complex, and to identify areas of energy risks. Monitoring of ENEX indicators and the metric shows the sustainability of development and energy efficiency over time.
