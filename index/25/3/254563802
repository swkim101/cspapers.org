Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detection methods for autonomous driving scenarios mainly adopt the training-from-scratch paradigm. Unfortunately, this paradigm heavily relies on large-scale labeled data, whose collection can be expensive and time-consuming. Self-supervised pre-training is an effective and desirable way to alleviate this dependence on extensive annotated data. In this work, we present BEV-MAE, an efficient masked autoencoder pre-training framework for LiDAR-based 3D object detection in autonomous driving. Specifically, we propose a bird's eye view (BEV) guided masking strategy to guide the 3D encoder learning feature representation in a BEV perspective and avoid complex decoder design during pre-training. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable point token to maintain a consistent receptive field size of the 3D encoder with fine-tuning for masked point cloud inputs. Based on the property of outdoor point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios, i.e., the point clouds of distant objects are more sparse, we propose point density prediction to enable the 3D encoder to learn location information, which is essential for object detection. Experimental results show that BEV-MAE surpasses prior state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and achieves a favorably pre-training efficiency. Furthermore, based on TransFusion-L, BEV-MAE achieves new state-of-the-art LiDAR-based 3D object detection results, with 73.6 NDS and 69.6 mAP on the nuScenes benchmark.
