We propose the Sparse Abstract Machine (SAM), an abstract machine model for targeting sparse tensor algebra to reconfigurable and fixed-function spatial dataflow accelerators. SAM defines a streaming dataflow abstraction with sparse primitives that encompass a large space of scheduled tensor algebra expressions. SAM dataflow graphs naturally separate tensor formats from algorithms and are expressive enough to incorporate arbitrary iteration orderings and many hardware-specific optimizations. We also present Custard, a compiler from a high-level language to SAM that demonstrates SAM's usefulness as an intermediate representation. We automatically bind from SAM to a streaming dataflow simulator. We evaluate the generality and extensibility of SAM, explore the performance space of sparse tensor algebra optimizations using SAM, and show SAM's ability to represent dataflow hardware.
