Tip force sensing for cable-driven continuum robots are vital to provide the force information for safe and reliable human-robot interaction. However, traditional triaxial force sensors usually have a complicated structure occupying its inner lumen, without enough space for additional instrumental tools. To solve this, this paper proposes a fixed and sliding fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors-based triaxial force sensing method for cable-driven continuum robots. The fixed FBG sensors are attached to the circumferential surface of continuum robot at the tip and base, and the sliding optical fibers with FBG sensors are located in the actuation channels as the sensing integrated pulling cables. This configuration guarantees a compact structure and large inner lumen. Two five-degreed-of-freedom (5-DOF) electromagnetic (EM) and a 6-DOF EM sensors are assembled to the tip and the base of the robot respectively, which can obtain the pose of the tip with respect to the base. The tip force in three directions can be decoupled using the information of the Bragg wavelength changes and EM sensors. Results show that the mean errors of force sensing along x-direction, y-direction, and z-direction are 4.1%, 4.7%, and 9.8%, respectively. The proposed sensing method does not rely on the elasticity of continuum robot, enabling its wide applicability for other cable-driven pseudo-continuum robots.
