In this paper, for the first time, we study the formal verification of Bayesian mechanisms through strategic reasoning. We rely on the framework of Probabilistic Strategy Logic (PSL), which is well-suited for representing and verifying multi-agent systems with incomplete information. We take advantage of the recent results on the decidability of PSL model checking under memoryless strategies, and reduce the problem of formally verifying Bayesian mechanisms to PSL model checking. We show how to encode Bayesian-Nash equilibrium and economical properties, and illustrate our approach with different kinds of mechanisms.
