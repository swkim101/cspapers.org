Recently more and more cloud service providers (e.g., Microsoft, Google, and Amazon) have commercialized their well-trained deep learning models by providing limited access via web API interfaces. However, it is shown that these APIs are susceptible to model inversion attacks, where attackers can recover the training data with high fidelity, which may cause serious privacy leakage.Existing defenses against model inversion attacks, however, hinder the model performance and are ineffective for more advanced attacks, e.g., Mirror [4]. In this paper, we proposed NetGuard, a novel utility-aware defense methodology against model inversion attacks (MIAs). Unlike previous works that perturb prediction outputs of the victim model, we propose to mislead the MIA effort by inserting engineered fake samples during the training process. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is carefully built to construct fake training samples to mislead the attack model without degrading the performance of the victim model. Besides, we adopt continual learning to further improve the utility of the victim model. Extensive experiments on CelebA, VGG-Face, and VGG-Face2 datasets show that NetGuard is superior to existing defenses, including DP [37] and Ad-mi [32] on state-of-the-art model inversion attacks, i.e., DMI [8], Mirror [4], Privacy [12], and Alignment [34].
