We present a fast collision checking/avoidance algorithm for collaborative robot arms that work in close proximity. We formulate forward kinematics and separating distance function using DH convention and Taylor models (the tight enclosure of a function), and then compute their tight bounds for determining interference between robot arms. Our algorithm allows the collaborative robot arms to perform fine and dexterous tasks in close spatial proximity.
