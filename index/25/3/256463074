Digital contact tracing is an effective solution to prevent such a pandemic, but the low adoption rate of a required mobile app hinders its effectiveness. A large collection of cellular trajectories from mobile subscribers can be an out-of-the-box solution that is free from the low adoption issue, but has been overlooked due to its low spatial resolution. In this paper, to increase the resolution of this cellular trajectory, we present a new problem that estimates the userâ€™s visited places at the point-of-interest(POI) level, which we call POI-level cellular trajectory reconstruction. We propose a novel algorithm, Pincette, that accomplishes more accurate POI reconstruction by leveraging various external data such as road networks and POI contexts. Specifically, Pincette comprises multi-view feature extraction and GCN-LSTM-based POI estimation. In the multi-view feature extraction, Pincette extracts three complementary features from three views: efficiency, periodicity, and popularity. In the GCN-LSTM-based POI estimation, these three views are seamlessly integrated, where spatio-temporal periodic patterns are captured by graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and an LSTM. With extensive experiments on two real data collections of two cities, we show that Pincette outperforms four POI estimation baselines by up to 21.20%. We believe that our work sheds light on the use of cellular trajectories for digital contact tracing. We release the source code at https://github.com/kaist-dmlab/Pincette.
