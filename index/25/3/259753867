Deep metric learning aims to learn a feature space that models the similarity between images, and feature normalization is a critical step for boosting performance. However directly optimizing L2-normalized softmax loss cause the network to fail to converge. Therefore some SOTA approaches appends a scale layer after the inner product to relieve the convergence problem, but it incurs a new problem that it's difficult to learn the best scaling parameters. In this letter, we look into the characteristic of softmax-based approaches and propose a novel learning objective function Stop-Gradient Softmax Loss (SGSL) to solve the convergence problem in softmax-based deep metric learning with L2-normalization. In addition, we found a useful trick named Remove the last BN-ReLU (RBR). It removes the last BN-ReLU in the backbone to reduce the learning burden of the model.
Experimental results on four fine-grained image retrieval benchmarks show that our proposed approach outperforms most existing approaches, i.e., our approach achieves 75.9% on CUB-200-2011, 94.7% on CARS196 and 83.1% on SOP which outperforms other approaches at least 1.7%, 2.9% and 1.7% on Recall@1.
