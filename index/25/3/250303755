Modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been used to solve problems that many humans struggle to solve. This opens up new opportunities for knowledge discovery and education. We demonstrate ALLURE, an educational AI system for learning to solve the Rubik’s cube that is designed to help students improve their problem solving skills. ALLURE can both find and explain its own strategies for solving the Rubik’s cube as well as build on user-provided strategies. Collaboration between AI and user happens using visual and natural language modalities.
