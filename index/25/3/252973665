Statistical 3D shape models of the head, hands, and fullbody are widely used in computer vision and graphics. Despite their wide use, we show that existing models of the head and hands fail to capture the full range of motion for these parts. Moreover, existing work largely ignores the feet, which are crucial for modeling human movement and have applications in biomechanics, animation, and the footwear industry. The problem is that previous body part models are trained using 3D scans that are isolated to the individual parts. Such data does not capture the full range of motion for such parts, e.g. the motion of head relative to the neck. Our observation is that full-body scans provide important information about the motion of the body parts. Consequently, we propose a new learning scheme that jointly trains a full-body model and specific part models using a federated dataset of full-body and body-part scans. Specifically, we train an expressive human body model called SUPR (Sparse Unified Part-Based Human Representation), where each joint strictly influences a sparse set of model vertices. The factorized representation enables separating SUPR into an entire suite of body part models. Note that the feet have received little attention and existing 3D body models have highly under-actuated feet. Using novel 4D scans of feet, we train a model with an extended kinematic tree that captures the range of motion of the toes. Additionally, feet deform due to ground contact. To model this, we include a novel non-linear deformation function that predicts foot deformation conditioned on the foot pose, shape, and ground contact. We train SUPR on an unprecedented number of scans: 1.2 million body, head, hand and foot scans. We quantitatively compare SUPR and the separated body parts and find that our suite of models generalizes better than existing models. SUPR is available at http://supr.is.tue.mpg.de
