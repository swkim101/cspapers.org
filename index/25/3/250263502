The entertainment industry, as well as the field of Computer Graphics, frequently faces the issue of creating large virtual crowds that would populate a scene. One of the ways to achieve that, particularly with modern rendering techniques, is by using simulation -- this, however, is nontrivial to design and control. The main goal of my PhD work is working towards the creation of a tool enabling the creation of virtual crowds that one can interact with, and we believe the best way to that is through Multiagent Reinforcement Learning techniques. These animated crowds can then be used both in movies and video games. Especially for the latter, it is highly desirable that both the crowd as a whole, as well as the individual characters, can react to the user's input in real time.
