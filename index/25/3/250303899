The StoryQ environment provides an intuitive graphical user interface for middle and high school students to create features from unstructured text data and train and test classification models using logistic regression. StoryQ runs in a web browser, is free and requires no installation. AI concepts addressed include: features, weights, accuracy, training, bias, error analysis and cross validation. Using the software in conjunction with curriculum currently under development is expected to lead to student understanding of machine learning concepts and workflow; developing the ability to use domain knowledge and basic linguistics to identify, create, analyze, and evaluate features; becoming aware of and appreciating the roles and responsibilities of AI developers;. This paper will consist of an online demo with a brief video walkthrough.
