Untrusted hardware supply chains enable malicious , powerful , and permanent alterations to processors known as hardware trojans. Such hardware trojans can undermine any software-enforced security policies deployed on top of the hardware. Existing defenses target a select set of hardware components, speciﬁcally those that implement hardware-enforced security mechanisms such as cryptographic cores, user/kernel privilege isolation, and memory protections. We observe that computing systems exercise general purpose processor logic to implement software-enforced security policies. This makes general purpose logic security critical since tampering with it could violate software-based security policies. Leveraging this insight, we develop a novel class of hardware trojans, which we dub Jinn trojans, that corrupt general-purpose hardware and can hide in many places within a processor to enable ﬂexible and powerful high level attacks. Jinn trojans deactivate compiler-based security-enforcement mechanisms, making type-safe software vulnerable to memory-safety by compromising a single bit of architectural state. We show that Jinn trojans are effective even when planted in general purpose hardware, disjoint from any hardware-enforced security components. We show that protecting hardware-enforced security logic is insufﬁcient to keep a system secure from hardware trojans.
