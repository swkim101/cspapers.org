Mobile extended reality (XR) has developed rapidly in recent years. Compared with the app-based XR, XR in web browsers has the advantages of being lightweight and cross-platform, providing users with a pervasive experience. Therefore, many frameworks are emerging to support the development of XR in web browsers. However, little has been known about how well these frameworks perform and how complex XR apps modern web browsers can support on mobile devices. To fill the knowledge gap, in this paper, we conduct an empirical study of mobile XR in web browsers. We select seven most popular web-based XR frameworks and investigate their runtime performance, including 3D rendering, camera capturing, and real-world understanding. We find that current frameworks have the potential to further enhance their performance by increasing GPU utilization or improving computing parallelism. Besides, for 3D scenes with good rendering performance, developers can feel free to add camera capturing with little influence on performance to support augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) applications. Based on our findings, we draw several practical implications to provide better XR support in web browsers.
