In the absence of an absolute positioning system, such as GPS, autonomous vehicles are subject to accumu-lation of positional error which can interfere with reliable performance. Improved navigational accuracy without GPS enables vehicles to achieve a higher degree of autonomy and reliability, both in terms of decision making and safety. This paper details the use of two navigation systems for autonomous agents using magnetic field anomalies to localize themselves within a map; both techniques use the information content in the environment in distinct ways and are aimed at reducing the localization uncertainty. The first method is based on a nonlinear observability metric of the vehicle model, while the second is an information theory based technique which minimizes the expected entropy of the system. These conditions are used to design guidance laws that minimize the localization uncertainty and are verified both in simulation and hardware experiments are presented for the observability approach.
