The present document addresses the selection method of optimal values (geometric dimensions) of the Engine Air Particle Separator (EAPS) parameters in aviation gas turbine engines (GTE). The methodology includes six main steps. The choice of these optimal values is carried out taking into account three particular criteria for the EAPS efficiency: the degree of air purification, pressure loss and mass. The EAPS parameters are selected using the Pareto method.
