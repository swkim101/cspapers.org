In this article, we propose a deep learning frame-work that provides a unified approach to the problem of leg contact detection in humanoid robot walking gaits. Our formulation accomplishes to accurately and robustly estimate the contact state probability for each leg (i.e., stable or slip/no contact). The proposed framework employs solely propriocep-tive sensing and although it relies on simulated ground-truth contact data for the classification process, we demonstrate that it generalizes across varying friction surfaces and different legged robotic platforms and, at the same time, is readily transferred from simulation to practice. The framework is quantitatively and qualitatively assessed in simulation via the use of ground-truth contact data and is contrasted against state-of-the-art methods with an ATLAS, a NAO, and a TALOS humanoid robot. Furthermore, its efficacy is demonstrated in base estimation with a real TALOS humanoid. To reinforce further research endeavors, our implementation is offered as an open-source ROS/Python package, coined Legged Contact Detection (LCD).
