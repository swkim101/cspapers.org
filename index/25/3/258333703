Socioeconomic indicators reflect location status from various aspects such as demographics, economy, crime and land usage, which play an important role in the understanding of location-based social networks (LBSNs). Especially, several existing works leverage multi-source data for socioeconomic indicator prediction in LBSNs, which however fail to capture semantic information as well as distil comprehensive knowledge therein. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG), which distils semantic knowledge from multi-source data, has been popular in recent LBSN research, which inspires us to introduce KG for socioeconomic indicator prediction in LBSNs. Specifically, we first construct a location-based KG (LBKG) to integrate various kinds of knowledge from heterogeneous LBSN data, including locations and other related elements like point of interests (POIs), business areas as well as various relationships between them, such as spatial proximity and functional similarity. Then we propose a hierarchical KG learning model to capture both global knowledge from LBKG and domain knowledge from several sub-KGs. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate our modelâ€™s superiority over state-of-the-art methods in socioeconomic indicators prediction.
