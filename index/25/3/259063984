Interatomic potentials learned using machine learning methods have been successfully applied to atomistic simulations. However, deep learning pipelines are notoriously data-hungry, while generating reference calculations is computationally demanding. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a transfer learning algorithm that leverages the ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) in describing chemical environments, together with kernel mean embeddings. We extract a feature map from GNNs pre-trained on the OC20 dataset and use it to learn the potential energy surface from system-specific datasets of catalytic processes. Our method is further enhanced by a flexible kernel function that incorporates chemical species information, resulting in improved performance and interpretability. We test our approach on a series of realistic datasets of increasing complexity, showing excellent generalization and transferability performance, and improving on methods that rely on GNNs or ridge regression alone, as well as similar fine-tuning approaches. We make the code available to the community at https://github.com/IsakFalk/atomistic_transfer_mekrr.
