Traffic flow imputation provides a more-complete view of traffic flows, and thus is a fundamental function in building Intelligent Transportation Systems. The performance of traffic flow imputation has a big impact on a wide range of downstream applications, such as traffic forecasting and control. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Multi-grAph Convolutional Recurrent netwOrk (MACRO) framework for supporting fine-grained lane-level traffic flow imputation, which can help to reconstruct more complete traffic flows at the lane level. Specifically, we first design a spatial dependency module to model the diversified spatial correlations within traffic flows, where multi-relation graphs are first constructed to consider correlations from various perspective, then a multi-graph convolution neural network is proposed to capture the integrated spatial dependencies of traffic flows and adequately propagate the observed traffic values to mitigate data sparsity problem from spatial domain. Also, to handle the temporally continuous data missing issue, we adopt a modified bi-directional recurrent neural network to capture traffic flowsâ€™ temporal dependencies by considering both historical and future information, and employ a temporal decay mechanism to control the irregular information transfer between adjacent time slices. Moreover, a spatio-temporal knowledge integration module is devised to comprehensively integrate multi-resolution spatiotemporal knowledge for traffic flow imputation. Finally, extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the performance of MACRO outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines with respect to traffic flow imputation.
