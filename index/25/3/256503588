In practical compressed sensing (CS), the obtained measurements typically necessitate quantization to a limited number of bits prior to transmission or storage. This nonlinear quantization process poses significant recovery challenges, particularly with extreme coarse quantization such as 1-bit. Recently, an efficient algorithm called QCS-SGM was proposed for quantized CS (QCS) which utilizes score-based generative models (SGM) as an implicit prior. Due to the adeptness of SGM in capturing the intricate structures of natural signals, QCS-SGM substantially outperforms previous QCS methods. However, QCS-SGM is constrained to (approximately) row-orthogonal sensing matrices as the computation of the likelihood score becomes intractable otherwise. To address this limitation, we introduce an advanced variant of QCS-SGM, termed QCS-SGM+, capable of handling general matrices effectively. The key idea is a Bayesian inference perspective on the likelihood score computation, wherein expectation propagation is employed for its approximate computation. Extensive experiments are conducted, demonstrating the substantial superiority of QCS-SGM+ over QCS-SGM for general sensing matrices beyond mere row-orthogonality.
