Intercorporate investment has a large impact in financial performance and long-term development of a corporate. Among all the concerns for a company â€™s investment strategy, complementary and substitutable investments are two fundamental factors. However, these two relations are implicit and entangled in the complex corporate network, requiring extra caution before investment. To this end, in this paper, we proposed a novel graph convolutional network called Series-Parallel decomposed Graph Convolutional Network (SPGCN). We first decompose the complementary and substitutable relations as two information propagating directions in company dependency graph, producing multifaceted node features. Then, with an Attentive Aggregation Module, we are able to further measure the impact of both features to the final investment decision making, producing an interpretable analysis for investment strategy. Finally, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset, to show the effectiveness of decomposing two concerns on investment recommendation task. With visualization and case studies, our method also shows great potential to help understand and conduct complementary and substitutable investment decisions. We open source our code to support future research: https://github.com/lem0n1e/SPGCN.
