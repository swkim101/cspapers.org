As an important stage in machine learning pipeline, feature selection techniques are mainly used to improve the generalization performance and training efficiency of machine learning model, but few works have focused on the robustness of machine learning models from the perspective of feature selection when dealing with adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose the adversarial training (AT) based feature selection framework, i.e. AT based feature selection, to improve the robustness of machine learning model built on the feature selection result, which is inspired by using adversarial training to improve the robustness of deep learning model. AT based feature selection framework is the combination of adversarial training with some traditional feature selection algorithm, which can be divided into AT in-processing and AT post-processing feature selection. On the other hand, stability is also a very important property for feature selection. Then we experimentally analyze the relationship between robustness and stability of AT based feature selection, especially theoretically analyze the stability of $\ell_{2}$ regularized AT in-processing feature selection algorithm in two different adversarial training forms. Our experimental results on benchmark data sets show that AT based feature selection algorithm is effective to improve the robustness of machine learning model, however, obtain lower stability than corresponding feature selection model without AT.
