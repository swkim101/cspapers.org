We propose a decentralized control algorithm for a minimalistic robotic swarm with limited capabilities such that the desired global behavior emerges. We consider the problem of searching for and encapsulating various targets present in the environment while avoiding collisions with both static and dynamic obstacles. The novelty of this work is the guaranteed generation of desired complex swarm behavior with constrained individual robots which have no memory, no localization, and no knowledge of the exact relative locations of their neighbors. Moreover, we analyze how the emergent behavior changes with different parameters of the task, noise in the sensor reading, and asynchronous execution.
