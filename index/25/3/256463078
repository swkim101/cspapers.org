As a promising learning paradigm for addressing the data scarcity and distribution mismatch issues, cross-domain prediction aims to leverage the transferable knowledge from the source domain to solve the learning problems in the target domain. Indeed, many urban computing tasks, such as cross- city/mode traffic flow prediction, have to face the severe data scarcity problem due to the heterogeneity in different data sources as well as the imbalanced development among cities. To this end, in this paper, we propose a cross-domain learning framework, namely CCMHC, which exploits Hierarchical Correlation between domains for Cross-City cross-Mode traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we first measure the correlation among inter-city traffic flows by exploring the similarity of region functions and road-networks. In this step, we filter out the regions with lower transfer ability from the source city to the target city. Then, we calculate the temporal correlations of traffic flows across different modes to select a source region that is highly related to the target region in a dynamic way. Moreover, a cross-domain urban flow prediction method is devised by transferring shared knowledge from the source city to the target city. Finally, experimental results on real-world data demonstrate the superiority of CCMHC over the state-of-the-art transfer learning methods. In addition, the generalization ability of the CCMHC framework on different neural network-based models is also validated.
