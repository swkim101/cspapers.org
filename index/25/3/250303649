In this work, we focus on a very practical problem: image segmentation under rain conditions. Image deraining is a classic low-level restoration task, while image segmentation is a typical high-level understanding task. Most of the existing methods intuitively employ the bottom-up paradigm by taking deraining as a preprocessing step for subsequent segmentation. However, our statistical analysis indicates that not only deraining would benefit segmentation (bottom-up), but also segmentation would further improve deraining performance (top-down) in turn. This motivates us to solve the rainy image segmentation task within a novel top-down and bottom-up unified paradigm, in which two sub-tasks are alternatively performed and collaborated with each other. Specifically, the bottom-up procedure yields both clearer images and rain-robust features from both image and feature domains, so as to ease the segmentation ambiguity caused by rain streaks. The top-down procedure adopts semantics to adaptively guide the restoration for different contents via a novel multi-path semantic attentive module (SAM). Thus the deraining and segmentation could boost the performance of each other cooperatively and progressively. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art on rainy image segmentation.
