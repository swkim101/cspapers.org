Denoising is a crucial step for hyperspectral image (HSI) applications. Though witnessing the great power of deep learning, existing HSI denoising methods suffer from limitations in capturing the nonlocal self-similarity. Trans-formers have shown potential in capturing longrange de-pendencies, but few attempts have been made with specifically designed Transformer to model the spatial and spec-tral correlation in HSIs. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a spectral enhanced rectangle Trans-former, driving it to explore the nonlocal spatial similarity and global spectral low-rank property of HSIs. For the former, we exploit the rectangle self-attention horizontally and vertically to capture the nonlocal similarity in the spatial domain. For the latter, we design a spectral enhancement module that is capable of extracting global underlying low-rank property of spatial-spectral cubes to suppress noise, while enabling the interactions among non-overlapping spatial rectangles. Extensive experiments have been conducted on both synthetic noisy HSIs and real noisy HSIs, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method in terms of both objective metric and subjective visual quality.
