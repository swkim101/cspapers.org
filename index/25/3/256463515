Topological Data Analysis (TDA) utilizes concepts from topology to analyze data. In general, TDA considers objects similar based on a topological invariant. Topological invariants are properties of the topological space that are homeomorphic; resilient to deformation in the space. The Euler-Poincar√© Characteristic is a classic topological invariant that represents the alternating sum of the vertices, edges, faces, and higherorder cells of a closed surface. Tracking the Euler characteristic over a topological filtration produces an Euler Characteristic Curve (ECC). This study introduces a computational technique to determine the ECC of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ or $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ data; the technique generalizes to higher dimensions. This technique separates landscapes of lowerorder homologies utilizing triangulations of the space.
