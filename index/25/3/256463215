Most existing recommendation research has been concentrated on unidirectional recommendation, i.e. only recommending items to users. However, in many real-world scenarios, the platform needs to achieve bi-directional recommendation. For example, in an online recruitment scenario, the recommender system not only needs to recommend positions to candidates, but also recommend candidates to enterprises. In this paper, we first formalize a new recommendation problem called bi-directional recommendation and contribute a new bidirectional recommendation model named BiROR (Bi-directional Recommendation for Online Recruitment). In BiROR, an encoder component is utilized to learn the text embeddings, and a graph learning component is designed to learn the graph embeddings. In addition, a multi-task learning framework is designed to achieve bi-directional recommendation. In the multi-task learning framework, we share the text embeddings and graph embeddings to alleviate the problems of data sparsity and data asymmetry in online recruitment. Extensive experiments in a real-world task show that BiROR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, verifying the effectiveness of the designs of our model.
