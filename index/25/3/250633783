Domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer the knowledge of a well-labeled source domain to facilitate unlabeled target learning. When turning to specific tasks such as indoor (Wi-Fi) localization, it is essential to learn a cross-domain regressor to mitigate the domain shift. This paper proposes a novel method Adversarial Bi-Regressor Network (ABRNet) to seek more effective cross- domain regression model. Specifically, a discrepant bi-regressor architecture is developed to maximize the difference of bi-regressor to discover uncertain target instances far from the source distribution, and then an adversarial training mechanism is adopted between feature extractor and dual regressors to produce domain-invariant representations. To further bridge the large domain gap, a domain- specific augmentation module is designed to synthesize two source-similar and target-similar inter- mediate domains to gradually eliminate the original domain mismatch. The empirical studies on two cross-domain regressive benchmarks illustrate the power of our method on solving the domain adaptive regression (DAR) problem.
