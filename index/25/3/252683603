Learning generative image models from various domains efficiently needs transferring knowledge from an image synthesis model trained on a large dataset. We present a recipe for learning vision transformers by generative knowledge transfer. We base our framework on generative vision transformers representing an image as a sequence of visual tokens with the autoregressive or non-autoregressive transformers. To adapt to a new domain, we employ prompt tuning, which prepends learnable tokens called prompts to the image token sequence and introduces a new prompt design for our task. We study on a variety of visual domains with varying amounts of training images. We show the effectiveness of knowledge transfer and a significantly better image generation quality.11https://github.com/google-research/generative_transfer
