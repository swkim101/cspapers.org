In 2021, the U.S. Hispanic population totaled 62.5 million people, 68% of whom spoke Spanish in their homes. To date, it is unclear which political advertisers address this audience in their preferred language, and whether they do so differently than for English-speaking audiences. In this work, we study differences between political Facebook ads in English and Spanish during 2020, the latest U.S. presidential election. Political advertisers spent $ 1.48 B in English, but only $ 28.8 M in Spanish, disproportionately little compared to the share of Spanish speakers in the population. We further find a lower proportion of election-related advertisers (which additionally are more liberal-leaning than in the English set), and a higher proportion of government agencies in the set of Spanish ads. We perform multilingual topic classification, finding that the most common ad topics in English were also present in Spanish, but to a different extent, and with a different composition of advertisers. Thus, Spanish speakers are served different types of ads from different types of advertisers than English speakers, and in lower amounts; these results raise the question of whether political communication through Facebook ads may be inequitable and effectively disadvantaging the sizeable minority of Spanish speakers in the U.S. population.
