Machine Learning (ML) has been widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. A fundamental assumption in ML is that training data and real-world data should follow a similar distribution. However, a deployed ML model may suffer from out-of-distribution (OOD) issues due to distribution shifts in the real-world data. Though many algorithms have been proposed to detect OOD data from text corpora, there is still a lack of interactive tool support for ML developers. In this work, we propose DeepLens, an interactive system that helps users detect and explore OOD issues in massive text corpora. Users can efficiently explore different OOD types in DeepLens with the help of a text clustering method. Users can also dig into a specific text by inspecting salient words highlighted through neuron activation analysis. In a within-subjects user study with 24 participants, participants using DeepLens were able to find nearly twice more types of OOD issues accurately with 22% more confidence compared with a variant of DeepLens that has no interaction or visualization support.
