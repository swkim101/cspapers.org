Language models have been shown to be very effective in predicting brain recordings of subjects experiencing complex language stimuli. For a deeper understanding of this alignment, it is important to understand the alignment between the detailed processing of linguistic information by the human brain versus language models. In NLP, linguistic probing tasks have revealed a hierarchy of information processing in neural language models that progresses from simple to complex with an increase in depth. On the other hand, in neuroscience, the strongest alignment with high-level language brain regions has consistently been observed in the middle layers. These findings leave an open question as to what linguistic information actually underlies the observed alignment between brains and language models. We investigate this question via a direct approach, in which we eliminate information related to specific linguistic properties in the language model representations and observe how this intervention affects the alignment with fMRI brain recordings obtained while participants listened to a story. We investigate a range of linguistic properties (surface, syntactic and semantic) and find that the elimination of each one results in a significant decrease in brain alignment across all layers of a language model. These findings provide direct evidence for the role of specific linguistic information in the alignment between brain and language models, and opens new avenues for mapping the joint information processing in both systems.
