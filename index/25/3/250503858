Large-area and high-precision tactile sensing information can not only improve the stability of robot grasping but also compensate for the lack of visual information in specific environments such as turbid underwater, dimness, and smoke. In this paper, we devise a universal jamming gripper with high-quality tactile sensing capability. The gripper adopts the particle jamming mechanism for grasping, and simultaneously uses a built-in camera to detect the deformation of its surface to obtain tactile information. To make the inside of the gripper transparent, glass beads and liquid with the same refractive index are applied as the internal filling. Besides, special treatments are taken to improve the tactile perception resolution of the gripper. The design perfectly merges visual-based tactile sensing into the traditional universal jamming gripper without changing its original gripping performance, making it possible for simultaneous grasping and sensing. To verify the tactile perception and grasping ability of the gripper in specific environments, we design two underwater experiments for grasping and pipe leak detection based on tactile information. Both have achieved a success rate not less than 95%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed gripper for manipulation in low visibility environments.
