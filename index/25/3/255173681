This paper proposes novel passive-dynamic walk-ers formed by two cross-shaped frames and eight viscoelastic elements. Since it is a combination of two four-legged rimless wheels via viscoelastic elements, we call it viscoelastically-combined rimless wheel (VCRW). Two types of VCRWs consisting of different cross-shaped frames are introduced; one is formed by combining two Greek-cross-shaped frames (VCRW1), and the other is formed by combining two-link cross-shaped frames that can rotate freely around the central axis (VCRW2). First, we describe the model assumptions and equations of motion and collision. Second, we numerically analyze the basic gait properties of passive dynamic walking. Furthermore, we consider an activation of VCRW2 for gen-erating a stable level gait, and discuss the significance of the study as a novel walking support device.
