Given a graph with edges colored red or blue and an integer $k$, the exact perfect matching problem asks if there exists a perfect matching with exactly $k$ red edges. There exists a randomized polylogarithmic-time parallel algorithm to solve this problem, dating back to the eighties, but no deterministic polynomial-time algorithm is known, even for bipartite graphs. In this paper we show that there is no sub-exponential sized linear program that can describe the convex hull of exact matchings in bipartite graphs. In fact, we prove something stronger, that there is no sub-exponential sized linear program to describe the convex hull of perfect matchings with an odd number of red edges.
