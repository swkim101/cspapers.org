Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models, which are reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, we investigate whether they can acquire discriminative representations for classification via generative pre-training. This paper shows that the networks in diffusion models, namely denoising diffusion autoencoders (DDAE), are unified self-supervised learners: by pre-training on unconditional image generation, DDAE has already learned strongly linear-separable representations within its intermediate layers without auxiliary encoders, thus making diffusion pre-training emerge as a general approach for generative-and-discriminative dual learning. To validate this, we conduct linear probe and finetuning evaluations. Our diffusion-based approach achieves 95.9% and 50.0% linear evaluation accuracies on CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively, and is comparable to contrastive learning and masked autoencoders for the first time. Transfer learning from ImageNet also confirms the suitability of DDAE for Vision Transformers, suggesting the potential to scale DDAEs as unified foundation models.
