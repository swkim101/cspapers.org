In this work, we present ICEBOAT an interactive tool that enables automotive UX experts to explore how users interact with In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVISs). Based on large naturalistic driving data continuously collected from production line vehicles, ICEBOAT visualizes driversâ€™ interactions and driving behavior on different levels of detail. Hence, it allows to easily compare different user flows based on performance- and safety-related metrics.
