The shift from vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE) to fully Electric Vehicles (EVs) is happening at a rapid pace. To be competitive with ICEs and ensure a smooth rollout, the charging process of EVs needs to be as fast and convenient as possible. Modern DC fast-charging standards achieve this by implementing a high-level charging communication (HLC), which enables a safe, efficient, and convenient charging experience. However, with the introduction of and reliance on HLC, the security of the communication becomes essential. As we have recently shown, the PLC-based charging communication used by the Combined Charging System (CCS) is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack. The attack, named Brokenwire, exploits the CSMA/CA medium access mechanism and relies on continuously broadcasting a preamble to force the communication participants to back off to prevent interference. In this demonstration, we present an end-to-end approach for conducting the novel Brokenwire attack. We present the architecture of our software pipeline and demonstrate how it allows an adversary to capture and transmit the attack signal with just one click.
