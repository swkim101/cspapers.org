Taking a justice-oriented approach to equity in Computer Science (CS) education, this paper questions the dominant discourse in CS education and asks what truly makes CS learning consequential from the perspective of youth. We define CS learning as consequential by focusing on its transformative impact on youth identity, agency, and perceptions of the world within and beyond CS classrooms, regardless of whether or not they pursue CS in the future. Our research-practice partnership used qualitative data, specifically longitudinal interview data with 30 students up to three years after they first experienced a high school CS class in a large public school district on the west coast serving majority Latinx, urban, low-income students. Our findings suggest that in order for CS learning to be meaningful and consequential for youth, learning must involve: 1) the freedom for youth to express their interests, passions, and concerns; 2) opportunities for youth to expand their views of CS and self in the world; and 3) teacher care for students, learning community, and subject matter. The findings have significant implications for the broader "CS for All" movement and future efforts to reform policy agendas aiming for a more justice-centered CS education.
