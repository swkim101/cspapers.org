The rapid expansion of robotics relies on properly configuring and testing hardware and software. Due to the expense and hazard of real-world testing on hardware, robot system testing increasingly utilizes extensive simulation. Creating robot simulation tests requires specialized skills in robot programming and simulation tools. While there are many platforms and tool-kits to create these simulations, they can be cumbersome when combined with automated testing. We present Maktub: a tool for creating tests using Unity and ROS. Maktub leverages the extensive 3D manipulation capabilities of Unity to lower the barrier in creating system tests for robots. A key idea of Maktub is to make tests without needing robotic software development skills. A video demonstration of Maktub can be found here: https://youtu.be/c0Bacy3DlEE, and the source code can be found at https://github.com/RobotCodeLab/Maktub.
