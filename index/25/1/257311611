As innovative classrooms start integrating new educational media, most informatics educators rely on classic computer rooms. Even though computers might still be seen as the main tool for representing and processing information, contemporary classrooms should include a variety of media to enable theoretical and hands-on approaches alike, and collaborative learning settings. To design the Engaging Computer Science Education Laboratory (ECSE Lab) at the Goethe University Frankfurt, we conducted a mixed-methods study on how future Computer Science classrooms should be designed according to 33 informatics preservice teachers and how such a didactical laboratory can support teacher education. The quantitative questionnaire results show that: 1) While the computer remains the most preferred tool, preservice teachers would like Computer Science Education classrooms to be equipped with a variety of other analog and digital media. 2) Different topics of Computer Science Education require diverse media uses. 3) Even though opinions differ regarding the ideal seating arrangements, more than half of the students prefer group settings. A qualitative data analysis from an open padlet indicates that the uses of such a didactical laboratory comprise especially experimenting with media, realizing new ideas for teaching practices, preparing classes, studying, and the use as a seminar room. Practical implications from these results are: The ECSE Lab (see Figure 1) will be equipped with a variety of analog media (whiteboards, a moderation kit, craft materials) and digital media (stationary computers, a projector, interactive whiteboards, laptops, microcontrollers, tablets, smartphones, cameras) as well as flexible furniture to allow situation-based settings.
