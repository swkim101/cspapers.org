Application development for the modern Web involves sophisticated engineering workflows which include user interface aspects. Those involve Web elements typically created with HTML/CSS markup and JavaScript-like languages, yielding Web documents. WebMonitor leverages requirements formally specified in a logic able to capture both the layout of visual components as well as how they change over time, as a user interacts with them. Then, requirements are verified upon arbitrary web pages, allowing for automated support for a wide set of use cases in interaction testing and simulation. We position WebMonitor within a developer workflow, where in case of a negative result, a visual counterexample is returned. The monitoring framework we present follows a black-box approach, and as such is independent of the underlying technologies a Web application may be developed with, as well as the browser and operating system used.
