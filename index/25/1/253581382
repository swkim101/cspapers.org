The superior performance of modern deep networks usually comes with a costly training procedure. This paper presents a new curriculum learning approach for the efficient training of visual backbones (e.g., vision Transformers). Our work is inspired by the inherent learning dynamics of deep networks: we experimentally show that at an earlier training stage, the model mainly learns to recognize some ‘easier-to-learn’ discriminative patterns within each example, e.g., the lower-frequency components of images and the original information before data augmentation. Driven by this phenomenon, we propose a curriculum where the model always leverages all the training data at each epoch, while the curriculum starts with only exposing the ‘easier-to-learn’ patterns of each example, and introduces gradually more difficult patterns. To implement this idea, we 1) introduce a cropping operation in the Fourier spectrum of the inputs, which enables the model to learn from only the lower-frequency components efficiently, 2) demonstrate that exposing the features of original images amounts to adopting weaker data augmentation, and 3) integrate 1) and 2) and design a curriculum learning schedule with a greedy-search algorithm. The resulting approach, EfficientTrain, is simple, general, yet surprisingly effective. As an off-the-shelf method, it reduces the wall-time training cost of a wide variety of popular models (e.g., ResNet, ConvNeXt, DeiT, PVT, Swin, and CSWin) by > 1.5× on ImageNet-1K/22K without sacrificing accuracy. It is also effective for self-supervised learning (e.g., MAE). Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/EfficientTrain.
