This paper considers the problem of learning a single ReLU neuron with squared loss (a.k.a., ReLU regression) in the overparameterized regime, where the input dimension can exceed the number of samples. We analyze a Perceptron-type algorithm called GLM-tron (Kakade et al., 2011) and provide its dimension-free risk upper bounds for high-dimensional ReLU regression in both well-specified and misspecified settings. Our risk bounds recover several existing results as special cases. Moreover, in the well-specified setting, we provide an instance-wise matching risk lower bound for GLM-tron. Our upper and lower risk bounds provide a sharp characterization of the high-dimensional ReLU regression problems that can be learned via GLM-tron. On the other hand, we provide some negative results for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for ReLU regression with symmetric Bernoulli data: if the model is well-specified, the excess risk of SGD is provably no better than that of GLM-tron ignoring constant factors, for each problem instance; and in the noiseless case, GLM-tron can achieve a small risk while SGD unavoidably suffers from a constant risk in expectation. These results together suggest that GLM-tron might be preferable to SGD for high-dimensional ReLU regression.
