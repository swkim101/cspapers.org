In the context of problem sets in first- and second-year computer science theory courses, we investigate the factors influencing students' decisions to work individually or in a small group. Through analysis of open-ended survey responses from over 1,300 students, we have gained a more nuanced understanding of these factors. We observed three categories of factors: workload and time management, optimizing learning and assignment marks, and social and affective factors. We identified two modifiers, online learning and previous group experiences, that amplify the impact of factors in the three main categories. We highlight notable student quotations and discuss barriers to group formation.
