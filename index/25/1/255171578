This work presents the automatic design of additively manufacturable serially linked one degree of freedom manipulators whose end effectors move along individually prescribed 2D trajectories. The kinematic coupling of the links is done by using gear stages consisting of spur gears and toothed belt gears. The basic design parameters of these mechanisms are determined using a Fourier series. The calculated Fourier elements with their respective frequency, amplitude and phase are interpreted as rotating 2D vectors which represent the manipulator links. Based on this, the kinematic coupling of the links is calculated and the corresponding gears are designed. All parts of these mechanisms, including the toothed belts, can be manufactured using a low cost 3D printing process. The software for the automated design of these manipulators from Fourier decomposition to CAD file generation has been implemented in MATLAB. To validate the automated design process, various test mechanisms were manufactured and examined for accuracy and precision.
