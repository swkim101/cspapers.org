Training generally capable agents that thoroughly explore their environment and learn new and diverse skills is a long-term goal of robot learning. Quality Diversity Reinforcement Learning (QD-RL) is an emerging research area that blends the best aspects of both fields -- Quality Diversity (QD) provides a principled form of exploration and produces collections of behaviorally diverse agents, while Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a powerful performance improvement operator enabling generalization across tasks and dynamic environments. Existing QD-RL approaches have been constrained to sample efficient, deterministic off-policy RL algorithms and/or evolution strategies, and struggle with highly stochastic environments. In this work, we, for the first time, adapt on-policy RL, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to the Differentiable Quality Diversity (DQD) framework and propose additional improvements over prior work that enable efficient optimization and discovery of novel skills on challenging locomotion tasks. Our new algorithm, Proximal Policy Gradient Arborescence (PPGA), achieves state-of-the-art results, including a 4x improvement in best reward over baselines on the challenging humanoid domain.
