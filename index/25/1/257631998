This paper explores interactive facial image editing via dialogue and introduces the ChatEdit benchmark dataset for evaluating image editing and conversation abilities in this context. ChatEdit is constructed from the CelebA-HQ dataset, incorporating annotated multi-turn dialogues corresponding to user edit requests on the images. The dataset is challenging, as it requires the system to dynamically track user requests, edit images, and generate appropriate responses. Accordingly, we propose three benchmark tasks: (i) user edit request tracking, (ii) image editing, and (iii) response generation. We present a novel baseline framework that integrates a dialogue module for both tracking user requests and generating responses and an image editing module for image editing. Unlike previous approaches, our framework directly tracks user edit requests from the entire dialogue history up to the current turn and modifies the original image rather than adjusting the previous turn's output, thereby reducing error accumulation and preventing attribute forgetfulness. Extensive experiments on the ChatEdit dataset underline our framework's superior performance against prior models, while also highlighting potential room for further research. We will release the code and data publicly to facilitate advancements in complex interactive facial image editing.
