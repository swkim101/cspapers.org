Estimating keypoint scale and orientation is crucial to extracting invariant features under significant geometric changes. Recently, the estimators based on self-supervised learning have been designed to adapt to complex imaging conditions. Such learning-based estimators generally predict a single scalar for the keypoint scale or orientation, called hard estimators. However, hard estimators are difficult to handle the local patches containing structures of different objects or multiple edges. In this paper, a Soft Self-Supervised Estimator (S3Esti) is proposed to overcome this problem by learning to predict multiple scales and orientations. S3Esti involves three core factors. First, the estimator is constructed to predict the discrete distributions of scales and orientations. The elements with high confidence will be kept as the final scales and orientations. Second, a probabilistic covariant loss is proposed to improve the consistency of the scale and orientation distributions under different transformations. Third, an optimization algorithm is designed to minimize the loss function, whose convergence is proved in theory. When combined with different keypoint extraction models, S3Esti generally improves over 50% accuracy in image matching tasks under significant viewpoint changes. In the 3D reconstruction task, S3Esti decreases more than 10% reprojection error and improves the number of registered images. [code release]
