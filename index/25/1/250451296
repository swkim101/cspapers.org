Few-shot action recognition aims to recognize novel action classes using only a small number of labeled training samples. In this work, we propose a novel approach that first summarizes each video into compound prototypes consisting of a group of global prototypes and a group of focused prototypes, and then compares video similarity based on the prototypes. Each global prototype is encouraged to summarize a specific aspect from the entire video, for example, the start/evolution of the action. Since no clear annotation is provided for the global prototypes, we use a group of focused prototypes to focus on certain timestamps in the video. We compare video similarity by matching the compound prototypes between the support and query videos. The global prototypes are directly matched to compare videos from the same perspective, for example, to compare whether two actions start similarly. For the focused prototypes, since actions have various temporal variations in the videos, we apply bipartite matching to allow the comparison of actions with different temporal positions and shifts. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.
