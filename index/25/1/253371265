Missing- Permission-Check (MPC) vulnerability is a type of bug where permission checks are not enforced for privileged operations. MPC vulnerability is prevalent and can cause severe security impacts. This paper proposes the first tool to detect MPC vulnerabilities in distributed cloud systems. We conduct an in-depth study of 95 real-world MPC vulnerabilities and our findings motivate a new tool named MPChecker. The tool introduces a combined log-static analysis to automatically identify privileged operations by inferring variables representing user owned data and critical system states, whose accesses need to be protected. We have evaluated MPChecker with 6 popular distributed systems. The tool reports 44 new vulnerabilities, and 43 of them have been confirmed and labeled as critical bugs. Moreover, 1 bug is particular dangerous and the developers requested to keep it undisclosed.
