Communication nondeterminism is one of the main reasons for the intractability of verification of message passing concurrency. In many practical message passing programs, the non-deterministic communication structure is symmetric and decomposed into epochs to obtain efficiency. Thus, symmetries and epoch structure can be exploited to reduce verification complexity. In this paper, we present a dynamic-symbolic runtime verification technique for single-path MPI programs, which (i) exploits communication symmetries by way of specifying symmetry breaking predicates (SBP) and (ii) performs compositional verification based on epochs. On the one hand, SBPs prevent the symbolic decision procedure from exploring isomorphic parts of the search space, and on the other hand, epochs restrict the size of a program needed to be analyzed at a point in time. We show that our analysis is sound and complete for single-path MPI programs on a given input. Using our prototype tool SIMIAN, we further demonstrate that our approach leads to (i) a significant reduction in verification times and (ii) scaling up to larger benchmark sizes compared to prior trace verifiers.
