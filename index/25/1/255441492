Many organizations seek to increase their agility in order to deliver more timely and competitive products. However, in safety-critical systems such as medical devices, autonomous vehicles, or factory floor robots, the release of new features has the potential to introduce hazards that potentially lead to run-time failures that impact software safety. As a result, many projects suffer from a phenomenon referred to as the big freeze. SAFA is designed to address this challenge. Through the use of cutting-edge deep-learning solutions, it generates trees of requirements, designs, code, tests, and other artifacts that visually depict how hazards are mitigated in the system, and it automatically warns the user when key artifacts are missing. It also uses a combination of colors, annotations, and recommendations to dynamically visualize change across software versions and augments safety cases with visual annotations to aid users in detecting and analyzing potentially adverse impacts of change upon system safety.
