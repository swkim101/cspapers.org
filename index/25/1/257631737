We study the problem of estimating optical flow from event cameras. One important issue is how to build a high-quality event-flow dataset with accurate event values and flow labels. Previous datasets are created by either capturing real scenes by event cameras or synthesizing from images with pasted foreground objects. The former case can produce real event values but with calculated flow labels, which are sparse and inaccurate. The latter case can generate dense flow labels but the interpolated events are prone to errors. In this work, we propose to render a physically correct event-flow dataset using computer graphics models. In particular, we first create indoor and outdoor 3D scenes by Blender with rich scene content variations. Second, diverse camera motions are included for the virtual capturing, producing images and accurate flow labels. Third, we render high-framerate videos between images for accurate events. The rendered dataset can adjust the density of events, based on which we further introduce an adaptive density module (ADM). Experiments show that our proposed dataset can facilitate event-flow learning, whereas previous approaches when trained on our dataset can improve their performances constantly by a relatively large margin. In addition, event-flow pipelines when equipped with our ADM can further improve performances. Our code is available at https://github.com/boomluo02/ADMFlow.
