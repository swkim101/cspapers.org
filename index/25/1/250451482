This paper proposes a Video Graph Transformer (VGT) model for Video Quetion Answering (VideoQA). VGT's uniqueness are two-fold: 1) it designs a dynamic graph transformer module which encodes video by explicitly capturing the visual objects, their relations, and dynamics for complex spatio-temporal reasoning; and 2) it exploits disentangled video and text Transformers for relevance comparison between the video and text to perform QA, instead of entangled cross-modal Transformer for answer classification. Vision-text communication is done by additional cross-modal interaction modules. With more reasonable video encoding and QA solution, we show that VGT can achieve much better performances on VideoQA tasks that challenge dynamic relation reasoning than prior arts in the pretraining-free scenario. Its performances even surpass those models that are pretrained with millions of external data. We further show that VGT can also benefit a lot from self-supervised cross-modal pretraining, yet with orders of magnitude smaller data. These results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of VGT, and reveal its potential for more data-efficient pretraining. With comprehensive analyses and some heuristic observations, we hope that VGT can promote VQA research beyond coarse recognition/description towards fine-grained relation reasoning in realistic videos.
