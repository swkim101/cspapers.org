The main goal of this work was to obtain our own measurements of the combustion rate of individual hydrocarbon components of the kerosene surrogate under the same conditions and compare them with the predictions of kinetic models and experimental data of real kerosene. The “Heat Flux” method was used to measure the combustion rate, three kinetic mechanisms were used to simulate the results: JetSurF 2.0 and two mechanisms developed at the Polytechnic Institute of Milan: reduced and detailed high-temperature, the calculations were carried out in the ANSYS ChemKin 18.2 software product.
