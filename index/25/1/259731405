In this work, we propose a real-time monocular 3D video reconstruction approach named Flora for reconstructing delicate and complete 3D scenes from RGB video sequences in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we introduce a novel method with two main contributions. Firstly, the proposed feature aggregation module retains both color and reliability in a dual-frequency form. Secondly, the loss compensation module solves missing structure by correcting losses for falsely pruned voxels. The dual-frequency feature aggregation module enhances reconstruction quality in both precision and recall, and the loss compensation module benefits the recall. Notably, both proposed contributions achieve great results with negligible inferencing overhead. Our state-of-the-art experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate Flora's leading performance in both effectiveness and efficiency.
