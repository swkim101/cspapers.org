At Asiacrypt 2020, Boneh et al. proposed a verifiable oblivious pseudorandom function based on isogenies. Basso et al. later demonstrated a subexponential attack on the pseudorandomness of the protocol. In this work, we propose an efficient countermeasure against such an attack. We also propose several improvements that significantly reduce the computational and communication cost of the protocol. We introduce some countermeasures that make the protocol secure against the recent SIDH attacks. Putting everything together, we obtain the most efficient post-quantum OPRF protocol.
