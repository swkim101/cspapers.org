Establishing superior-quality correspondences in an image pair is pivotal to many subsequent computer vision tasks. Using Euclidean distance between correspondences to find neighbors and extract local information is a common strategy in previous works. However, most such works ignore similar sparse semantics information between two given images and cannot capture local topology among correspondences well. Therefore, to deal with the above problems, Multiple Sparse Semantics Dynamic Graph Network (MS2 DG-Net) is proposed, in this paper, to predict probabilities of correspondences as inliers and recover camera poses. MS2 DG-Net dynamically builds sparse semantics graphs based on sparse semantics similarity between two given images, to capture local topology among correspondences, while maintaining permutation-equivariant. Extensive experiments prove that MS2 DG-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in outlier removal and camera pose estimation tasks on the public datasets with heavy outliers.
