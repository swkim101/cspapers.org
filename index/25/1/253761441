Multi-Intent Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), a novel and more complex scenario of SLU, is attracting increasing attention. Unlike traditional SLU, each intent in this scenario has its specific scope. Semantic information outside the scope even hinders the prediction, which tremendously increases the difficulty of intent detection. More seriously, guiding slot filling with these inaccurate intent labels suffers error propagation problems, resulting in unsatisfied overall performance. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Scope-Sensitive Result Attention Network (SSRAN) based on Transformer, which contains a Scope Recognizer (SR) and a Result Attention Network (RAN). SR assignments scope information to each token, reducing the distraction of out-of-scope tokens. RAN effectively utilizes the bidirectional interaction between SF and ID results, mitigating the error propagation problem. Experiments on two public datasets indicate that our model significantly improves SLU performance (5.4% and 2.1% on Overall accuracy) over the state-of-the-art baseline.
