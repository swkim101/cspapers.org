Photo retouching finds many applications in various fields. However, most existing methods are designed for global retouching and seldom pay attention to the local region, while the latter is actually much more tedious and time-consuming in photography pipelines. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive blend pyramid network, which aims to achieve fast local retouching on ultra high-resolution photos. The network is mainly composed of two components: a context-aware local retouching layer (LRL) and an adaptive blend pyramid layer (BPL). The LRL is designed to implement local retouching on low-resolution images, giving full consideration of the global context and local texture information, and the BPL is then developed to progressively expand the low-resolution results to the higher ones, with the help of the proposed adaptive blend module and refining module. Our method outperforms the existing methods by a large margin on two local photo retouching tasks and exhibits excellent performance in terms of running speed, achieving real-time inference on 4K images with a single NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU. Moreover, we introduce the first high-definition cloth retouching dataset CRHD-3K to promote the research on local photo retouching. The dataset is available at https://github.com/youngLbw/crhd-3K.
