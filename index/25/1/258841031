Extracting structured and grounded fact triples from raw text is a fundamental task in Information Extraction (IE). Existing IE datasets are typically collected from Wikipedia articles, using hyperlinks to link entities to the Wikidata knowledge base. However, models trained only on Wikipedia have limitations when applied to web domains, which often contain noisy text or text that does not have any factual information. We present WebIE, the first large-scale, entity-linked closed IE dataset consisting of 1.6M sentences automatically collected from the English Common Crawl corpus. WebIE also includes negative examples, i.e. sentences without fact triples, to better reflect the data on the web. We annotate ~25K triples from WebIE through crowdsourcing and introduce mWebIE, a translation of the annotated set in four other languages: French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Hindi. We evaluate the in-domain, out-of-domain, and zero-shot cross-lingual performance of generative IE models and find models trained on WebIE show better generalisability. We also propose three training strategies that use entity linking as an auxiliary task. Our experiments show that adding Entity-Linking objectives improves the faithfulness of our generative IE models.
