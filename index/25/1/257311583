This experience report details pilot deployments of the Platform for Ethics and Responsible Computing Education (PEaRCE) in undergraduate computer science (CS) courses. PEaRCE is an online learning environment designed to immerse undergraduate CS students in realistic interactive work scenarios. The simulated work scenarios illustrate how technical CS course material can be readily exploited towards the creation of appealing systems, which nevertheless can be instruments of harm to others. Students take the role of an employee within a project and are given details about the project. Students then decide whether to continue with the project immediately, or to first talk to various project stakeholders who could provide additional information about the project and its impacts. At the end of the simulation, students are provided information about the project scenario, including the potential impacts of the project and feedback on stakeholder conversation choices. We report on preliminary findings from pilot deployments of PEaRCE in undergraduate CS courses, including student feedback about PEaRCE and the simulation scenarios and discuss future directions for the design of the system and its use in future CS courses.
