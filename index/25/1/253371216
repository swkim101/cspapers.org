In this work, we propose a WiFi vision-based approach to person re-identification (Re-ID) indoors. Our approach leverages the advances of WiFi to visualize a person and utilizes deep learning to help WiFi devices identify and recognize people. Specifically, we leverage multiple antennas on WiFi devices to estimate the two-dimensional angle of arrival (2D AoA) of the WiFi signal reflections to enable WiFi devices to "see'' a person. We then utilize deep learning techniques to extract a 3D mesh representation of a person and extract the body shape and walking patterns for person Re-ID. Our preliminary study shows that our system achieves high overall ranking accuracies. It also works under non-line-of-sight and different person appearance conditions, where the traditional camera vision-based systems do not work well.
