We present progress on the problem of reconfiguring a 2D arrangement of building material by a cooperative group of robots. These robots must avoid collisions, deadlocks, and are subjected to the constraint of maintaining connectivity of the structure. We develop two reconfiguration methods, one based on spatio-temporal planning, and one based on target swapping, to increase building efficiency. The first method can significantly reduce planning times compared to other multi-robot planners. The second method helps to reduce the amount of time robots spend waiting for paths to be cleared, and the overall distance traveled by the robots.
