Navigation through unknown, cluttered environments is a fundamental and challenging task for autonomous vehicles as they must deal with a myriad of obstacle configurations typically unknown a priori. Challenges arise because obstacles of unknown shapes and dimensions can create occlusions limiting sensor field of view and leading to uncertainty in motion planning. In this paper we propose to leverage such occlusions to quickly explore and cover unknown cluttered environments. Specifically, this work presents a novel occlusion-aware frontier-based approach that estimates gaps in point cloud data and shadows in the field of view to generate waypoints to navigate. Our scheme also proposes a breadcrumbing technique to save states of interest during exploration that can be exploited in future missions. For the latter aspect we focus primarily on the generation of the minimum number of breadcrumbs that will increase coverage and visibility of an explored environment. Extensive simulations and experiment results on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) are demonstrated to validate the proposed technique, showing improvements over traditional state of the art frontier-based exploration methods.
