Traditionally, architecture prototypes are built on top of FPGA infrastructure, with two associated problems. First, very large FPGAs are prohibitively expensive for most people and institutions. Second, the burden of FPGA development adds to an already uneasy life of researchers, especially those who focus on software. Large designs that do not fit into a single FPGA exacerbate these issues even more. This work presents SMAPPIC â€” the first open-source prototype platform for shared memory multi-die architectures on cloud FPGAs. SMAPPIC leverages the OpenPiton/BYOC infrastructure and AWS F1 instances to make FPGA-based prototypes of System-on-Chips, processor cores, accelerators, cache subsystems, etc., cheap, scalable, and straightforward. SMAPPIC enables many use cases that are not possible or significantly more complicated in existing software and FPGA tools. This work has the potential to accelerate the rate of innovation in computer engineering fields in the nearest future.
