TextHide was recently proposed to protect the training data via instance encoding in natural language domain. Due to the lack of theoretic privacy guarantee, such instance encoding scheme has been shown to be vulnerable against privacy attacks, e.g., reconstruction attack. To address such limitation, we revise the instance encoding scheme with differential privacy and thus provide a provable guarantee against privacy attacks. The experimental results also show that the proposed scheme can defend against privacy attacks while ensuring learning utility (as a trade-off).
