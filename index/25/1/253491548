 Establishing cleaner energy generation therefore improving the sustainability of power systems is a crucial task in this century. One of the key strategies being pursued is to shift the dependence on fossil fuel to renewable technologies such as wind, solar, and nuclear. However, with the increasing number of heterogeneous components included in the power system, the complexity of the hybrid energy system becomes more significant, which makes it prone to system failures. The complex system imposes a more stringent requirement of the contingency plan to enhance the overall system resilience against potential system disruptive events. Among different strategies to ensure a resilient system, intentional islanding is commonly applied in practical applications for power systems. In this study, we address the challenges of intentional islanding design considering high penetration of renewable energy sources, and develop a hierarchical clustering-based design method for optimized intentional islanding strategies at the transmission level of a power system. To incorporate the renewable generation that relies on the inverter technology, the frequency measurements are considered to represent the transient response and further used as embedded information in the clustering algorithm. And in the case study, the stabilized post-disruption performance of the modified IEEE-9 bus test system demonstrates the capability of the proposed method for resilience enhancement.
