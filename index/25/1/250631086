There is a well-known approach to cope with NP-hard problems in practice: reduce the given problem to SAT or MAXSAT and run a SAT or a MaxSAT solver. This method is very efficient since SAT/MaxSAT solvers are extremely well-studied, as well as the complexity of these problems. At AAAI 2011, Li et al. proposed an alternative to this approach and suggested the Partial Minimum Satisfiability problem as a reduction target for NP-hard problems. They developed the MinSatz solver and showed that reducing to Partial Minimum Satisfiability and using MinSatz is in some cases more efficient than reductions to SAT or MaxSAT. Since then many results connected to the Partial Minimum Satisfiability problem were published. However, to the best of our knowledge, the worst-case complexity of Partial Minimum Satisfiability has not been studied up until now. Our goal is to fix the issue and show a O*((2-É›)^m) lower bound under the SETH assumption (here m is the total number of clauses), as well as several other lower bounds and parameterized exact algorithms with better-than-trivial running time.
