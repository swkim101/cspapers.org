Perception and portability are critical issues for wearable gloves in hand assistive engineering. However, available wearable gloves either lack flexible sensing or are bulky. In this paper, we present a tendon-driven lightweight wearable glove with soft joint sensing, Sen-Glove. Sen-Glove is equipped with 14 soft strain sensors, which enables full bending motion monitoring of 14 joints of five fingers and greatly reduces the weight of the glove. Besides, modular design makes Sen-Glove more compact and weighs 161g in total, reducing the burden on hand. A series of mechanical tests are conducted to evaluate the characteristics of Sen-Glove. Experimental results show that Sen-Glove can withstand 500 bending cycles, assist the subject in grasping 21 multi-scale objects, and recognize 11 gestures. The classification accuracy of 11 different gestures reaches 98.6 %, which verifies the efficacy of the strain sensors.
