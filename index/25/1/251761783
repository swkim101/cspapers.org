Chatter vibrations, which arise in cutting operations, are a significant barrier to achieving the desired productivity and product quality. Regenerative chatter is detrimental to any process as it creates excessive vibration between the tool and the workpiece, impacting the performance and increasing the risk of failure. Active inertial actuators, such as a proof-mass-damper (PMD) can reduce chatter vibration by adding viscous damping into the structure. This paper describes a solution based on an electromagnetic PMD to the problem of chatter vibrations. The advantages are demonstrated experimentally, using a test rig where electromagnetic actuators emulate the operation of conventional cutting forces. The improved dynamical properties are quantified through stability lobe diagrams.
