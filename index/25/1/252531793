In recent years, real image super-resolution (SR) has achieved promising results due to the development of SR datasets and corresponding real SR methods. In contrast, the field of real video SR is lagging behind, especially for real raw videos. Considering the superiority of raw image SR over sRGB image SR, we construct a real-world raw video SR (Real-RawVSR) dataset and propose a corresponding SR method. We utilize two DSLR cameras and a beam-splitter to simultaneously capture low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) raw videos with 2x, 3x, and 4x magnifications. There are 450 video pairs in our dataset, with scenes varying from indoor to outdoor, and motions including camera and object movements. To our knowledge, this is the first real-world raw VSR dataset. Since the raw video is characterized by the Bayer pattern, we propose a two-branch network, which deals with both the packed RGGB sequence and the original Bayer pattern sequence, and the two branches are complementary to each other. After going through the proposed co-alignment, interaction, fusion, and reconstruction modules, we generate the corresponding HR sRGB sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark real and synthetic video SR methods with either raw or sRGB inputs.
