Many deep spatio-temporal learning methods have been proposed for crowd flow modeling in recent years. However, most of them focus on designing a spatial and temporal convolution mechanism to aggregate information from nearby nodes and historical observations for a pre-defined prediction task. Different from the existing research, this paper aims to provide a generic and dynamic representation learning method for crowd flow modeling. The main idea of our method is to maintain a continuous-time representation for each node, and update the representations of all nodes continuously according to the streaming observed data. Along this line, a particular encoder-decoder architecture is proposed, where the encoder converts the newly happened transactions into a timestamped message, and then the representations of related nodes are updated according to the generated message. The role of the decoder is to guide the representation learning process by reconstructing the observed transactions based on the most recent node representations. Moreover, a number of virtual nodes are added to discover macro-level spatial patterns and also share the representations among spatially-interacted stations. Experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets for four popular prediction tasks in crowd flow modeling. The result demonstrates that our method could achieve better prediction performance for all the tasks than baseline methods.
