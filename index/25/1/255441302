Recommender systems (RSs) are increasingly being used to help in all sorts of software engineering tasks, including modelling. However, building a RS for a modelling notation is costly. This is especially detrimental for development paradigms that rely on domain-specific languages (DSLs), like model-driven engineering and lowcode approaches. To alleviate this problem, we propose a DSL called Droid that facilitates the configuration and creation of RSs for particular modelling notations. Its tooling provides automation for all phases in the development of a RS: data preprocessing, system configuration for the modelling language, evaluation and selection of the best recommendation algorithm, and deployment of the RS into a modelling tool. A video of the tool is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHiObfKUhS0.
