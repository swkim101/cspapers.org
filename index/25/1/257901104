In recent years, learning-based feature detection and matching have outperformed manually-designed methods in in-air cases. However, it is challenging to learn the features in the underwater scenario due to the absence of annotated underwater datasets. This paper proposes a cross-modal knowl-edge distillation framework for training an underwater feature detection and matching network (UFEN). In particular, we use in-air RGBD data to generate synthetic underwater images based on a physical underwater imaging formation model and employ these as the medium to distil knowledge from a teacher model SuperPoint pretrained on in-air images. We embed UFEN into the ORB-SLAM3 framework to replace the ORB feature by introducing an additional binarization layer. To test the effectiveness of our method, we built a new underwater dataset with groundtruth measurements named EASI (https://github.com/Jinghe-mel/UFEN-SLAM), recorded in an indoor water tank for different turbidity levels. The experimental results on the existing dataset and our new dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
