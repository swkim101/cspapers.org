The emergent field of social AI is concerned with the development of autonomous agents that are able to act as part of larger community. Within this context, my research seeks to engineer meaningful social interactions among a group of agents from two different approaches. First, the societal level leverages constructs that apply to a society as a whole, like norms and social values. Second, the individual level endows agents with the ability to reason about others, by making use of Theory of Mind capabilities.
