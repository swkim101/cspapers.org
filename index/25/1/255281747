In the development strategy of Ukraine Industry 4.0, it is stated that relevant and promising scientific and engineering services are: the creation of new software products, including 4.0 technologies; industrial automation and complex engineering; development and production of complex, low-volume, or unique products. In the conditions of mixed education, which is related to the pandemic and martial law in Ukraine, the question of how to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for mastering the basics of developing and programming embedded systems that work with the use of smart technologies and Internet of Things technologies is quite relevant. . In the absence of access to ESP8266, ESP32 IoT modules, students are invited to simulate their work in the Wokwi cloud service. The paper considers the temperature and humidity monitoring system in the DWEET.IO cloud service on the ESP8266 IoT module and the DHT11 combined sensor. Prototyping the operation of such a system in the Wokwi service is performed on an ESP32 IoT module and a DHT22 sensor, with the simulation of data transmission to the IoT cloud service. The article provides the source codes of the temperature and humidity monitoring system program. The proposed approach allows for prototyping embedded systems that work using smart technologies and Internet of Things technologies without the presence of IoT modules and sensors. The Wokwi cloud service allows you to configure the software part of embedded systems and connect to real cloud services of the Internet of Things with the simulation of data exchange via a wireless interface using Wi-Fi technology of the 802.11g standard.
