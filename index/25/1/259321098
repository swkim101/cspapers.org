Graph size generalization is hard for Message passing neural networks (MPNNs). The graph-level classification performance of MPNNs degrades across various graph sizes. Recently, theoretical studies reveal that a slow uncontrollable convergence rate w.r.t. graph size could adversely affect the size generalization. To address the uncontrollable convergence rate caused by correlations across nodes in the underlying dimensional signal-generating space, we propose to use Wasserstein barycenters as graph-level consensus to combat node-level correlations. Methodologi-cally, we propose a Wasserstein barycenter matching (WBM) layer that represents an input graph by Wasserstein distances between its MPNN-filtered node embeddings versus some learned class-wise barycenters. Theoretically, we show that the convergence rate of an MPNN with a WBM layer is controllable and independent to the dimensionality of the signal-generating space. Thus MPNNs with WBM layers are less susceptible to slow un-controllable convergence rate and size variations. Empirically, the WBM layer improves the size generalization over vanilla MPNNs with different backbones (e.g., GCN, GIN, and PNA) significantly on real-world graph datasets.
