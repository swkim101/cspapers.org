There is a rapidly growing interest in the security of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and internet-of-things (IoT) in industry, government and academia. This interest is also reflected in this workshop that from 2019 has been part of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, which originally hosted two workshops: One on CPS security and privacy (running 5 times in the past) and one on IoT security and privacy (running 2 times in the past). Due to the close connection of the two topics, the Steering Committees of the two workshops decided in 2020 to merge towards delivering a world-class event on CPS&IoT security and privacy. CPSIoTSec'22 corresponds to the fourth edition of this merger. CPS&IoTSec'22 attracted 16 submissions, which were assigned to four independent reviewers. Following a rigorous peer-review process, 3 full papers and 4 short papers were accepted, achieving an acceptance rate of 43.75%. We would like to express our deepest thanks to the CPS&IoTSec'22 Steering Committee for entrusting us with organizing the workshop, and all the members of the program committee for their valuable reviews and discussions. Likewise, we would like to thank all the authors who submitted their contributions in the CPS & IoT Security field.
