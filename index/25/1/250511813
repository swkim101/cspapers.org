While the design of autonomous robots often emphasizes developing proficient robots, another important attribute of autonomous robot systems is their ability to evaluate their own proficiency and limitations. A robot should be able to assess how well it can perform a task before, during, and after it attempts the task. Thus, we consider the following question: How can we design autonomous robots that know their own limits? Toward this end, this paper presents an approach, called assumption-alignment tracking (AAT), for designing autonomous robots that can effectively evaluate their own limits. In AAT, the robot combines (a) measures of how well its decision-making algorithms align with its environment and hardware systems with (b) its past experiences to assess its ability to succeed at a given task. The effectiveness of AAT in assessing a robot's limits are illustrated in a robot navigation task.
