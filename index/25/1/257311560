We propose a self-efficacy scale for data management. The scale assesses students' perceived capabilities in mastering the breadth and depth of modern data management, as well as hands-on skills for effective management of data. Such capabilities are critical to computing and data science students. We have conducted factor analysis to validate the scale. The analysis produced a factor model with high internal consistencies. Group analyses using the factor solution and statistical testing show that (1) males and females have similar self-efficacy, except for the depth of knowledge where females showed higher confidences; and (2) CS students had much higher self-efficacy than non-CS students. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-efficacy scale for data management.
