System auditing provides a low-level view into cyber threats by monitoring system entity interactions. In response to advanced cyber-attacks, one prevalent solution is to apply data provenance analysis on audit records to search for anomalies (anomalous behaviors) or specifications of known attacks. However, existing approaches suffer from several limitations: 1) generating high volumes of false alarms, 2) relying on expert knowledge, or 3) producing coarse-grained detection signals. In this paper, we recognize the structural similarity between threat detection in cybersecurity and recommendation in information retrieval. By mapping security concepts of system entity interactions to recommendation concepts of user-item interactions, we identify cyber threats by predicting the preferences of a system entity on its interactive entities. Furthermore, inspired by the recent advances in modeling high-order connectivity via item side information in the recommendation, we transfer the insight to cyber threat analysis and customize an automated detection system, SHADEWATCHER. It fulfills the potential of high-order information in audit records via graph neural networks to improve detection effectiveness. Besides, we equip SHADEWATCHER with dynamic updates towards better generalization to false alarms. In our evaluation against both real-life and simulated cyber-attack scenarios, SHADEWATCHER shows its advantage in identifying threats with high precision and recall rates. Moreover, SHADEWATCHER is capable of pinpointing threats from nearly a million system entity interactions within seconds.
