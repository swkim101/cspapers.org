ï€  Abstract - In this paper, we propose a teleoperated construction 3D printing technology, called TeleLayering, for planetary and terrestrial applications. The TeleLayering technology is enabled by effective multimodal control and monitoring systems and enhanced construction 3D printing robots to build or repair a variety of structures in extreme environments without the need for human presence on the jobsite. This paper presents a general description, main technical requirements, implementation challenges, and applications of this technology.
