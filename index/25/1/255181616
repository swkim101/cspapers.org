Private vehicles are expected to continue representing a large share of the urban traffic requiring intelligent management to provide safe and efficient urban mobility. In this context, it is imperative to mitigate traffic congestion and associated travel delays to improve the quality of life of urban dwellers. This paper explores the global performance of grid networks of independent intersections using different intersection management protocols. We particularly aim to compare the performance achieved when using the intelligent intersection management architecture (IIMA) that relies on the synchronous intersection management protocol (SIMP), against two conventional (Round-robin - RR and trivial traffic light control - TTLC) and two adaptive (Max-pressure control algorithm - MCA and Websters traffic light control - WTLC) intersection management approaches. We consider four-way two-lane intersections with two crossing configurations, namely dedicated and shared left lane, on a 2Ã—2 grid network of intersections. Simulation results with SUMO show that composing intersections with synchronous management considerably improves the network throughput and reduces travel delays.
