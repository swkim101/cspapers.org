[Background:] Automated Intelligent Toolchains, which are a composition of different tools that use AI or static analysis, are widely used in software engineering to deploy automated program repair techniques, or in software security to identify vulnerabilities. [Overall Research Problem:] Most studies with automated intelligent toolchains report uncertainty and evaluations only of the individual components of the chain. How do we calculate the uncertainty and error propagation on the overall automated toolchain? [Approach:] I plan to replicate research case studies to collect data and design a methodology to reconstruct the overall correctness metrics of the toolchains, or identifying missing variables. Further confirmatory experiments with humans will be performed. Finally, I will implement an artifact to automate the overall assessment of automated toolchains. [Current Status:] A preliminary validation of published studies showed promising results.
