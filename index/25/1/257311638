Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy is a rapidly evolving research field. Due to the broad scope of AI literacy-related publications, a comprehensive analysis of the field is needed in order to examine the main characteristics of the current scientific output. Based on it, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of the field where we investigated the publications' evolution over time, research constituents (authors, countries, institutions, publication venues), collaboration patterns, and emerging trends. The findings point out that the United States of America (USA), China, Spain, and Germany are the most contributing countries in the AI literacy field. Moreover, the organizations that most contribute to the AI literacy field are the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Eastern Finland, and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Furthermore, KI - KÃ¼nstliche Intelligenz, ACM Transactions on Computing Education, and IEEE Access are the most disseminating journals, and FIE, AAAI, SIGCSE, and CHI are the most disseminating conferences of AI literacy research. According to keywords co-occurrence analysis, machine learning, data, big data, deep learning, and ethics are the most addressed AI topics. Finally, based on the achieved results, this bibliometric analysis draws some conclusions regarding the AI literacy field and points out potential directions for future works.
