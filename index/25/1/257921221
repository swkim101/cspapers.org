Inspections are frequently conducted to reveal information about agents' otherwise unobserved actions. Some inspections occur at pre-announced times; others are surprises. We show how the productive role of the inspected agent determines whether predictable or random inspections are optimal. If the agent's main task is achieving a breakthrough---think of an entrepreneur investing in an innovative industry---then predictable inspections are optimal. If the main task is avoiding a breakdown---think of a financial institution managing its risk in order to avoid default---then random inspections are optimal.
