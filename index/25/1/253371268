The blooming of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the demand for new connectivity technologies. Zigbee, with its low-power consumption and flexible network structure, has become one of the essential wireless communication protocols in the IoT ecosystem and is adopted by many major companies. There have been over thousands of certified Zigbee products, ranging from sensors, to link light products, to smart energy devices. A common belief is that Zigbee is comparatively secure, due to the nature of closed networks and the use of encryption. However, in this paper, we find Zigbee-related attacks in which adversaries are outside of the target network and have no knowledge of the encryption keys. The low attack requirements pose high threats. The attacks mislead devices to accept forged packets, which will jeopardize the normal operations of Zigbee networks. We further develop a framework to efficiently identify such problems. The framework supports flexible modification of address and network information, and bit-level manipulations from the MAC layer. To accelerate analysis, we design semantic-aware fuzzing to generate packet candidates that are more likely to produce meaningful results. We conduct experiments on 10 real-world Zigbee systems. Using our approach, we have identified five types of practical attacks, ranging from communication disruption to security key leakage. We show proof-of-concept attacks on industry Zigbee products and systems. Our findings bring to light new security issues of Zigbee and further motivate possible mitigation approaches.
