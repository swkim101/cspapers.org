The problem of replica coordination is fundamental to building Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) distributed systems. Seminal BFT architectures for safety-critical real-time systems from the eighties and nineties relied on custom processors and networks, and are hence not readily usable today. Modern-day deployments on cloud platforms do not “scale down” to embedded platforms and are not designed around timeliness. Recent work on real-time BFT protocols focuses on simulations and reliability analyses. In short, there exist no easily programmable BFT libraries that can be conveniently retrofitted onto real-time applications with deadlines and that perform well on embedded platforms. We propose In-ConcReTeS, a BFT key-value store designed for building highly reliable control applications on commodity embedded platforms. At its core, In-ConcReTeS is a real-time friendly redesign and an efficient implementation of a BFT protocol used by seminal fault-tolerant architectures. We evaluated In-ConcReTeS using an inverted pendulum simulation and an automotive benchmark on a cluster of four Raspberry Pis connected over Ethernet. Our results show that, unlike Redis and etcd, In-ConcReTeS can repeatedly synchronize hundreds of key-value pairs, while tolerating faults, every tens of milliseconds.
