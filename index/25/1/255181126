This paper proposes a variable impedance control architecture to facilitate eye surgery training in a dual-user haptic system. In this system, an expert surgeon (the trainer) and a novice surgeon (the trainee) collaborate on a surgical procedure using their own haptic devices. The mechanical impedance parameters of the trainer's haptic device remain constant during the operation, whereas those of the trainee vary with his/her proficiency level. The trainee's relative proficiency might be objectively quantified in real-time based on position error between the trainer and the trainee. The proposed architecture enables the trainer to intervene in the training process as needed to ensure the trainee is following the right course of action and to avoid the trainee's from potential tissue injuries. The stability of the overall nonlinear closed-loop system has been investigated using the input-to-state stability (ISS) criterion. High-gain observer with unknown inputs is considered in this work to estimate the interaction forces. Simulation and experimental results under different scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control methods.
