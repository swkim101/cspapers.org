Today, some applications encrypt our data, while many others do not. Users must accept the level of protection the application provides. Our research aims to support client-to-client encryption at the system level so that users can enable encryption for data in any application (e.g., email, Slack), even if the application does not support it. Two users can exchange sensitive data without it being accessible to any applications or systems along the path. We will describe the challenges to designing the system, the techniques we will use to build the system, and the advantages of encryption at the system level.
