Node attribute forecasting has recently attracted considerable attention. Recent attempts have thus far utilize dynamic graph convolutional network (GCN) to predict future node attributes. However, few prior works have notice that the complex spatial and temporal interaction between nodes, which will hamper the performance of dynamic GCN. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic GCN model named meta-DGCN, leveraging meta spatial-temporal tasks to enhance the ability of dynamic GCN for better capturing node attributes in the future. Experiments show that meta-DGCN effectively modeling comprehensive spatio-temporal correlations between nodes and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various real-world datasets.
