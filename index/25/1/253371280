Our aim is to create a personal assistant, a chatbot, that can answer queries from software developers regarding Privacy by Design (PbD) methods and applications throughout the design phase of IoT system development. We used semantic web technologies to model the PARROT Ontology that includes knowledge underlying PbD measurements, their intersections with privacy patterns, IoT system needs, and the privacy patterns that should be applied across IoT systems. To determine the PARROT ontology's requirements, a collection of real-world IoT use cases were aided by a series of workshops to gather Competency Questions (CQs) from researchers and software engineers, resulting in 81 selected CQs. In a user study, the PARROT ontology was able to answer up to 58% of software developers' privacy-related issues. The technical report \citeorca149337 contains further analysis and results from data collecting and intermediate synthesis steps.
