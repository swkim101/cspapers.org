In this paper, we present a novel autonomous driving framework, called a road graph and image attention network (RIANet), which computes the attention scores of objects in the image using the road graph feature. The process of the proposed method is as follows: First, the feature encoder module encodes the road graph, image, and additional features of the scene. The attention network module then incorporates the encoded features and computes the scene context feature via the attention mechanism. Finally, the low-level controller mod-ule drives the ego-vehicle based on the scene context feature. In the experiments, we use an urban scene driving simulator named CARLA to train and test the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing autonomous driving methods.
