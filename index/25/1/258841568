Estimating position bias is a well-known challenge in Learning to Rank (L2R). Click data in e-commerce applications, such as targeted advertisements and search engines, provides implicit but abundant feedback to improve personalized rankings. However, click data inherently includes various biases like position bias. Based on the position-based click model, Result Randomization and Regression Expectation-Maximization algorithm (REM) have been proposed to estimate position bias, but they require various paired observations of (item, position). In real-world scenarios of advertising, marketers frequently display advertisements in a fixed pre-determined order, which creates difficulties in estimation due to the limited availability of various pairs in the training data, resulting in a sparse dataset. We propose a variant of the REM that utilizes item embeddings to alleviate the sparsity of (item, position). Using a public dataset and internal carousel advertisement click dataset, we empirically show that item embedding with Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) improves the accuracy of position bias estimation and the estimated position bias enhances Learning to Rank performance. We also show that LSI is more effective as an embedding creation method for position bias estimation.
