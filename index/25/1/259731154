Large-scale high-quality data is critical for training modern deep neural networks. However, data acquisition can be costly or time-consuming for many time-series applications, thus researchers turn to generative models for generating synthetic time-series data. In particular, recent generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable success in time-series generation. Despite their success, existing GAN models typically generate the sequences in an auto-regressive manner, and we empirically observe that they suffer from severe distribution shifts and bias amplification, especially when generating long sequences. To resolve this problem, we propose Adversarial Error Correction GAN (AEC-GAN), which is capable of dynamically correcting the bias in the past generated data to alleviate the risk of distribution shifts and thus can generate high-quality long sequences. AEC-GAN contains two main innovations: (1) We develop an error correction module to mitigate the bias. In the training phase, we adversarially perturb the realistic time-series data and then optimize this module to reconstruct the original data. In the generation phase, this module can act as an efficient regulator to detect and mitigate the bias. (2) We propose an augmentation method to facilitate GAN's training by introducing adversarial examples. Thus, AEC-GAN can generate high-quality sequences of arbitrary lengths, and the synthetic data can be readily applied to downstream tasks to boost their performance. We conduct extensive experiments on six widely used datasets and three state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models to evaluate the quality of our synthetic time-series data in different lengths and downstream tasks. Both the qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of AEC-GAN over other deep generative models for time-series generation.
