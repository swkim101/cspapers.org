To fully evaluate the overall performance of different NLP models in a given domain, many evaluation benchmarks are proposed, such as GLUE, SuperGLUE and CLUE. The fi eld of natural language understanding has traditionally focused on benchmarks for various tasks in languages such as Chinese, English, and multilingua, however, there has been a lack of attention given to the area of classical Chinese, also known as"wen yan wen", which has a rich history spanning thousands of years and holds signifi cant cultural and academic value. For the prosperity of the NLP community, in this paper, we introduce the WYWEB evaluation benchmark, which consists of nine NLP tasks in classical Chinese, implementing sentence classifi cation, sequence labeling, reading comprehension, and machine translation. We evaluate the existing pre-trained language models, which are all struggling with this benchmark. We also introduce a number of supplementary datasets and additional tools to help facilitate further progress on classical Chinese NLU. The github repository is https://github.com/baudzhou/WYWEB.
