3D semantic segmentation is a fundamental building block for several scene understanding applications such as autonomous driving, robotics and AR/VR. Several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models suffer from the part-misclassification problem, wherein parts of the same object are labelled incorrectly. Previous methods have utilized hierarchical, iterative methods to fuse semantic and instance information, but they lack learnability in context fusion, and are computationally complex and heuristic driven. This paper presents Segment-Fusion, a novel attention-based method for hierarchical fusion of semantic and instance in-formation to address the part misclassifications. The presented method includes a graph segmentation algorithmfor grouping points into segments that pools point-wise features into segment-wise features, a learnable attention-based net-work to fuse these segments based on their semantic and instance features, and followed by a simple yet effective connected component labelling algorithm to convert seg-ment features to instance labels. Segment-Fusion can be flexibly employed with any network architecture for semantic/instance segmentation. It improves the qualitative and quantitative performance of several semantic segmentation backbones by upto 5% on the ScanNet and S3DIS datasets.
