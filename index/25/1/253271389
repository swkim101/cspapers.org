A significant transition in the characteristics of computational workloads coupled with the developments in computing as well as networking concepts and practices has presented various challenges and opportunities. In this work, we study dynamic offloading of soft real-time tasks in SDN based fog computing system. Preliminary results have been presented to highlight the impact of intra/inter-cluster offloading on the penalty due to deadline miss. Finally, the future research directions have been outlined.
