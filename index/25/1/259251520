Effectively rearranging heterogeneous objects constitutes a high-utility skill that an intelligent robot should master. Whereas significant work has been devoted to the grasp synthesis of heterogeneous objects, little attention has been given to the planning for sequentially manipulating such objects. In this work, we examine the long-horizon sequential rearrangement of heterogeneous objects in a tabletop setting, addressing not just generating feasible plans but near-optimal ones. Toward that end, and building on previous methods, including combinatorial algorithms and Monte Carlo tree search-based solutions, we develop state-of-the-art solvers for optimizing two practical objective functions considering key object properties such as size and weight. Thorough simulation studies show that our methods provide significant advantages in handling challenging heterogeneous object rearrangement problems, especially in cluttered settings. Real robot experiments further demonstrate and confirm these advantages.
