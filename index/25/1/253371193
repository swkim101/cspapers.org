In this poster, we proposed a .NET patch analysis framework named MSILDiffer based on Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL). First, MSILDiffer directly extracts MSIL instructions from the .NET assemblies, and retrieves the hierarchy of classes as well as their internal class methods. Then, with coarse and fine granularity feature extraction and comparison, MSILDiffer quickly filters out the code with substantial changes after patch. Besides, we build a dataset of patch analysis containing 24.46 million class methods based on the Microsoft Exchange mail system security patches. With the assistance of MSILDiffer, we generated 32 call paths and crafted corresponding POCs for 1-day vulnerabilities in the dataset. Through the experiment evaluation, MSILDiffer is superior to JustAssembly in terms of coverage, accuracy and time consumption of patch difference analysis.
