Contrastive learning has emerged as one of the most promising self-supervised methods. It can efficiently learn the transferable representations of samples through the instance-level discrimination task. In general, the performance of the contrastive learning method can be further improved by projecting the transferable high-dimensional representations into the low-dimensional feature space. This is because the model can learn more abstract discriminative information. However, when low-dimensional features cannot provide sufficient discriminative information to the model (e.g., the samples are very similar to each other), the existing contrastive learning method will be limited to a great extent. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a general module called the Feature Reconstruction Amplifier (FRA) for adding additional high-dimensional feature information to the model. Specifically, FRA reconstructs the low-dimensional feature embeddings with Gaussian noise vectors and projects them to a high-dimensional reconstruction space. In this reconstruction space, we can add additional feature information through the designed loss. We have verified the effectiveness of the module itself through exhaustive ablation experiments. In addition, we perform linear evaluation and transfer learning on five common visual datasets, the experimental results demonstrate that our method is superior to recent advanced contrastive learning methods.
