In this paper, we propose GameBlockchain, an open-source blockchain framework designed to support secure transactions of NFTs in modern computer games. Its purpose is to enable game industry stakeholders such as game developers, content creators, and regular gamers to create and exchange game assets in a more secure and trusted environment. The security of traditional databases and potential data tampering or dangerous user behavior is improved, as outlined in the paper, by blockchain technology, which is used to record critical operations in a ledger, preserving the identity of the user at all times. From a technical perspective, the main goal is to provide an architecture that is easy to use, flexible, understandable, and has an extensible SDK. Using the framework, game developers and regular users should be able to create and trade assets without third-party providers, and use all related services directly in the game interface itself, without having to switch between applications or pay additional transfer fees to providers. We also encourage the development of games with shared marketplaces and wallets on both the developer and user sides, making it easier to monetize assets and services.
