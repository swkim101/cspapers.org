In an ideal world, automated tools and systems could manage security and privacy seamlessly and transparently with minimal human input. In the real world, we are nowhere close to that ideal. Instead, in order to achieve good security and privacy outcomes, people need to absorb and apply high-quality security and privacy information and advice. This applies not only to end users, but also to software developers, product managers, and even security operations professionals. Sadly, the current state of the security advice and information ecosystem is in many respects a disaster. End users often get their advice from TV shows, movies, and even misleading influencer ads [2, 4], while soft ware developers take unvetted suggestions from Stack Overflow [1, 3]. Even compliance standards -- which are designed to provide authoritative security guidance -- have numerous problems [6, 7]. Our review of security advice on the web found 374 unique advice imperatives, many of which directly contradict one another [5]. This sad state of affairs is, in many ways, our fault. Security experts, like the ones who attend conferences such as CCS, often refuse to prioritize, recommending maximum security without tailoring to specific situations. Researchers evaluate tools and techniques in idealized rather than realistic use contexts, and have made little progress in accurately measuring the costs and benefits of any particular intervention. In this talk, I will review the many problems of the security and privacy information and advice ecosystem, and how we got here. I'll outline our responsibility, as experts and researchers, to help improve the quality, availability, and usability of security and privacy information. Finally, I'll discuss at what we know (and what we need to find out) about how to make progress.
