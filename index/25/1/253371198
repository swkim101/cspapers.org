The ninth ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense (MTD) Workshop is held on November 7, 2022, in conjunction with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). The main objective of the workshop is to discuss novel randomization, diversification, and dynamism techniques for computer systems and network, new metric and analysis frameworks to assess and quantify the effectiveness of MTD, and discuss challenges and opportunities that such defenses provide. This year the workshop has also incorporated a number of invited papers to capture the lessons learned from experts in this field, and highlight some of the unique opportunities for MTD in hardware and challenges of practical deployment of MTD techniques. We have constructed an exciting and diverse program of five refereed papers, two invited papers, and two invited keynote talks that will provide the participant with a vibrant and thought-provoking set of ideas and insights.
