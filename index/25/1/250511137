This paper describes the development of a modular end-effector system (MEES) for autonomous robotic maintenance and repair tasks. The design consists of the following major components: Robot Side Mating Socket Module (RSMS), End-Effector Side Mating Socket Module (EEMS), the Modular Camera System (MCS), and Tool Holder/Changer unit. Multiple prototypes for each component have been manufactured, tested, and evaluated resulting in the final concept. Existing robotic tool-changer systems on the market were evaluated and features were built into the Modular End-Effector System to overcome the current limitations of those systems. A notable advantage to the MEES is that it is a robot agnostic system and simply uses an ISO standard bolt mounting pattern to physically attached to the robot of choice along with an ethernet connection. No external cables are required that could restrain the workspace of the robot manipulator. Additionally, it is compatible with customized wrist-mounted sensors and end-effectors without any modification of the actual robot circuitry. The MEES is demonstrated working with three different end-effectors and two different robots.
