Many operations performed by work class Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) require the manipulation of heavy loads. An example is the manipulation and grouting of armour stones. A way to increase the working capabilities of the ROV is to introduce cables among the set of actuators. The cable lengths and tensions are controlled by winches placed on the vehicle. Being similar to a cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR), the resultant system inherits some advantages such as the possibility to generate large forces over a large workspace and the possibility to use CDPR techniques to estimate the pose of the ROV. This paper proposes a complete control architecture for the Hybrid Cable-Thruster actuated ROV (HCT-ROV) and analyzes, in computer simulations, the performances of such a system while it performs real world operations, such as heavy lifting and hovering in presence of water current.
