The classic approach to the Web of Things in embedded systems consists of the use of embedded web servers that transmit data from sensors to external entities (web clients). In this paper we present a browser-driven sensor service, in which an embedded web browser shares data with external entities: collects them, pre-processes them and sends them to their recipients. The paper shows the framework software of such a system and a simple, prototype implementation with the use of this framework.
