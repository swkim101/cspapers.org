ECDSA is widely used in transport layer security, cryptocurrency, and more. The problem of securely computing ECDSA has received considerable interest. Literature suggests that there is no n-parties ECDSA which shows the property of correctness (where correctness means when any party forgets to send the message to another party, and still the system provides the correct output). In this poster, we proposed a novel approach for achieving n-parties ECDSA with correctness using the claim of Byzantine agreement. We present our work by using the existing work of Xue et al. [1] for signature generation. Later on, we applied the Byzantine agreement. Our work easily deals with the case when any party does not send the message to another party.
