Indoor localization systems often fuse inertial odometry with map information via hand-defined methods to reduce odometry drift, but such methods are sensitive to noise and struggle to generalize across odometry sources. To address the robustness problem in map utilization, we propose a data-driven prior on possible user locations in a map by combining learned spatial map embeddings and temporal odometry embeddings. Our prior learns to encode which map regions are feasible locations for a user more accurately than previous hand-defined methods. This prior leads to a 49% improvement in inertial-only localization accuracy when used in a particle filter. This result is significant, as it shows that our relative positioning method can match the performance of absolute positioning using bluetooth beacons. To show the gen-eralizability of our method, we also show similar improvements using wheel encoder odometry. Our code will be made publicly availableâ€ 1project page: https://rebrand.ly/learned-map-prior.
