In this paper, we look at the case of a Generic text-to-text NMT model that has to deal with data coming from various modalities, like speech, images, or noisy text extracted from the web. We propose a two-step method, based on composable adapters, to deal with this problem of Multimodal Robustness. In a first step, we separately learn domain adapters and modality specific adapters, to deal with noisy input coming from various sources: ASR, OCR, or noisy text (UGC). In a second step, we combine these components at runtime via dynamic routing or, when the source of noise is unknown, via two new transfer learning mechanisms (Fast Fusion and Multi Fusion). We show that our method provides a flexible, state-of-the-art, architecture able to deal with noisy multimodal inputs.
