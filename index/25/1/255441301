Exploratory testing is an effective testing approach which leverages the tester’s knowledge and creativity to design test cases to provoke and recognize failures at the system level from the end user’s perspective. Although some principles and guidelines have been proposed to guide exploratory testing, there are no effective tools for automatic generation of exploratory test scenarios (a.k.a soap opera tests). Existing test generation techniques rely on specifications, program differences and fuzzing, which are not suitable for exploratory test generation. In this paper, we propose to leverage the scenario and oracle knowledge in bug reports to generate soap opera test scenarios. We develop open information extraction methods to construct a system knowledge graph (KG) of user tasks and failures from the steps to reproduce, expected results and observed results in bug reports. We construct a proof-of-concept KG from 25,939 bugs of the Firefox browser. Our evaluation shows the constructed KG is of high quality. Based on the KG, we create soap opera test scenarios by combining the scenarios of relevant bugs, and develop a web tool to present the created test scenarios and support exploratory testing. In our user study, 5 users find 18 bugs from 5 seed bugs in 2 hours using our tool, while the control group finds only 5 bugs based on the recommended similar bugs.
