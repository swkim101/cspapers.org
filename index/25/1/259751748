To facilitate offline reinforcement learning, uncertainty estimation is commonly used to detect out-of-distribution data. By inspecting, we show that current explicit uncertainty estimators such as Monte Carlo Dropout and model ensemble are not competent to provide trustworthy uncertainty estimation in offline reinforcement learning. Accordingly, we propose a non-parametric distance-aware uncertainty estimator which is sensitive to the change in the input space for offline reinforcement learning. Based on our new estimator, adaptive truncated quantile critics are proposed to underestimate the out-of-distribution samples. We show that the proposed distance-aware uncertainty estimator is able to offer better uncertainty estimation compared to previous methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DARL method is competitive to the state-of-the-art methods in offline evaluation tasks.
