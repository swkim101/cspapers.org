As an efficient blockchain platform, EOSIO is becoming increasingly popular. However, it has exposed many security problems and caused a large amount of financial losses. In the past, the difficulty of collecting open-source EOSIO smart contracts and analyzing WebAssembly (Wasm) bytecode compiled by EOSIO smart contracts, making few researchers proposed static analysis tools for EOSIO smart contracts, and tools capable of dataflow analysis have not yet appeared. In this work, we first propose a dataflow analysis method for EOSIO smart contracts. Based on Octopus, we designed an efficient dataflow analysis method, which can generate Static Single Assignment (SSA) form intermediate representation (IR) for the objective function and its variables to obtain the results of dataflow. We further proved the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments on our collected data sets.
