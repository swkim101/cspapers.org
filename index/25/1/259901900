Training deep learning models on data distributed and local to edge devices such as mobile phones is a prominent recent research direction. In a Gossip Learning (GL) system, each participating device maintains a model trained on its local data and iteratively aggregates it with the models from its neighbours in a communication network. While the fully distributed operation in GL comes with natural advantages over the centralized orchestration in Federated Learning (FL), its convergence becomes particularly slow when the data distribution is heterogeneous and aligns with the clustered structure of the communication network. These characteristics are pervasive across practical applications as people with similar interests (thus producing similar data) tend to create communities.



This paper proposes a data-driven neighbor weighting strategy for aggregating the models: this enables faster diffusion of knowledge across the communities in the network and leads to quicker convergence. We augment the method to make it computationally efficient and fair: the devices quickly converge to the same model. We evaluate our model on real and synthetic datasets that we generate using a novel generative model for communication networks with heterogeneous data. Our exhaustive empirical evaluation verifies that our proposed method attains a faster convergence rate than the baselines. For example, the median test accuracy for a decentralized bird image classifier application reaches 81% with our proposed method within 80 rounds, whereas the baseline only reaches 46%.
