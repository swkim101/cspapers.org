Framing analysis is predominantly qualitative and quantitative, examining a small dataset with manual coding. Easy access to digital data in the last two decades prompts scholars in both computation and social sciences to utilize various computational methods to explore frames in large-scale datasets. The growing scholarship, however, lacks a comprehensive understanding and resources of computational framing analysis methods. Aiming to address the gap, this article surveys existing computational framing analysis approaches and puts them together. The research is expected to help scholars and journalists gain a deeper understanding of how frames are being explored computationally, better equip them to analyze frames in large-scale datasets, and, finally, work on advancing methodological approaches.
