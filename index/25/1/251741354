Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are the most commonly used methods for skeleton-based action recognition and have achieved remarkable performance. Generating adjacency matrices with semantically meaningful edges is particularly important for this task, but extracting such edges is challenging problem. To solve this, we propose a hierarchically decomposed graph convolutional network (HD-GCN) architecture with a novel hierarchically decomposed graph (HD-Graph). The proposed HD-GCN effectively decomposes every joint node into several sets to extract major structurally adjacent and distant edges, and uses them to construct an HD-Graph containing those edges in the same semantic spaces of a human skeleton. In addition, we introduce an attention-guided hierarchy aggregation (A-HA) module to highlight the dominant hierarchical edge sets of the HD-Graph. Furthermore, we apply a new six-way ensemble method, which uses only joint and bone stream without any motion stream. The proposed model is evaluated and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four large, popular datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with various comparative experiments.
