Machine learning (ML) systems based on deep neural networks are more present than ever in software solutions for numerous industries. Their inner workings relying on models learning with data are as helpful as they are mysterious for non-expert people. There is an increasing need to make the design and development of those solutions accessible to a more general public while at the same time making them easier to explore. In this paper, to address this need, we discuss a proposition of a new assisted approach, centered on the downstream task to be performed, for helping practitioners to start using and applying Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This proposal, supported by an initial testbed UI prototype, uses an externalized form of knowledge, where JSON files compile different pipeline metadata information with their respective related artifacts (e.g., model code, the dataset to be loaded, good hyperparameter choices) that are presented as the user interacts with a conversational agent to suggest candidate solutions for a given task.
