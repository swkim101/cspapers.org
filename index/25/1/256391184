Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic protocol that allows one party to prove the correctness of a statement to another party without revealing any information beyond the correctness of the statement itself. It guarantees computation integrity and confidentiality, and is therefore increasingly adopted in industry for a variety of privacy-preserving applications, such as verifiable outsource computing and digital currency. A significant obstacle in using ZKP for online applications is the performance overhead of its proof generation. We develop GZKP, a GPU accelerated zero-knowledge proof system that supports different levels of security requirements and brings significant speedup toward making ZKP truly usable. For polynomial computation over a large finite field, GZKP promotes a cache-friendly memory access pattern while eliminating the costly external shuffle in existing solutions. For multi-scalar multiplication, GZKP adopts a new parallelization strategy, which aggressively combines integer elliptic curve point operations and exploits fine-grained task parallelism with load balancing for sparse integer distribution. GZKP outperforms the state-of-the-art ZKP systems by an order of magnitude, achieving up to 48.1× and 17.6× speedup with standard cryptographic benchmarks and a real-world application workload, respectively.
