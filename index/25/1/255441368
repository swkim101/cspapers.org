Research in hardware and software support for Virtual Reality (VR) has significantly increased over the last decade. Given the software platform fragmentation and hardware volatility, there is an apparent disconnect among practitioners while building applications in the VR domain. This paper proposes a role-based model template as a meta-model to specify the bare minimum VR software system. We conducted a grounded-theory-based qualitative study on prevailing and phased-out VR SDKs and standards to propose this meta-model. This model template can help VR practitioners build open-source tools to develop, design, and test VR software systems.
