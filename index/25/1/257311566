Collaborative question generation and mapping by students has been shown to improve students' active (engaged) and meaningful learning. In implementing these methods into a course that enabled high levels of autonomy (as recommended by Self-determination theory), we found student procrastination to be a persistent problem. Since student contribution tends to wane over the course of a semester, the efficacy of a curriculum reliant on content generation similarly wanes. We describe our efforts in reducing procrastination in a course focused on collaborative question generation and mapping, using an iterative design research methodology, over eight months of two semesters. To encourage students to create high-quality questions, we implemented a voting system that graded students based on the number of instructor up-votes given to questions they created. While this reduced procrastination early on, students found ways to take advantage of the autonomy provided by the course curriculum, leading them to resume procrastinating. To address this issue, we adjusted the grading schema for the second semester by scoring both students' and instructors' up-votes, while also allowing students to present their created content in optional weekly meetings. The introduction of optional weekly meetings had the greatest effect towards decreasing procrastination. End-of-semester surveys reported that: 1) while students enjoyed both semesters, they gave more positive feedback for the second semester; 2) student-led discussions for personally created content, when combined with the autonomy to choose both the topic and time to study, helped their learning and time management skills.
