This paper proposes a teleoperation framework to exploit the maximum manipulation capability during teleoperation. Here, exploiting maximum manipulation capacity means that the robot moves with its maximum control input while not violating the given constraints, and it is a nonlinear optimization problem with nonlinear constraints which is hard to be solved. The proposed framework relaxes the optimization problem into a simple QP problem and unifies the various constraints in the joint configuration space and Cartesian task space by utilizing control barrier function and control Lyapunov function techniques. The joint angle, velocity, acceleration limits are imposed on a teleoperated robot so that the robot does not generate any emergency stop during the teleoperation. Especially, the robot shows stable motion even near the kinematic singularity, so the operator can explore almost every reachable and admissible state of the robot via teleoperation.
