Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and data mining to security and privacy problems. The analytic tools and intelligent behavior provided by these techniques make AI and ML increasingly important for autonomous real-time analysis and decision making in domains with a wealth of data or that require quick reactions to constantly changing situations. The use of learning methods in security-sensitive domains, in which adversaries may attempt to mislead or evade intelligent machines, creates new frontiers for security research. The recent widespread adoption of "deep learning" techniques, whose security properties are difficult to reason about directly, has only added to the importance of this research. In addition, data mining and machine learning techniques create a wealth of privacy issues, due to the abundance and accessibility of data. The AISec workshop provides a venue for presenting and discussing new developments in the intersection of security and privacy with AI and machine learning.
