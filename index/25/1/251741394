While smart mobile health apps that adapt to usersâ€™ progressive individual needs are proliferating, many of them struggle to fulfill their promises due to an inferior user experience. Understanding the concerns of real-world users related to those apps, and their smart components in particular, could help advance the app design to attract and retain users. In this paper, we target this issue through a preliminary thematic analysis of 120 user reviews of six smart health apps. We found that accuracy, customizability, and convenience of data input are primary concerns raised in real-world user reviews. Many concerns on the smart components are related to the trust issue of the users towards the apps. However, several important aspects such as privacy and fairness were rarely discussed in the reviews. Overall, our study provides insights that can inspire further investigations to support the design of smart mobile health apps.
