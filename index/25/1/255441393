Virtual Reality (VR) technology has been utilized in other fields besides gaming, such as education, training, arts, shopping, and e-commerce. However, the technical support of VR software is not growing as fast as its market size, especially for testing. Because of the immersive feature that requires VR apps to act and react to all the interactions dynamically, the traditional static testing techniques such as unit test generation cannot fully guarantee the correctness of the tested functions. In this paper, we proposed a Dynamic Testing Recommendation tool (DyTRec) to suggest the potential types of dynamic testing for the target VR projects. Specifically, we categorize the dynamic testing types by analyzing the official APIs from the VR engine documentation and then apply the extracting and searching on all VR script files. We evaluated DyTRec on 20 VR projects and successfully reported 39 suggested results.
