Research Problem. The CAPE Framework has been used in multiple studies to situate capacity-building efforts within schools to offer equitable student access to and participation in K-12 computer science (CS) education. CAPE defines four major components of capacity, access, participation and experience. However, to define what each of the CAPE components can entail, well-defined subcomponents are needed. Research Question. Our research questions for this study were: What are the possible subcomponents for Capacity in the CAPE framework? and How feasible is it to use the newly defined subcomponents in a gap analysis study? Methodology. We conducted a qualitative content analysis by creating a codebook from an existing data framework and literature review. We reframed earlier findings on factors that influence student learning and academic achievement into the CAPE. Findings. We vetted an expanded framework that includes eight Capacity subcomponents, a third (categories) layer and a fourth (subcategories) layer that can be used to disaggregate the many elements that comprise Capacity. For our trial analysis of 196 articles, we added several codes at the category and subcategory level, but found no gaps in the codes for our a priori defined subcomponents. Implications. The extended Capacity framework can be used by others to inform its usage and develop a consensus of what is included within each subcomponent for Capacity, develop instrumentation and protocols for exploring Capacity at a more granular level, conduct scoping and literature reviews, and understand how various variables play a part in the CS educational ecosystem.
