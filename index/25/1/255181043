It has been shown that changing the coordinates describing a multi-body system to use absolute rather than relative angles produces a significant improvement in the tractability of trajectory optimization problems. This simplifies the equations of motion when modelling long kinematic chains. In this paper, we extend this idea by investigating whether a maximal coordinate system, which also describes the translational position of bodies using absolute coordinates, might lead to further performance improvements. We compare it to the relative translation, absolute orientation (RTAO) coordinate scheme using a batch of trajectory optimization trials selected with contact-implicit legged locomotion applications in mind. We find that maximal coordinates tend to shorten solving times for spatial problems, while the RTAO formulation still performs best in the case of planar motion.
