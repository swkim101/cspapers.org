Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) extrapolation reasoning predicts future events based on historical information, which has great research significance and broad application value. Existing methods can be divided into embedding-based methods and logical rule-based methods. Embedding-based methods rely on learned entity and relation embeddings to make predictions and thus lack interpretability. Logical rule-based methods bring scalability problems due to being limited by the learned logical rules. We combine the two methods to capture deep causal logic by learning rule embeddings, and propose an interpretable model for temporal knowledge graph reasoning called adaptive logical rule embedding model for inductive reasoning (ALRE-IR). ALRE-IR can adaptively extract and assess reasons contained in historical events, and make predictions based on causal logic. Furthermore, we propose a one-class augmented matching loss for optimization. When evaluated on the ICEWS14, ICEWS0515 and ICEWS18 datasets, the performance of ALRE-IR outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines. The results also demonstrate that ALRE-IR still shows outstanding performance when transferred to related dataset with common relation vocabulary, indicating our proposed model has good zero-shot reasoning ability.
