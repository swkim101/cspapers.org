 Reconstruction of the pelvic region post the resection of pelvic bone sarcoma is vital for the rehabilitation and restoration of activities of daily living in patients. The prosthesis design should restore maximum functional outcomes for tumors that do not significantly decrease life expectancy. Currently, reconstruction methods use either bone grafts or prostheses. For tumors at regions such as the iliac wing and for young patients, there is minimal chance of bone grafts to remodel into the exact anatomy of the iliac wing. On the other hand, a customized pelvic prosthesis ensures restoration of the anatomical configuration and mechanical strength. A commercially available pelvic prosthesis is solid and is much stiffer than the bone leading to stress shielding effect and higher strains on the intact pelvic bone. This work proposes the design of a lightweight Ti6Al4V pelvic prosthesis for type-I resection due to a sarcoma at the iliac wing, which matches the exact anatomy of the resected pelvic bone. First, a compliance minimization problem subject to walking gait cycle loads with mass constraint equal to the mass of the resected iliac bone is solved using topology optimization. Then the density field from topology optimization is mapped into shell and lattice infills. Prosthesis designs with different lattice structures are subjected to a compression test simulation, and the heterogeneity of lattices on the structural performance of the prosthesis is studied. Thus, a lightweight prosthesis, similar in geometry, stiffness and mass to the natural iliac bone, is achieved with a decrease in stress shielding effect.
