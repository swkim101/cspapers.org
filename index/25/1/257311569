Computer Science (CS) courses classified as Career Technical Education (CTE) make up over half of all CS courses offered in high schools in California as of the 2018-2019 school year and are eligible for funding through CTE grants. There has been a growing focus on creating equitable access to CS as well as recommendations to use CTE funds for this purpose. This paper examines whether there is an increase in CS course offerings or CS enrollment as an effect of receiving CTE funding in California. Publicly available data from the California Department of Education (CDE) was used to conduct a two-way fixed effects analysis. Results indicate a null effect from these grants on CS course offerings and enrollment. These results raise questions as to other factors that might have played a larger role in the recent increase in CS course offerings and expansion of CS courses classified as CTE.
