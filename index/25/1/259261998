We present a neural network architecture designed to naturally learn a positional embedding and overcome the spectral bias towards lower frequencies faced by conventional implicit neural representation networks. Our proposed architecture, SPDER, is a simple MLP that uses an activation function composed of a sinusoidal multiplied by a sublinear function, called the damping function. The sinusoidal enables the network to automatically learn the positional embedding of an input coordinate while the damping passes on the actual coordinate value by preventing it from being projected down to within a finite range of values. Our results indicate that SPDERs speed up training by 10x and converge to losses 1,500-50,000x lower than that of the state-of-the-art for image representation. SPDER is also state-of-the-art in audio representation. The superior representation capability allows SPDER to also excel on multiple downstream tasks such as image super-resolution and video frame interpolation. We provide intuition as to why SPDER significantly improves fitting compared to that of other INR methods while requiring no hyperparameter tuning or preprocessing.
