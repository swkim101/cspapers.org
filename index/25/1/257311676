Over the last decade, substantial strides have been made in the CS for All movement, with the widespread the enactment of policies that promote the implementation of CS education in K-12 schools. Despite this progress, at the current rate of growth, it is estimated that it will take four decades to actually reach CS for all students. This sobering finding highlights the urgent need to understand why so many schools are lagging in implementation, and to identify solutions that could address this gap. Using school-level survey data and administrative school records, we investigate the barriers to scaling up CS education in New York City. Common to many school reform initiatives, some schools were early adopters and eagerly embraced the call to provide CS to all students. Others, despite years of effort and support, have yet to offer CS or serve a small percentage of their enrollment. Our findings suggest that while "normative'' perceptions of CS (e.g., beliefs about it's value) are similar among lower- and higher-implementing schools, some "technical'' challenges-such as lacking an implementation plan and shared school-wide vision for CS-and "political'' challenges-such as the lack of support from administrators, are greater for schools struggling to offer CS. Though these findings focus on one district, they are relevant to the many others engaged in CS for all efforts. This study builds on previous research by shedding light on the distinct challenges and needs of "lagging'' schools, and provides insight into effective strategies for bringing CS education to all.
