Most learning-based approaches to category-level 6D pose estimation are design around normalized object coordinate space (NOCS). While being successful, NOCS-based methods become inaccurate and less robust when handling objects of a category containing significant intra-category shape variations. This is because the object coordinates induced by global and rigid alignment of objects are semantically incoherent, making the coordinate regression hard to learn and generalize. We propose Semantically-aware Object Coordinate Space (SOCS) built by warping-and-aligning the objects guided by a sparse set of keypoints with semantically meaningful correspondence. SOCS is semantically coherent: Any point on the surface of a object can be mapped to a semantically meaningful location in SOCS, allowing for accurate pose and size estimation under large shape variations. To learn effective coordinate regression to SOCS, we propose a novel multi-scale coordinatebased attention network. Evaluations demonstrate that our method is easy to train, well-generalizing for large intracategory shape variations and robust to inter-object occlusions.
