NLP has advanced greatly together with the proliferation of Transformer-based pre-trained language models. To adapt to a downstream task, the pre-trained language models need to be fine-tuned with a sufficient supply of annotated examples. In recent years, Adapter-based fine-tuning methods have expanded the applicability of pre-trained language models by substantially lowering the required amount of annotated examples. However, existing Adapter-based methods still fail to yield meaningful results in the few-shot regime where only a few annotated examples are provided. In this study, we present a meta-learning-driven low-rank adapter pooling method, called AMAL, for leveraging pre-trained language models even with just a few data points. We evaluate our method on five text classification benchmark datasets. The results show that AMAL significantly outperforms previous few-shot learning methods and achieves a new state-of-the-art.
