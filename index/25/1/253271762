Real-time embedded systems require sufficient re-sources to meet the applicationâ€™s requirements. This often creates over-provisioning of resources, increasing the unused resources and overall costs. Determining optimal resource supply is essential to avoid over-resource provisioning. Existing research works lack consideration of finding the optimized supply of resources to meet the workload demand during any time intervals. Therefore, we propose a resource-aware optimization model to minimize the resource provision in any periodic task model. The proposed approach exploits the supply and demand bound functions to reduce resource over-provisioning while guaranteeing task deadlines. The preliminary experimental results show the benefits of our proposed approach for enhancing resource usage.
