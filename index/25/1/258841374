Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved excellent performance in a variety of evaluation benchmarks, they still struggle in complex reasoning tasks which require specific knowledge and multi-hop reasoning. To improve the reasoning abilities, we propose \textbf{ChatCoT}, a tool-augmented chain-of-thought reasoning framework for chat-based LLMs. In ChatCoT, we model the chain-of-thought~(CoT) reasoning as multi-turn conversations, to utilize tools in a more natural way through chatting. At each turn, LLMs can either interact with tools or perform the reasoning. Our approach can effectively leverage the multi-turn conversation ability of chat-based LLMs, and integrate the thought chain following and tools manipulation in a unified way. Specially, we initialize the early turns of the conversation by the tools, tasks and reasoning format, and propose an iterative \emph{tool-augmented reasoning} step to perform step-by-step tool-augmented reasoning. The experiment results on two complex reasoning datasets (MATH and HotpotQA) have shown the effectiveness of ChatCoT on complex reasoning tasks, achieving a 6.8\% relative improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline.
