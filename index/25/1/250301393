This demo paper presents a design and implementation of a system AnomalyKiTS for detecting anomalies from time series data for the purpose of offering a broad range of algorithms to the end user, with special focus on unsupervised/semi-supervised learning. Given an input time series, AnomalyKiTS provides four categories of model building capabilities followed by an enrichment module that helps to label anomaly. AnomalyKiTS also supports a wide range of execution engines to meet the diverse need of anomaly workloads such as Serveless for CPU intensive work, GPU for deep-learning model training, etc.
