Being extremely dominated by men, software development organizations lack diversity. People from other groups often encounter sexist, misogynistic, and discriminatory (SMD) speech during communication. To identify SMD contents, I aim to build an automatic misogyny identification (AMI) tool for the domain of software developers. On this goal, I built a dataset of 10,138 pull request comments mined from Github based on a keyword-based selection, followed by manual validation. Using ten-fold cross-validation, I evaluated ten machine learning algorithms for automatic identification. The best performing model achieved 80% precision, 67.07% recall, 72.5% f-score, and 95.96% accuracy.
