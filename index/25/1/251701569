Multi-Manned Two-Sided Assembly Line Worker Assignment and Balancing Problem (MTALWABP) is typically used in the production of large-size and high-volume products such as the automotive industry. In this paper, we address the problem of balancing two-sided assembly lines with skilled workers. Two new mathematical models were developed to solve this problem. The first model has as objective the minimization of the line cycle time. The second one aims to minimize the number of stations and mated-stations. In order to test the performance of these two mathematical models, an experimental study was carried out under IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.6.
