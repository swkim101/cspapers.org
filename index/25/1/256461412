Recent work has demonstrated that entity representations can be extracted from pre-trained language models to develop knowledge graph completion models that are more robust to the naturally occurring sparsity found in knowledge graphs. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of how to best extract and incorporate those embeddings into knowledge graph completion models. We explore the suitability of the extracted embeddings for direct use in entity ranking and introduce both unsupervised and supervised processing methods that can lead to improved downstream performance. We then introduce supervised embedding extraction methods that can extract more informative representations. We then synthesize our findings and develop a knowledge graph completion model that significantly outperforms recent neural models.
