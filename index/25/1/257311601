Spaceflight is risky and the training needed by astronauts to prepare for flight is demanding. Technical skills - robotics, space walking, rendezvous and assembly - are acquired in the years prior to launch through rigorous and realistic simulator-based training. Interestingly, many of the non-technical skills - self-management, teamwork, leadership - can be nurtured earlier in the life of an astronaut - even during grade school and university. Robert Thirsk will reminisce about several beloved educators of his youth who influenced and guided him on his trajectory to space. He will recount pivotal moments in his post-secondary education. While Robert is not a pedagogical specialist, he will also share his perspectives on science education and cross-disciplinary collaboration, as well as lessons that can be learned through failure.
