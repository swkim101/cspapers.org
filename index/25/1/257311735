There is a great need to train future software developers in accessibility, and disability simulations can be a powerful way to engage students. In this work, we evaluate the effects of disability simulation games on student empathy and design choices. To do this we recruited 124 students and randomized them into two conditions: students playing simulation games and a control group of students who learned accessibility topics through a video lecture and readings. Although the accessibility lecture and readings were effective at inspiring student empathy towards people with disabilities, the effects were short-lived; in contrast, the simulations inspired greater and longer-lasting empathy and consideration of people with disabilities. However, more work should be done to determine whether these gains influence students' inclusion of people with disabilities in practice.
