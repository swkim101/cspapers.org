Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have recently been employed for image deblurring, formulated as an image-conditioned generation process that maps Gaussian noise to the high-quality image, conditioned on the blurry input. Image-conditioned DPMs (icDPMs) have shown more realistic results than regression-based methods when trained on pairwise in-domain data. However, their robustness in restoring images is unclear when presented with out-of-domain images as they do not impose specific degradation models or intermediate constraints. To this end, we introduce a simple yet effective multiscale structure guidance as an implicit bias that informs the icDPM about the coarse structure of the sharp image at the intermediate layers. This guided formulation leads to a significant improvement of the deblurring results, particularly on unseen domain. The guidance is extracted from the latent space of a regression network trained to predict the clean-sharp target at multiple lower resolutions, thus maintaining the most salient sharp structures. With both the blurry input and multiscale guidance, the icDPM model can better understand the blur and recover the clean image. We evaluate a single-dataset trained model on diverse datasets and demonstrate more robust deblurring results with fewer artifacts on unseen data. Our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art perceptual quality while keeping competitive distortion metrics.
