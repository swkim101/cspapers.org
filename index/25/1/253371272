These proceedings contain the papers selected for inclusion in the technical program for the 21st ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society (WPES 2022), held in conjunction with the 29th ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security (CCS 2022). This year, WPES is held as a hybrid event (including both in-person and online presentations) on November 7, 2022. In response to the workshop's call for papers, 59 valid submissions were received. These 59 submissions include 43 submissions as full papers and 16 submissions as short papers. They were evaluated by a technical program committee consisting of 51 researchers whose backgrounds include a diverse set of topics related to privacy. Each paper was reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee, and the average number of reviews for each paper is 3.75. Papers were evaluated based on their importance, novelty, and technical quality. After the rigorous review process, 12 submissions were accepted as full papers (acceptance rate: 20.3%) and additionally 8 submissions were accepted as short papers.
