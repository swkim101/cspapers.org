Mean-field games have been used as a theoretical tool to obtain an approximate Nash equilibrium for symmetric and anonymous $N$-player games. However, limiting applicability, existing theoretical results assume variations of a"population generative model", which allows arbitrary modifications of the population distribution by the learning algorithm. Moreover, learning algorithms typically work on abstract simulators with population instead of the $N$-player game. Instead, we show that $N$ agents running policy mirror ascent converge to the Nash equilibrium of the regularized game within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples from a single sample trajectory without a population generative model, up to a standard $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ error due to the mean field. Taking a divergent approach from the literature, instead of working with the best-response map we first show that a policy mirror ascent map can be used to construct a contractive operator having the Nash equilibrium as its fixed point. We analyze single-path TD learning for $N$-agent games, proving sample complexity guarantees by only using a sample path from the $N$-agent simulator without a population generative model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows for independent learning by $N$ agents with finite sample guarantees.
