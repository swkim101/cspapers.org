We present a data structure that for a dynamic graph G that is updated by edge insertions and deletions, maintains a tree decomposition of G of width at most $6 k+5$ under the promise that the treewidth of G never grows above k. The amortized update time is $\mathcal{O}_{k}\left(2^{\sqrt{\log n} \log \log n}\right)$, where n is the vertex count of G and the $\mathcal{O}_{k}(\cdot)$ notation hides factors depending on k. In addition, we also obtain the dynamic variant of Courcelleâ€™s Theorem: for any fixed property $\varphi$ expressible in the CMSO2 logic, the data structure can maintain whether G satisfies $\varphi$ within the same time complexity bounds. To a large extent, this answers a question posed by Bodlaender [WG 1993].
