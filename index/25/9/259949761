Recommender system (RS) is widely applied in a multitude of scenarios to aid individuals obtaining the information they require efficiently. At the same time, the prevalence of popularity bias in such systems has become a widely acknowledged issue. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method named Model-Agnostic Popularity Debias Training Framework (MDTF). It consists of two basic modules including 1) General Ranking Model (GRM), which is model-agnostic and can be implemented as any ranking models; and 2) Popularity Debias Module (PDM), which estimates the impact of the competitiveness and popularity of candidate items on the CTR, by utilizing the feedback of cold-start users to re-weigh the loss in GRM. MDTF seamlessly integrates these two modules in an end-to-end multi-task learning framework. Extensive experiments on both real-world offline dataset and online A/B test demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.
