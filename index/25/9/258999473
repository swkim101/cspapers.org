PyTorch has ascended as a premier machine learning framework, yet it lacks a native and comprehensive library for decision and control tasks suitable for large development teams dealing with complex real-world data and environments. To address this issue, we propose TorchRL, a generalistic control library for PyTorch that provides well-integrated, yet standalone components. We introduce a new and flexible PyTorch primitive, the TensorDict, which facilitates streamlined algorithm development across the many branches of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and control. We provide a detailed description of the building blocks and an extensive overview of the library across domains and tasks. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate its reliability and flexibility and show comparative benchmarks to demonstrate its computational efficiency. TorchRL fosters long-term support and is publicly available on GitHub for greater reproducibility and collaboration within the research community. The code is open-sourced on GitHub.
