We propose a method for robotic control of deformable objects using a learned nonlinear dynamics model. After collecting a dataset of trajectories from the real system, we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) to approximate its input-output behavior with a latent state-space model. The RNN internal state is low-dimensional enough to enable realtime nonlinear control methods. We demonstrate a closed-loop control scheme with the RNN model using a standard nonlinear state observer and model-predictive controller. We apply our method to track a highly dynamic trajectory with a point on the deformable object, in real time and on real hardware. Our experiments show that the RNN model captures the true system's frequency response and can be used to track trajectories outside the training distribution. In an ablation study, we find that the full method improves tracking accuracy compared to an open-loop version without the state observer.
