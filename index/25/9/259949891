A challenge for search technologies is to support scientific literature surveys that present overviews of the reported numerical values documented for specific physical properties. We present SciHarvester, a system tailored to address this problem for agronomic science. It provides an interface to search PubAg documents, allowing complex queries involving restrictions on numerical values. SciHarvester identifies relevant documents and generates overview of reported parameter values. The system allows interrogation of the results to explain the system's performance. Our evaluations demonstrate the promise of incorporating information extraction techniques with the use of neural scoring mechanisms.
