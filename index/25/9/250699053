. Although much progress has been made in 3D clothed human reconstruction, most of the existing methods fail to produce robust results from in-the-wild images, which contain diverse human poses and appearances. This is mainly due to the large domain gap between training datasets and in-the-wild datasets. The training datasets are usually synthetic ones, which contain rendered images from GT 3D scans. How-ever, such datasets contain simple human poses and less natural image appearances compared to those of real in-the-wild datasets, which makes generalization of it to in-the-wild images extremely challenging. To resolve this issue, in this work, we propose ClothWild, a 3D clothed human reconstruction framework that firstly addresses the robustness on in-the-wild images. First, for the robustness to the domain gap, we propose a weakly supervised pipeline that is trainable with 2D supervision targets of in-the-wild datasets. Second, we design a DensePose-based loss function to reduce ambiguities of the weak supervision. Extensive empirical tests on several public in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that our proposed ClothWild produces much more accurate and robust results than the state-of-the-art methods. The codes are available in here. steps: cloth-to-body mapping, query point selection, and loss calculation.
