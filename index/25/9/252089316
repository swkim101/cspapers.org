This paper presents a method for the robust selection of measurements in a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework. Existing methods check consistency or compatibility on a pairwise basis, however many measurement types are not sufficiently constrained in a pairwise scenario to determine if either measurement is inconsistent with the other. This paper presents group-$k$ consistency maximization ($\mathrm{G}k\text{CM}$) that estimates the largest set of measurements that is internally group-$k$ consistent. Solving for the largest set of group-$k$ consistent measurements can be formulated as an instance of the maximum clique problem on generalized graphs and can be solved by adapting current methods. This paper evaluates the performance of $\mathrm{G}k\text{CM}$ using simulated data and compares it to pairwise consistency maximization (PCM) presented in previous work.
