Recent advancements toward perception and decision-making of flexible endoscopes have shown great potential in computer-aided surgical interventions. However, owing to modeling uncertainty and inter-patient anatomical variation in flexible endoscopy, the challenge remains for efficient and safe navigation in patient-specific scenarios. This paper presents a novel data-driven framework with self-contained visual-shape fusion for autonomous intelligent navigation of flexible endoscopes requiring no priori knowledge of system models and global environments. A learning-based adaptive visual servoing controller is proposed to online update the eye-in-hand vision-motor configuration and steer the endoscope, which is guided by monocular depth estimation via a vision transformer (ViT). To prevent unnecessary and excessive interactions with surrounding anatomy, an energy-motivated shape planning algorithm is introduced through entire endoscope 3-D proprioception from embedded fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. Furthermore, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy is developed to minimize the elastic potential energy flow and simultaneously optimize the steering policy. Dedicated navigation experiments on a robotic-assisted flexible endoscope with an FBG fiber in several phantom environments demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed framework.
