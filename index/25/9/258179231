Sentence encoders have indeed been shown to achieve superior performances for many downstream text-mining tasks and, thus, claimed to be fairly general. Inspired by this, we performed a detailed study on how to leverage these sentence encoders for the"zero-shot topic inference"task, where the topics are defined/provided by the users in real-time. Extensive experiments on seven different datasets demonstrate that Sentence-BERT demonstrates superior generality compared to other encoders, while Universal Sentence Encoder can be preferred when efficiency is a top priority.
