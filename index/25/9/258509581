Discovering cause and effect variables from observational data is an important but challenging problem in science and engineering. In this work, a recently proposed brain inspired learning algorithm namely-Neurochaos Learning (NL) is used for the classification of cause and effect time series generated using coupled autoregressive processes, coupled 1D chaotic skew tent maps, coupled 1D chaotic logistic maps and a real-world prey-predator system. In the case of coupled skew tent maps, the proposed method consistently outperforms a five layer Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for unidirectional coupling coefficient values ranging from 0 . 1 to 0 . 7 . Further, we investigate the preservation of causality in the feature extracted space of NL using Granger Causality for coupled autoregressive processes and Compression-Complexity Causality for coupled chaotic systems and real-world prey-predator dataset. Unlike DNN, LSTM and 1D Convolutional Neural Network, it is found that NL preserves the inherent causal structures present in the input timeseries data. These findings are promising for the theory and applications of causal machine learning and open up the possibility to explore the potential of NL for more sophisticated causal learning tasks.
