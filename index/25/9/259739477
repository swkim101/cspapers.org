Deepfake brings huge and potential negative impacts to our daily lives. As the real-life Deepfake videos circulated on the Internet become more authentic, most existing detection algorithms have failed since few visual differences can be observed between an authentic video and a Deepfake one. However, the forensic traces are always retained within the synthesized videos. In this study, we present a noise-based Deepfake detection model, NoiseDF for short, which focuses on the underlying forensic noise traces left behind the Deepfake videos. In particular, we enhance the RIDNet denoiser to extract noise traces and features from the cropped face and background squares of the video image frames. Meanwhile, we devise a novel Multi-Head Relative-Interaction method to evaluate the degree of interaction between the faces and backgrounds that plays a pivotal role in the Deepfake detection task. Besides outperforming the state-of-the-art models, the visualization of the extracted Deepfake forensic noise traces has further displayed the evidence and proved the robustness of our approach.
