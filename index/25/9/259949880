Session search is a widely adopted technique in search engines that seeks to leverage the complete interaction history of a search session to better understand the information needs of users and provide more relevant ranking results. The vast majority of existing methods model a search session as a sequence of queries and previously clicked documents. However, if we simply represent a search session as a sequence we will lose the topological information in the original search session. It is non-trivial to model the intra-session interactions and complicated structural patterns among the previously issued queries, clicked documents, as well as the terms or entities that appeared in them. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Session Search with Graph Classification Model (SSGC), which regards session search as a graph classification task on a heterogeneous graph that represents the search history in each session. To improve the performance of the graph classification, we design a specific pre-training strategy for our proposed GNN-based classification model. Extensive experiments on two public session search datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in the session search task.
