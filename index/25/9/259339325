This paper investigates the problem of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV s) motion planning with posture constraints and the problem of the more general symmetrical situations where UAVs have more than one optimal solution. In this paper, the posture constraints are formulated in the 3D Dubins method, and the symmetrical situations are overcome by a more collaborative strategy called the shunted strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated by conducting extensive simulation experiments. Meanwhile, we compared the proposed method with the other state-of-the-art methods, and the comparison results show that the proposed method advances the previous works. Finally, the practicability of the proposed algorithm was analyzed by the statistic in computational cost. The source code of our method can be available at https://github.com/wuuya1/SCA.
