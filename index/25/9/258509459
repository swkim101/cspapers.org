Comparison against SPD Neural Networks For SPDNet and SPDNetBN, we compute a covariance matrix to represent an input sequence as in [20]. The sizes of the covariance matrices are respectively 93× 93, 60× 60, and 150× 150 for HDM05, FPHA, and NTU60 datasets. The sizes of the transformation matrices for the experiments on FPHA dataset are set to 60× 50, 50× 40, 40× 30, respectively. The sizes of the transformation matrices for the experiments on NTU60 dataset are set to 150× 100, 100× 60, 60× 30, respectively.
