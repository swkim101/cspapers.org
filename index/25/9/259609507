Quality estimation (QE) aims to assess the quality of machine translations when reference translations are unavailable. QE plays a crucial role in many real-world applications of machine translation. Because labeled QE data are usually limited in scale, recent research, such as DirectQE, pre-trains QE models with pseudo QE data and obtains remarkable performance. However, there tends to be inevitable noise in the pseudo data, hindering models from learning QE accurately. Our study shows that the noise mainly comes from the differences between pseudo and real translation outputs. To handle this problem, we propose CLQE, a denoising pre-training framework for QE based on curriculum learning. More specifically, we propose to measure the degree of noise in the pseudo QE data with some metrics based on statistical or distributional features. With the guidance of these metrics, CLQE gradually pre-trains the QE model using data from cleaner to noisier. Experiments on various benchmarks reveal that CLQE outperforms DirectQE and other strong baselines. We also show that with our framework, pre-training converges faster than directly using the pseudo data. We make our CLQE code available (https://github.com/NJUNLP/njuqe).
