Search engines and conversational assistants are commonly used to help users complete their every day tasks such as booking travel, cooking, etc. While there are some existing datasets that can be used for this purpose, their coverage is limited to very few domains. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge base, ‘Task2KB’, which is constructed using data crawled from WikiHow, an online knowledge resource offering instructional articles on a wide range of tasks. Task2KB encapsulates various types of task-related information and attributes, such as requirements, detailed step description, and available methods to complete tasks. Due to its higher coverage compared to existing related knowledge graphs, Task2KB can be highly useful in the development of general purpose task completion assistants.
