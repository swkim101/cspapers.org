This paper discusses the tele-operation system for multiple mobile manipulators. If a single person could freely tele-operate multiple mobile manipulators simultaneously, it would be a great step toward the goal of “avatar-symbiotic society” allowing people to live beyond the constraints of their bodies, space, and time. At present, however, such a tele-operation system has not been developed. Therefore, we built a prototype system to tele-operate two mobile manipulators and conducted a subject experiment on a pick-and-place task to investigate the tele-operator's task performance, workload and gaze behavior. By analyzing these results, we obtained guidelines to design tele-operation system for multiple robots.
