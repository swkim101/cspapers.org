It is critical to perceive physical contact for intelligent robots to safely interact in dynamic, unstructured environments. As physical contacts can occur at any location, a well-performing tactile sensing system should be able to deploy a large area on robotic surface. Some researchers have implemented large-area tactile sensors by using sensing arrays, but it is challenging to deploy many sensing elements. Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) has recently been introduced into tactile sensing to overcome some of the limitations with conventional tactile sensing arrays, and good results have been achieved for some robotic applications. However, a particular challenge is that spatial resolution is low. Although various attempts have been made to improve the performance of ERT-based tactile sensors, the intrinsic resolution issue remains unsolved. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive optimal drive strategy for efficient ERT-based large-area tactile sensing for robotic applications, which can adaptively select the current injection and voltage measurement pattern for optimal tactile stimulus. In particular, regions of tactile contacts are preliminarily detected and localized by a base scanning pattern with only a few measurement data. According to this detected region, the adaptive strategy can select the optimal current injection and voltage measurement pattern to improve the sensing performance by maximizing the current density. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, the proposed method is comprehensively evaluated by simulation and experiments. The results revealed that the optimal strategy can effectively improve both spatial and temporal resolution.
