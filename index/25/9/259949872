Knowledge graph embedding aims at modeling knowledge by projecting entities and relations into a low-dimensional semantic space. Most of the works on knowledge graph embedding construct negative samples by negative sampling as knowledge graphs typically only contain positive facts. Although substantial progress has been made by dynamic distribution based sampling methods, selecting plausible and prior information-engaged negative samples still poses many challenges. Inspired by type constraint methods, we propose Hierarchical Type Enhanced Negative Sampling (HTENS) which leverages hierarchical entity type information and entity-relation cooccurrence information to optimize the sampling probability distribution of negative samples. The experiments performed on the link prediction task demonstrate the effectiveness of HTENS. Additionally, HTENS shows its superiority in versatility and can be integrated into scalable systems with enhanced negative sampling.
