Automated recruitment tools are proliferating. While having the promise of improving efficiency, various risks, including bias, challenges the potential of these tools. An in-depth understanding of the perceived risk factors and needs from the perspective of both recruiters and job seekers is needed. We address this through an interview study in the high-tech industry to compare and contrast the concerns of these two roles. We found that the importance of clarifying position requirements and assessing candidates as “whole individuals” are commonly discussed by both recruiters and job seekers. In contrast, while recruiters tended to be more aware of cognitive bias and desired more tool support during interviews, job seekers voiced more desire towards a healthy candidate-company relationship. Additionally, both roles considered the uncertainty of the current technology capability and reduced human contact as concerns for using automated tools. Based on these results, we provided design implications for automated recruitment tools and related decision-support technologies.
