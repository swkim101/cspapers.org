Spike camera is an emerging bio-inspired vision sensor with ultra-high temporal resolution. It records scenes by accumulating photons and outputting continuous binary spike streams. Optical flow is a key task for spike cameras and their applications. A previous attempt has been made for spike-based optical flow. However, the previous work only focuses on motion between two moments, and it uses graphics-based data for training, whose generalization is limited. In this paper, we propose a tailored network, Spike2Flow that extracts information from binary spikes with temporal-spatial representation based on the differential of spike firing time and spatial information aggregation. The network utilizes continuous motion clues through joint correlation decoding. Besides, a new dataset with real-world scenes is proposed for better generalization. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing synthetic datasets and real data captured by spike cameras.
