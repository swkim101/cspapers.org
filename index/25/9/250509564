Navigation in close proximity with pedestrians is a challenge on the way to fully automated vehicles. Pedestrian-friendly navigation requires an understanding of pedestrian reaction and intention. Merely safety based reactive systems can lead to sub-optimal navigation solutions resulting in the freezing of the vehicle in many scenarios. Moreover, a strictly reactive method can produce unnatural driving patterns which cannot guarantee the legibility or social acceptance of the automated vehicle. This work presents a proactive maneuvering method adapted to navigation in close interaction with pedestrians using a dynamic channel approach. The method allows to proactively explore the navigation options based on anticipating pedestrians cooperation. The navigation is tested in frontal and lateral crossing scenarios with variable space density. The system is implemented under ROS, and compared with the probabilistic Risk-RRT planning method. The results are evaluated based on the safety and comfort of the pedestrians, and the quality of the vehicle's trajectory.
