Glass surfaces are omnipresent in our daily lives and often go unnoticed by the 1 majority of us. While humans are generally able to infer their locations and thus 2 avoid collisions, it can be difficult for current object detection systems to handle 3 them due to the transparent nature of glass surfaces. Previous methods approached 4 the problem by extracting global context information to obtain priors such as 5 boundary and reflection. However, their performances cannot be guaranteed when 6 these critical features are not available. We observe that humans often reason 7 through the semantic context of the environment, which offers insights into the 8 categories of and proximity between entities that are expected to appear in the 9 surrounding. For example, the odds of co-occurrence of glass windows with walls 10 and curtains is generally higher than that with other objects such as cars and trees, 11 which have relatively less semantic relevance. Based on this observation, we 12 propose a model that integrates the contextual relationship of the scene for glass 13 surface detection with two novel modules: (1) Scene Aware Activation (SAA) 14 Module to adaptively filter critical channels with respect to spatial and semantic 15 features, and (2) Context Correlation Attention (CCA) Module to progressively 16 learn the contextual correlations among objects both spatially and semantically. In 17 addition, we propose a large-scale glass surface detection dataset named GSD-S, 18 which contains 4,519 real-world RGB glass surface images from diverse real-19 world scenes with detailed annotations. Experimental results show that our model 20 outperforms contemporary works, especially with 48.8% improvement on MAE 21 from our proposed GSD-S dataset. 22
