Endotracheal intubation is a mandatory competency for most medical staff. This procedure involves opening the entrance of the patient's upper windpipe using a laryngoscope and then inserting a tube into the windpipe to supply Oxygen to the patient. This time critical intervention requires careful control of the force vector on the tongue to lift it parallel to the jaw than to push the jaw to open the mouth. However, traditional intubation training methods in which novices practice intubation on prostheses lack haptic feedback to improve force control. We designed a sensorised intubation training phantom that can provide trainees with vibrotactile feedback reflecting the laryngoscope's force on the tongue. The critical component of this phantom is a silicon rubber tongue embedded with magnets and hall effect sensors. We calibrated the hall effect sensor readings to predict the force vector exerted on the tongue with errors less than 0.5 N in the lifting and pushing directions. We conducted a controlled experiment, mainly comparing the training results between participants with and without haptic feedback. Results show a statistically significant drop in the undesired forces due to haptic feedback, and the skill is retained when tested after 24 hours without haptic feedback.
