In the deployment of real-world text classiﬁcation models, label scarcity is a common problem. As the number of classes increases, this problem becomes even more complex. One way to address this problem is by applying text augmentation methods. One of the more prominent methods involves using the text-generation capabilities of language models. We propose Text AUgmenta-tion by Dataset Reconstruction (TAU-DR), a novel method of data augmentation for text classiﬁcation. We conduct experiments on several multi-class datasets, showing that our approach improves the current state-of-the-art techniques for data augmentation.
