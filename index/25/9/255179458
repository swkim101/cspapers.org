Leveraging both the autonomy of robots and the expert knowledge of humans can enable a multi-robot system to complete missions in challenging environments with a high degree of adaptivity and robustness. This paper proposes a multi-modal task-based graphical user interface for controlling a heterogeneous multi-robot team. The core of the interface is an integrated multi-robot task allocation system to allow the user to encode his/her intents to guide the heterogeneous multi-robot team. The design of the interface aims to provide the human operator continuous situational awareness and effective control for rapid decision-making in time-critical missions. Team CSIRO Data61 came in second place utilizing this interface for the DARPA Subterranean (SubT) Challenge. The ideas used for this user interface can apply to other multi-robot applications.
