Our goal is to synthesize realistic underwater scenes with various fish species in different fish cages, which can be utilized to train computer vision models to automate fish counting task. It is a challenging problem to prepare a sufficiently diverse labeled dataset of images from aquatic environments. We solve this challenge by introducing an adaptive bio-inspired fish simulation. The behavior of caged fish changes based on the species, size and number of fish, and the size and shape of the cage, among other variables. In this paper, we propose a method for achieving schooling behavior for any given combination of variables, using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in various fish cages in arbitrary environments. Furthermore, to visually reproduce the underwater scene in different locations and seasons, we incorporate a physically-based underwater simulation.
