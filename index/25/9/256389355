We study first-order methods with preconditioning for solving structured nonlinear convex optimization problems. We propose a new family of preconditioners generated by symmetric polynomials. They provide first-order optimization methods with a provable improvement of the condition number, cutting the gaps between highest eigenvalues, without explicit knowledge of the actual spectrum. We give a stochastic interpretation of this preconditioning in terms of coordinate volume sampling and compare it with other classical approaches, including the Chebyshev polynomials. We show how to incorporate a polynomial preconditioning into the Gradient and Fast Gradient Methods and establish the corresponding global complexity bounds. Finally, we propose a simple adaptive search procedure that automatically chooses the best possible polynomial preconditioning for the Gradient Method, minimizing the objective along a low-dimensional Krylov subspace. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of our preconditioning strategies for solving various machine learning problems.
