We present a robust method to visually segment scenes into objects based on motion and appearance. Both these cues provide complementary information that we fuse using two interconnected recursive estimators: One estimates object segmentation from motion as a probabilistic clustering of tracked 3D points, and the other estimates object segmentation from appearance as a probabilistic image segmentation. The interconnected estimators provide a probabilistic and consistent object segmentation in real time, which makes them well suited for many downstream robotic tasks. We evaluate our method on one such task, kinematic structure estimation, on a dataset of interactions with articulated objects and show that our fusion improves object segmentation by 70% and in turn estimated kinematic joints by 26% over a purely motion-based approach. Furthermore, we show the necessity of probabilistic modeling for downstream robotic tasks, achieving 339% of the performance of a recent multimodal but deterministic RNN for object segmentation on the estimation of kinematic structure.
