Traditionally, monocular 3D human pose estimation employs a machine learning model to predict the most likely 3D pose for a given input image. However, a single image can be highly ambiguous and induces multiple plausible solutions for the 2D-3D lifting step, which results in overly confident 3D pose predictors. To this end, we propose DiffPose, a conditional diffusion model that predicts multiple hypotheses for a given input image. Compared to similar approaches, our diffusion model is straightforward and avoids intensive hyperparameter tuning, complex network structures, mode collapse, and unstable training. Moreover, we tackle the problem of over-simplification of the intermediate representation of the common two-step approaches which first estimate a distribution of 2D joint locations via joint-wise heatmaps and consecutively use their maximum argument for the 3D pose estimation step. Since such a simplification of the heatmaps removes valid information about possibly correct, though labeled unlikely, joint locations, we propose to represent the heatmaps as a set of 2D joint candidate samples. To extract information about the original distribution from these samples, we introduce our embedding transformer which conditions the diffusion model. Experimentally, we show that DiffPose improves upon the state of the art for multi-hypothesis pose estimation by 3-5% for simple poses and outperforms it by a large margin for highly ambiguous poses.1
