In the past few years we have developed hardware computing systems for commercial autonomous vehicles, but inevitably the high development cost and long turn-around time have been major roadblocks for commercial deployment. Hence we also explored the potential of software optimization. This paper, for the first-time, shows that it is feasible to enable full leve1-4 autonomous driving workloads on a single off-the-shelf card (Jetson AGX Xavier) for less than ${\$}1\mathrm{k}$, an order of magnitude less than the state-of-the-art systems, while meeting all the requirements of latency. The success comes from the resolution of some important issues shared by existing practices through a series of measures and innovations.
