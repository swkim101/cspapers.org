The complexity of industry-grade event-based datalakes grows dynamically each passing hour. Companies actively gather behavioral information on their customers, recording multiple types of events, such as clicks, likes, page views, card transactions, add-to-basket, or purchase events. In response to this, the Synerise Monad platform has been proposed. The primary focus of Monad is to produce Universal Behavioral Representations (UBRs) - large vectors encapsulating the behavioral patterns of each user. UBRs do not lose knowledge about individual events, in contrast to aggregated features or averaged embeddings. They are based on award-winning algorithms developed at Synerise - Cleora and EMDE - and allow to process real-life datasets composed of billions of events in record time. In this paper, we introduce a new aspect of Monad: private foundation models for behavioral data, trained on top of UBRs. The foundation models are trained in purely self-supervised manner and allow to exploit general knowledge about human behavior, which proves especially useful when multiple downstream models must be trained and time constraints are tight, or when labeled data is scarce. Experimental results show that the Monad foundation models can cut training time in half and require 3x less data to reach optimal results, often achieving state-of-the-art results.
