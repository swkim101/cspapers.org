This paper proposes a novel mathematical solution to solve the inverse kinematics (IK) of single section mobile continuum manipulators (SSMCMs). Thus, to achieve a given pose of the end-effector (EE), the proposed mathematical solution consists in determining the position and orientation parameters of the mobile platform and of a single section of the continuum manipulator. As advantages, the proposed mathematical solution eliminates the EE pose errors when the dynamic parameters are neglected and the continuum manipulator is cylindrical in shape. A simulation and an experiment validate the proposed approach.
