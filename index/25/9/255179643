Sound source separation is a method to extract a target sound source from a mixture of various sound sources and noises. One of the typical sound source separation methods is beamforming, which can separate sound sources by direction based on the phase difference between channels from the recorded signal of a microphone array, a multi-channel recording system. However, beamforming is a direction-based method and cannot separate multiple sources in the same direction. In this paper, we propose a method for separating sources in the same direction using multiple microphone arrays. The proposed method performs beamforming using multiple microphone arrays and extracts only the target sound source from the separated sound by the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), thus reducing the influence of other sources in the same direction. In this paper, to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted assuming the presence of another sound source in the same direction from an arbitrary microphone array. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the delay-sum method in a simulation environment. In addition, experiments were conducted in a real environment to verify the effect of reverberation.
