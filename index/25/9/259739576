Deep clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data mining that aims at learning clustering-oriented feature representations. In previous studies, most of deep clustering methods follow the idea of self-supervised representation learning by maximizing the consistency of all similar instance pairs while ignoring the effect of feature redundancy on clustering performance. In this paper, to address the above issue, we design a dual mutual information constrained clustering method named DMICC which is based on deep contrastive clustering architecture, in which the dual mutual information constraints are particularly employed with solid theoretical guarantees and experimental validations. Specifically, at the feature level, we reduce the redundancy among features by minimizing the mutual information across all the dimensionalities to encourage the neural network to extract more discriminative features. At the instance level, we maximize the mutual information of the similar instance pairs to obtain more unbiased and robust representations. The dual mutual information constraints happen simultaneously and thus complement each other to jointly optimize better features that are suitable for the clustering task. We also prove that our adopted mutual information constraints are superior in feature extraction, and the proposed dual mutual information constraints are clearly bounded and thus solvable. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms most other clustering algorithms. The code is available at https://github.com/Li-Hyn/DMICC.
