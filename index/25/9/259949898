Popularity detection of news articles is critical for making relevant recommendations for users and drive user engagement for maximum business value. Among several well-known metrics such as likes, shares, comments, Click-Through-Rate (CTR) has evolved as a default metric of popularity. However, CTR is highly influenced by the probability of news articles getting an impression, which in turn depends on the recommendation algorithm. Furthermore, it does not consider the age of the news articles, which are highly perishable and also misses out on human contextual behavioral preferences towards news. Here, we use the MIND dataset, open sourced by Microsoft to investigate the existing metrics of popularity and propose six new metrics. Our aim is to create awareness about the different perspectives of measuring popularity while discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed metrics with respect to the human click behavior. We evaluated the predictability of the proposed metrics in comparison to CTR prediction. We further evaluated the utility of the proposed metrics through different test cases. Our results indicate that by using appropriate popularity metrics, we can reduce the initial news corpus (item set) by 50% and still could achieve 99% of the total clicks as compared to unfiltered news corpus based recommender systems. Similarly, our results show that we can reduce the effective number of articles recommended per impression that could improve user experience with the news platforms. The metrics proposed in this paper can be useful in other contexts, especially in recommenders with perishable items e.g. video reels or blogs.
