This paper deals with the problem of incre- 001 mental dialect identification. Our goal is to 002 reliably determine the dialect before the full 003 utterance is given as input. The major part of 004 the previous research on dialect identification 005 has been model-centric with a focus on perfor- 006 mance. We address a new question: How much 007 input is needed to identify a dialect? Our ap- 008 proach is a data-centric analysis that results in 009 general criteria for finding the shortest input 010 needed to make a plausible guess. Working 011 with two sets of dialects (Swiss German and 012 Indo-Aryan languages), we show that the di- 013 alect can be identified well before the end of 014 the input utterance. To determine the optimal 015 point for making the first guess, we propose a 016 heuristic that involves calibrated model confi- 017 dence (temperature scaling) and input length. 018 We show that the same input shortening criteria 019 apply to both of our data sets. While the per- 020 formance with the early guesses is still below 021 the performance on the full input, the gap is 022 smaller when the overall performance of the 023 fine-tuned model is better 1 . 024
