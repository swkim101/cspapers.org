Cloud services have recently undergone a major shift from monolithic designs to microservices running on the cloud-native infrastructure, where monitoring systems are widely deployed to ensure the service level agreement (SLA). Nev-ertheless, the traditional monitoring system no longer fulﬁlls the demands of cloud-native monitoring, which is observed from the practical experience in Alibaba cloud. Speciﬁcally, the monitor occupies resources ( e.g. , CPU) of the monitored infrastructure, disturbing services running on it. For example, enabling monitor causes jitters/declines of online services in Alibaba’s “double eleven” shopping festival with high loads. On the other hand, the quality of service (QoS) of monitoring itself, which is vital to track and ensure SLA, is not guaranteed with the high loaded system. In this paper, we design and implement a novel monitoring system, named Z ERO , for cloud-native monitoring. First, Z ERO achieves zero overhead to collect raw metrics from the monitored hosts using one-sided remote direct memory access (RDMA) operations, thus avoiding any interferences to cloud services. Second, Z ERO adopts receiver-driven model to collect monitoring metrics with high QoS, where credit-based ﬂow control and hybrid I/O model are proposed to mitigate network congestion/interference and CPU bottlenecks. Z ERO has been deployed and evaluated in Alibaba cloud. Deployment results show that Z ERO achieves no CPU occupation at the monitored host and supports 1 ∼ 10 k hosts with 0 . 1 ∼ 1 s sampling interval using single thread for network I/O.
