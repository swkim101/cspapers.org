The aim of continual learning is to learn new tasks continuously (i.e., plasticity) without forgetting previously learned knowledge from old tasks (i.e., stability). In the scenario of online continual learning, wherein data comes strictly in a streaming manner, the plasticity of online continual learning is more vulnerable than offline continual learning because the training signal that can be obtained from a single data point is limited. To overcome the stability-plasticity dilemma in online continual learning, we propose an online continual learning framework named multi-scale feature adaptation network (MuFAN) that utilizes a richer context encoding extracted from different levels of a pre-trained network. Additionally, we introduce a novel structure-wise distillation loss and replace the commonly used batch normalization layer with a newly proposed stability-plasticity normalization module to train MuFAN that simultaneously maintains high plasticity and stability. MuFAN outperforms other state-of-the-art continual learning methods on the SVHN, CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CORe50 datasets. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the significance and scalability of each proposed component: 1) multi-scale feature maps from a pre-trained encoder, 2) the structure-wise distillation loss, and 3) the stability-plasticity normalization module in MuFAN.
