Facebook content search is a critical channel that enables people to discover the best content to deepen their engagement with friends and family, creators, and communities. Building a highly personalized search engine to serve billions of daily active users to find the best results from a large scale of candidates is a challenging task. The search engine must take multiple dimensions into consideration, including different content types, different query intents, and user social graph, etc. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of Facebook content search in depth, and then describe our novel approach to efficiently handling a massive number of documents with advanced query understanding, retrieval, and machine learning techniques. The proposed system has been fully verified and applied to the production system of Facebook Search, which serves billions of users.
