 Additive manufacturing and topology optimization are complementary technologies that enable unprecedented levels of design freedom for realizing complex structures. This increasing design freedom is accompanied by increasing complexity, such that it can become difficult for either computational algorithms or human designers alone to search these expansive design spaces effectively. Our previous work laid the foundation for an interactive design framework that enables human designers to use their expertise and intuition to guide computational algorithms quickly towards promising solutions. The framework established a latent representation of a library of designs by combining classical topology optimization techniques with a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). Our goal is to expand on this framework by creating interactive functionalities that allow users to more efficiently visualize and search an expansive structural design space by manipulating its latent variable representation.
