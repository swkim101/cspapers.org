This paper is the first to provide a thorough system design overview along with the fusion methods selection criteria of a real-world cooperative autonomous driving system, named Infrastructure-Augmented Autonomous Driving or IAAD. We present an in-depth introduction of the IAAD hardware and software on both road-side and vehicle-side computing/communication platforms. We extensively characterize the IAAD system in the context of real-world deployment scenarios and observe that the network condition fluctuates along the road is currently the main technical roadblock for cooperative autonomous driving. To address this challenge, we propose new fusion methods, dubbed “inter-frame fusion” and “planning fusion” to complement the current state-of-the-art “intra-frame fusion”. We demonstrate that each fusion method has its own benefit and constraint. Adaptively choosing the fusion method according to the real-world condition will benefit the SoV without the violation of the SoV's safety requirements.
