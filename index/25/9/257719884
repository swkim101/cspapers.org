Ring ORAM (Oblivious RAM) is a secure primitive that mitigates the large performance degradation of ORAM through reduced online memory bandwidth demand, i.e., the number of memory accesses at servicing a real memory request. Ring ORAM requires 4Ã— or more of the protected data space to enable the optimization and thus presents high capacity pressure on modern memory systems. While recent studies strive to reduce its space consumption through bucket compaction, the large space consumption remains a major design challenge for Ring ORAM.In this paper, we propose AB-ORAM to reduce the space capacity demand in Ring ORAM. AB-ORAM identifies two inefficient use of memory space in Ring ORAM: (i) accessed blocks hold useless data until the next reshuffle operation; and (ii) large buckets provide a diminishing performance benefit for tree levels close to the leaves. AB-ORAM then proposes two schemes to exploit the optimization opportunities, respectively. Specifically, it reclaims accessed blocks early by allocating them to buckets that need a reshuffle; and shrinks the bucket size for tree level close to the leaves for a better space/performance trade-off. We evaluate the proposed AB-ORAM design and compare it to the state-of-the-art. Our results show that AB-ORAM achieves an average of 36% space reduction over the state-of-the-art while introducing very low performance overhead.
