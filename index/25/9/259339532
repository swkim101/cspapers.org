Mobile robots are becoming safer and more affordable, and their presence in the workspace is increasing. However, many tasks that involve reasoning, long-term planning or human preferences are still hard to automate. While some solutions in specialised areas slowly emerge, an alternative to full autonomy can be to actively leverage intuition and experience of human operators. To do this, suitable interfaces and modes of interaction have to be explored. Inspired by Real-Time Strategy games, we implement a Mixed Reality interface that can be used with either a Microsoft HoloLens 2 headset or a tablet. The interface allows users to interact with multiple mobile robots simultaneously. We conduct a user study to compare the headset and tablet versions of the interface in different scenarios inspired by a real-world construction setting. We show that, while performance and preference of interface are dependent on the task and the complexity of the required interaction, users are able to solve non-trivial tasks on both platforms using our system.
