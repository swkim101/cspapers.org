The method of calculation of flows in areas with moving boundaries is considered in the article. Solid body in a flow is modeled as a continuously distributed volume force field. The reaction of the flow to a solid is found from the solution of the problem of the interaction of a homogeneous gas flow with a barrier. The solution of this problem allows one to obtain the characteristics of the flow depending on the nature of the motion of the rigid body. This is the speed and pressure in front and behind a moving body. The approach involves carrying out calculations on Cartesian grids. The main problem is the approximation of highly complex curved surfaces using rectangular boundaries. A mapping method of guiding properties of smooth boundaries for increasing the accuracy of calculations on rough Cartesian grids is proposed. The possibility of using this approach for simulation of flow past bodies with moving boundaries is demonstrated. The proposed approach for calculating moving bodies does not require moving grids. No multiple rebuilding of the computational domain is required.
