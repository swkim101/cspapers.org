Correspondence selection, a crucial step in many computer vision tasks, aims to distinguish between inliers and outliers from putative correspondences. The coherence of correspondences is often used for predicting inlier probability, but it is difficult for neural networks to extract coherence contexts based only on quadruple coordinates. To overcome this difficulty, we propose enhancing the preliminary features using local and global handcrafted coherent characteristics before model learning, which strengthens the discrimination of each correspondence and guides the model to prune obvious outliers. Furthermore, to fully utilize local information, neighbors are searched in coordinate space as well as feature space. These two kinds of neighbors provide complementary and plentiful contexts for inlier probability prediction. Finally, a novel neighbor representation and a fusion architecture are proposed to retain detailed features. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on relative camera pose estimation and correspondence selection metrics on the outdoor YFCC100M [1] and the indoor SUN3D [2] datasets.
