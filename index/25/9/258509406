Using Unbiased Learning to Rank (ULTR) to train the ranking model with biased click logs has attracted increased research interest. The key idea is to explicitly model the user’s observation behavior when building the ranker with a large number of click logs. Considering the simplicity, recent efforts are mainly based on the position bias hypothesis, in which the observation only depends on the position. However, this hypothesis does not hold in many scenarios due to the neglect of the distinct characteristics of individuals in the same position. On the other hand, directly modeling observation bias for each individual is quite challenging, since the effects of each individual’s features on relevance and observation are entangled. It is difficult to ravel out this coupled effect and thus obtain a correct relevance model from click data. To address this issue, we first present the concept of coupling effect for individual-level ULTR. Then, we develop the novel Lipschitz and Bernoulli Decoupling (LBD) model to decouple the effects on relevance and observation at the individual level. We prove theoretically that our proposed method could recover the correct relevance order for the ranking objective. Empirical results on two LTR benchmark datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art base-lines and verify its effectiveness in debiasing data.
