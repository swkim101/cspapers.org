Finding the right product on e-commerce websites with millions of products is a daunting task for a large set of customers. On the search page, product attribute filters a.k.a. "refinements" emerge as a convenient navigational option for customers to narrow down the search results along product attributes of their choice (e.g., Material:Cotton, Color:Black for 'shirt'). However, on mobile devices, refinements are not easily discoverable due to lack of screen space. To improve discoverability, contextually relevant refinements are suggested in-line on search page by refinement recommendation systems. Existing works on refinement recommendations primarily rely on the search context as input, and are trained using aggregated refinement preferences 'explicitly' expressed by customers. These solutions fail to capture 'implicit' preferences expressed during the customer shopping mission through in-session browsing activity. In this paper, we propose a session-based recommendation system (SBRS) which recommends refinements by inferring product attribute preferences of customers based on the sequence of products viewed earlier in the session. For the task of refinement recommendation, we propose a) AttriBERT, a model which extends BERT architecture to learn from the attribute values of products and b) a novel product representation strategy, which represents each product as a dictionary of attribute:value pairs (e.g., RAM Size:64GB). We evaluate our approach on RecSys 2022 Challenge and Amazon e-commerce datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art sequence models on the task of session-based refinement recommendation.
