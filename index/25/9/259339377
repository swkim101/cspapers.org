The calibration of a vision-guided dual-arm robotic system, including the robot-robot and hand-eye calibration, requires the tracked positions of markers in different postures. However, in many cases, using markers to calibrate is impractical. Only some markerless features can be obtained rather than the rigid transform matrix; for example, the shaft of a markerless robotic tool can be tracked. Therefore, we proposed a Kronecker-Product-based method to calibrate the dual-arm system with a tracked robotic tool by decoupling the translation and rotation. The simulation and experiment results on a da Vinci Research Kit show that the proposed method is robust and accurate under different noise levels and various sample robot movements, compared with two state-of-the-art methods for dual-arm calibration with complete homogeneous transformations.
