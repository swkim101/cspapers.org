Prompting has gained tremendous attention as an efficient method for the adaptation of large-scale language models. However, prompts often act against human intuition and report unstable performances, which has motivated meth-ods that automatically find effective prompts. One popular approach is gradient-based search, which iteratively updates a (randomly) initialized prompt towards the optimal one with the guide of gradients. We propose a novel regularization method, CoRe, for gradient-based prompt tuning techniques, which guides a prompt to produce a task context properly. CoRe realizes two regularization effects — context attuning and context filtering — that improve prediction performance in a zero-shot in-context learning setting where a model makes inferences only with the prompt tuned by CoRe, without any demonstration examples for in-context learning. Context attuning guides the context generated by the input and the tuned prompt toward embedding the appropriate context for the task. In our theoretical analysis, reg-ularizing the context extends to improving zero-shot in-context learning performance. Context filtering steers the prompt to select only the task-related context so that context attuning solely focuses on creating and sending the right task context. We evaluate CoRe on natural language understanding datasets and two large language models, GPT2-XL and GPT-J. Our training scheme shows performance improvements up to 11.9% on GPT2-XL, and up to 6.3% on GPT-J
