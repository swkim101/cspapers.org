Graph-structured diagrams, such as enterprise ownership charts or management hierarchies, are a challenging medium for deep learning models as they not only require the capacity to model language and spatial relations but also the topology of links between entities and the varying semantics of what those links represent. Devising Question Answering models that automatically process and understand such diagrams have vast applications to many enterprise domains, and can move the state-of-the-art on multimodal document understanding to a new frontier. Curating real-world datasets to train these models can be difficult, due to scarcity and confidentiality of the documents where such diagrams are included. Recently released synthetic datasets are often prone to repetitive structures that can be memorized or tackled using heuristics. In this paper, we present a collection of 10,000 synthetic graphs that faithfully reflect properties of real graphs in four business domains, and are realistically rendered within a PDF document with varying styles and layouts. In addition, we have generated over 130,000 question instances that target complex graphical relationships specific to each domain. We hope this challenge will encourage the development of models capable of robust reasoning about graph structured images, which are ubiquitous in numerous sectors in business and across scientific disciplines.
