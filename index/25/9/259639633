In conventional recognition tasks, models are only trained to recognize learned targets, but it is usually difficult to collect training examples of all potential categories. In the testing phase, when models receive test samples from unknown classes, they mistakenly classify the samples into known classes. Open set recognition (OSR) is a more realistic recognition task, which requires the classifier to detect unknown test samples while keeping a high classification accuracy of known classes. In this paper, we study how to improve the OSR performance of deep neural networks from the perspective of representation learning. We employ supervised contrastive learning to improve the quality of feature representations, propose a new supervised contrastive learning method that enables the model to learn from soft training targets, and design an OSR framework on its basis. With the proposed method, we are able to make use of label smoothing and mixup when training deep neural networks contrastively, so as to improve both the robustness of outlier detection in OSR tasks and the accuracy in conventional classification tasks. We validate our method on multiple benchmark datasets and testing scenarios, achieving experimental results that verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
