In this work, a computational study of the parameters of the power plant of an unmanned aerial vehicle operating on a cryogenic working medium is carried out. Liquid nitrogen was chosen as a cryogenic working medium, since nitrogen emission does not harm the environment. The article presents two possible schemes of a cryogenic power plant for an unmanned aerial vehicle. The first is a diagram of a cryogenic power plant of an unmanned aerial vehicle with air heating, in which air acts as a heat source at an ambient temperature at an altitude of 2000 m. The second is a diagram of a cryogenic power plant of an unmanned aerial vehicle with heating of the working fluid due to solar energy, in which solar energy acts as a source of heat. A computational study of a cryogenic power plant operating according to an open Rankine cycle was carried out, as well as computational studies of possible cryogenic power plant schemes for an unmanned aerial vehicle, as a result of which a comparative analysis of the data obtained was carried out and a suitable cryogenic power plant design for an unmanned aerial vehicle with the required parameters was selected.
