Humans are talented with the ability to perform diverse interactions in the teaching process. However, when humans want to teach AI, existing interactive systems only allow humans to perform repetitive labeling, causing an unsatisfactory teaching experience. My Ph.D. research studies Interactive Machine Teaching (IMT), an emerging field of HCI research that aims to enhance humansâ€™ teaching experience in the AI creation process. My research builds IMT systems that exploit and guide user interaction and shows that such in-depth integration of human interaction can benefit both AI models and user experience.
