Optical Coherence Elastography (OCE) is a method that discerns local tissue stiffness using optical information. This method has recently been explored for laryngeal cancer tumor margin detection but has not been widely deployed clinically. Part of the challenge hindering such clinical deployment is the need for controlled high-precision mechanical probing of the tissue. This paper explores the concept of robot-assisted optical coherence elastography(OCE) and presents a preliminary system integration used to demonstrate the approach for stiffness mapping and discerning tumor margins. The approach is demonstrated on a custom Cartesian stage robot, and a custom-built OCE system comprised of an 830 nm broad-band laser with a vector-analysis method for phase gradient estimation and strain imaging. The paper illustrates one of the advantages of robot-controlled probing in terms of increasing the accuracy of the OCE system in a large range of displacement and strain. By leveraging motion information from the robot, online re-calibration of the OCE strain map may be achieved, thereby reducing OCE errors. After calibration, it is shown that the error in estimating the local Young's modulus is 0.485% in the silicon phantom and 0.531% in the agar phantom. These results suggest that future integration of optical coherence tomography(OCT) in clinically deployable robots may offer advantages in enabling local stiffness map estimation using OCE.
