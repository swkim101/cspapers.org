In the classical e-commerce platforms, the personalized product-tying recommendation has proven to be of great added value, which improves users' purchase willingness to product-tying by displaying the suitable marketing creative. In this paper, we present a new recommendation problem, i.e., the Pop-up One-time Marketing (POM), where the product-tying marketing creative only pops up one time when the user pays for the main item. POM has become a ubiquitous application in e-commerce platforms, e.g., buy the mobile tying mobile case and buy flight ticket tying insurance. However, many existing recommendation methods are sub-optimal for the creative marketing in the POM scenario due to unconsidering the unique characteristics in the scenario. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework named Event-aware Adaptive Clustering Uplift Network (EACU-Net) for the POM scenario, which is to our best knowledge the first attempt along this line. EACU-Net contains three modules: (1) the event-aware graph cascading learning, which employs a heterogeneous graph network to comprehensively learn the embedding for the user attributes, event categories, and creative elements by stage. (2) an adaptive clustering uplift network, which learns the sensitivity of users to creatives under the same context. (3) an event-aware information gain network to learn more information from samples with event affection. Extensive offline and online evaluations on a real-world e-commerce platform demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared with the state-of-the-art method.
