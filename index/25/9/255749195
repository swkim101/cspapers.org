Can one inject new concepts into an already trained generative model, while respecting its existing structure and knowledge? We propose a new task - domain expansion - to address this. Given a pretrained generator and novel (but related) domains, we expand the generator to jointly model all domains, old and new, harmoniously. First, we note the generator contains a meaningful, pretrained latent space. Is it possible to minimally perturb this hard-earned representation, while maximally representing the new domains? Interestingly, we find that the latent space offers unused, “dormant” directions, which do not affect the output. This provides an opportunity: By “repurposing” these directions, we can represent new domains without perturbing the original representation. In fact, we find that pretrained generators have the capacity to add several- even hundreds - of new domains! Using our expansion method, one “expanded” model can supersede numerous domain-specific models, without expanding the model size. Additionally, a single expanded generator natively supports smooth transitions between domains, as well as composition of domains. Code and project page available here.
