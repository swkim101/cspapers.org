Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) can enable robots to learn to perform tasks based on an individual's preferences without requiring a hand-crafted re-ward function. However, existing approaches either assume access to a high-fidelity simulator or analytic model or take a model-free approach that requires extensive, possibly unsafe online environment interactions. In this paper, we study the benefits and challenges of using a learned dynamics model when performing PbRL. In particular, we provide evidence that a learned dynamics model offers the following benefits when performing PbRL: (1) preference elicitation and policy optimization require significantly fewer environment interactions than model-free PbRL, (2) diverse preference queries can be synthesized safely and efficiently as a byproduct of standard model-based RL, and (3) reward pre-training based on suboptimal demonstrations can be performed without any environmental interaction. Our paper provides empirical ev-idence that learned dynamics models enable robots to learn customized policies based on user preferences in ways that are safer and more sample efficient than prior preference learning approaches.
