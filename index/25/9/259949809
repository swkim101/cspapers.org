Video analysis platforms that integrate automatic solutions for multimedia and information retrieval enable various applications in many disciplines including film and media studies, communication science, and education. However, current platforms for video analysis either focus on manual annotations or include only a few tools for automatic content analysis. In this paper, we present a novel web-based video analysis platform called TIB AV-Analytics (TIB-AV-A). Unlike previous platforms, TIB-AV-A integrates state-of-the-art approaches in the fields of computer vision, audio analysis, and natural language processing for many relevant video analysis tasks. To facilitate future extensions and to ensure interoperability with existing tools, the video analysis approaches are implemented in a plugin structure with appropriate interfaces and import-export functions. TIB-AV-A leverages modern web technologies to provide users with a responsive and interactive web interface that enables manual annotation and provides access to powerful deep learning tools without a requirement for specific hardware dependencies.
