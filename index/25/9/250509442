Multi-LiDAR system is an important part of V2X (Vehicle to Everything) to enhance the perception information for unmanned vehicles. To fuse the information from multiple 3D LiDARs, accurate extrinsic calibration between the LiDARs is essential. However, the existing multi-LiDAR calibration methods mainly focus on short baseline scenarios, where multiple LiDARs are closely mounted on a single platform (e.g., an unmanned vehicle). Besides, most methods typically use a planar target for calibration. Some of the methods require the motion of the multi-LiDAR system. The above conditions severely limit the application of these methods to V2X, where LiDARs are non-movable, the baseline and viewpoint difference between the LiDARs can be very large. In order to meet these challenges, we propose an accurate and robust extrinsic calibration method for long baseline multi-LiDAR systems, named LB-L2L-Calib (Large Baseline LiDAR to LiDAR extrinsic Calibration). (1) We use a sphere as the calibration target for multiple LiDARs with large viewpoint difference, leveraging the viewpoint-invariance of the sphere. (2) A improved sphere detection and sphere center estimation strategy is introduced to detect and extract the sphere center from a cluttered point cloud in large-scale outdoor scenario. (3) A extrinsic parameter regression scheme is introduced. Both simulation and real experiments demonstrate that LB-L2L-Calib is highly accurate and robust. Quantitative results show that the rotation and translation error is less than 0.01m and 0.01° (in simulation, Gauss noise 0.03m, the distance and viewpoint difference between two LiDARs is more than 30m and 90°).
