This paper presents the stabilization using dynamic output feedback controller for Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems that can represent nonlinear systems accurately. Many different stabilization conditions by state feedback control have been obtained in the literature. However, few papers have considered stabilizing output feedback controllers, which is useful for practical systems, of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems. Therefore, we propose a control design based on dynamic output feedback controllers in this paper. Based on the idea of Lyapunov function having the structure of the integral of the membership functions, new stabilization conditions are obtained. This approach is known to reduce the conservativeness of the stabilization conditions. Furthermore, relaxation lemmas are used to reduce the conservativeness of the conditions. Finally, numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the design methods presented in the paper.
