Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) aim to predict the next item that users will consume, by modeling the user interests within their item sequences. While most existing SRSs focus on a single type of user behavior, only a few pay attention to multi-behavior sequences, although they are very common in real-world scenarios. It is challenging to effectively capture the user interests within multi-behavior sequences, because the information about user interests is entangled throughout the sequences in complex relationships. To this end, we first address the characteristics of multi-behavior sequences that should be considered in SRSs, and then propose novel methods for Dynamic Multi-behavior Sequence modeling named DyMuS, which is a light version, and DyMuS+, which is an improved version, considering the characteristics. DyMuS first encodes each behavior sequence independently, and then combines the encoded sequences using dynamic routing, which dynamically integrates information required in the final result from among many candidates, based on correlations between the sequences. DyMuS+, furthermore, applies the dynamic routing even to encoding each behavior sequence to further capture the correlations at item-level. Moreover, we release a new, large and up-to-date dataset for multi-behavior recommendation. Our experiments on DyMuS and DyMuS+ show their superiority and the significance of capturing the characteristics of multi-behavior sequences.
