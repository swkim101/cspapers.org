The variety and severity of recent DNS-based attacks under-score the importance of a secure naming system. Although DNSSEC provides data authenticity in theory, practical de-ployments unfortunately are fragile, costly, and typically lacks end-to-end (E2E) guarantees. This motivates us to rethink authentication in DNS fundamentally and introduce RHINE, a secure-by-design Internet naming system. RHINE offloads the authentication of zone delegation to an end-entity PKI and tames the operational complexity in an offline manner, allowing the efficient E2E authentication of zone data during online name resolution. With a novel logging mechanism, Delegation Transparency, RHINE achieves a highly robust trust model that can tolerate the compromise of all but one trusted entities and, for the first time, counters threats from superordinate zones. We formally verify RHINEâ€™s security properties using the Tamarin prover. We also demonstrate its practicality and performance advantages with a prototype implementation.
