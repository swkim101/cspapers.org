Deep networks on 3D point clouds have achieved remarkable success in 3D classification, while they are vulnerable to geometry variations caused by inconsistent data acquisition procedures. This results in a challenging 3D domain generalization (3DDG) problem, that is to generalize a model trained on source domain to an unseen target domain. Based on the observation that local geometric structures are more generalizable than the whole shape, we propose to reduce the geometry shift by a generalizable part-based feature representation and design a novel part-based domain generalization network (PDG) for 3D point cloud classification. Specifically, we build a part-template feature space shared by source and target domains. Shapes from distinct domains are first organized to part-level features and then represented by part-template features. The transformed part-level features, dubbed aligned part-based representations, are then aggregated by a part-based feature aggregation module. To improve the robustness of the part-based representations, we further propose a contrastive learning framework upon part-based shape representation. Experiments and ablation studies on 3DDA and 3DDG benchmarks justify the efficacy of the proposed approach for domain generalization, compared with the previous state-of-the-art methods.
