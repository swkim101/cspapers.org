In this paper, we propose using online public maps, e.g., OpenStreetMap (OSM), for large-scale radar-based localization without needing a prior sensing map. This can potentially extend the localization system to anywhere worldwide without building, saving, or maintaining a sensing map, as long as an online public map covers the operating area. Existing methods using OSM only use route network or semantics information. These two sources of information are not combined in the previous works, while our proposed system fuses them to improve localization accuracy. Our experiments, on three open datasets collected from three different continents, show that the proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art localization methods, reducing up to 50% of position errors. We release an open-source implementation for the community.
