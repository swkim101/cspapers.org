Neural sequence detection plays a vital role in neuroscience research. Recent impressive works utilize convolutive nonnegative matrix factorization and Neyman-Scott process to solve this problem. However, they still face two limitations. Firstly, they accommodate the entire dataset into memory and perform iterative updates of multiple passes, which can be inefficient when the dataset is large or grows frequently. Secondly, they rely on the prior knowledge of the number of sequence types, which can be impractical with data when the future situation is unknown. To tackle these limitations, we propose a hierarchical Dirichlet point process model for efficient neural sequence detection. Instead of computing the entire data, our model can sequentially detect sequences in an online unsupervised manner with Particle filters. Besides, the Dirichlet prior enables our model to automatically introduce new sequence types on the fly as needed, thus avoiding specifying the number of types in advance. We manifest these advantages on synthetic data and neural recordings from songbird higher vocal center and rodent hippocampus.
