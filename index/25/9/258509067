Under a standard binary classiﬁcation setting with possible model misspeciﬁcation, we study the problem of estimating general Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which is an arbitrary set of false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate (TPR) pairs. We formally introduce the notion of optimal ROC curve over a general model space. It is argued that any ROC curve estimation methods implemented over the given model space should target the optimal ROC curve over that space. Three popular ROC curve estimation methods are then analyzed at the population level (i.e., when there are inﬁnite number of samples) under both correct and incorrect model speciﬁcation. Based on our analysis, they are all consistent when the surrogate loss function satisﬁes certain conditions and the given model space includes all measurable classiﬁers. Interestingly, some of these conditions are similar to those that are required to ensure classiﬁcation consistency. When the model space is incorrectly speciﬁed, however, we show that only one method leads to consistent estimation of the ROC curve over the chosen model space. We present some numerical results to demonstrate the effects of model misspeciﬁcation on the performance of various methods in terms of their ROC curve estimates.
