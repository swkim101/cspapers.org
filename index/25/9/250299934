Model-based diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations is complicated and difficult to manage over. In this paper, we proposed two new diagnosis models, namely, the Compacted Model with Multiple Observations (CMMO) and the
 Dominated-based Compacted Model with Multiple Observations (D-CMMO), to solve the problem in which a considerable amount of time is needed when multiple observations are given and more than one fault is injected. Three ideas are presented in this paper. First, we propose to encode MBD with each observation as a subsystem and share as many system variables as possible to compress the size of encoded clauses. Second, we utilize the notion of gate dominance in the CMMO approach to compute Top-Level Diagnosis with Compacted Model (CM-TLD) to reduce the solution space. Finally, we explore the performance of our model using three fault models. Experimental results on the ISCAS-85 benchmarks show that CMMO and D-CMMO perform better than
 the state-of-the-art algorithms.
