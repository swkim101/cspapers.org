Complex needle shape prediction remains an issue for planning of surgical interventions of flexible needles. In this paper, we validate a theoretical method for flexible needle shape prediction allowing for non-uniform curvatures, extending upon a previous sensor-based model which combines curvature measurements from fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors and the mechanics of an inextensible elastic rod to determine and predict the 3D needle shape during insertion. We evaluate the model's effectiveness in single-layer isotropic tissue for shape sensing and shape prediction capabilities. Experiments on a four-active area, FBG-sensorized needle were performed in varying single-layer isotropic tissues under stereo vision to provide 3D ground truth of the needle shape. The results validate a viable 3D needle shape prediction model accounting for non-uniform curvatures in flexible needles with mean needle shape sensing and prediction root-mean-square errors of 0.479 mm and 0.892 mm, respectively.
