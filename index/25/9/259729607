The limited number of actors and actions in existing datasets make 3D pose estimators tend to overfit, which can be seen from the performance degradation of the algorithm on cross-datasets, especially for rare and complex poses. Although previous data augmentation works have increased the diversity of the training set, the changes in camera viewpoint and position play a dominant role in improving the accuracy of the estimator, while the generated 3D poses are limited and still heavily rely on the source dataset. In addition, these works do not consider the adaptability of the pose estimator to generated data, and complex poses will cause training collapse. In this paper, we propose the CEE-Net, a Complementary End-to-End Network for 3D human pose generation and estimation. The generator extremely expands the distribution of each joint-angle in the existing dataset and limits them to a reasonable range. By learning the correlations within and between the torso and limbs, the estimator can combine different body-parts more effectively and weaken the influence of specific joint-angle changes on the global pose, improving the generalization ability. Extensive ablation studies show that our pose generator greatly strengthens the joint-angle distribution, and our pose estimator can utilize these poses positively. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method can achieve much better performance on various cross-datasets, rare and complex poses.
