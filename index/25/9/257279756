Pseudo-labeling has proven to be a promising semi-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm. Existing pseudo-labeling methods commonly assume that the class distributions of training data are balanced. However, such an assumption is far from realistic scenarios and thus severely limits the performance of current pseudo-labeling methods under the context of class-imbalance. To alleviate this problem, we design a bias adaptive classifier that targets the imbalanced SSL setups. The core idea is to automatically assimilate the training bias caused by class imbalance via the bias adaptive classifier, which is composed of a novel bias attractor and the original linear classifier. The bias attractor is designed as a light-weight residual network and optimized through a bi-level learning framework. Such a learning strategy enables the bias adaptive classifier to fit imbalanced training data, while the linear classifier can provide unbiased label prediction for each class. We conduct extensive experiments under various imbalanced semi-supervised setups, and the results demonstrate that our method can be applied to different pseudo-labeling models and is superior to current state-of-the-art methods.
