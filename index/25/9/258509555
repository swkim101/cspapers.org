Machine learning on blockchain graphs is an emerging ﬁeld with many applications such as ransomware payment tracking, price manipulation analysis, and money laundering detection. However, analyzing blockchain data requires domain expertise and computational resources, which pose a signiﬁcant barrier and hinder advancement in this ﬁeld. We introduce Chartalist, the ﬁrst comprehensive platform to methodically access and use machine learning across a large selection of blockchains to address this challenge. Chartalist contains ML-ready datasets from unspent transaction output (UTXO) (e.g., Bitcoin) and account-based blockchains (e.g., Ethereum). We envision that Chartalist can facilitate data modeling, analysis, and representation of blockchain data and attract a wider community of scientists to analyze blockchains. Chartal-ist is a sustainable open-science initiative at https://github.com/cakcora/ Chartalist .
