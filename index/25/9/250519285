A multi-fingered hand that can grasp and manipulate a variety of objects is an option for assisting people in their daily lives. However, the range of torque output that can be handled by the multi-fingered hand is very limited compared to the capability of the human hand. In this paper, we introduce a new multi-fingered hand consisting of a dynamic pulley and a linkage mechanism, aiming to achieve a human-like output torque with a human-like size. The proposed multi-fingered hand can achieve a fingertip force of 50N, which is equivalent to that of a human, and at the same time can perform delicate operations such as picking up a coin on a desk. In addition, we realized the stay-on-tab opening task of a can by utilizing fingertip strength.
