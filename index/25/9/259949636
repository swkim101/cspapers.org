In this work, we present SONAR, a web-based tool for multimodal exploration of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) inspiration networks. SONAR is conceived to support both creators and traders in the emerging Web3 by providing an interactive visualization of the inspiration-driven connections between NFTs, at both individual level and collection level. SONAR can hence be useful to identify new investment opportunities as well as anomalous inspirations. To demonstrate SONAR's capabilities, we present an application to the largest and most representative dataset concerning the NFT landscape to date, showing how our proposed tool can scale and ensure high-level user experience up to millions of edges.
