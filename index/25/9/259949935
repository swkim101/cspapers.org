This half day tutorial introduces the participant to the basic concepts underlying neural Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR). It discusses the most common algorithmic approaches to CLIR, focusing on modern neural methods; the history of CLIR; where to find and how to use CLIR training collections, test collections and baseline systems; how CLIR training and test collections are constructed; and open research questions in CLIR.
