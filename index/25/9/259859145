Question generation methods based on pre-trained language models often suffer from factual inconsistencies and incorrect entities and are not answerable from the input paragraph. Domain shift â€“ where the test data is from a different domain than the training data - further exacerbates the problem of hallucination. This is a critical issue for any natural language application doing question generation. In this work, we propose an effective data processing technique based on de-lexicalization for consistent question generation across domains. Unlike existing approaches for remedying hallucination, the proposed approach does not filter training data and is generic across question-generation models. Experimental results across six benchmark datasets show that our model is robust to domain shift and produces entity-level factually consistent questions without significant impact on traditional metrics.
