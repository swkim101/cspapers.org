Proficiency self-assessment (PSA), the ability to assess how well one can carry out a task, is a desirable capability of autonomous robot systems. Prior work has proposed assumption-alignment tracking (AAT) for performing PSA, and has shown that it can accurately predict robot performance in real-time given a dataset obtained from both normal and abnormal training runs. Obtaining data in abnormal conditions (i.e., conditions in which the robot is not prepared to operate) is difficult and is often not possible. As a result, many realistic datasets contain very few data points for abnormal conditions, making it difficult to apply AAT. This paper hypothesizes that a one-class classifier can be built to detect anomalies using only data collected under normal conditions. Two metrics, difference and separation, are proposed and used to demonstrate that AAT feature vectors from different running conditions tend to form distinct clusters that are identifiable by mainstream one-class classification algorithms. Thus, one-class classifiers trained on AAT feature vectors from normal data can detect anomalous conditions. Furthermore, preliminary results suggest that a few abnormal data points, if available, can be used to classify the abnormality type and, in turn, the degree to which the anomalies will likely impact robot performance. Empirical results from both a simulated navigation robot and a Sawyer robot manipulating blocks show the efficacy of the approach.
