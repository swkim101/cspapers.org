For better photography, most recent commercial cameras including smartphones have either adopted large-aperture lens to collect more light or used a burst mode to take multiple images within short times. These interesting features lead us to examine depth from focus/defocus. In this work, we present a convolutional neural network-based depth estimation from single focal stacks. Our method differs from relevant state-of-the-art works with three unique features. First, our method allows depth maps to be inferred in an end-to-end manner even with image alignment. Second, we propose a sharp region detection module to reduce blur ambiguities in subtle focus changes and weakly texture-less regions. Third, we design an effective downsampling module to ease flows of focal information in feature extractions. In addition, for the generalization of the proposed network, we develop a simulator to realistically reproduce the features of commercial cameras, such as changes in field of view, focal length and principal points. By effectively incorporating these three unique features, our network achieves the top rank in the DDFF 12-Scene benchmark on most metrics. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various quantitative evaluations and real-world images taken from various off-the-shelf cameras compared with state-of-the-art methods.
