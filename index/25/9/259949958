Reasoning on temporal knowledge graphs (TKGR), aiming to infer missing events along the timeline, has been widely studied to alleviate incompleteness issues in TKG, which is composed of a series of KG snapshots at different timestamps. Two types of information, i.e., intra-snapshot structural information and inter-snapshot temporal interactions, mainly contribute to the learned representations for reasoning in previous models. However, these models fail to leverage (1) semantic correlations between relationships for the former information and (2) the periodic temporal patterns along the timeline for the latter one. Thus, such insufficient mining manners hinder expressive ability, leading to sub-optimal performances. To address these limitations, we propose a novel reasoning model, termed RPC, which sufficiently mines the information underlying the Relational correlations and Periodic patterns via two novel Correspondence units, i.e., relational correspondence unit (RCU) and periodic correspondence unit (PCU). Concretely, relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) and RCU are used to encode the intra-snapshot graph structural information for entities and relations, respectively. Besides, the gated recurrent units (GRU) and PCU are designed for sequential and periodic inter-snapshot temporal interactions, separately. Moreover, the model-agnostic time vectors are generated by time2vector encoders to guide the time-dependent decoder for fact scoring. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show that RPC outperforms the state-of-the-art TKGR models, and also demonstrate the effectiveness of two novel strategies in our model.
