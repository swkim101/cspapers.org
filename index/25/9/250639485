Both data augmentation and contrastive loss are the key components of contrastive learning. In this paper, we design a new multi-view unsupervised graph representation learning method including adaptive data augmentation and multi-view contrastive learning, to address some issues of contrastive learning ignoring the information from feature space. Specifically, the adaptive data augmentation first builds a feature graph from the feature space, and then designs a deep graph learning model on the original representation and the topology graph to update the feature graph and the new representation. As a result, the adaptive data augmentation outputs multi-view information, which is fed into two GCNs to generate multi-view embedding features. Two kinds of contrastive losses are further designed on multi-view embedding features to explore the complementary information among the topology and feature graphs. Additionally, adaptive data augmentation and contrastive learning are embedded in a unified framework to form an end-to-end model. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, compared to state-of-the-art methods.
