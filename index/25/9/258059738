We show that the big-O problem for max-plus automata, i.e. weighted automata over the semiring (ℕ ∪ {–∞}, max, +), is decidable and PSPACE-complete. The big-O (or affine domination) problem asks whether, given two max-plus automata computing functions f and g, there exists a constant c such that f ≤ cg + c. This is a relaxation of the containment problem asking whether f ≤ g, which is undecidable. Our decidability result uses Simon’s forest factorisation theorem, and relies on detecting specific elements, that we call witnesses, in a finite semigroup closed under two special operations: stabilisation and flattening.
