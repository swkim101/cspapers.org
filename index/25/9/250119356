A recent survey of industry practices by Akesson et al. [1] indicates that the use of response-time analysis (RTA) is surprisingly limited. In particular, in response to Question 23 of Akesson et al.â€™s survey, the majority of respondents (61%) indicated that the presence of potential deadline violations is assessed by running tests and checking for overruns. In contrast, the use of in-house schedulability analyses or commercially-available schedulability tools is far less widespread (31% and 9%, respectively).
