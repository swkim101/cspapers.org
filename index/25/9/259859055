Knowledge graphs mostly exhibit a mixture of branching relations, e.g., hasFriend , and complex structures, e.g., hierarchy and loop. Most knowledge graph embeddings have problems expressing them, because they model a specific relation r from a head h to tails by starting at the node embedding of h and transitioning deterministically to exactly one other point in the embedding space. We overcome this issue in our novel framework It ˆ o E by modeling relations between nodes by relation-specific, stochastic transitions. Our framework is based on stochastic It ˆ o processes, which operate on low-dimensional manifolds. It ˆ o E is highly expressive and generic subsuming various state-of-the-art models operating on different, also non-Euclidean, manifolds. Experimental re-sults show the superiority of It ˆ o E over other deterministic embedding models with regard to the KG completion task.
