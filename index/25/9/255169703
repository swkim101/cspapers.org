Most deformable object manipulation tasks still rely on skillful human operators. To automate such tasks, a robotic system should not only be able to deform an object to a desired shape but also servo its deformation along a specific path towards the desired shape. We propose a shape servoing control scheme to automate such tasks. Our scheme controls the deformation trajectory towards the desired shape by imposing task-focused convergence constraints. The constraints impose how fast the different regions of the object converge to the desired shape. Integrating such a behavior in shape servoing forms our main contribution. Experiments, carried out on rubber layer assembly tasks, show that our control scheme outperforms a state-of-the-art shape servoing scheme.
