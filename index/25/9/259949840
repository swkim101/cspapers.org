Community search, which looks for query-dependent communities in a graph, is an important task in graph analysis. Existing community search studies address the problem by finding a densely-connected subgraph containing the query. However, many real-world networks are heterogeneous with rich semantics. Queries in heterogeneous networks generally involve in multiple communities with different semantic connections, while returning a single community with mixed semantics has limited applications. In this paper, we revisit the community search problem on heterogeneous networks and introduce a novel paradigm of heterogeneous community search and ranking. We propose to automatically discover the query semantics to enable the search of different semantic communities and develop a comprehensive community evaluation model to support the ranking of results. We build HeteroCS, a heterogeneous community search system with semantic explanation, upon our semantic community model, and deploy it on two real-world graphs. We present a demonstration case to illustrate the novelty and effectiveness of the system.
