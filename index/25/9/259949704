Low-resource relation extraction (LRE) aims to extract potential relations from limited labeled corpus to handle the problem of scarcity of human annotations. Previous works mainly consist of two categories of methods: (1) Self-training methods, which improve themselves through the models' predictions, thus suffering from confirmation bias when the predictions are wrong. (2) Self-ensembling methods, which learn task-agnostic representations, therefore, generally do not work well for specific tasks. In our work, we propose a novel LRE architecture named SelfLRE, which leverages two complementary modules, one module uses self-training to obtain pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, and the other module uses self-ensembling learning to obtain the task-agnostic representations, and leverages the existing pseudo-labels to refine the better task-specific representations on unlabeled data. The two models are jointly trained through multi-task learning to iteratively improve the effect of LRE task. Experiments on three public datasets show that SelfLRE achieves 1.81% performance gain over the SOTA baseline. Source code is available at: https://github.com/THU-BPM/SelfLRE.
