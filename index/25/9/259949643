Next item recommendation is a crucial task of session-based recommendation. However, the gap between the optimization objective (Binary Cross Entropy) and the ranking metric (Mean Reciprocal Rank) has not been well-explored, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel objective function, namely Adjusted-RR, to directly optimize Mean Reciprocal Rank. Specifically, Adjusted-RR adopts Bayesian Average to adjust Reciprocal Rank loss with Normal Rank loss by creating position-aware weights between them. Adjusted-RR is a plug-and-play objective that is compatible with various models. We apply Adjusted-RR on two base models and two datasets, and experimental results show that it makes a significant improvement in the next item recommendation.
