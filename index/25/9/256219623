The mathematical model described in the paper made it possible to obtain accurate results for the working mediums' temperature at the supercharger's outlet. The method of calculating heat exchange with regard to roughness can be recognized as effective. The high roughness in the channels obtained using selective laser fusion technology makes it possible to create a compact and efficient heat exchanger.
