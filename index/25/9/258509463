We introduce a multi-mode tensor clustering method that implements a fused version of the alternating least squares algorithm (Fused-Orth-ALS) for simultaneous tensor factorization and clustering. The statistical convergence rates of recovery and clustering are established when the data are a noise contaminated tensor with a latent low rank CP decomposition structure. Specifically, we show that a modified alternating least squares algorithm can provably recover the true latent low rank factorization structure when the data form an asymmetric tensor with perturbation. Clustering consistency is also established. Finally, we illustrate the accuracy and computational efficient implementation of the Fused-Orth-ALS algorithm by using both simulations and real datasets
