Video-language models suffer from forgetting old/learned knowledge when trained with streaming data. In this work, we thus propose a continual video-language modeling (CVLM) setting, where models are supposed to be sequentially trained on five widely-used video-text datasets with different data distributions. Although most of existing continual learning methods have achieved great success by exploiting extra information ( e.g. , memory data of past tasks) or dynamically extended networks, they cause enormous resource consumption when transferred to our CVLM setting. To overcome the challenges ( i.e. , catastrophic forgetting and heavy resource consumption) in CVLM, we propose a novel cross-modal MoCo-based model with bidirectional momentum update (BMU), termed BMU-MoCo. Concretely, our BMU-MoCo has two core designs: (1) Different from the conventional MoCo, we apply the momentum update to not only momentum encoders but also encoders ( i.e. , bidirectional) at each training step, which enables the model to review the learned knowledge retained in the momentum encoders. (2) To further enhance our BMU-MoCo by utilizing earlier knowledge, we additionally maintain a pair of global momentum encoders (only initialized at the very beginning) with the same BMU strategy. Extensive results show that our BMU-MoCo remarkably outperforms recent competitors w.r.t. video-text retrieval performance and forgetting rate, even without using any extra data or dynamic networks.
