The lack of publicly available high-quality and accurately labeled datasets has long been a major bottleneck for singing voice synthesis (SVS). To tackle this problem, we present M4Singer , a free-to-use M ulti-style, M ulti-singer M andarin singing collection with elaborately annotated M usical scores as well as its benchmarks. Specifically, 1) we construct and release a large high-quality Chinese singing voice corpus, which is recorded by 20 professional singers, covering 700 Chinese pop songs as well as all the four SATB types (i.e., soprano, alto, tenor, and bass); 2) we take extensive efforts to manually compose the musical scores for each recorded song, which is necessary to the study of the prosody modeling for SVS. 3) To facilitate the use and demonstrate the quality of M4Singer, we conduct four different benchmark experiments: score-based SVS, controllable singing voice (CSV), singing voice conversion (SVC) and automatic music transcription (AMT).
