We prove a complexity dichotomy theorem for counting planar graph homomorphisms of domain size 3. Given any 3 by 3 real valued symmetric matrix H defining a graph homomorphism from all planar graphs G ↦ ZH(G), we completely classify the computational complexity of this problem according to the matrix H. We show that for every H, the problem is either polynomial time computable or #P-hard. The P-time computable cases consist of precisely those that are P-time computable for general graphs (a complete classification is known) or computable by Valiant’s holographic algorithm via matchgates. We also prove several results about planar graph homomorphisms for general domain size q. The proof uses mainly analytic arguments.
