We consider the problem of adding a fixed number of new edges to an undirected graph in order to minimize the diameter of the augmented graph, and under the constraint that the number of edges added for each vertex is bounded by an integer. The problem is motivated by network-design applications, where we want to minimize the worst case communication in the network without excessively increasing the degree of any single vertex, so as to avoid additional overload. We present three algorithms for this task, each with their own merits. The special case of a matching augmentation -when every vertex can be incident to at most one new edge-is of particular interest, for which we show an inapproximability result, and provide bounds on the smallest achievable diameter when these edges are added to a path. Finally, we empirically evaluate and compare our algorithms on several real-life networks of varying types.
