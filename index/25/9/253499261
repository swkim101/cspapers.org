Temporal Action Localization (TAL) methods typically operate on top of feature sequences from a frozen snippet encoder that is pretrained with the Trimmed Action Classification (TAC) tasks, resulting in a task discrepancy problem. While existing TAL methods mitigate this issue either by re-training the encoder with a pretext task or by end-to-end fine-tuning, they commonly require an overload of high memory and computation. In this work, we introduce Soft-Landing (SoLa) strategy, an efficient yet effective framework to bridge the transferability gap between the pretrained encoder and the downstream tasks by incorporating a light-weight neural network, i.e., a SoLa module, on top of the frozen encoder. We also propose an unsupervised training scheme for the SoLa module; it learns with inter-frame Similarity Matching that uses the frame interval as its supervisory signal, eliminating the need for temporal annotations. Experimental evaluation on various benchmarks for downstream TAL tasks shows that our method effectively alleviates the task discrepancy problem with remarkable computational efficiency.
