Recognizing classroom dialogue acts has significant promise for yielding insight into teaching, student learning, and classroom dynamics. However, obtaining K-12 classroom dialogue data with labels is a significant challenge, and therefore, developing data-efficient methods for classroom dialogue act recognition is essential. This work addresses the challenge of classroom dialogue act recognition from limited labeled data using a contrastive learning-based self-supervised approach (SSCon). SSCon uses two independent models that iteratively improve each otherâ€™s performance by increasing the accuracy of dialogue act recognition and minimizing the embedding distance between the same dialogue acts. We evaluate the approach on three complementary dialogue act recognition datasets: the TalkMoves dataset (annotated K-12 mathematics lesson transcripts), the Dai-lyDialog dataset (multi-turn daily conversation dialogues), and the Dialogue State Tracking Challenge 2 (DSTC2) dataset (restaurant reser-vation dialogues). Results indicate that our self-supervised contrastive learning-based model outperforms competitive baseline models when trained with limited examples per dialogue act. Furthermore, SSCon outperforms other few-shot models that require considerably more labeled data 1 .
