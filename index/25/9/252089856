Several studies have shown that automated support for different activities of the security patch management process has great potential for reducing delays in installing security patches. However, it is also important to understand how automation is used in practice, its limitations in meeting real-world needs and what practitioners really need, an area that has not been empirically investigated in the existing software engineering literature. This paper reports an empirical study aimed at investigating different aspects of automation for security patch management using semi-structured interviews with 17 practitioners from three different organisations in the healthcare domain. The findings are focused on the role of automation in security patch management for providing insights into the as-is state of automation in practice, the limitations of current automation, how automation support can be enhanced to effectively meet practitionersâ€™ needs, and the role of the human in an automated process. Based on the findings, we have derived a set of recommendations for directing future efforts aimed at developing automated support for security patch management.
