The article describes the traveling-wave thermoacoustic engine in which the hot heat source is at the ambient temperature (300 K), and the cold heat source has a cryogenic temperature (110 K). A description of its mathematical model is given and the results of modeling the steady-state operating mode in the program for the development of low-amplitude devices with thermoacoustic energy conversion DeltaEC (Design Environment for Low-amplitude Thermoacoustic Energy Conversion) are presented. The type of engine described in this work can use in many practical applications, for example, it can be used to convert energy from various heat sources in technological processes involving the use of gaseous and liquid fluids with a cryogenic temperature level into electrical energy.
