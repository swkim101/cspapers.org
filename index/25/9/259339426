Flapping wing micro aerial vehicles face challenges in sensing and reacting to disturbances like wind gusts. This work introduces a new microscale bio-inspired digital strain sensor to detect these perturbations. The sensor is designed to change logic states when a specified strain threshold has been reached. The sensors are 3D printed on a flexible Mylar wing using two-photon polymerization. Three digital sensors with varying strain thresholds demonstrate differences in activation timing due to different design parameters. The sensors are tested at the 25 Hz flapping frequency of a hawkmoth, an insect with comparable wing size. A perturbation was added to the flapping wing by subjecting it to a 3 m/s wind gust. A single digital sensor is able to identify the wind disturbance by comparing the time of the first strain threshold crossing. A separate approach looks at the change in sensor ‘on’-time for each flap cycle and provides a clear indication of the wind disturbance.
