ranxhub is an online repository for sharing artifacts deriving from the evaluation of Information Retrieval systems. Specifically, we provide a platform for sharing pre-computed runs: the ranked lists of documents retrieved for a specific set of queries by a retrieval model. We also extend ranx, a Python library for the evaluation and comparison of Information Retrieval runs, adding functionalities to integrate the usage of ranxhub seamlessly, allowing the user to compare the results of multiple systems in just a few lines of code. In this paper, we first outline the many advantages and implications that an online repository for sharing runs can bring to the table. Then, we introduce ranxhub and its integration with ranx, showing its very simple usage. Finally, we discuss some use cases for which ranxhub can be highly valuable for the research community.
