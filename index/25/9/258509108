Labeled data often comes at a high cost as it may require recruiting human labelers or running costly‘ experiments. At the same time, in many practical scenarios, one already has access to a partially labeled, potentially biased dataset that can help with the learning task at hand. Motivated by such settings, we formally initiate a study of semi-supervised active learning through the frame of linear regression. Here, the learner has access to a dataset X ∈ R ( n un + n lab ) × d composed of n un unlabeled examples that a learner can actively query, and n lab examples labeled a priori. Denoting the true labels by Y ∈ R n un + n lab , the learner’s objective is to ﬁnd (cid:98) β ∈ R d such that,
