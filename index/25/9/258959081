ATOMIC is a large-scale commonsense knowledge graph (CSKG) containing everyday if-then knowledge triplets, i.e., head event, relation, tail event. The one-hop annotation manner made ATOMIC a set of independent bipartite graphs, which ignored the numerous links between events in different bipartite graphs and consequently caused shortages in knowledge coverage and multi-hop paths. In this work, we aim to construct Dense-ATOMIC with high knowledge coverage and massive multi-hop paths. The events in ATOMIC are normalized to a consistent pattern at first. We then propose a CSKG completion method called Rel-CSKGC to predict the relation given the head event and the tail event of a triplet, and train a CSKG completion model based on existing triplets in ATOMIC. We finally utilize the model to complete the missing links in ATOMIC and accordingly construct Dense-ATOMIC. Both automatic and human evaluation on an annotated subgraph of ATOMIC demonstrate the advantage of Rel-CSKGC over strong baselines. We further conduct extensive evaluations on Dense-ATOMIC in terms of statistics, human evaluation, and simple downstream tasks, all proving Dense-ATOMICâ€™s advantages in Knowledge Coverage and Multi-hop Paths. Both the source code of Rel-CSKGC and Dense-ATOMIC are publicly available on https://github.com/NUSTM/Dense-ATOMIC.
