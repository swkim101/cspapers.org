We propose a novel solution for unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation. To translate complex images with a wide range of objects to a different domain, recent approaches often use the object annotations to perform per-class source-to-target style mapping. However, there remains a point for us to exploit in the I2I. An object in each class consists of multiple components, and all the sub-object components have different characteristics. For example, a car in CAR class consists of a car body, tires, windows and head and tail lamps, etc., and they should be handled separately for realistic I2I translation. The simplest solution to the problem will be to use more detailed annotations with sub-object component annotations than the simple object annotations, but it is not possible. The key idea of this paper is to bypass the sub-object component annotations by leveraging the original style of the input image because the original style will include the information about the characteristics of the sub-object components. Specifically, for each pixel, we use not only the per-class style gap between the source and target domains but also the pixelâ€™s original style to determine the target style of a pixel. To this end, we present Style Harmonization for unpaired I2I translation (SHUNIT). Our SHUNIT generates a new style by harmonizing the target domain style retrieved from a class memory and an original source image style. Instead of direct source-to-target style mapping, we aim for source and target styles harmonization. We validate our method with extensive experiments and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the latest benchmark sets. The source code is available online: https://github.com/bluejangbaljang/SHUNIT.
