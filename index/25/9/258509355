1. For all authors... (a) Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paperâ€™s contributions and scope? [Yes] (b) Did you describe the limitations of your work? [Yes] Our method out perform other methods by a large margin on heterogeneous dataset, the performance on random/biased datasets is not the best compared to other methods. (c) Did you discuss any potential negative societal impacts of your work? [No] (d) Have you read the ethics review guidelines and ensured that your paper conforms to them? [Yes] 2. If you are including theoretical results... (a) Did you state the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results? [N/A] (b) Did you include complete proofs of all theoretical results? [N/A] 3. If you ran experiments... (a) Did you include the code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experimental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL)? [Yes] (b) Did you specify all the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen)? [Yes] (c) Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times)? [Yes] (d) Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)? [Yes] 4. If you are using existing assets (e.g., code, data, models) or curating/releasing new assets... (a) If your work uses existing assets, did you cite the creators? [Yes] (b) Did you mention the license of the assets? [No] (c) Did you include any new assets either in the supplemental material or as a URL? [N/A]
