We study the challenging problem of recovering detailed motion from a single motion-blurred image. Existing solutions to this problem estimate a single image sequence without considering the motion ambiguity for each region. Therefore, the results tend to converge to the mean of the multi-modal possibilities. In this paper, we explicitly account for such motion ambiguity, allowing us to generate multiple plausible solutions all in sharp detail. The key idea is to introduce a motion guidance representation, which is a compact quantization of 2D optical flow with only four discrete motion directions. Conditioned on the motion guidance, the blur decomposition is led to a specific, unambiguous solution by using a novel two-stage decomposition network. We propose a unified framework for blur decomposition, which supports various interfaces for generating our motion guidance, including human input, motion information from adjacent video frames, and learning from a video dataset. Extensive experiments on synthesized datasets and real-world data show that the proposed framework is qualitatively and quantitatively superior to previous methods, and also offers the merit of producing physically plausible and diverse solutions.
