 This article explores various uncertain control co-design (UCCD) problem formulations. While previous work offers formulations that are method-dependent and limited to only a handful of uncertainties (often from one discipline), effective application of UCCD to real-world dynamic systems requires a thorough understanding of uncertainties and how their impact can be captured. Since the first step is defining the UCCD problem of interest, this article aims at addressing some of the limitations of the literature by identifying possible sources of uncertainties in a general UCCD context and then formalizing ways in which their impact is captured through problem formulation alone (without having to immediately resort to solution strategies). We first develop a universal UCCD formulation and discuss its fundamental elements. Issues such as the treatment of the objective function, the challenge of the analysis-type equality constraints, and various formulations for inequality constraints are discussed. Then, more specialized problem formulations such as the risk-neutral and risk-averse stochastic, worst-case robust, probabilistic robust, fuzzy expected value, and possibilistic chance-constrained UCCD formulations are presented. Key concepts from these formulations, along with insights from closely-related fields, such as robust and stochastic control theory, are discussed, and future research directions are identified.
