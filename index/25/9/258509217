Incremental implicitly-refined classification task aims at assigning hierarchical labels to each sample encountered at different phases. Existing methods tend to fail in generating hierarchy-invariant descriptors when the novel classes are inherited from the old ones. To address the issue, this paper, which explores the inheritance relations in the process of multi-level semantic increment, proposes an Uncertainty-Aware Hierarchical Refinement (UAHR) scheme. Specifically, our proposed scheme consists of a global representation extension strategy that enhances the discrimination of incremental representation by widening the corresponding margin distance, and a hierarchical distribution alignment strategy that refines the distillation process by explicitly determining the inheritance relationship of the incremental class. Particularly, the shifting subclasses are corrected under the guidance of hierarchical uncertainty, ensuring the consistency of the homogeneous features. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks ( i.e. , IIRC-CIFAR, IIRC-ImageNet-lite, IIRC-ImageNet-Subset, and IIRC-ImageNet-full) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches.
