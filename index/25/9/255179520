Service robots are mobile autonomous robots, often operating in uncertain and difficult environments. While being increasingly popular, engineering service robots is challenging. Especially, evolving them from prototype to deployable product requires effective validation and verification, assuring the robot's correct and safe operation in the target environment. While testing is the most common validation and verification technique used in practice, surprisingly little is known about the actual testing practices and technologies used in the service robotics domain. We present an experience report on field testing of an industrial-strength service robot, as it transitions from lab experiments to an operational environment. We report challenges and solutions, and reflect on their effectiveness. Our long-term goal is to establish empirically-validated testing techniques for service robots. This experience report constitutes a necessary, but self-contained first step, exploring field testing practices in detail. Our data sources are detailed test artifacts and developer interviews. We model the field testing process and describe test-case design practices. We discuss experiences from performing these field tests over a 10-month test campaign.
