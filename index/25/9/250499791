In the near future, autonomous systems such as multi-robot
systems are envisioned to increasingly co-exist with hu-
mans in our daily lives, from household service to large-
scale warehouse logistics, agriculture environment sampling,
and smart city. In these applications, robots and humans as
networked heterogeneous components will frequently inter-
act with each other in a variety of scenarios under uncer-
tain, rapidly-changing, and possibly hostile environment. On
one hand, harmonious interactions among robots, as well as
between robots and humans, would require safe integration
(e.g. collision-free close-proximity interactions) of heteroge-
neous robots, human, and human-robot autonomy. On the
other hand, reliable interactions among autonomous multi-
robot systems often call for resilient system integrity (e.g.
communication capability with potential robot failures) to re-
tain its capability of accomplishing complex tasks through
coordinated behaviors. In the proposed talk, I will discuss our
recent works towards safe autonomy and resilient autonomy
that aim to facilitate correct-by-design robotic behaviors in a
variety of applications.
