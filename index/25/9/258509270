In recommendation systems, global positioning, system identiﬁcation, and mobile social networks, it is a fundamental routine that a server completes a low-rank matrix from an observed subset of its entries. However, sending data to a cloud server raises up the data privacy concern due to eavesdropping attacks and the single-point failure problem, e.g., the Netﬂix prize contest was canceled after a privacy lawsuit. In this paper, we propose a homomorphic matrix completion algorithm for privacy-preserving purpose. First, we formulate a homomorphic matrix completion problem where a server performs matrix completion on cyphertexts, and propose an encryption scheme that is fast and easy to implement. Secondly, we prove that the proposed scheme satisﬁes the homomorphism property that decrypting the recovered matrix on cyphertexts will obtain the target matrix (on plaintexts). Thirdly, we prove that the proposed scheme satisﬁes an ( ✏ , � ) -differential privacy property. While with similar level of privacy guarantee, we reduce the best-known error bound O ( 10 p n 31 n 2 ) to EXACT recovery at a price of more samples. Finally, on synthetic data and real-world data, we show that both homomorphic nuclear-norm minimization and alternating minimization algorithms achieve accurate recoveries on cyphertexts, verifying the homomorphism property.
