Mixup is an efficient data augmentation technique, which improves generalization by interpolating random examples. While numerous approaches have been developed for Mixup in the Euclidean and in the hyperbolic space, they do not fully use the intrinsic properties of the examples, i.e., they manually set the geometry (Euclidean or hyperbolic) based on the overall dataset, which may be sub-optimal since each example may require a different geometry. We propose DynaMix, a framework that automatically selects an example-specific geometry and performs Mixup between the different geometries to improve training dynamics and generalization. Through extensive experiments in image and text modalities we show that DynaMix outperforms state-of-the-art methods over six downstream applications. We find that DynaMix is more useful in low-resource and semi-supervised settings likely because it displays a probabilistic view of the geometry.
