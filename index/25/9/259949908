The first edition of the Implicit Author Characterization from Texts for Search and Retrieval (IACT'23) aims at bringing to the forefront the challenges involved in identifying and extracting from texts implicit information about authors (e.g., human or AI) and using it in IR tasks. The IACT workshop provides a common forum to consolidate multi-disciplinary efforts and foster discussions to identify the wide-ranging issues related to the task of extracting implicit author-related information from the textual content, including novel tasks and datasets. We will also discuss the ethical implications of implicit information extraction. In addition, we announce a shared task focused on automatically determining the literary epochs of written books.
