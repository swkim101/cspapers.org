Semantic communication has emerged as the break-through beyond the Shannon theorem by transmitting and receiving semantic information instead of data bits or symbols regardless of its content. This paper proposes a two-stage reconstruction process to boost the system's performance. In the first phase, the image information is first decoded from the noisy received data by exploiting the channel knowledge. The decoded image is enhanced by a post-filter and image statistics. Different metrics are exploited to evaluate the image restoration quality of our considered model. Numerical results are obtained using natural images that verify the superior improvements of the proposed two-stage reconstruction process over the traditional decoded data. Moreover, the different metrics assessing the system performance based on their criteria can be conflicted with each other.
