This paper presents a framework for transferring surface finishing skills to new surface geometries while preserving the surface finish quality. The main idea is to estimate the contact area between the workpiece and the tool by using 3D point cloud approach and replicate a given material removal rate and the accumulated material removal, as these quantities are the main parameters for quality. The grinding motion trajectory is generated by solving a constrained optimization problem that minimizes the maximal point-wise deviation between actual and desired material removal and simultaneously minimizes the average deviation between actual and desired material removal rate. The proposed approach is verified in simulation to show the difference between direct replication of force/motion and the proposed replication of material removal. Finally, experimental results confirm that the quality of a surface finishing task can be transferred to new surface geometries with the proposed method.
