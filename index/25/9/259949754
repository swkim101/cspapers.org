Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of online micro-video platforms, in which the recommender system plays an essential role in overcoming the information overloading problem and providing personalized content for users. Although some progress has been achieved in the micro-video recommendation, there are still some limitations in learning the representations of user interests and video features. Specifically, the user modeling in existing works is performed at a coarse-grained level, i.e., video level. However, in micro-video recommendation, the user feedback is at a continuous form---users can skip over a video at each frame---which reveals fine-grained user preferences. In this work, we approach the problem of learning fine-grained user preferences for micro-video recommendation by first collecting two real-world datasets. To address the challenges of preference modeling and weak supervision signal, we propose a solution named FRAME (short for Fine-gRAined preference-modeling for Micro-video rEcommendation). Specifically, we first adopt visual feature extraction and transformation to maintain the fine-grained video embeddings. We then propose graph convolution layers to learn the user preference from complex and fine-grained user-clip relations, and hybrid-supervision objectives for enhancing the supervision signal. The experimental results on two collected real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. We release the datasets and codes in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/FRAME, which we believe can benefit the community.
