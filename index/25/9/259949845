Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as the foundation of the most advanced Information Retrieval (IR) models. Powered by PLMs, the latest IR research has proposed novel models, new domain adaptation algorithms as well as enlarged datasets. In this paper, we present a Python-based IR toolkit OpenMatch-v2. As a full upgrade of OpenMatch proposed in 2021, OpenMatch-v2 incorporates the most recent advancements of PLM-based IR research, providing support for new, cross-modality models and enhanced domain adaptation techniques with a streamlined, optimized infrastructure. The code of OpenMatch is publicly available at https://github.com/OpenMatch/OpenMatch.
