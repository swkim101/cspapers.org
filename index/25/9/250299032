Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous for decision making in planning social infrastructures.
In real-world scenarios, a decision-maker needs to solve his/her problem iteratively until he/she satisfies solutions, but such an iterative process remains challenging.
This paper studies a new explainable framework, particularly for finding meeting points, which is a key optimization problem for designing facility locations.
Our framework automatically fills the gap between its input instance and instances from which a user could obtain the desired outcome, where computed solutions are judged by the user.
The framework also provides users with explanations, representing the difference of instances for deeply understanding the process and its inside.
Explanations are clues for users to understand their situation and implement suggested results in practice (e.g., designing a coupon for free travel).
We experimentally demonstrate that our search-based framework is promising to solve instances with generating explanations in a sequential decision-making process.
