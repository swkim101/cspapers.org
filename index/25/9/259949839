Recently, Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been adopted to model a wide range of structured data from academic and industry fields. With the rapid development of Internet technology, there are more and more meaningful applications for Internet devices, including device identification, geolocation and others, whose performance needs improvement. To replicate the several claimed successes of GNNs, this paper proposes DeviceGPT based on a generative pre-training transformer on a heterogeneous graph via self-supervised learning to learn interactions-rich information of devices from its large-scale databases well. The experiments on the dataset constructed from the real world show DeviceGPT could achieve competitive results in multiple Internet applications.
