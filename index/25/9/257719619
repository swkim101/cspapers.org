Log creation, maintenance, and its persist ordering are known to be performance bottlenecks for durable transactions on persistent memory. Existing hardware persistent memory transactions overlook an important opportunity for improving performance: some persistent data is algorithmically redundant such that it can be recovered from other data, removing the need for logging such data. The paper presents an ISA extension that enables selective logging for hardware persistent memory transactions for the first time. The ISA extension features two novel components: fine-grain logging and lazy persistency. Fine-grain logging allows hardware to log updates on data in the granularity of words without lengthening the critical path of data accesses. Lazy persistency allows updated data to remain in the cache after the transaction commits. Together, the new hardware persistent memory transaction outperforms the state-of-the-art hardware counterpart by 1.8Ã— on average.
