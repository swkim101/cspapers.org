Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a bundle of items to users as a whole with user-bundle (U-B) interaction information, and auxiliary user-item (U-I) interaction and bundle-item affiliation information. Recent methods usually use two graph neural networks (GNNs) to model user's bundle preferences separately from the U-B graph (bundle view) and U-I graph (item view). However, by conducting statistical analysis, we find that the auxiliary U-I information is far underexplored due to the following reasons: 1) Loosely combining the predicted results cannot well synthesize the knowledge from both views. 2) The local U-B and U-I collaborative relations might not be consistent, leading to GNN's inaccurate modeling of user's bundle preference from the U-I graph. 3) The U-I interactions are usually modeled equally while the significant ones corresponding to user's bundle preference are less emphasized. Based on these analyses, we propose a Distillation-enhanced Graph Masked AutoEncoder (DGMAE) for bundle recommendation. Our framework extracts the knowledge of first- and higher-order U-B relations from the U-B graph and injects it into a well-designed graph masked autoencoder (student model). The student model is built with two key designs to jointly capture significant local and global U-I relations from the U-I graph. In specific, we design a transformer-enhanced GNN encoder for global relation learning, which increases the model's representational power of depicting user's bundle preferences. Meanwhile, an adaptive edge masking strategy and reconstruction target are designed on the significant U-I edges to guide the student model to identify the potential ones suggesting user's bundle preferences. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the significant improvements of DGMAE over the SOTA methods.
