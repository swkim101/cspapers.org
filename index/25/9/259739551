My research focuses on new techniques in machine learning and game theory to optimally allocate our scarce resources in multi-agent settings to maximize environmental sustainability. Drawing scientific questions from my close partnership with conservation organizations, I have advanced new lines of research in learning and planning under uncertainty, inspired by the low-data, noisy, and dynamic settings faced by rangers on the frontlines of protected areas.
