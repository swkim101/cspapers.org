Obtaining the shape and size of a robot's workspace is essential for both its design and control. However, determining the accurate workspace of a multi-segment continuum robot by graphic or analytical methods is a challenging task due to its inherent flexibility and complex structure. Existing numerical methods have limitations when applied to a continuum robot. This paper presents an Equivalent Two Section (ETS) method for calculating the workspace of multi-segment continuum robots. This method is based on the forward kinematics and a piecewise constant curvature (PCC) model to determine the boundaries of the workspace. In order to verify the proposed method, simulation experiments are conducted using six different maximum bending angles and seven different number of segments. Results of the ETS method are compared to the true workspaces of these configurations estimated by an exhaustive approach. The results show that the proposed ETS method is both efficient and accurate, and has small estimation errors. Discussions on the advantages and limitations of the proposed ETS method are also presented.
