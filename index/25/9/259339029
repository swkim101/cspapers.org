Previous research into using robots for pain man-agement has shown promise. However to date, there seems to have been little research investigating user requirements for robotic pain management devices which could be used by adults living with chronic pain, and how these might be translated into custom products. We carried out a user study comprising online surveys and interviews with people who have lived experience of chronic pain to investigate their perspectives. We had a total of 44 participants in our study. Our research revealed a preference for robotic devices for pain management which have an abstract or animal-like form, noting that contact points with the body should feel soft, warm, and light. Study participants also felt that the user should initiate the interaction and should have control of the robot, as well as the type and intensity of touch. Favored touch types included massaging, rubbing, and stroking. From the emerging requirements, given the diversity of experiences, design-related attributes identified could be used for a form-customization application, such as interactive evolutionary computation (IEC), as a means to personalize the embodiment of robotic devices. Prioritized form factors for customization through included size, weight, and feel.
