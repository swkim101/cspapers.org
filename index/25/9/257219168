Sim-and-real training is a promising alternative to sim-to-real training for robot manipulations. However, the current sim-and-real training is neither efficient, i.e., slow con-vergence to the optimal policy, nor effective, i.e., sizeable real-world robot data. Given limited time and hardware budgets, the performance of sim-and-real training is not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a Consensus-based Sim-And-Real deep reinforcement learning algorithm (CSAR) for manipulator pick-and-place tasks, which shows comparable performance in both sim-and- real worlds. In this algorithm, we train the agents in simulators and the real world to get the optimal policies for both sim-and-real worlds. We found two interesting phenomenons: (1) Best policy in simulation is not the best for sim-and-real training. (2) The more simulation agents, the better sim-and-real training.
