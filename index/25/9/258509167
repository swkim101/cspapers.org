To alleviate the unfavorable effect of noisy topology in Graph Neural networks (GNNs), some efforts perform the local topology reﬁnement through the pairwise propagation weight learning and the multi-channel extension. Unfortunately, most of them suffer a common and fatal drawback: irrelevant propagation to one node and in multi-channels. These two kinds of irrelevances make propagation weights in multi-channels free to be determined by the labeled data, and thus the GNNs are exposed to overﬁtting. To tackle this issue, a novel Orthogonal Propagation with Ego-Network modeling (OPEN) is proposed by modeling relevances between propagations. Speciﬁcally, the relevance between propagations to one node is modeled by whole ego-network modeling, while the relevance between propagations in multi-channels is modeled via diversity requirement. By interpreting the propagations to one node from the perspective of dimension reduction, propagation weights are inferred from principal components of the ego-network, which are orthogonal to each other. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations reveal four attractive characteristics of OPEN as modeling high-order relationships beyond pairwise one, preventing overﬁtting, robustness, and high efﬁciency.
