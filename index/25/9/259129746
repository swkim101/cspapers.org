Large Language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in assisting robot learning tasks, i.e., complex household planning.However, the performance of pretrained LLMs heavily relies on domain-specific templated text data, which may be infeasible in real-world robot learning tasks with image-based observations. Moreover, existing LLMs with text inputs lack the capability to evolve with non-expert interactions with environments.In this work, we introduce a novel learning paradigm that generates robotsâ€™ executable actions in the form of text, derived solely from visual observations. Our proposed paradigm stands apart from previous works, which utilized either language instructions or a combination of language and visual data as inputs. We demonstrate that our proposed method can employ two fine-tuning strategies, including imitation learning and reinforcement learning approaches, to adapt to the target test tasks effectively.We conduct extensive experiments involving various model selections, environments, and tasks across 7 house layouts in the VirtualHome environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing baselines, confirming the effectiveness of this novel learning paradigm.
