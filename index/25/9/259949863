Multi-task Recommender Systems (MTRSs) has become increasingly prevalent in a variety of real-world applications due to their exceptional training efficiency and recommendation quality. However, conventional MTRSs often input all relevant feature fields without distinguishing their contributions to different tasks, which can lead to confusion and a decline in performance. Existing feature selection methods may neglect task relations or require significant computation during model training in multi-task setting. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Single-shot Feature Selection framework for MTRSs, referred to as MultiSFS, which is capable of selecting feature fields for each task while considering task relations in a single-shot manner. Specifically, MultiSFS first efficiently obtains task-specific feature importance through a single forward-backward pass. Then, a data-task bipartite graph is constructed to learn field-level task relations. Subsequently, MultiSFS merges the feature importance according to task relations and selects feature fields for different tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness and properties of MultiSFS, we integrate it with representative MTRS models and evaluate on three real-world datasets. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility.
