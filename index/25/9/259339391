UMA-2 is a wheeled mobile platform equipped with a vacuum adhesion system, eight actuated joints and four passive ones, designed to climb vertical and curved surfaces. The platform can perform maintenance tasks such as corrosion removal and cleaning with grinding while climbing. The quality of the repairing process is largely affected by grinding process parameters including tool forces, toolpath and the robot trajectory accuracy. The current work introduces a trajectory analysis and adaptation model to control the UMA-2 platform to ensure specific surface quality KPIs and incorporating the effects of robot compliancy. The proposed trajectory analysis has been extensively validated through experimental campaigns representative of maintenance in wind power industry.
