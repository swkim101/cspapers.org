Broadly speaking, I hope to dedicate my PhD to improving our understanding of algorithmic economics with the ultimate goal of building welfare improving decentralized technology for markets. In the following pages, I describe how my past work has built on the existing literature to get closer to the goal of creating such technologies, and describe what research paths this work opens up for the rest of my PhD. I believe that my research has the potential to provide algorithmic solutions to problems in machine learning, optimization, and game theory, and can be used to improve the efficiency of online marketplaces.
