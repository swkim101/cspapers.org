A cuspidal serial robot can travel from one inverse kinematic solution to another without crossing a singularity. Cuspidal robots ask for extra care and caution in trajectory planning, as identifying an aspect related to one unique inverse kinematic solution is not possible. The issues related to motion planning with cuspidal robots are related to the inherent property arising from the geometric design of the robot. The cuspidality property has not been considered in recent industrial 6R robots with a non-spherical wrist. In this work, cuspidality is illustrated with the JACO robot (gen 2, non-spherical wrist), a serial arm by Kinova Robotics which is deployed in various applications and is cuspidal in nature. A nonsingular change of solutions for the robot is provided to highlight the effect of cuspidal robots on the interference with the environment. The pose with multiple inverse kinematic solutions in an aspect is presented. Problems in choosing the initial solution of the path in cuspidal robots, and its consequence, is illustrated with an example path in the workspace of the JACO robot. The paper presents the importance of cuspidality analysis of 6R robots and the implications of neglecting it.
