Adapting large pre-trained models (PTMs) through fine-tuning imposes prohibitive computational and storage burdens. Recent studies of delta tuning (DT), i.e., parameter-efficient tuning, find that only optimizing a small portion of parameters conditioned on PTMs could yield on-par performance compared to conventional fine-tuning. Generally, DT methods exquisitely design delta modules (DT modules) which could be applied to arbitrary fine-grained positions inside PTMs. However, the effectiveness of these fine-grained positions largely relies on sophisticated manual designation, thereby usually producing sub-optimal results. In contrast to the manual designation, we explore constructing DT modules in an automatic manner. We automatically S earch for the S parse S tructure of Delta Tuning (S 3 Delta). Based on a unified framework of various DT methods, S 3 Delta conducts the differentiable DT structure search through bi-level optimization and proposes shifted global sigmoid method to explicitly control the number of trainable parameters. Extensive experiments show that S 3 Delta surpasses manual and random structures with less trainable parameters. The searched structures preserve more than 99% fine-tuning performance with 0.01% trainable parameters. Moreover, the advantage of S 3 Delta is amplified with extremely low trainable parameters budgets (0.0009% âˆ¼ 0.01%). The searched structures are transferable and explainable, providing suggestions and guidance for the future design of DT methods.
