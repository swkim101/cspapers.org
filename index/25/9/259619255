The present paper introduces sparsely supervised instance segmentation, with the datasets being fully annotated bounding boxes and sparsely annotated masks. A direct solution to this task is self-training, which is not fully explored for instance segmentation yet. In this paper, we propose MaskBooster for sparsely supervised instance segmentation (SpSIS) with comprehensive usage of pseudo masks. MaskBooster is featured with (1) dynamic and progressive pseudo masks from an online updating teacher model, (2) refining binary pseudo masks with the help of bounding box prior, (3) learning inter-class prediction distribution via knowledge distillation for soft pseudo masks. As an end-to-end and universal self-training framework, MaskBooster can empower fully supervised algorithms and boost their segmentation performance on SpSIS. Abundant experiments are conducted on COCO and BDD100K datasets and validate the effectiveness of MaskBooster. Specifically, on different COCO protocols and BDD100K, we surpass sparsely supervised baseline by a large margin for both Mask RCNN and ShapeProp. MaskBooster on SpSIS also outperforms weakly and semi-supervised instance segmentation state-of-the-art on the datasets with similar annotation budgets.
