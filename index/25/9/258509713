Stochastic approximation is a foundation for many algorithms found in machine learning and optimization. It is in general slow to converge: the mean square error vanishes as O ( n − 1 ) . A deterministic counterpart known as quasi-stochastic approximation is a viable alternative in many applications, including gradient-free optimization and reinforcement learning. It was assumed in prior research that the optimal achievable convergence rate is O ( n − 2 ) . It is shown in this paper that through design it is possible to obtain far faster convergence, of order O ( n − 4+ δ ) , with δ > 0 arbitrary. Two techniques are introduced for the ﬁrst time to achieve this rate of convergence. The theory is also specialized within the context of gradient-free optimization, and tested on standard benchmarks. The main results are based on a combination of novel application of results from number theory and techniques adapted from stochastic approximation theory.
