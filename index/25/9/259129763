The goal of this paper is to revisit Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) through dualization of a difference of convex functions. This allows to naturally extend KPCA to multiple objective functions and leads to efficient gradient-based algorithms avoiding the expensive SVD of the Gram matrix. Particularly, we consider objective functions that can be written as Moreau envelopes, demonstrating how to promote robustness and sparsity within the same framework. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing significant speedup in KPCA training time as well as highlighting the benefits in terms of robustness and sparsity.
