A robot must comply with very restrictive safety standards in close human-robot collaboration applications. These standards limit the robot's performance because of speed reductions to avoid potentially large forces exerted on humans during collisions. On-robot capacitive proximity sensors (CPS) can serve as a solution to allow higher speeds and thus better productivity. They allow early reactive measures before contacts occur to reduce the forces during collisions. An open question on designing the systems is the selection of an adequate activation distance to trigger safety measures for a specific robot while considering latency and detection robustness. Furthermore, the systems' actual effectiveness of impact attenuation and performance gain has not been evaluated before. In this work, we define and conduct a unified test procedure based on collision experiments to determine these parameters and investigate the performance gain. Two capacitive proximity sensor systems are evaluated on this test strategy on two robots. A significant performance increase can be achieved, since a small detection distance doubles robot operation speed while maintaining the same contact force as without Capacitive Proximity Sensor (CPS). This work can serve as a reference guide for designing, configuring and implementing future on-robot CPS.
