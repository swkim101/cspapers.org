In this paper, a new demonstration-based path-planning framework for the visual inspection of large structures using UAVs is proposed. We introduce UPPLIED: UAV Path PLanning for InspEction through Demonstration, which utilizes a demonstrated trajectory to generate a new trajectory to inspect other structures of the same kind. The demonstrated trajectory can inspect specific regions of the structure and the new trajectory generated by UPPLIED inspects similar regions in the other structure. The proposed method generates inspection points from the demonstrated trajectory and uses standardization to translate those inspection points to inspect the new structure. Finally, the position of these inspection points is optimized to refine their view. Numerous experiments were conducted with various structures and the proposed framework was able to generate inspection trajectories of various kinds for different structures based on the demonstration. The trajectories generated match with the demonstrated trajectory in geometry and at the same time inspect the regions inspected by the demonstration trajectory with minimum deviation.
