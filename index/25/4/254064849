Multi-agent path finding in dynamic environments is of great academic and practical value for multi-robot systems in the real world. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the learning process during path planning in dynamic environments, we introduce an algorithm called Attention and BicNet based Multi-agent path planning with effective reinforcement (AB-Mapper) under the actor-critic reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, on one hand, we design an actor-network that can utilize the BicNet with communication function to achieve the intra-team coordination. On the other hand, we propose a critic network that can selectively allocate attention weights to surrounding agents. This attention mechanism allows an individual agent to automatically learn a better evaluation of actions by considering the behaviours of its surrounding agents. Compared with the SOTA method Mapper in crowded environments with dynamic obstacles, our AB-Mapper is more effective (90.27±0.06% vs. 61.65±13.90% in terms of mean success rate) in solving the general multi-agent path finding problem.
