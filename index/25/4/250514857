Robotic engineers face major challenges to solve the complex actuation needs of Human-Robot Collaboration with existing act robotic gearboxes. Available technologies comprise high-ratio Planetary Gearheads, Cycloid Drives and Harmonic Drives, inherited from conventional industrial robotics. Alternative approaches include Direct-Drive and Quasi Direct-Drive actuation strategies, which propose to cancel or substantially reduce gear ratio, in order to minimize reflected inertia and attain enough backdrivability for collaborative tasks. This paper presents the proof-of-concept validation of a novel high-ratio, Wolfrom-based, gearbox technology that follows a different approach to attain the same objective. Testing five different gearbox prototypes, we confirm the ability of the R2poweR technology to improve efficiency and backdrivability while retaining the weight and control advantages derived from the use of high reduction ratios. The result is a highly efficient, backdrivable, high-ratio gearbox with exciting Huma-Robot Collaboration potential.
