It was found that the use of natural magnesium hydroxide (n–MDH) as mineral filler in EVA based composites provided mechanical and rheological properties that did not completely comply with the halogen-free flame-retardant (HFFR) cables parameters. Moreover, the use of n–MDH mostly gave a rough grey surface in the compound extruded by rheometry capillary. In contrast, with the use of synthetic material (s–MDH), a combination of better outcomes was observed. Mechanical and rheological properties were more aligned with the application, and the aesthetics were also improved, i.e., the surface was smooth and whiter. Therefore, with the aim of obtaining good aesthetical quality on the extrudate, we studied formulations by varying the type of polymer matrix and using a mixture of the natural magnesium hydroxide combined with other kind of fillers (in a 3:1 ratio using as main filler n–MDH). On this account, we found a synergistic effect in the mechanical, rheological, and aesthetic properties for the filler blend system containing n–MDH in combination with s–MDH or Böhmite AlO(OH), or using a secondary polymer belonging to the polybutene family combined with EVA.
