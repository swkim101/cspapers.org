. Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection plays a crucial role in activity understanding. Though signiﬁcant progress has been made, interactiveness learning remains a challenging problem in HOI detection: existing methods usually generate redundant negative H-O pair proposals and fail to eﬀectively extract interactive pairs. Though interactiveness has been studied in both whole body- and part- level and facilitates the H-O pairing, previous works only focus on the target person once ( i.e. , in a local perspective) and overlook the information of the other persons. In this paper, we argue that comparing body-parts of multi-person simultaneously can aﬀord us more useful and supplementary interactiveness cues. That said, to learn body-part interactiveness from a global perspective: when classifying a target person’s body-part interactiveness, visual cues are explored not only from herself/himself but also from other persons in the image . We construct body-part saliency maps based on self-attention to mine cross-person informative cues and learn the holistic relationships between all the body-parts. We evaluate the proposed method on widely-used benchmarks HICO-DET and V-COCO. With our new perspective, the holistic global-local body-part interactiveness learning achieves signiﬁcant improvements over state-of-the-art.
