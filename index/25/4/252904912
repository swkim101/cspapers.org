The ability to correctly identify areas damaged by forest wildfires is essential to plan and monitor the restoration process and estimate the environmental damages after such catastrophic events. The wide availability of satellite data, combined with the recent development of machine learning and deep learning methodologies applied to the computer vision field, makes it extremely interesting to apply the aforementioned techniques to the field of automatic burned area detection. One of the main issues in such a context is the limited amount of labeled data, especially in the context of semantic segmentation. In this paper, we introduce a publicly available dataset for the burned area detection problem for semantic segmentation. The dataset contains 73 satellite images of different forests damaged by wildfires across Europe with a resolution of up to 10m per pixel. Data were collected from the Sentinel-2 L2A satellite mission and the target labels were generated from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) annotations, with five different severity levels, ranging from undamaged to completely destroyed. Finally, we report the benchmark values obtained by applying a Convolutional Neural Network on the proposed dataset to address the burned area identification problem.
