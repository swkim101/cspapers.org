Employing query suggestion techniques to assist users in articulating their needs during online search has become increasingly vital for search engines in an age of exponential information growth. The success of a query suggestion system lies in understanding and modeling user search intent behind each query accurately, which can hardly be achieved without personalization efforts on taking advantage of dynamic user feedback behaviors and rich contextual information. This valuable area, however, has been still largely untapped by current query suggestion systems. In this work, we propose Dynamic Searching Flow Model (DSFM), a query suggestion framework that is capable of modeling and refining user search intent progressively in recruitment scenarios by leveraging a dynamic flow mechanism. Here the concepts of local flow and global flow are introduced to capture the real-time intention of users and the overall influence of a session, respectively. By utilizing rich semantic information contained in resumes and job requirements, DSFM enables the personalization of query suggestions. In addition, weighted contrast learning is introduced into the training process to produce more extensive targeted query samples and partially alleviate the exposure bias. The adoption of attention mechanism allows the selection of the most relevant information to compose the final intention representation. Extensive experimental results on different categories of real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on the task of query suggestion for online recruitment platforms.
