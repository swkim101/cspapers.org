Dense retrieval (DR) has shown promising results in many information retrieval (IR) related tasks, whose foundation is high-quality text representations for effective search. Taking the pre-trained language models (PLMs) as the text encoders has become a popular choice in DR. However, the learned representations based on these PLMs often lose the discriminative power, and thus hurt the recall performance, particularly as PLMs consider too much content of the input texts. Therefore, in this work, we propose to pre-train a discriminative language representation model, called DiscBERT, for DR. The key idea is that a good text representation should be able to automatically keep those discriminative features that could well distinguish different texts from each other in the semantic space. Specifically, inspired by knowledge distillation, we employ a simple yet effective training method, called self-teaching, to distill the model's knowledge constructed when training on the sampled representative tokens of a text sequence into the model's knowledge for the entire text sequence. By further fine-tuning on publicly available retrieval benchmark datasets, DiscBERT can outperform the state-of-the-art retrieval methods.
