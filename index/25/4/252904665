Traffic is the pulse of the city. Transportation systems can involve humans, vehicles, shipments, information technology, and the physical infrastructure, all interacting in complex ways. Intelligent transportation enables the city to function in a more efficient and effective way. A wide range of city data become increasingly available, such as taxi trips, surveillance camera data, human mobility data from mobile phones or location-based services, events from social media, car accident reports, bike-sharing information, Points-Of-Interest, traffic sensors, public transportation data, and many more. This abundance of data poses a grand challenge to the CIKM research community: How to utilize such data toward city intelligence, across various transportation tasks? The 3rd workshop of "Data-driven Intelligent Transportation" welcomes articles and presentations in the areas of transportation systems, data mining, and artificial intelligence, conveying new advances and developments in theory, modeling, simulation, testing, case studies, as well as large-scale deployment.
