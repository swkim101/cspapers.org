Recently, the dominant DETR-based approaches apply central-concept spatial prior to accelerating Transformer detector convergency. These methods gradually refine the reference points to the center of target objects and imbue object queries with the updated central reference information for spatially conditional attention. However, centralizing reference points may severely deteriorate queries' saliency and confuse detectors due to the indiscriminative spatial prior. To bridge the gap between the reference points of salient queries and Transformer detectors, we propose SAlient Point-based DETR (SAP-DETR) by treating object detection as a transformation from salient points to instance objects. Concretely, we explicitly initialize a query-specific reference point for each object query, gradually aggregate them into an instance object, and then predict the distance from each side of the bounding box to these points. By rapidly attending to query-specific reference regions and the conditional box edges, SAP-DETR can effectively bridge the gap between the salient point and the query-based Transformer detector with a significant convergency speed. Experimentally, SAP-DETR achieves 1.4× convergency speed with competitive performance and stably promotes the SoTA approaches by ∼1.0 AP. Based on ResNet-DC-101, SAP-DETR achieves 46.9 AP.
