Soft robots can be incredibly robust and safe but typically fail to match the strength and precision of rigid robots. This dichotomy between soft and rigid is recently starting to break down, with emerging research interest in hybrid soft-rigid robots. In this work, we draw inspiration from Nature, which achieves the best of both worlds by coupling soft and rigid tissues-like muscle and bone-to produce biological systems capable of both robustness and strength. We present foundational, general-purpose pipelines to simulate and fabricate cable-driven soft-rigid robots with embedded skeletons. We show that robots built using these methods can fluidly mimic biological systems while achieving greater force output and external load resistance than purely soft robots. Finally, we show how our simulation and fabrication pipelines can be leveraged to create more complex robots and do model-based control.
