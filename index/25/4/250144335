Flexible Endoscopes (FEs) for colonoscopy present several limitations due to their inherent complexity, resulting in patient discomfort and lack of intuitiveness for clinicians. Robotic FEs with autonomous control represent a viable solution to reduce the workload of endoscopists and the training time while improving the procedure outcome. Prior works on autonomous endoscope FE control use heuristic policies that limit their generalisation to the unstructured and highly deformable colon environment and require frequent human intervention. This work proposes an image-based FE control using Deep Reinforcement Learning, called Deep Visuomotor Control (DVC), to exhibit adaptive behaviour in convoluted sections of the colon. DVC learns a mapping between the images and the FE control signal. A first user study of 20 expert gastrointestinal endoscopists was carried out to compare their navigation performance with DVC using a realistic virtual simulator. The results indicate that DVC shows equivalent performance on several assessment parameters, being more safer. Moreover, a second user study with 20 novice users was performed to demonstrate easier human supervision compared to a state-of-the-art heuristic control policy. Seamless supervision of colonoscopy procedures would enable endoscopists to focus on the medical decision rather than on the control of FE.
