In few-shot generative model adaptation, the model for target domain is prone to the mode-collapse. Recent studies attempted to mitigate the problem by matching the relationship among samples generated from the same latent codes in source and target domains. The objective is further extended to image patch-level to transfer the spatial correlation within an instance. However, the patch-level approach assumes the consistency of spatial structure between source and target domains. For example, the positions of eyes in two domains are almost identical. Thus, it can bring visual artifacts if source and target domain images are not nicely aligned. In this paper, we propose a few-shot generative model adaptation method free from such assumption, based on a motivation that generative models are progressively adapting from the source domain to the target domain. Such progressive changes allow us to identify semantically coherent image regions between instances generated by models at a neighboring training iteration to consider the spatial correlation. We also propose an importance-based patch selection strategy to reduce the complexity of patch-level correlation matching. Our method shows the state-of-the-art few-shot domain adaptation performance in the qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
