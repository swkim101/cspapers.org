Robot Operating System (ROS) is the most popular framework for developing robotics software. Typically, robotics software is safety-critical and employed in real-time systems requiring timing guarantees. Since the first generation of ROS provides no timing guarantee, the recent release of its second generation, ROS2, is necessary and timely, and has since received immense attention from practitioners and researchers. Unfortunately, the existing analysis of ROS2 showed the peculiar scheduling strategy of ROS2 executor, which severely affects the response time of ROS2 applications. This paper proposes a deadline-based scheduling strategy for the ROS2 executor. It further presents an analysis for an end-to-end response time of ROS2 workload (processing chain) and an evaluation of the proposed scheduling strategy for real workloads.
