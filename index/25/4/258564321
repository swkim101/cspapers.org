With the recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), a vast number of applications have emerged across various use cases. Among the plethora of NLP applications, many academic researchers are motivated to do work that has a positive social impact, in line with the recent initiatives of NLP for Social Good (NLP4SG). However, it is not always obvious to researchers how their research efforts are tackling today's big social problems. Thus, in this paper, we introduce NLP4SG Papers, a scientific dataset with three associated tasks that can help identify NLP4SG papers and characterize the NLP4SG landscape by: (1) identifying the papers that address a social problem, (2) mapping them to the corresponding UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and (3) identifying the task they are solving and the methods they are using. Using state-of-the-art NLP models, we address each of these tasks and use them on the entire ACL Anthology, resulting in a visualization workspace that gives researchers a comprehensive overview of the field of NLP4SG.
