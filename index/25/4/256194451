Robot grasping is subject to an inherent tradeoff: Grippers with a large span typically take a longer time to close, and fast grippers usually cover a small span. However, many practical applications of grippers require the ability to close a large distance rapidly. For example, grasping cloth typically requires pressing a wide span of fabric into a graspable cusp. Besides, the ability to perform human-like grasping and ease offabrication are also very important for new soft grippers. Here, we demonstrate a human-finger-inspired snapping gripper that exploits elastic instability to achieve rapid and reversible closing over a wide span. Using prestressed semi-rigid material as the skeleton, the gripper fingers can widely open (86 mm) and rapidly close (46 ms) following a trajectory similar to that of a thumb-index finger pinching, and is 2.7 times and 10.9 times better than the reference gripper in terms of span and speed, respectively. We theoretically give the design principle, simulatively verify the method, and experimentally test this gripper on a variety of rigid, flexible, and limp objects and achieve good mechanical performance.
