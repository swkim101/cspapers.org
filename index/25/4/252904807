Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have drawn attention due to their excellent performance in fraud detection tasks, which reveal fraudsters by aggregating the features of their neighbors. However, some fraudsters typically tend to alleviate their suspiciousness by connecting with many benign ones. Besides, label-imbalanced neighborhood also deteriorates fraud detection accuracy. Such behaviors violate the homophily assumption and worsen the performance of GNN-based fraud detectors. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Augment Graph Neural Network (DAGNN) for fraud detection tasks. In DAGNN, we design a two-pathway framework including disparity augment (DA) pathway and similarity augment (SA) pathway. Accordingly, we devise two novel information aggregation strategies. One is to augment the disparity between target node and its heterogenous neighbors in original topology. The other is to augment its similarity to homogenous neighbors in a relatively label-balanced neighborhood. The experimental results compared with the state-of-the-art models on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DAGNN.
