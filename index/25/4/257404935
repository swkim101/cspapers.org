Pneumatic soft robots present many advantages in manipulation tasks. Notably, their inherent compliance makes them safe and reliable in unstructured and fragile environments. However, full-body shape sensing for pneumatic soft robots is challenging because of their high degrees of freedom and complex deformation behaviors. Vision-based proprioception sensing methods relying on embedded cameras and deep learning provide a good solution to proprioception sensing by extracting the full-body shape information from the high-dimensional sensing data. But the current training data collection process makes it difficult for many applications. To address this challenge, we propose and demonstrate a robust sim-to-real pipeline that allows the collection of the soft robot's shape information in high-fidelity point cloud representation. The model trained on simulated data was evaluated with real internal camera images. The results show that the model performed with averaged Chamfer distance of 8.85 mm and tip position error of 10.12 mm even with external perturbation for a pneumatic soft robot with a length of 100.0 mm. We also demonstrated the sim-to-real pipeline's potential for exploring different configurations of visual patterns to improve vision-based reconstruction results.
