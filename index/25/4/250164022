How to achieve better results with fewer labeling costs remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present a new active learning framework, which for the first time incorporates contrastive learning into recently proposed one-bit supervision. Here one-bit supervision denotes a simple Yes or No query about the correctness of the model's prediction, and is more efficient than previous active learning methods requiring assigning accurate labels to the queried samples. We claim that such one-bit information is intrinsically in accordance with the goal of contrastive loss that pulls positive pairs together and pushes negative samples away. Towards this goal, we design an uncertainty metric to actively select samples for query. These samples are then fed into different branches according to the queried results. The Yes query is treated as positive pairs of the queried category for contrastive pulling, while the No query is treated as hard negative pairs for contrastive repelling. Additionally, we design a negative loss that penalizes the negative samples away from the incorrect predicted class, which can be treated as optimizing hard negatives for the corresponding category. Our method, termed as ObCP, produces a more powerful active learning framework, and experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate its superiority.
