In a hybrid memory system using DRAM as the NVM cache, DRAM and NVM can be accessed in serial or parallel mode. However, we found that using either mode alone will bring access latency and bandwidth problems. In this paper, we integrate these two access modes and design a simple but accurate predictor (called SAPredictor) to help choose the appropriate access mode, thereby avoiding long access latency and bandwidth problems to improve memory performance. Our experiments show that SAPredictor achieves an accuracy rate of up to 97.1% and helps reduce access latency by up to 35.6% at fairly low costs.
