Smart contract and DApp users are taking great risks, as they do not obtain necessary knowledge that can help them avoid using vulnera- ble and malicious contract code. In this paper, we develop a novel system Tx2TXT that can automatically create security-centric textual descriptions directly from smart contract bytecode. To capture the security aspect of financial applications, we formally define a funds transfer graph to model critical funds flows in smart contracts. To ensure the expressiveness and conciseness of the descriptions de- rived from these graphs, we employ a GCN-based model to identify security-related condition statements and selectively add them to our graph models. To convert low-level bytecode instructions to human- readable textual scripts, we leverage robust API signatures to recover bytecode semantics. We have evaluated Tx2TXT on 890 well-labeled vulnerable, malicious and safe contracts where developer-crafted descriptions are available. Our results have shown that Tx2TXT out- performs state-of-the-art solutions and can effectively help end users avoid risky contracts
