Modern security architectures provide Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to protect critical data and applications against malicious privileged software in so-called enclaves. However, the seamless integration of existing TEEs into the cloud is hindered, as they require substantial adaptation of the software executing inside an enclave as well as the cloud management software to handle enclaved workloads. We tackle these challenges by presenting VirTEE, the first TEE architecture that allows strongly isolated execution of unmodified virtual machines (VMs) in enclaves, as well as secure live migration of VM enclaves between VirTEE-enabled servers. Combined with its secure I/O capabilities, VirTEE enables the integration of enclaved computing in today's complex cloud infrastructure. We thoroughly evaluate our RISC-V-based prototype, and show its effectiveness and efficiency.
