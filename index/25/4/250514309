Disturbance mainly caused by recoil force in-evitably makes washing drone seriously deviate from the desired position, thereby reducing the cleaning efficiency. It is neces-sary to develop an effective anti-disturbance control method. Although some progresses have been made, the position error thereof is still large, rendering existing methods inapplicable in washing drone. In this paper, we propose a learning-based anti-disturbance control (LADC) method to significantly reduce the position error by combining robust nonlinear control and partial differential equation network (PDENet). Taking data noise into account, we use differential spectral normalization in the training of the PDENet. A distinguishing feature of our method is to directly learn PDENet parameters from flight logs without installing extra sensors. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms classical PD method and extended state observer (ESO) based control method with 70 % and 50 % reduced position error, respectively, and can be further applied in variable scenarios.
