Learning on graphs (LOG) plays a pivotal role in various high-impact application domains. The past decades have developed tremendous theories, algorithms, and open-source systems in answering what/who questions on graphs. However, recent studies reveal that the state-of-the-art techniques for learning on graphs (LOG) are often not trustworthy in practice with respect to several social aspects (e.g., fairness, transparency, security). A natural research question to ask is: how can we make learning algorithms on graphs trustworthy? To answer this question, we propose a paradigm shift, from answering what and who LOG questions to understanding how and why LOG questions. The TrustLOG workshop provides a venue for presenting, discussing, and promoting frontier research on trustworthy learning on graphs. Moreover, TrustLOG will serve as an impulse for the LOG community to identify novel research problems and shed new light on future directions.
