The successful application of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) has revolutionized the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by large-scale self-supervised pre-training. However, it is not easy to obtain high-performing models in domain-specific applications and deploy them online with strict QPS (Query Per Second) requirements for industrial practitioners. To solve these issues, the EasyNLP toolkit is designed for building PTM-based NLP applications with ease, which supports a comprehensive suite of NLP algorithms and is suitable for meeting the inference requirements in industry. It features knowledge-enhanced pre-training that captures rich domain knowledge to better support domain-specific applications. In addition, the knowledge distillation and prompt-based few-shot learning functionalities are provided to improve the performance of large-scale PTMs with little training data available, and to distill models to smaller ones that are suitable for online deployment. EasyNLP provides a unified framework of model training, inference and deployment for real-world applications, using simple high-level APIs or command-line tools. Currently, EasyNLP has powered over ten business units within Alibaba Group and is seamlessly integrated to the Platform of AI (PAI) products on Alibaba Cloud. EasyNLP is also beneficial for academia, as it integrates state-of-the-art methods and models to make it easy for researchers to benchmark and develop their own algorithms. We have released EasyNLP to public at GitHub (https://github.com/alibaba/EasyNLP).
