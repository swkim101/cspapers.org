This article describes the process and results of a detailed analysis of the existing compressor working process. This analysis is the starting point for the compressor modernization. The analysis has clarified the ‘starting point’ for engineers, identified problems with the initial design and helped to formulate the technical specification for optimization. In order to solve the problem, a CFD model of the compressor working process was created and verified with the available initial data. It was found that the front group of stages had low efficiency and the rear group of stages was significantly oversized in terms of flow rate. As a result, it was determined that it was necessary to concentrate on the development of the first 6 stages when modernizing the compressor. However, the development of the front group can only have a positive effect if there is a decrease in the reduced flow rate of the outlet unit.
