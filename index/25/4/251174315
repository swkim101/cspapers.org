Electrochemical characterization of alumina-based membranes obtained by two different techniques, sinterization or anodization, is performed by analyzing membrane potential values. This analysis allows us the estimation of the effective concentration of fixed charge in the membrane (Xef) and the transport number of the ions into the pores (ti), as well as the determination of ionic permselectivity (P(i)) and their correlation with the different structures (supported, symmetrical or asymmetric), geometrical parameters (pore size and porosity) and surface materials (alumina-zirconia or alumina) of the studied membranes. From these results, the electropositive character of the membranes was stated, but also the significant reduction (70%) in Xef value and around 30% in permselectivity when pore size increases from 25 nm to 100 nm, in the case of sinterized alumina-zirconia membranes with similar porosity (CRF samples), while the clear influence of pore size on the electrochemical behavior of the electrochemically synthesized alumina membranes (NPAM samples) was confirmed as well as the lower influence of membrane porosity. Moreover, the effect of protein (BSA) static fouling on electrochemical parameters for both CRF and NPAMs samples was also analyzed, and our results show a reduction in the electropositive character of both membranes, being this behavior opposite to that discussed for one of the NPAMs as a result of surface modification with a theophylline derivative (Theo 1).
