Ultrasound scanning is an imaging technique that aids medical professionals in diagnostics and interventional procedures. However, a trained human-in-the-loop (HITL) with a radiologist is required to perform the scanning procedure. We seek to create a novel ultrasound system that can provide imaging in the absence of a trained radiologist, say for patients in the field who suffered injuries after a natural disaster. One challenge of automating ultrasound scanning involves finding the optimal area to scan and then performing the actual scan. This task requires simultaneously maintaining contact with the surface while moving along it to capture high quality images. In this work, we present an automated Robotic Ultrasound System (RUS) to tackle these challenges. Our approach introduces a Bayesian Optimization framework to guide the probe to multiple points on the unknown surface. Our proposed framework collects the ultrasound images as well as the pose information at every probed point to estimate regions with high vessel density (information map) and the surface contour. Based on the information map and the surface contour, an area of interest is selected for scanning. Furthermore, to scan the proposed region, a novel 6-axis hybrid force-position controller is presented to ensure acoustic coupling. Lastly, we provide experimental results on two different phantom models to corroborate our approach.
