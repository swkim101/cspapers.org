Natural language processing (NLP) sees rich mobile applications. To support various language understanding tasks, a foundation NLP model is often fine-tuned in a federated, privacy-preserving setting (FL). This process currently relies on at least hundreds of thousands of labeled training samples from mobile clients; yet mobile users often lack willingness or knowledge to label their data. Such an inadequacy of data labels is known as a few-shot scenario; it becomes the key blocker for mobile NLP applications. For the first time, this work investigates federated NLP in the few-shot scenario (FedFSL). By retrofitting algorithmic advances of pseudo labeling and prompt learning, we first establish a training pipeline that delivers competitive accuracy when only 0.05% (fewer than 100) of the training data is labeled and the remaining is unlabeled. To instantiate the workflow, we further present a system FeS1, addressing the high execution cost with novel designs: (1) Curriculum pacing, which injects pseudo labels to the training workflow at a rate commensurate to the learning progress; (2) Representational diversity, a mechanism for selecting the most learnable data, only for which pseudo labels will be generated; (3) Co-planning of a model's training depth and layer capacity. Together, these designs reduce the training delay, client energy, and network traffic by up to 46.0×, 41.2× and 3000.0×, respectively. Through algorithm/system co-design, FeS demonstrates that FL can apply to challenging settings where most training samples are unlabeled.
