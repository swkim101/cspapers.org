We present GALGO, a system for large scale graph analytics. GALGO provides complex graph analytics in a parallel cluster, exploiting a parallel database system as a computation engine. In this demonstration we show that fundamental graph algorithms including all pairs shortest path, single source shortest path, PageRank, triangle counting, connected components and reachability can be solved completely with queries, dynamically generated by our system. Our system presents performance that is very competitive to state-of-the-art graph systems. Furthermore, our out-of-core graph computation can process graphs larger than available main memory, without compromising performance.
