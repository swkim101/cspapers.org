We study the design of embeddings into Euclidean space with outliers. Given a metric space $(X,d)$ and an integer $k$, the goal is to embed all but $k$ points in $X$ (called the"outliers") into $\ell_2$ with the smallest possible distortion $c$. Finding the optimal distortion $c$ for a given outlier set size $k$, or alternately the smallest $k$ for a given target distortion $c$ are both NP-hard problems. In fact, it is UGC-hard to approximate $k$ to within a factor smaller than $2$ even when the metric sans outliers is isometrically embeddable into $\ell_2$. We consider bi-criteria approximations. Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm that approximates the outlier set size to within an $O(\log^4 k)$ factor and the distortion to within a constant factor. The main technical component in our result is an approach for constructing a composition of two given embeddings from subsets of $X$ into $\ell_2$ which inherits the distortions of each to within small multiplicative factors. Specifically, given a low $c_S$ distortion embedding from $S\subset X$ into $\ell_2$ and a high(er) $c_X$ distortion embedding from the entire set $X$ into $\ell_2$, we construct a single embedding that achieves the same distortion $c_S$ over pairs of points in $S$ and an expansion of at most $O(\log k)\cdot c_X$ over the remaining pairs of points, where $k=|X\setminus S|$. Our composition theorem extends to embeddings into arbitrary $\ell_p$ metrics for $p\ge 1$, and may be of independent interest. While unions of embeddings over disjoint sets have been studied previously, to our knowledge, this is the first work to consider compositions of nested embeddings.
