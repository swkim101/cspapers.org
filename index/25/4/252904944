Artificial Intelligence techniques on malware run-time behavior have emerged as a promising tool in the arms race against sophisticated and stealthy cyber-attacks. While data of malware run-time features are critical for research and benchmark comparisons, unfortunately, there is a dearth of real-world datasets due to multiple challenges to their collection. The evasive nature of malware, its dependence on connected real-world conditions to execute, and its potential repercussions pose significant challenges for executing malware in laboratory settings. Consequently, prior open datasets rely on isolated virtual sandboxes to run malware, resulting in data that is not representative of malware behavior in the wild. This paper presents RaDaR, an open real-world dataset for run-time behavioral analysis of Windows malware. RaDaR is collected by executing malware on a real-world testbed with Internet connectivity and in a timely manner, thus providing a close-to-real-world representation of malware behavior. To enable an unbiased comparison of different solutions and foster multiple verticals in malware research, RaDaR provides a multi-perspective data collection and labeling of malware activity. The multi-perspective collection provides a comprehensive view of malware activity across the network, operating system (OS), and hardware. On the other hand, the multi-perspective labeling provides four independent perspectives to analyze the same malware, including its methodology, objective, capabilities, and the information it exfiltrates. To date, RaDaR includes 7 million network packets, 11.3 million OS system call traces, and 3.3 million hardware events of 10,434 malware samples having different methodologies (3 classes) and objectives (9 classes), spread across 30 well-known malware families.
