Optane Persistent Memory (PM) is a pioneering solution to byte-addressable PM for commodity systems. However, the performance of Optane PM is highly workload-sensitive, rendering many prior designs of Key-Value (KV) store inefficient. To cope with this reality, we advocate rethinking KV store design for Optane PM. Our design follows a principle of Single-stream Writing with managed Multi-stream Reading (SWMR): Incoming KV pairs are written to PM through a single write stream and managed by an ordered index in DRAM. Through asynchronously sorting and rewriting large sets of KV pairs, range queries are handled with a managed number of concurrent streams. YCSB results show that our design improved upon existing ones by 116% and 21% for write-only throughput and read-write throughput, respectively.
