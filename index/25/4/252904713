The Mixed-Initiative ConveRsatiOnal Systems workshop (MICROS) aims at bringing novel ideas and investigating new solutions on conversational assistant systems. The increasing popularity of personal assistant systems, as well as smartphones, has changed the way users access online information, posing new challenges for information seeking and filtering. MICROS has a particular focus on mixed-initiative conversational systems, namely, systems that can provide answers in a proactive way (e.g., asking for clarification or proposing possible interpretations for ambiguous and vague requests). We invite people working on conversational systems or interested in the workshop topics to send us their position and research manuscripts.
