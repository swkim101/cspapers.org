The task of live traffic condition prediction, which aims at predicting live traffic conditions (i.e., fast, slow, and congested) based on traffic information on roads, plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, such as navigation, route planning, and ride-hailing services. Existing solutions have adopted aggregated trajectory data to generate traffic estimates, which inevitably suffer from GPS drift caused by cluttered urban road scenarios. In addition, the trajectory information alone is insufficient to provide evidence for sudden traffic situations and perception of street-wise elements. To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we present DuTraffic, which is a robust and production-ready solution for live traffic condition prediction by taking both trajectory data and street views into account. Specifically, the vision-based detection and segmentation modules are developed to forecast traffic flow by using street views. Then, we propose a spatial-temporal-based module, TRST-Net, to learn the latent trajectory representation. Finally, a bilinear model is introduced to mix these two representations and then predicts live traffic conditions with trajectory data and street views in a mutually complementary manner. The task is recast as a multi-task learning problem, which could benefit from the strong representation of latent space manifold modeling. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale, real-world datasets from Baidu Maps demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of DuTraffic. In addition, DuTraffic has already been deployed in production at Baidu Maps since December 2020, handling tens of millions of requests every day. This demonstrates that DuTraffic is a practical and robust industrial solution for live traffic condition prediction.
