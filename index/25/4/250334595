We study the classic divide-and-choose method for equitably allocating divisible goods between two players who are rational, self-interested Bayesian agents. The players have additive private values for the goods, gD1, gD2, ..., gDn for the divider, and gC1, gC2, ..., gCn for the chooser. The prior distributions GDi and gCi, from which gDi and gCi are respectively drawn, are independent and common knowledge. After observing each gDi, the divider allocates each good fractionally between Pile 1 and Pile 2, then the chooser decides which player gets which pile.
