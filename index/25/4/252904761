The Fashion domain is one of the most profitable domains in most of the e-commerce shops, shoes being one of the top-selling categories within this domain. When shopping for shoes, one of the most important aspects for the buyers is the shoe size. Shoe size charts differ between different brands, geographical regions, genders and age groups. Not providing some of these details, as a buyer or a seller, could lead to a query intent to inventory mismatch and reduced or wrong search results. Furthermore, buying the wrong shoe size is one of the top reasons for product returns, which causes shipping delays and loss in revenue. To address this issue, we propose an approach for shoe size resolution and normalization in search queries and product listings using Knowledge Graphs.
