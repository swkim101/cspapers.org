Spatiotemporal (ST) learning has become a crucial technique for urban digitalization. Due to expansions and dynamics of cities, current spatiotemporal models are inclined to suffer distribution shifts between training and testing sets, leading to the OOD delimma. However, few studies focus on such OOD problem in temporal regressions, let alone spatiotemporal learning. Spatiotemporal data usually reveals segment-level heterogeneity within periodicity and complex spatial dependencies, posing challenges to invariance extraction. In this paper, we find that ST relations make sense for generalization and devise a Causal ST learning framework, CauSTG, which enables invariant relation transferred to OOD scenarios. Specifically, we take temporal steps as environments, and transform spatial-temporal relations into learnable parameters. To tackle heterogeneity in periodicity, we partition temporal steps into sub-environments by identifying distinctive trend patterns, enabling re-organized samples trained separately. To extract invariance within ST observations, we propose a spatiotemporal consistency learner and a hierarchical invariance explorer to jointly filter out stable relations. Our spatiotemporal learner quantifies bi-directional spatial consistency and extracts disentangled seasonal-trend patterns via trainable parameters. Further, the hierarchical invariance explorer constructs variation-based filter to achieve both local and global invariances. Experiments reveal that CauSTG can increase at most 10.26% performance against best baselines, and visualized invariant relations can well interpret the physical rationales. The appendix and codes can be available in our Github repository.
