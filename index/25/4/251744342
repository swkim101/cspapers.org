Analog in-situ computation based on memristive circuits has been regarded as a promising approach for designing high-performance and low-power neural network accelerators. However, despite the low-cost and highly parallel memristive crossbars, the peripheral circuits especially analog-digital-converters (ADCs) induce significant overhead. Quantitative analysis shows that ADCs can contribute up to 91% energy consumption and 72% chip area, which significantly offset the advantages of memristive NN accelerators. To address this problem, we first mathematically analyze the computation flow in a memristive accelerator, and find that there are many useless operations. These operations significantly increase the demand for peripheral circuits. Then, based on our discovery, we propose a novel architecture, Tailor, which removes these unnecessary operations without accuracy loss. We design two types of Tailor. General Tailor is compatible with most existing memristive accelerators and can be easily applied to them. Customized Tailor is specialized for a certain NN application and can obtain more improvement. Experimental results show that, General Tailor can reduce 14% ~ 20% inference time and 33% ~ 41% energy consumption. Customized Tailor can further achieve 56% ~ 87% higher computation density.
