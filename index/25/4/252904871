Social recommender systems play a key role in solving the problem of information overload. In order to better extract latent hierarchical property in the data, they usually explore the user-user connections and user-item interactions in hyperbolic space. Existing methods resort tangent spaces to realize some operations (e.g., matrix multiplication) on hyperbolic manifolds. However, frequently projecting between the hyperbolic space and the tangent space will destroy the global structure of the manifold and reduce the accuracy of predictions. Besides, decisions made by users are often influenced by multi-aspect potential preferences, which are usually represented as a vector for each user. To this end, we design a novel hyperbolic-to-hyperbolic user representation with multi-aspect social recommender system, namely H2HMSR, which directly works in hyperbolic space. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model can adequately extract social information of users with multi-aspect preferences and outperforms hyperbolic and Euclidean counterparts.
