Stock prediction is a challenging task due to the uncertainty of stock markets. Despite the success of previous works, most of them rely on the assumption that stock data follow the identically identical distribution while the existence of multiple trading patterns in stock market violates it, ignoring multiple patterns in stock market will inevitably lead to the performance decline, and the lack of pattern prior knowledge further hinders the learning of patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel training process Pattern Adaptive Training based on Optimal Transport (OT) to train a set of predictors specializing in diverse patterns while without any prior pattern knowledge and inconsistent assumption. Based on this process, we further mine the potential fitness rank among specialists and design the Pattern Adaptive Specialist Network (PASN) with proposed ranking based selector to choose appropriate specialist predictor for samples. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves best IC and other metrics on real-world stock datasets.
