Recently, graph convolutional network (GCN) has become one of the most popular and state-of-the-art collaborative filtering (CF) methods. Existing GCN-based CF studies have made many meaningful and excellent efforts at loss function design and embedding propagation improvement. Despite their successes, we argue that existing methods have not yet properly explored more effective sampling strategy, including both positive sampling and negative sampling. To tackle this limitation, a novel framework named ITSM-GCN is proposed to carry out our designed Informative Training Sample Mining (ITSM) sampling strategy for the learning of GCN-based CF models. Specifically, we first adopt and improve the dynamic negative sampling (DNS) strategy, which achieves considerable improvements in both training efficiency and recommendation performance. More importantly, we design two potentially positive training sample mining strategies, namely a similarity-based sampler and score-based sampler, to further enhance GCN-based CF. Extensive experiments show that ITSM-GCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCN-based CF models, including LightGCN, SGL-ED and SimpleX. For example, ITSM-GCN improves on SimpleX by 12.0%, 3.0%, and 1.2% on Recall@20 for Amazon-Books, Yelp2018 and Gowalla, respectively.
