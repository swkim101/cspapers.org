Forming teams of experts who collectively hold a set of required skills and can successfully cooperate is challenging due to the vast pool of feasible candidates with diverse backgrounds, skills, and personalities. Neural models have been proposed to address scalability while maintaining efficacy by learning the distributions of experts and skills from successful teams in the past in order to recommend future teams. However, such models are prone to overfitting when training data suffers from a long-tailed distribution, i.e., few experts have most of the successful collaborations, and the majority has participated sparingly. In this paper, we present an optimization objective that leverages both successful and virtually unsuccessful teams to overcome the long-tailed distribution problem. We propose three negative sampling heuristics that can be seamlessly employed during the training of neural models. We study the synergistic effects of negative samples on the performance of neural models compared to lack thereof on two large-scale benchmark datasets of computer science publications and movies, respectively. Our experiments show that neural models that take unsuccessful teams (negative samples) into account are more efficient and effective in training and inference, respectively.
