Low-light environments have posed a formidable challenge for robust unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking even with state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers since the poten-tial image features are hard to extract under adverse light conditions. Besides, due to the low visibility, accurate online selection of the object also becomes extremely difficult for human monitors to initialize UAV tracking in ground con-trol stations. To solve these problems, this work proposes a novel enhancer, i.e., HighlightNet, to light up potential objects for both human operators and UAV trackers. By employing Transformer, HighlightNet can adjust enhancement parameters according to global features and is thus adaptive for the illumination variation. Pixel-level range mask is introduced to make HighlightNet more focused on the enhancement of the tracking object and regions without light sources. Furthermore, a soft truncation mechanism is built to prevent background noise from being mistaken for crucial features. Evaluations on image enhancement benchmarks demonstrate HighlightNet has advantages in facilitating human perception. Experiments on the public UAVDark135 benchmark show that HightlightNet is more suitable for UAV tracking tasks than other state-of-the-art (SOTA) low-light enhancers. In addition, real-world tests on a typical UAV platform verify HightlightNet's practicability and efficiency in nighttime aerial tracking-related applications.
