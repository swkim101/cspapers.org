The skyrocketing market value of cryptocurrencies has prompted more investors to pour funds into cryptocurrencies to seek asset hedging. However, the anonymity of blockchain makes cryptocurrency naturally a tool of choice for criminals to commit smart contract scams. Consequently, smart contract scam detection is particularly critical for investors to avoid economic loss. Previous methods mainly leverage specific code logic of smart contracts and/or design rules based on abnormal transaction behaviors for scam detection. Although these methods gain success at detecting particular scams, they perform worse when applied to scams with highly similar codes. Besides, well-designed decision rules rely on expert knowledge and tedious data collection steps, which causes poor flexibility. To combat these challenges, we consider the problem of smart contract scam detection via mining topological features of account interaction information that dynamically evolves. We adopt interactive features extracted from dynamic interaction information of accounts and propose a framework named TTG-SCSD to utilize the features and Topological Data Analysis for smart contract scams detection. The TTG-SCSD constructs discrete dynamic interaction graphs for each contract and designs interactive features that characterize account behaviors. The features are modeled combined with a topology quantification mechanism to capture contract intentions in transactions. Experimental results on real-world transaction datasets from Ethereum show that TTG-SCSD obtains better generalizability and improves the performance of the bare versions of the comparison methods.
