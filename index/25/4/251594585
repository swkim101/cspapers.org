Terrain-aware locomotion has become an emerging topic in legged robotics. However, it is hard to generate diverse, challenging, and realistic unstructured terrains in simulation, which limits the way researchers evaluate their locomotion policies. In this paper, we prototype the generation of a terrain dataset via terrain authoring and active learning, and the learned samplers can stably generate diverse high-quality terrains. We expect the generated dataset to make a terrain-robustness benchmark for legged locomotion. The dataset, the code implementation, and some policy evaluations are released at https://bit.ly/3bn4j7f.
