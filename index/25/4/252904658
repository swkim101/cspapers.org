Handling unanswerable questions in knowledge base question answering (KBQA) has been a focus in recent years. However, how to explain why a given question is unanswerable is rarely discussed. In this work, we seek not only to correct unanswerable questions based on a personal knowledge base, but also to explain the reason of the correction. We argue that different types of questions need heterogeneous subgraphs with different types of connections. We thus propose a heterogeneous subgraph aggregation network with a two-level attention mechanism to detect important entities and relations in subgraphs and attend to informative subgraphs for different questions. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five subgraphs and their combinations, with results that attest the effectiveness of incorporating heterogeneous subgraphs.
