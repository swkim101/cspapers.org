Given an sql, a rdbms performs a series of operations to generate a Query Execution Plan (qep), which tells how the results will be collected and returned eventually. The whole pipeline for obtaining the qep is the core functionality of a rdbms, thus is definitely a fundamental knowledge that must be acquired by database learners and junior engineers of any rdbms. Unfortunately, though the majority of rdbmss provide EXPLAIN statement to show the qep, general users cannot see how/why these plans are generated. The only way for learning that is to turn to the textbook, which contains limited number of predefined examples accordingly. However, they are too sketchy to allow us to have a hand-on experience in practice. In this work, we present a general framework, DBinsight, that unveils the query processing pipeline visually at each phase during the processing pipeline, including parsing, translating, query optimization, etc. Considering that the underlying designs and optimization strategies of rdbmss are different, in DBinsight we present an SQPProfile interface, such that heterogeneous data structures in various rdbmss are normalized to a uniform format. Thanks to that, in DBinsight we only need to focus on offering the presentation and interaction functionalities based on the uniformed SQPProfile, and do not need to worry about the difference in the underlying rdbmss.
