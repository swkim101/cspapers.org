Every day millions of people use online products and services to satisfy their information needs. While doing so, they produce large volumes of user-generated content (UGC). In this talk, we will distinguish between "explicit" UGC, which is intended to be made public (such as product ratings or reviews), and "implicit" UGC, which can be responsibly anonymized and aggregated in a privacy-preserving way to improve public health. We will analyze implicit UGC as a positive consumption externality, and will discuss its beneficial uses across a range of public health applications. The bulk of this talk will focus on methods for aggregating and analyzing the data to provide timely signals that help guide public health interventions and assess their efficacy. We will discuss applications such as estimating disease incidence, outbreak prediction, mitigating pandemic spread, and improving public health messaging.
