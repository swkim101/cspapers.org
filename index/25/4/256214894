The analysis of the current state of scientific and technical developments in the field of seawater desalination and wastewater distillation, in particular, the designs of desalination plants using a steam compressor. A method for gas-dynamic calculation of a steam compressor has been developed. Based on this model, a one-dimensional computational model was created to search for the configuration of a steam compressor using the IOSO optimization program. A mathematical model has been created to obtain the values of the flow parameters at any point of the interscapular channel, as well as to obtain the pressure and efficiency characteristics. Calculations for the strength of the impeller of a steam compressor were made, and the natural frequency of the rotor oscillations was determined. Based on the analysis obtained, a new design solution was worked out and a full-scale experiment was carried out.
