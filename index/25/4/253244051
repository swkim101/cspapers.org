Humans use audio signals in the form of spoken language or verbal reactions effectively when teaching new skills or tasks to other humans. While demonstrations allow humans to teach robots in a natural way, learning from trajectories alone does not leverage other available modalities including audio from human teachers. To effectively utilize audio cues accompanying human demonstrations, first it is important to understand what kind of information is present and conveyed by such cues. This work characterizes audio from human teachers demonstrating multi-step manipulation tasks to a situated Sawyer robot along three dimensions: (1) duration of speech used, (2) expressiveness in speech or prosody, and (3) semantic content of speech. We analyze these features for four different independent variables and find that teachers convey similar semantic content via spoken words for different conditions of (1) demonstration types, (2) audio usage instructions, (3) subtasks, and (4) errors during demonstrations. However, differentiating properties of speech in terms of duration and expressiveness are present for the four independent variables, highlighting that human audio carries rich information, potentially beneficial for technological advancement of robot learning from demonstration methods.
