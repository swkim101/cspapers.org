Sinapic acid, 3,5-dimethoxyl-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, belonging to the class of hydroxycinnamic acids, shows antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, renoprotective, neuroprotective, antidiabetic, anxiolytic, and antibacterial activity. The aim of this work was to incorporate sinapic acid into solid lipid nanoparticles in order to improve its bioavailability. SLNs were prepared using the hot high-speed homogenization method. The pharmaco-technological properties and thermotropic profile of SLNs encapsulated with sinapic acid, as well as their interaction with biomembrane models, were evaluated. SLNs showed promising physicochemical properties and encapsulation efficiency, as well as a desirable release profile; moreover, they facilitated the interaction of sinapic acid with a biomembrane model made of multilamellar vesicles. In conclusion, this formulation can be used in further studies to assess its suitability to improve sinapic acid activity.
