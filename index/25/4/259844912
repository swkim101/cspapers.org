We present SymRustC, a hybrid fuzzer for Rust. SymRustC is hybrid in the sense that it combines fuzzing and concolic execution. SymRustC leverages an existing tool called SymCC for its concolic execution capability and another existing tool called LibAFL for its fuzzing capability. Since SymCC instruments LLVM IR (Intermediate Representation) for concolic execution and the Rust compiler uses LLVM as a backend, we integrate SymCC with the Rust compiler to instrument Rust programs for concolic execution. LibAFL provides a framework to develop a fuzzer, and we use it to develop a hybrid fuzzer that combines fuzzing and our concolic execution. We discuss our implementation as well as four case studies to demonstrate that SymRustC can generate inputs that discover errors in Rust programs.
