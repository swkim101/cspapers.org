Assigning items to owners is a common problem found in various real-world applications, for example, audience-channel matching in marketing campaigns, borrower-lender matching in loan management, and shopper-merchant matching in e-commerce. Given an objective and multiple constraints, an assignment problem can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Such assignment problems are usually NP-hard [21], so when the number of items or the number of owners is large, solving for exact solutions becomes challenging. In this paper, we are interested in solving constrained assignment problems with hundreds of millions of items. Thus, with just tens of owners, the number of decision variables is at billion-scale. This scale is usually seen in the internet industry, which makes decisions for large groups of users. We relax the possible integer constraint, and formulate a general optimization problem that covers commonly seen assignment problems. Its objective function is convex. Its constraints are either linear, or convex and separable by items. We study to solve our generalized assignment problems in the Bregman Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (BADMM) framework where we exploit Bregman divergence to transform the Augmented Lagrangian into a separable form, and solve many subproblems in parallel. The entire solution can thus be implemented using a MapReduce-style distributed computation framework. We present experiment results on both synthetic and real-world datasets to verify its accuracy and scalability.
