Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to exploit the pixel-level annotated samples on source domain to assist the segmentation of unlabeled samples on target domain. For such a task, the key is to construct reliable supervision signals on target domain. However, existing methods can only provide unreliable supervision signals constructed by segmentation model (SegNet) that are generally domain-sensitive. In this work, we try to find a domain-robust clue to construct more reliable supervision signals. Particularly, we experimentally observe the domain-robustness of optical flow in video tasks as it mainly represents the motion characteristics of scenes. However, optical flow cannot be directly used as supervision signals of semantic segmentation since both of them essentially represent different information. To tackle this issue, we first propose a novel Segmentation-to-Flow Module (SFM) that converts semantic segmentation maps to optical flows, named the segmentation-based flow (SF), and then propose a Segmentation-based Flow Consistency (SFC) method to impose consistency between SF and optical flow, which can implicitly supervise the training of segmentation model. The extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with considerable performance improvement.
