Honeywords are decoy passwords associated with each user account to timely detect password leakage. The key issue lies in how to generate honeywords that are hard to be differentiated from real passwords. This security mechanism was first introduced by Juels and Rivest at CCS’13, and has been covered by hundreds of media and adopted in dozens of research domains. Existing research deals with honeywords primarily in an ad hoc manner, and it is challenging to develop a secure honeyword-generation method and well evaluate (attack) it. In this work, we tackle this problem in a principled approach. We first propose four theoretic models for characterizing the attacker $\mathcal{A}$’s best distinguishing strategies, with each model based on a different combination of information available to $\mathcal{A}$ (e.g., public datasets, the victim’s personal information and registration order). These theories guide us to design effective experiments with real-world password datasets to evaluate the goodness (flatness) of a given honeyword-generation method.Armed with the four best attacking theories, we develop the corresponding honeyword-generation method for each type of attackers, by using various representative probabilistic password guessing models. Through a series of exploratory investigations, we show the use of these password models is not straightforward, but requires creative and significant efforts. Both empirical experiments and user-study results demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform prior art. Besides, we manage to resolve several previously unexplored challenges that arise in the practical deployment of a honeyword method. We believe this work pushes the honeyword research towards statistical rigor.
