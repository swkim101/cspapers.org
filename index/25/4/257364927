Human body trajectories are a salient cue to identify actions in the video. Such body trajectories are mainly conveyed by hands and face across consecutive frames in sign language. However, current methods in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) usually process frames independently, thus failing to capture cross-frame trajectories to effectively identify a sign. To handle this limitation, we propose correlation network (CorrNet) to explicitly capture and leverage body trajectories across frames to identify signs. In specific, a correlation module is first proposed to dynamically compute correlation maps between the current frame and adjacent frames to identify trajectories of all spatial patches. An identification module is then presented to dynamically emphasize the body trajectories within these correlation maps. As a result, the generated features are able to gain an overview of local temporal movements to identify a sign. Thanks to its special attention on body trajectories, CorrNet achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on four largescale datasets, i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily, and CSL. A comprehensive comparison with previous spatial-temporal reasoning methods verifies the effectiveness of CorrNet. Visualizations demonstrate the effects of CorrNet on emphasizing human body trajectories across adjacent frames.
