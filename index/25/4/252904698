Sequential recommendation aims at predicting the next item that the user may be interested in given the historical interaction sequence. Typical neural models derive a single history embedding to represent the user's interests. Moving one step forward, recent studies point out that multiple sequence embeddings can help to better capture multi-faceted user interests. However, when ranking candidate items, these methods usually adopt the greedy inference strategy. This approach uses the best matching interest for each candidate item to calculate the ranking score, neglecting the target interest distribution in different contexts, which might lead to incompatibility with the current user intent. In this paper, we propose to enhance multi-interest recommendation by predicting the target user interest with a separate interest predictor and a specifically designed distillation loss. The proposed framework consists of two modules: the 1) multi-interest extractor to generate multiple embeddings regarding different user interests; and the 2) target-interest predictor to predict the interest distribution in the current context, which will be further utilized to dynamically aggregate multi-interest embeddings. To provide explicit supervision signals to the target-interest predictor, we devise a target-interest distillation loss that uses the similarity between the target item and multi-interest embeddings as the soft label of the target interest. This helps the target-interest predictor to accurately predict the user interest at the inference stage and enhances its generalization ability. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.
