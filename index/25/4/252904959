Civil Case Judgment Prediction (CCJP) is a fundamental task in the legal intelligence of the civil law system, which aims to automatically predict the judgment results on each plea of the plaintiff. Existing studies mainly focus on making judgment predictions only on a certain civil cause (e.g., the divorce dispute) by utilizing the fact descriptions and pleas of the plaintiff, which still suffer from the various causes and complicated legal essential elements in the real court. Thus, in this paper, we formalize CCJP as a multi-task learning problem and propose a CCJP method centering on the trial mode of essential elements, CPEE, which explores the practical judicial process and analyzes comprehensive legal essential elements to make judgment predictions. Specifically, we first construct three tasks (i.e., the predictions on the civil causes, law articles, and the final judgment on each plea) necessary for CCJP, that follow the judgment process and exploit the results of intermediate subtasks to make judgment predictions. Then we design a logic-enhanced network to predict the results of three tasks and conduct a comprehensive study of civil cases. Finally, owing to the interlinked and dependent relationships among each task, we adopt the cause prediction result to help predict law articles and incorporate them into final judgment prediction through a gate mechanism. Furthermore, since the existing dataset fails to provide sufficient case information, we construct a real-world CCJP dataset that contains various causes and comprehensive legal elements. Extensive experimental results on the dataset validate the effectiveness of our method.
