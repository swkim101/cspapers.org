Benefiting from the search efficiency, differentiable neural architecture search (NAS) has evolved as the most dominant alternative to automatically design competitive deep neural networks (DNNs). We note that DNNs must be executed under strictly hard performance constraints in real-world scenarios, for example, the runtime latency on autonomous vehicles. However, to obtain the architecture that meets the given performance constraint, previous hardware-aware differentiable NAS methods have to repeat a plethora of search runs to manually tune the hyper-parameters by trial and error, and thus the total design cost increases proportionally. To resolve this, we introduce a lightweight hardware-aware differentiable NAS framework dubbed LightNAS, striving to find the required architecture that satisfies various performance constraints through a one-time search (i.e., you only search once). Extensive experiments are conducted to show the superiority of LightNAS over previous state-of-the-art methods. Related codes will be released at https://github.com/stepbuystep/LightNAS.
