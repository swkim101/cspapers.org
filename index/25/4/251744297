To alleviate costly data communication among processing cores and memory modules, parallel processing-in-memory (PIM) is a promising approach which exploits the huge available internal memory bandwidth. High capacity, wide row size, and maturity of DRAM technology, make DRAM an alluring structure for PIM. However, dense layout, high process variation, and noise vulnerability of DRAMs make it very challenging to apply PIM for DRAMs in practice. This work proposes a PIM structure which eliminates these DRAM limitations, exploiting a precharge-free DRAM (PF-DRAM) structure. The proposed PIM structure, called PIPF-DRAM, performs parallel bitwise operations only by modifying control signal sequences in PF-DRAM, with almost zero structural and circuit modifications. Comparing the state-of-the-art PIM techniques, PIPF-DRAM is 4.2Ã— more robust to process variation, 4.1% faster in average cycle time of operations, and consumes 66.1% less energy.
