This paper presents an efficient yield optimization method for analog circuits via Gaussian process classification and varying-sigma sampling. To quickly determine the better design, yield estimations are executed at varying sigma of process variations. Instead of regression methods requiring accurate yield values, a Gaussian process classification method is applied to model these preference information of designs with binary comparison results, and the preferential Bayesian optimization framework is implemented to guide the search. Additionally, a multi-fidelity surrogate model is adopted to learn the yield correlation at different sigmas. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves up to 12Ã— speed-up without loss of accuracy.
