The increasing adoption of confidential computing is providing individual users with a more seamless interaction with numerous mobile and server devices. TrustZone is a promis-ing security technology for the use of partitioning sensitive private data into a trusted execution environment (TEE). Un-fortunately, third-party developers have limited accessibility to TrustZone. This is because TEE vendors need to validate such security applications to preserve their security rigorously. Moreover, TrustZone-based systems suffer from vulnerabilities affecting Trusted App and trusted OS, possibly causing the entire system to be compromised.
