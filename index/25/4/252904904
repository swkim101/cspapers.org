In this paper, we study the problem of on-demand food delivery in a new setting where two groups of workers -- riders and taxi drivers (drivers for short) -- cooperate with each other for better service. The riders are responsible for the first and the last mile, and the drivers are in charge of the cross-community transportation. We show this problem is generally NP-hard by a reduction from the well-known 3-dimensional matching (3DM). To tackle with this problem, we first reduce it to the maximum independent set problem and use a simple greedy strategy to design an approximate algorithm which has a polynomial time. Considering the exponents in the polynomial are not very small, we then transform the 3DM into two rounds of 2-dimensional matching and propose a fast algorithm to solve it. Though 3DM problem is NP-hard, we find the cooperation between riders and drivers form a special tripartite graph, based on which we construct a flow network and employ the min-cost max-flow algorithm to efficiently compute the exact solution. We conduct extensive experiments to show the efficiency and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.
