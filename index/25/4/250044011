Traditional marker-based motion capture requires excessive and specialized equipment, hindering accessibility and wider adoption. In this work, we demonstrate such a system but rely on a very sparse set of low-cost consumer-grade sensors. Our system exploits a data-driven backend to infer the captured subject's joint positions from noisy marker estimates in real-time. In addition to reduced costs and portability, its inherent denoising nature allows for quicker captures by alleviating the need for precise marker placement and post-processing, making it suitable for interactive virtual reality applications.
