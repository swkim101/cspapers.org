A climate network represents the global climate system as a network where nodes are geographical locations each represented by time-series and edges indicate the interactions of time-series. Network science has been applied to climate data to study the dynamics of a climate network. To enable network dynamics analysis on historical and real-time climate data, the core task is the efficient computation and update of correlation matrices and climate networks. We demonstrate tsupy, a Python library, which extends Jupyter Notebook as instrumentation for performing climate network construction and analysis at interactive speed. This demonstration focuses on how tsupy enables dynamic network analysis on climate data. We also show how tsupy can be applied to neuro-imaging to understand the functional connectivity between brain regions.
