This paper presents a unified controller for dual-arm robot dynamic multi-object nonprehensile transportation. The controller is composed of time-optimal path parameteri-zation (TOPP) and model predictive control (MPC) and aimed at efficiently and dynamically transporting objects using the dual-arm robot under physical constraints while avoiding the slippage of the objects. A force tracking controller without using the force sensor is also proposed to achieve accurate contact force control between the arms and objects. Experiments on the real robot show the effectiveness of the proposed TOPP-MPC-based controller.
