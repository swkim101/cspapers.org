The rapid growth of information and communication technologies in recent years, and the different forms of digital connectivity, have profoundly affected how news is generated and consumed. Digital traces and computational methods offer new opportunities to model and track the provenance of news. This project is the first study to characterize and predict how prominent news outlets make edits to news frames and their implications for geopolitical relationships and attitudes. We evaluate the feasibility of training few-shot learners on the editing patterns of articles discussing different countries, for understanding their wider implications in preserving or damaging geopolitical relationships.
