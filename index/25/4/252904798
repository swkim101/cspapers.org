Traditional machine learning methods used in marketing and digital commerce applications, including propensity scoring and many recommendation algorithms, are usually focused on improving short-term outcomes such as click-through rates. In many environments, however, long-term customer engagement can be more important than immediate outcomes. In this paper, we describe several real-world case studies on building personalization engines that address this problem using reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We also discuss the design patterns used to create such solutions.
