Using big data, distributed computing systems such as Apache Hadoop requires processing massive amount of data to support business and research applications. Thus, it is critical to ensure the cyber security of such systems. To better defend from advanced cyber attacks that pose threats to even well-protected enterprises, system-auditing based techniques have been adopted for monitoring system activities and assisting attack investigation. In this demo, we are building a system that collects system auditing logs from a big data system and performs data analysis to understand how system auditing can be used more effectively to assist attack investigation on big systems. We also built a demo application that detects unexpected file deletion and presents root causes for the deletion.
