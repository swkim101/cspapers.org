The popularity of Android OS has made it an appealing target for malware developers. To evade detection, including by ML-based techniques, attackers invest in creating malware that closely resemble legitimate apps, challenging the state of the art with difficult-to-detect samples. In this paper, we propose Guided Retraining, a supervised representation learning-based method for boosting the performance of malware detectors. To that end, we first split the experimental dataset into subsets of “easy” and “difficult” samples, where difficulty is associated to the prediction probabilities yielded by a malware detector. For the subset of “easy” samples, the base malware detector is used to make the final predictions since the error rate on that subset is low by construction. Our work targets the second subset containing “difficult” samples, for which the probabilities are such that the classifier is not confident on the predictions, which have high error rates. We apply our Guided Retraining method on these difficult samples to improve their classification. Guided Retraining leverages the correct predictions and the errors made by the base malware detector to guide the retraining process. Guided Retraining learns new embeddings of the difficult samples using Supervised Contrastive Learning and trains an auxiliary classifier for the final predictions. We validate our method on four state-of-the-art Android malware detection approaches using over 265k malware and benign apps. Experimental results show that Guided Retraining can boost state-of-the-art detectors by eliminating up to 45.19% of the prediction errors that they make on difficult samples. We note furthermore that our method is generic and designed to enhance the performance of binary classifiers for other tasks beyond Android malware detection.
