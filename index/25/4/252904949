Learning a causal structure from observational data is crucial for data scientists. Recent advances in causal structure learning (CSL) have focused on local-to-global learning, since the local-to-global CSL can be scaled to high-dimensional data. The local-to-global CSL algorithms first learn the local skeletons, then construct the global skeleton, and finally orient edges. In practice, the performance of local-to-global CSL mainly depends on the accuracy of the global skeleton. However, in many real-world settings, owing to inevitable data quality issues (e.g. noise and small sample), existing local-to-global CSL methods often yield many asymmetric edges (e.g., given anasymmetric edge containing variables A and B, the learned skeleton of A contains B, but the learned skeleton of B does not contain A), which make it difficult to construct a high quality global skeleton. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a Bootstrap sampling based Causal Structure Learning (BCSL) algorithm. The novel contribution of BCSL is that it proposes an integrated global skeleton learning strategy that can construct more accurate global skeletons. Specifically, this strategy first utilizes the Bootstrap method to generate multiple sub-datasets, then learns the local skeleton of variables on each asymmetric edge on those sub-datasets, and finally designs a novel scoring function to estimate the learning results on all sub-datasets for correcting the asymmetric edge. Extensive experiments on both benchmark and real datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
