Neuromorphic processor is popular due to its high energy efficiency for spatio-temporal applications. However, when running the spiking neural network (SNN) topologies with the ever-growing scale, existing neuromorphic architectures face challenges due to their restrictions on neuron fan-in and fan-out. This paper proposes Unicorn, a multicore neuromorphic processor with a spike train sliding multicasting mechanism (STSM) and neuron merging mechanism (NMM) to support unconstrained fan-out and flexible fan-in of neurons. Unicorn supports 36K neurons and 45M synapses and thus supports a variety of neuromorphic applications. The peak performance and energy efficiency of Unicorn reach 36TSOPS and 424GSOPS/W respectively. Experimental results show that Unicorn can achieve 2×-5.5× energy reduction over the state-of-the-art neuromorphic processor when running an SNN with a relatively large fan-out and fan-in.
