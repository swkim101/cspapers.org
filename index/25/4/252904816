In this paper, we focus on the problem of evolution management of multi-model data. With the changing user requirements, the schema and the data need to be adapted to preserve the expected functionality of a multi-model application. We introduce a tool MM-evocat based on utilising the category theory. We show that the core of the tool, i.e., the categorical representation of multi-model data, enables us to grasp all the specifics of the individual models and their possible combinations. Its simple but powerful formal basis enables unique and robust support for evolution management.
