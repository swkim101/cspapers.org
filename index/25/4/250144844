Emergence of massive dynamic objects will diversify spatial structures when robots navigate in urban environments. Therefore, the online removal of dynamic objects is critical. In this paper, we introduce a novel online removal framework for highly dynamic urban environments. The framework consists of the scan-to-map front-end and the map-to-map back-end modules. Both the front- and back-ends deeply integrate the visibility-based approach and map-based approach. The experiments validate the framework in highly dynamic simulation scenarios and real-world dataset.
