Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has attracted increasing attention in recent years as a solution to the data sparsity issue. The fundamental paradigm of prior efforts is to train a mapping function based on the overlapping users/items and then apply it to the knowledge transfer. However, due to the commercial privacy policy and the sensitivity of user data, it is unrealistic to explicitly share the user mapping relations and behavior data. Therefore, in this paper, we consider a more practical cross-domain scenario, where there is no explicit overlap between the source and target domains in terms of users/items. Since the user sets of both domains are drawn from the entire population, there may be commonalities between their user characteristics, resulting in comparable user preference distributions. Thus, without the mapping relations at user level, it is feasible to model this distribution-level relation to transfer knowledge between domains. To this end, we propose a novel framework that improves the effect of representation learning on the target domain by aligning the representation distributions between the source and target domains. In addition, GWCDR can be easily integrated with existing single-domain collaborative filtering methods to achieve cross-domain recommendation. Extensive experiments on two pairs of public bidirectional datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in enhancing the recommendation performance.
