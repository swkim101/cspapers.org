In this paper, we discuss the role of gripper compliance in successful grasping and manipulation of thin, flexible materials. We show, both conceptually and empirically, that each axis of compliance in a planar gripper provides unique benefits in this domain. Vertical compliance allows robust grasping of thin materials in the presence of large uncertainty in positioning. Lateral compliance increases opportunity to respond to unexpected snags by increasing the time window over which tensile forces are applied. Rotational compliance avoids damage to objects by decreasing the maximum tensile forces applied during snags. We explore these three benefits through empirical tests comparing a rigid gripper to a soft gripper, evaluating the level of vertical uncertainty each can handle for prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation, as well as the forces and displacements incurred during snags. The results show how a soft gripper's three-axis compliance provides a passive ability to prevent damage to delicate materials.
