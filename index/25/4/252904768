Wearable-based human activity recognition (HAR) is commonly employed in real-world scenarios such as health monitoring, auxiliary diagnosis, etc. As implementing activity recognition is a daunting challenge in an open dynamic environment, incremental learning has become a common method to adapt to variable behavior patterns of users and create dynamic modeling in activity recognition. However, catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge with incremental learning. This is contrary to our expectations of identifying new activity classes while remembering existing ones. To address this problem, we propose a knowledge importance-based class incremental learning method called KiCi and construct an incremental learning model based on the framework of self-iterative knowledge distillation for dynamic activity recognition. To eliminate the prediction bias of the teacher model on the old knowledge, we utilize the trained weights of previous incremental steps generated by the teacher model as the prior knowledge to obtain knowledge importance. Then use it to make the student model have a reasonable trade-off between old and new knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting by avoiding negative transfer. We conduct extensive experiments on four public HAR datasets and our method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.
