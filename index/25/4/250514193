Trajectory scaling has long been used to address velocity and acceleration constraints in robotic motion planning. In later years, reactive motion planning based on dynamical systems has become popular. The traditional scaling techniques are not always suitable to adopt directly when online modifications of the trajectories are made leading to feasibility problems. In this paper, we propose an approach which scales trajectories modelled as dynamical systems for improved feasibility. This is achieved by proactively scaling the trajectory as the acceleration limits are approached. Performance is illustrated by means of simulations and experiments on a UR10 robot.
