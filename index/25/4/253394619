We spend one-third of our lives sleeping, and sleep quality plays an important role in our overall health. Sleep posture monitoring can help medical professionals prevent negative health outcomes associated with certain sleep postures. In this work, we propose using millimeter-wave wireless signals to classify the sleep posture using a supervised deep learning model and preliminarily evaluate the performance for 7 volunteers and 5 broad classes of postures.
