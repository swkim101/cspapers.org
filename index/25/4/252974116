In this work we present the design of a swimming robot that is inspired by the body shape modulation of small microorganisms. Amoebas are small single celled organisms that locomote through deformation and shape change of their body. To achieve similar shape modulation for swimming propulsion in a robot we developed a novel flexible appendage using tape springs. A tape spring is an elongated strip of metal with a curved cross-section that can act as a stiff structure when loaded against the curvature, while it can easily buckle when loaded with the curvature. We develop a tape spring appendage that is capable of freely deforming its perimeter through two actuation inputs. In the first portion of this paper we develop the kinematics of the appendage mechanisms and compare with experiment. Next we present the design of a surface locomoting robot that uses two appendages for propulsion. From the appendage kinematics we derive the local connection vector field for locomotion kinematics and study the optimal gait for forward swimming. Lastly, we demonstrate robot swimming performance in open water conditions. The novel appendage design in this robot is advantageous because it enables omnidirectional movement, the appendages will not tangle in debris, and they are robust to collisions and contact with structures.
