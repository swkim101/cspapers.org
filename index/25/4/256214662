The article considers the possibility of using a new method for producing a ceramic-metal composite material (cermet) Ti3 SiC2-Sn (Pb), which is based on an energy-efficient process of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) of a porous Ti3 SiC2 skeleton with its subsequent spontaneous infiltration with a tin-lead melt Sn10wt.%Pb. The effect of the delay time after SHS and before contact with the melt on spontaneous infiltration, cermet density, its microstructure, and phase composition was investigated. The delay time for complete infiltration with low residual porosity without a significant decrease in the content of the Ti3 SiC2 was determined. It is shown that the compressive strength of the synthesized cermet is 117 MPa compared to 47 MPa for pure alloy Sn10wt.%Pb.
