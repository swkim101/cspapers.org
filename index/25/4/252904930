In recent years, Knowledge Graphs and Ontology-based Data Management have proven to be particularly effective in the efficient management and consolidation of heterogeneous data sources. In this context, semantic modeling has proven to be a useful approach for creating semantic data annotations. However, automatically generated semantic models usually need to be revised by a domain expert, who is often not familiar with semantic technologies. For addressing this issue, we propose the PLASMA semantic modeling tool, which aims at enabling domain experts to build semantic models from scratch or refine models created by automatic algorithms. We demonstrate the use of the tool and its user interface in two different semantic data management use cases for integrating smart city data in a public funded project, called City Dataspace, and for creating semantic models in an industrial use case at Siemens AG.
