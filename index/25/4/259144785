Molecular property prediction is an important problem in drug discovery and materials science. As geometric structures have been demonstrated necessary for molecular property prediction,3D information has been combined with various graph learning methods to boost prediction performance. However, obtaining the geometric structure of molecules is not feasible in many real-world applications due to the high computational cost. In this work, we propose a novel 3D pre-training framework (dubbed 3D PGT), which pre-trains a model on 3D molecular graphs, and then fine-tunes it on molecular graphs without 3D structures. Based on fact that bond length, bond angle, and dihedral angle are three basic geometric descriptors corresponding to a complete molecular 3D conformer, we first develop a multi-task generative pre-train framework based on these three attributes. Next, to automatically fuse these three generative tasks, we design a surrogate metric using the total energy to search for weight distribution of the three pretext tasks since total energy corresponding to the quality of 3D conformer. Extensive experiments on 2D molecular graphs are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and generalization ability of the proposed 3D PGT compared to various pre-training baselines.
