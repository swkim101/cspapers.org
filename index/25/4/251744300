Approximate logic synthesis aims at trading off a circuit's quality to improve a target metric. Corresponding methods explore a search space by approximating circuit components and verifying the resulting quality of the overall circuit, which is costly. We propose a methodology that determines reasonable values for the component's local error bounds prior to search space exploration. Utilizing formal verification on a novel approximation miter guarantees the circuit's quality for such local error bounds, independent of employed approximation methods, resulting in reduced runtimes due to omitted verifications. Experiments show speed-ups of up to 3.7x for approximate logic synthesis using our method.
