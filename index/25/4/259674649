Given a million-scale dataset of who-calls-whom data containing imperfect labels, how can we detect existing and new fraud patterns? We propose TgrApp, which extracts carefully designed features and provides visualizations to assist analysts in spotting fraudsters and suspicious behavior. Our TgrApp method has the following properties: (a) Scalable, as it is linear on the input size; and (b) Effective, as it allows natural interaction with human analysts, and is applicable in both supervised and unsupervised settings.
