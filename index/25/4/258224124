Plastic straws are well-known tools to assist human beings in drinking fluid, but most of them have micro-defects including black spot defects, head problems, pressure tube defects, and sealing wrinkles. The manual detection of these defects has drawbacks such as low efficiency, a high false detection rate, and excessive labor. This paper proposed machine vision-based detection with self-adaption and high-accuracy characteristics. A serial synthesis of algorithms including homomorphic filtering, Nobuyuki Otsu, and morphological opening operations is proposed to obtain plastic straws with binary images with good performance, and it was further found that the convolutional neural network can be designed to realize the real-time recognition of black spot defects, where the corner detection algorithm demonstrates the linear fitting of the edge point of the straw with the effective detection of sealing wrinkle defects. We also demonstrated that the multi-threshold classification algorithm is used to detect defects effectively for head problems and pressure tube defects. The detection system based on machine vision successfully overcomes shortcomings of manual inspection, which has high inspection efficiency and adaptively detects multiple defects with 96.85% accuracy. This research can effectively help straw companies achieve high-quality automated production and promotes the application of machine vision in plastic straw defects with the aid of machine learning.
