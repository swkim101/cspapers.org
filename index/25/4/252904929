With the development of the Internet, a large amount of transaction data (e.g., shopping records, web browsing history), which represents user data, has been generated. By collecting user transaction data and learning specific patterns and association rules from it, service providers can provide better services. However, because of the increasing privacy awareness and the formulation of laws on data protection, collecting data directly from users will raise privacy concerns. The concept of local differential privacy (LDP), which provides strict data privacy protection on the user side and allows effective statistical analysis on the server side, is able to protect user privacy and perform statistics on sensitive issues at the same time. This paper adopts padding-and-sampling-based frequent oracle (PSFO), combined with an interactive query-response method satisfying local differential privacy, to identify frequent itemsets in an efficient and accurate way. Therefore, this paper proposes FIML, an improved algorithm for finding frequent itemsets in the LDP setting of transaction data. The data collector generates frequent candidate sets based on the results of the previous stage and uses them for querying, and users randomize their responses in a reduced domain to achieve local differential privacy. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show that the FIML algorithm can find frequent itemsets more efficiently with the same privacy protection and computational cost.
