Localisation with Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar has gained increasing interest due to its inherent resistance to challenging environments. However, complex artefacts of the radar measurement process require appropriate uncertainty estimation - to ensure the safe and reliable application of this promising sensor modality. In this work, we propose a multi-session map management system which constructs the “best” maps for further localisation based on learned variance properties in an embedding space. Using the same variance properties, we also propose a new way to introspectively reject localisation queries that are likely to be incorrect. For this, we apply robust noise-aware metric learning, which both leverages the short-timescale variability of radar data along a driven path (for data augmentation) and predicts the downstream uncertainty in metric-space-based place recognition. We prove the effectiveness of our method over extensive cross-validated tests of the Oxford Radar RobotCar and MulRan dataset. In this, we outperform the current state-of-the-art in radar place recognition and other uncertainty-aware methods when using only single nearest-neighbour queries. We also show consistent performance increases when rejecting queries based on uncertainty over a difficult test environment, which we did not observe for a competing uncertainty-aware place recognition system.
