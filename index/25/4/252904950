Nested Name Entity Recognition is to identify the entities with nested relationships from sentences, which has various applications ranging from relation extraction to semantic understanding. However, existing methods have two drawbacks, i.e., 1) error propagation when identifying entities at different nesting levels and 2) unable to uncover and utilize the complex correlations between the inner and outer entities. To address these two defects, we propose a bidirectional hierarchical(BidH) model for nested name entity recognition. BidH consists of a forward module and a backward module, where the former first extracts the inner entities and then extracts the outer ones, while the latter extracts the entities in the opposite direction. Furthermore, we design an entity masked self attention mechanism to combine the two modules by fusing their predictions and hidden states layer by layer. BidH can effectively deal with error propagation and exploit the correlations between entities at different nesting levels to improve the recognition accuracy. Experiments on the GENIA dataset show that BidH outperforms the state-of-the-art nested named entity recognition models in terms of F1 score.
