The task of POI attribute acquisition, which aims at completing missing attributes (e.g., POI name, address, status, phone, and open/close time) for a point of interest (POI) or updating existing attribute values of a POI, plays an essential role in enabling users to entertain location-based services using commercial map applications, such as Baidu Maps. Existing solutions have adopted street views or web documents to acquire POI attributes, which have a major limitation in applying for large-scale production due to the labor-intensive and time-consuming nature of collecting data, error accumulation in processing textual/visual data in unstructured or free format, and necessitating post-processing steps with manual efforts. In this paper, we present our efforts and findings from a 3-year longitudinal study on designing and implementing DuIVRS, which is an alternative, fully automatic, and production-proven solution for large-scale POI attribute acquisition via completely machine-directed dialogues. Specifically, DuIVRS is designed to proactively acquire POI attributes via a telephonic interactive voice response system, whose tasks are to generate machine-initiative directed dialogues, make scripted telephone calls to businesses, and interact with people who answered the phone to achieve predefined goals through multi-turn dialogues. DuIVRS has already been deployed in production at Baidu Maps since December 2018, which greatly improves productivity and reduces production cost of POI attribute acquisition. As of December 31, 2021, DuIVRS has made 140 million calls and 42 million POI attribute updates within a 3-year period, which represents an approximately 3-year workload for a high-performance team of 1,000 call center workers. This demonstrates that DuIVRS is an industrial-grade and robust solution for cost-effective, large-scale acquisition of POI attributes.
