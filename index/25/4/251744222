Coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA) is an emerging hardware architecture, with reconfigurable Processing Elements (PEs) for executing operations efficiently and flexibly. One major challenge for current CGRA compilers is the scalability issue for large loop applications, where valid loop mapping results cannot be obtained in an acceptable time. This paper proposes an enhanced loop mapping method based on Graph Neural Network (GNN), which effectively addresses the scalability issue and generates valid loop mapping results for large applications. Experimental results show that the proposed method enhances the compilation time by 10.8x on average over existing methods, with even better loop mapping solutions.
