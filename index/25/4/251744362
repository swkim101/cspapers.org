Quantum circuit verification is essential, ensuring that quantum program compilation yields a sequence of primitive unitary operators executable correctly and reliably on a quantum processor. Most prior quantum circuit equivalence checking methods rely on edge-weighted decision diagrams and suffer from scalability and verification accuracy issues. This work overcomes these issues by extending a recent BDD-based algebraic representation of state vectors to support unitary operator manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the new method in scalability and exactness in contrast to the inexactness of prior approaches. Also, our method is much more robust in verifying dissimilar circuits than previous work.
