Post-processing is crucial to modern recommendation systems to achieve various purposes, e.g., improving diversity, and giving reasonable itineraries which consist of combinations of items, but is merely studied in the literature. We decouple the recommendation system into two modules including a reward estimation module and a post-processing module. Our real-time post-processing module built on Ray abstracts the common post-processing problems in the itinerary recommendation as combinatorial optimization problems. Under the goal of maximizing the click-through rate, the more reasonable recommendation results are obtained by imposing various constraints on the candidate items. However, the optimization problems are typically mixed integer programming problems with quadratic terms in practice, which are NP-hard. In real-time scenarios, there are extremely high requirements for the speed of the solving process. We speed up the problem solving by linearizing and relaxing the original problem and use Ray serving as the underlying service to provide stable and efficient technical support. At last, We provide services to users by deploying the post-processing module in the itinerary recommendation scenario at Alipay's built-in applet named ''What's nearby''. The online A/B experiment shows that the user exposure click rate can be significantly improved.
