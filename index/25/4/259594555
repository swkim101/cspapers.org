Sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) is an attractive research area where freehand sketches are used as queries to retrieve relevant images. Existing solutions have advanced the task to the challenging zero-shot setting (ZS-SBIR), where the trained models are tested on new classes without seen data. However, they are prone to overfitting under a realistic scenario when the test data includes both seen and unseen classes. In this paper, we study generalized ZS-SBIR (GZS-SBIR) and propose a novel semi-transductive learning paradigm. Transductive learning is performed on the image modality to explore the potential data distribution within unseen classes, and zero-shot learning is performed on the sketch modality sharing the learned knowledge through a semi-heterogeneous architecture. A hybrid metric learning strategy is proposed to establish semantics-aware ranking property and calibrate the joint embedding space. Extensive experiments are conducted on two large-scale benchmarks and four evaluation metrics. The results show that our method is superior over the state-of-the-art competitors in the challenging GZS-SBIR task.
