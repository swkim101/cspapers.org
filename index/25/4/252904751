Storage engines for analytic databases are being developed to be setup with different devices for both cost price and performance considerations. Persistent Memory(PMem), as a novel storage device, also provides a new promising option for the hybrid storage. In this demonstration, we introduce Hockey, an efficient columnar storage engine designed for hybrid PMem-SSD storage. We first go through the design of the system and introduce how the data and meta data are structured and accessed on the PMem. The system's data placement strategy on hybrid storage is then presented. To highlight Hockey's design concerns for the hybrid storage as well as its superior performance, we develop a visual interface to demonstrate the system through three scenarios.
