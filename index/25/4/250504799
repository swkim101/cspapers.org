Disparity and optical flow estimation are respectively 1D and 2D dense correspondence matching (DCM) tasks in nature. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is crucial for their success in new and unseen scenarios, enabling networks to draw inferences across different domains without manually-labeled ground truth. In this paper, we propose a general UDA framework (UnDAF) for disparity or optical flow estimation. Unlike existing approaches based on adversarial learning that suffers from pixel distortion and dense correspondence mismatch after domain alignment, our UnDAF adopts a straightforward but effective coarse-to-fine strategy, where a co-teaching strategy (two networks evolve by complementing each other) refines DCM estimations after Fourier transform initializes domain alignment. The simplicity of our approach makes it extremely easy to guide adaptation across different domains, or more practically, from synthetic to real-world domains. Extensive experiments carried out on the KITTI and MPI Sintel benchmarks demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our UnDAF, advancing all other state-of-the-art UDA approaches for disparity or optical flow estimation.
