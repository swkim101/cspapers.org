This paper proposes AlphaRoute, an AlphaGo inspired algorithm for coordinating large-scale routes, built upon graph attention reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We first partition the road network into regions and model large-scale coordinated route planning as a Markov game, where each partitioned region is treated as a player instead of each driver. Then, AlphaRoute applies a bilevel optimization framework, consisting of several region planners and a global planner, where the region planner coordinates the route choices for vehicles located in the region and generates several strategies, and the global planner evaluates the combination of strategies. 
 AlphaRoute is built on graph attention network for evaluating each state and MCTS algorithm for dynamically visiting and simulating the future state for narrowing down the search space. AlphaRoute is capable of 1) bridging user fairness and system efficiency, 2) achieving higher search efficiency by alleviating the curse of dimensionality problems, and 3) making an effective and informed route planning by simulating over the future to capture traffic dynamics. 
 Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two real-world road networks as compared with several baselines to evaluate the performance, and results show that AlphaRoute achieves the lowest travel time, and is efficient and effective for coordinating large-scale routes and alleviating the traffic congestion problem. The code will be publicly available.
