We present Viewset Diffusion, a diffusion-based generator that outputs 3D objects while only using multi-view 2D data for supervision. We note that there exists a one-to-one mapping between viewsets, i.e., collections of several 2D views of an object, and 3D models. Hence, we train a diffusion model to generate viewsets, but design the neural network generator to reconstruct internally corresponding 3D models, thus generating those too. We fit a diffusion model to a large number of viewsets for a given category of objects. The resulting generator can be conditioned on zero, one or more input views. Conditioned on a single view, it performs 3D reconstruction accounting for the ambiguity of the task and allowing to sample multiple solutions compatible with the input. The model performs reconstruction efficiently, in a feed-forward manner, and is trained using only rendering losses using as few as three views per viewset.
