We are in the middle of the most significant change to work practices in generations. For hundreds of years, physical space was the most important technology people used to get things done. The coming Hybrid Work Era, however, will be shaped by digital technology. The recent rapid shift to remote work accelerated the digital transformation already underway at many organizations, and new types of work-related data are now being generated at an unprecedented rate. For example, the average Microsoft Teams user spends 252% more time in the application now than they did in February 2020. During the early stages of the pandemic, we saw the direct impact of digital technology on work in its ability to help people sustain collaboration across time and space. But looking forward, the new digital knowledge captured in the Hybrid Work Era will allow us to reimagine work at an even more fundamental level. AI systems, for example, can now learn from the conversations people have to support knowledge re-use, and even learn how successful conversations happen to help drive more productive meetings. Historically, AI systems have been hindered in a work context by a lack of data; the development of foundation models is changing that, creating an opportunity to combine general world knowledge with the knowledge and behaviors currently locked up and siloed as we work. The CIKM community can shape the new future of work, but first must address the challenges surrounding workplace knowledge management that arise as we have more data, more sophisticated AI, and more human engagement. In this talk I will give an overview of what research tells us about emerging work practices, and explore how the CIKM community can build on these findings to help create a new – and better – future of work.
