Static analysis is an important tool for detecting bugs in real-world software. The advent of numerous analysis algorithms with their own tradeoffs has led to the proliferation of configurable static analysis tools, but their complex, undertested configuration spaces are obstacles to their widespread adoption. To improve the reliability of these tools, my research focuses on developing new approaches to automatically test and debug them. First, I describe an empirical study that helps to understand the performance and behavior of configurable taint analysis tools for Android. The findings of this study motivate the development of ECSTATIC, a framework for testing and debugging that goes beyond taint analysis to test any configurable static analysis tool. The next steps for this research involve the automatic creation of real-world benchmarks for static analysis with associated ground truths and analysis features.
