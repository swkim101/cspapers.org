Fairness has gained increasing importance in a variety of AI and machine learning contexts. As one of the most ubiquitous applications of machine learning, search engines mediate much of the information experiences of members of society. Consequently, understanding and mitigating potential algorithmic unfairness in search have become crucial for both users and systems. In this tutorial, we will introduce the fundamentals of fairness in machine learning, for both supervised learning such as classification and ranking, and unsupervised learning such as clustering. We will then present the existing work on fairness in search engines, including the fairness definitions, evaluation metrics, and taxonomies of methodologies. This tutorial will help orient information retrieval researchers to algorithmic fairness, provide an introduction to the growing literature on this topic, and gathering researchers and practitioners interested in this research direction.
