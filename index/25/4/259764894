Quantitative information plays an important part in the financial and data analysis areas. Prior work relied on pattern-matching methods and complex hand-crafted rules to extract quantitative information due to the lack of labeled data. Such methods can be unstable and difficult to scale to the open domain. In this paper, we study quantitative information extraction in the low-resource setting. We propose a search-based approach by searching from the syntactic structures to acquire basic training data. The search process is simple yet effective. Then, a prefix-based text-to-text generation method is employed to extract the quantitative information. The prefix design can fully leverage pre-trained language models for text generation to serve the information extraction purpose. Experimental results show that our approaches achieves high performance with a limited amount of labeled data. The extraction result could further boost the performance of other tasks such as quantitative reasoning.
