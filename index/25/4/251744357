The finite element method (FEM) is a well-known technique for approximately solving partial differential equations and it finds application in various engineering disciplines. The recently introduced wafer-scale engine (WSE) has shown the potential to accelerate FEM by up to 10,000Ã—. However, accelerating FEM to the full potential of a WSE is non-trivial. Thus, in this work, we propose a partitioning algorithm to partition a 3D finite element model into tiles. The tiles can be thought of as a special netlist and are placed onto the 2D array of a WSE by our placement algorithm. Compared to the best-known approach, our partitioning has around 5% higher accuracy, and our placement algorithm can produce around 11% shorter wirelength (L1.5-normalized) on average.
