Blockchain and big data are two technologies with great potential and great influence in the field of information technology. Big data research applied in many fields of society. However, big data has features as large size, temporal events, complex structure, and incompleteness. Therefore, big data exists many challenges that need to be researched such as data security, data integrity, anti-fraud, data quality, data management, data analysis, and data mining. Blockchain technology has the characteristics of distribution, immutability, transparency, and security. Therefore, integrating blockchain technology into big data is a promising solution to overcome these challenges. However, blockchain technology is not really mature yet. Researchers need to identify the problem and have a suitable approach for applying blockchain technology to big data. In this article, we survey and present a complete picture of the integrated base. At the same time, cloud services for big data, application range, and blockchain big data projects also presented. From there, the researchers were able to clearly identify the development challenges and future directions for this exciting topic.
