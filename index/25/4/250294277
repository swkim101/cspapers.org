Landslides refer to occurrences of massive ground movements due to geological (and meteorological) factors, and can have disastrous impact on property, economy, and even lead to loss of life. The advances of remote sensing provide accurate and continuous terrain monitoring, enabling the study and analysis of land deformation which, in turn, can be used for possible landslides forecast. Prior studies either rely on independent observations for displacement prediction or model static land characteristics without considering the subtle interactions between different locations and the dynamic changes of the surface conditions. We present DyLand -- Dynamic Manifold Learning with Normalizing Flows for Land deformation prediction -- a novel framework for learning dynamic structures of terrain surface and improving the performance of land deformation prediction. DyLand models the spatial connections of InSAR measurements and estimates conditional distributions of deformations on the terrain manifold with a novel normalizing flow-based method. Instead of modeling the stable terrains, it incorporates surface permutations and captures the innate dynamics of the land surface while allowing for tractable likelihood estimates on the manifold. Our extensive evaluations on curated InSAR datasets from continuous monitoring of slopes prone to landslides show that DyLand outperforms existing bechmarking models.
