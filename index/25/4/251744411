The fast-growing capacity and complexity are challenging for FPGA global placement. Besides, while many recent studies have focused on the eDensity-based placement as its great efficiency and quality, they suffer from redundant frequency translation. This paper presents a CNN-inspired analytical placement algorithm to effectively handle the redundant frequency translation problem for large-scale FPGAs. Specifically, we compute the density penalty by a fully-connected propagation and gradient to a discrete differential convolution backward. With the FPGA heterogeneity, vectorization plays a vital role in self-adjusting the density penalty factor and the learning rate. In addition, a pseudo net model is used to further optimize the site constraints by establishing connections between blocks and their nearest available regions. Finally, we formulate a refined objective function and a degree-specific gradient preconditioning to achieve a robust, high-quality solution. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves an 8% reduction on HPWL and 15% less global placement runtime on average over leading commercial tools.
