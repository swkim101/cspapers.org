The standard way to store and interact with the large amount of data that are central to the functioning of any modern business is through the use of a relational Knowledge Graph Management System (KGMS). In this paper we show how the relational model can be successfully exploited to model complex analytic scenarios while enjoying the same characteristics of clarity and flexibility as when modeling the data themselves. Using the Rel language, we simulate the daily schedule of an airline company as an agentbased system, and we will show how modeling this system through a set of relationships and logical rules will let us focus directly on the inherent complexity of our model, taking away most of the incidental effort in actually implementing our simulation.
