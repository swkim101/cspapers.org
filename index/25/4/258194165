The dental environment is being polluted with metals from dental materials in many ways, mainly due to aerosol-generating procedures; this could affect the long-term well-being of dentists, dental students, and dental personnel. The current dental pollution incorporates metallic nanoparticles, which are highly reactive and quickly become airborne, especially those particles that become unbound in the bulk composition. In addition, liquid mercury or mercury vapors may be released from dental amalgam, causing concerns in the dental community. In our study, we reviewed the behavior of metallic elements present in dental materials, their routes of exposure, and their potentially toxic effects on the dental team. This review found that skin and lung disorders are the most harmful effects of metallic exposure for dentists, dental students, and dental personnel. Therefore, chronic exposure to low concentrations of metals in the dental environment, especially in nanosized forms, should be further investigated to improve the environmental matrix, material choice, and safety protocols.
