Physical unclonable function (PUF) is a promising lightweight hardware security primitive that exploits process variations during chip fabrication for applications such as key generation and device authentication. Reliability of the PUF information plays a vital role and poses a major challenge for PUF design. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-state analog PUF (DA PUF) which has been successfully fabricated in 55nm process. The 40,960 bits generated by the fabricated DA PUF pass the NIST randomness test with reliability over 99.99% for working environment of -40 ~ 125Â° C (temperature) and 0.96 ~ 1.44V (voltage), outperforming the two state-of-the-art analog PUFs reported in JSSC 2016 and 2021.
