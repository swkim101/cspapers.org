3D convolution neural networks (CNNs) have been the prevailing option for video recognition. To capture the temporal information, 3D convolutions are computed along the sequences, leading to cubically growing and expensive computations. To reduce the computational cost, previous methods resort to manually designed 3D/2D CNN structures with approximations or automatic search, which sacrifice the modeling ability or make training time-consuming. In this work, we propose to automatically design efficient 3D CNN architectures via a novel training-free neural architecture search approach tailored for 3D CNNs considering the model complexity. To measure the expressiveness of 3D CNNs efficiently, we formulate a 3D CNN as an information system and derive an analytic entropy score, based on the Maximum Entropy Principle. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal entropy score (STEntr-Score) with a refinement factor to handle the discrepancy of visual information in spatial and temporal dimensions, through dynamically leveraging the correlation between the feature map size and kernel size depth-wisely. Highly efficient and expressive 3D CNN architectures, \ie entropy-based 3D CNNs (E3D family), can then be efficiently searched by maximizing the STEntr-Score under a given computational budget, via an evolutionary algorithm without training the network parameters. Extensive experiments on Something-Something V1\&V2 and Kinetics400 demonstrate that the E3D family achieves state-of-the-art performance with higher computational efficiency.
