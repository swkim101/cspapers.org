Conditional image repainting (CIR) is an advanced image editing task, which requires the model to generate visual content in user-specified regions conditioned on multiple cross-modality constraints, and composite the visual content with the provided background seamlessly. Existing methods based on two-phase architecture design assume dependency between phases and cause color-image incongruity. To solve these problems, we propose a novel Unified Conditional image Repainting Network (UniCoRN). We break the two-phase assumption in the CIR task by constructing the interaction and dependency relationship between background and other conditions. We further introduce the hierarchical structure into cross-modality similarity model to capture feature patterns at different levels and bridge the gap between visual content and color condition. A new Landscape-CIR dataset is collected and annotated to expand the application scenarios of the CIR task. Experiments show that UniCoRN achieves higher synthetic quality, better condition consistency, and more realistic compositing effect.
