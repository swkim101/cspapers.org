Neural network ensemble is a collaborative learning paradigm that utilizes multiple neural networks to solve a complex learning problem. Constructing predictive models with high generalization performance is an important and yet most challenging goal for robust intelligence systems in the presence of dirty data. Given a target learning task, popular approaches have been dedicated to find the top performing model. However, it is difficult in general to estimate the best model when available data is finite, possibly dirty, and insufficient for the problem. In this keynote, I will give an overview of a diversity-centric ensemble learning framework developed at Georgia Tech, including methodologies and algorithms for measuring, enforcing, and combining multiple neural networks by improving generalization performance of the overall system and maximizing ensemble utility and resilience to dirty data.
