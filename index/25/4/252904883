With the development of Industry 4.0 technology, modern industries such as Bosch's welding monitoring witnessed the rapid widespread of machine learning (ML) based data analytical applications, which in the case of welding monitoring has led to more efficient and accurate welding monitoring quality. However, industrial ML is affected by the low transparency of ML towards non-ML experts needs. The lack of understanding by domain experts of ML methods hampers the application of ML methods in industry and the reuse of developed ML pipelines, as ML methods are often developed in an ad hoc manner for specific problems. To address these challenges, we propose the concept and a system of executable Knowledge Graph (KG), which formally encode ML knowledge and solutions in KGs, which serve as common language between ML experts and non-ML experts, thus facilitate their communication and increase the transparency of ML methods. We evaluated our system extensively with an industrial use case at Bosch, showing promising results.
