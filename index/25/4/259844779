DDLDroid is a static analyzer for detecting data loss issues in Android apps during activity restart or app relaunch. It is bootstrapped by a saving-restoring bipartite graph which correlates variables that need saving to those that need restoring according to their carrier widgets, and is based on the analysis of saving and restoring data flows. It reports data loss issues once missed or broken data flows are identified. DDLDroid detects 302 true data loss issues out of 66 Android apps in 73 minutes, including 180 previously-unknown issues, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.
