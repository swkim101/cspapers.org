In an unpaired setting, lacking sufficient content constraints for image-to-image translation (I2I) tasks, GAN-based approaches are usually prone to model collapse. Current solutions can be divided into two categories, reconstruction-based and Siamese network-based. The former requires that the transformed or transforming image can be perfectly converted back to the original image, which is sometimes too strict and limits the generative performance. The latter involves feeding the original and generated images into a feature extractor and then matching their outputs. This is not efficient enough, and a universal feature extractor is not easily available. In this paper, we propose EnCo, a simple but efficient way to maintain the content by constraining the representational similarity in the latent space of patch-level features from the same stage of the encoder and decoder of the generator. For the similarity function, we use a simple MSE loss instead of contrastive loss, which is currently widely used in I2I tasks. Benefits from the design, EnCo training is extremely efficient, while the features from the encoder produce a more positive effect on the decoding, leading to more satisfying generations. In addition, we rethink the role played by discriminators in sampling patches and propose a discriminative attention-guided (DAG) patch sampling strategy to replace random sampling. DAG is parameter-free and only requires negligible computational overhead, while significantly improving the performance of the model. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of EnCo, and we achieve multiple state-of-the-art compared to previous methods.
