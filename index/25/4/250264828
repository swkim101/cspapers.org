This paper investigates using a sampling-based approach, the RRT*, to reconfigure a 2D set of connected tiles in complex environments, where multiple obstacles might be present. Since the target application is automated building of discrete, cellular structures using mobile robots, there are constraints that determine what tiles can be picked up and where they can be dropped off during reconfiguration. We compare our approach to two algorithms as global and local planners, and show that we are able to find more efficient build sequences using a reasonable amount of samples, in environments with varying degrees of obstacle space.
