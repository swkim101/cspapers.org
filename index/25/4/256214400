The article covers a combined method for prediction carbon monoxide emissions from combustion chambers of gas turbine engines in which the chemical reactor model (CRM) of the combustion chamber is built on the basis of the results of three-dimensional CFD simulation (CFD - Computational Fluid Dynamics). To improve the accuracy of CO emissions prediction in the CRM low-temperature lean streams of the fuel-air mixture are separately modeled. Lean streams are identified and tracked from CFD simulations. The results of prediction of carbon monoxide emissions from the combustion chamber of an industrial gas turbine are presented. A good agreement was obtained between the calculated and experimental dependences of CO emissions on the operating mode of the combustion chamber. The differences between measurements and calculations are about 11.8-23.3 %.
