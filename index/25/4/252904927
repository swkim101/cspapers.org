Abstractive summarization is a classic task in Natural Language Generation (NLG), which aims to produce a concise summary of the original document. Recently, great efforts have been made on sequence-to-sequence neural networks to generate abstractive sum- maries with a high level of fluency. However, prior arts mainly focus on the optimization of token-level likelihood, while the rich semantic information in documents has been largely ignored. In this way, the summarization results could be vulnerable to hallucinations, i.e., the semantic-level inconsistency between a summary and corresponding original document. To deal with this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel fact-aware abstractive summarization model, named Entity-Relation Pointer Generator Network (ERPGN). Specially, we attempt to formalize the facts in original document as a factual knowledge graph, and then generate the high-quality summary via directly modeling consistency between summary and the factual knowledge graph. To that end, we first leverage two pointer net- work structures to capture the fact in original documents. Then, to enhance the traditional token-level likelihood loss, we design two extra semantic-level losses to measure the disagreement between a summary and facts from its original document. Extensive experi- ments on public datasets demonstrate that our ERPGN framework could outperform both classic abstractive summarization models and the state-of-the-art fact-aware baseline methods, with significant improvement in terms of faithfulness.
