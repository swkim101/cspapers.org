Unlike most human-engineered systems, biological systems are emergent from low-level interactions, allowing much broader diversity and superior adaptation to complex environments. Inspired by the process of morphogenesis in nature, a bottom-up design approach for robot morphology is proposed to treat a robot's body as an emergent response to underlying processes rather than a predefined shape. This paper presents Loopy, a “Swarm-of-One” polymorphic robot testbed that can be viewed simultaneously as a robotic swarm and a single robot. Loopy's shape is determined jointly by self-organization and morphological computing using physically linked homogeneous cells. Experimental results show that Loopy can form symmetric shapes consisting of lobes. Using the same set of parameters, even small amounts of initial noise can change the number of lobes formed. However, once in a stable configuration, Loopy has an “inertia” to transfiguring in response to dynamic parameters. By making the connections among self-organization, morphological computing, and robot design, this work lays the foundation for more adaptable robot designs in the future.
