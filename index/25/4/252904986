Trajectory similarity computation as the fundamental problem for various downstream analytic tasks, such as trajectory classification and clustering, has been extensively studied in recent years. However, how to infer an accurate and robust similarity over two trajectories is difficult due to the some trajectory characteristics in practice, e.g. non-uniform sampling rate, nonmalignant fluctuation, and noise points, etc. To circumvent such challenges, we in this paper introduce the adversarial training idea into the trajectory representation learning for the first time to enhance the robustness and accuracy. Specifically, our proposed method AdvTraj2Vec has two novelties: i) it perturbs the weight parameters of embedding layers to learn a robust model to infer an accurate pairwise similarity over each two trajectories; and ii) it employs the GAN momentum to harness the perturbation extent to which an appropriate trajectory representation can be learned for the similarity computation. Extensive experiments using two real-world trajectory datasets Porto and Beijing validate our proposed AdvTraj2Vec on the robustness and accuracy aspects. The multi-facet results show that our AdvTraj2Vec significantly outperforms the stat-of-the-art methods in terms of different distortions, such as trajectory-point addition, deletion, disturbance, and outlier injection.
