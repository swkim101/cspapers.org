A novel ICP-OES method has been developed for the determination of Si concentration, originating from polyorganophosphosilanes, in biological specimens that also contain metal ions. The method is free of hazardous hydrofluoric acid (HF) and involves digestion with HNO3/H2O2 prior to the analysis by ICP-OES. High and reproducible spike recovery was obtained from the controls.
