The paper investigates and discusses possible stand test control methods for the upcoming turbofan core. During testing, the engine core is placed in the simulated environment created on a dedicated test facility. The task of the control is to reach specified parameters of the working fluid that meet the conditions of the tests. It is not trivial to control these parameters due to their complex interactions and nonlinear relationships with possible commands. This imposes specific requirements on the control logic that is part of automation system mathware to provide gas turbine testing. The paper discusses two main approaches to test process control: the conventional selector-based approach and the fuzzy control approach. The conventional approach is complemented by adaptive management capabilities. The advantages of control based on fuzzy logic are discussed and the conclusion is made about the feasibility of further research in this direction given the promising opportunities to improve the quality of engine core testing.
