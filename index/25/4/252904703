Previous hypergraph expansions are solely carried out on either vertex level or hyperedge level, thereby missing the symmetric nature of data co-occurrence, and resulting in information loss. To address the problem, this paper treats vertices and hyperedges equally and proposes a new hypergraph expansion named the line expansion(LE) for hypergraphs learning. The new expansion bijectively induces a homogeneous structure from the hypergraph by modeling vertex-hyperedge pairs. Our proposal essentially reduces the hypergraph to a simple graph, which enables the existing graph learning algorithms to work seamlessly with the higher-order structure. We further prove that our line expansion is a unifying framework over various hypergraph expansions. We evaluate the proposed LE on five hypergraph datasets in terms of the hypergraph node classification task. The results show that our method could achieve at least 2% accuracy improvement over the best baseline consistently.
