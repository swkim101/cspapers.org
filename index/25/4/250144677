We present a modified tuning of the algorithm of Zimmert and Seldin [2020] for adversarial multiarmed bandits with delayed feedback, which in addition to the minimax optimal adversarial regret guarantee shown by Zimmert and Seldin simultaneously achieves a near-optimal regret guarantee in the stochastic setting with fixed delays. Specifically, the adversarial regret guarantee is $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{TK} + \sqrt{dT\log K})$, where $T$ is the time horizon, $K$ is the number of arms, and $d$ is the fixed delay, whereas the stochastic regret guarantee is $\mathcal{O}\left(\sum_{i \neq i^*}(\frac{1}{\Delta_i} \log(T) + \frac{d}{\Delta_{i}\log K}) + d K^{1/3}\log K\right)$, where $\Delta_i$ are the suboptimality gaps. We also present an extension of the algorithm to the case of arbitrary delays, which is based on an oracle knowledge of the maximal delay $d_{max}$ and achieves $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{TK} + \sqrt{D\log K} + d_{max}K^{1/3} \log K)$ regret in the adversarial regime, where $D$ is the total delay, and $\mathcal{O}\left(\sum_{i \neq i^*}(\frac{1}{\Delta_i} \log(T) + \frac{\sigma_{max}}{\Delta_{i}\log K}) + d_{max}K^{1/3}\log K\right)$ regret in the stochastic regime, where $\sigma_{max}$ is the maximal number of outstanding observations. Finally, we present a lower bound that matches regret upper bound achieved by the skipping technique of Zimmert and Seldin [2020] in the adversarial setting.
