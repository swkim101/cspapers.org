Microprocessors are constantly increasing in complexity, but to remain competitive, their design and testing cycles must be kept as short as possible. This trend inevitably leads to design errors that eventually make their way into commercial products. Major microprocessor vendors such as Intel and AMD regularly publish and update errata documents describing these errata after their microprocessors are launched. The abundance of errata suggests the presence of significant gaps in the design testing of modern microprocessors. We argue that while a specific erratum provides information about only a single issue, the aggregated information from the body of existing errata can shed light on existing design testing gaps. Unfortunately, errata documents are not systematically structured. We formalize that each erratum describes, in human language, a set of triggers that, when applied in specific contexts, cause certain observations that pertain to a particular bug. We present RemembERR, the first large-scale database of microprocessor errata collected among all Intel Core and AMD microprocessors since 2008, comprising 2,563 individual errata. Each RemembERR entry is annotated with triggers, contexts, and observations, extracted from the original erratum. To generalize these properties, we classify them on multiple levels of abstraction that describe the underlying causes and effects. We then leverage RemembERR to study gaps in design testing by making the key observation that triggers are conjunctive, while observations are disjunctive: to detect a bug, it is necessary to apply all triggers and sufficient to observe only a single deviation. Based on this insight, one can rely on partial information about triggers across the entire corpus to draw consistent conclusions about the best design testing and validation strategies to cover the existing gaps. As a concrete example, our study shows that we need testing tools that exert power level transitions under MSR-determined configurations while operating custom features.
