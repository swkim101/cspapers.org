Reference placement is promising to handle the increasing complexity in PCB design. We model the netlist into a graph and use a subgraph matching algorithm to find the isomorphism of the placed template in component combination to reuse the placement. The state-of-the-art VF3 algorithm can achieve high matching accuracy while suffering from high computation time in large-scale instances. Thus, we propose the D2BS algorithm to guarantee matching quality and efficiency. We build and filter the candidate set (CS) according to designed features to construct the CS structure. In the CS optimization, a graph diversity tolerance strategy is adopted to achieve inexact matching. Then, hierarchical match is developed to search the template embeddings in the CS structure guided by branch backtracking and matched nodes snatching. Experimental results show that D2BS outperforms VF3 in accuracy and runtime, achieving 100% accuracy on PCB instances.
