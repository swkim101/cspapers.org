Vision-language (VL) Pre-training (VLP) has shown to well generalize VL models over a wide range of VL downstream tasks, especially for cross-modal retrieval. However, it hinges on a huge amount of image-text pairs, which requires tedious and costly curation. On the contrary,weakly-supervised VLP (W-VLP) explores means with object tags generated by a pre-trained object detector (OD) from images. Yet, they still require paired information, i.e. images and object-level annotations, as supervision to train an OD. To further reduce the amount of supervision, we propose Prompts-in-The-Loop (PiTL) that prompts knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to describe images. Concretely, given a category label of an image, e.g.refinery, the knowledge, e.g.a refinery could be seen with large storage tanks, pipework, and ..., extracted by LLMs is used as the language counterpart. The knowledge supplements, e.g. the common relations among entities most likely appearing in a scene. We create IN14K, a new VL dataset of 9M images and 1M descriptions of 14K categories from ImageNet21K with PiTL. Empirically, the VL models pre-trained with PiTL-generated pairs are strongly favored over other W-VLP works on image-to-text (I2T) and text-to-image (T2I) retrieval tasks, with less supervision. The results reveal the effectiveness of PiTL-generated pairs for VLP.
