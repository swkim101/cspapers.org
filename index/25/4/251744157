Recent years have witnessed significant advances brought by microfluidic biochips in automating biochemical processing. Accurate preparation of fluid samples with microfluidic mixers is a fundamental step in various biomedical applications, where concentration prediction and generation are critical. Finite element analysis (FEA) is the most commonly used simulation method for accurate concentration prediction of a given biochip design, such as COMSOL. However, the FEA simulation process is time-consuming with poor scalability for large biochip sizes. This paper proposes a new concentration prediction method based on the graph neural networks (GNN), which efficiently and accurately predicts the generated concentration by random microfluidic mixers of different sizes. Experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art method, the proposed GNN-based simulation method obtains a reduction of 88% in terms of errors of predicted concentration, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed GNN model.
