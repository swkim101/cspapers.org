The development of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) facilitates the enhancement of traffic efficiency in complicated scenarios. Difficulties remain unsolved in developing an effective and efficient coordination strategy for CAVs. In this paper, we formulate the cooperative autonomous driving task of CAVs as an optimal control problem with safety conditions enforced as hard constraints, and propose a computationally-efficient parallel optimization framework to generate strategies for CAVs with the travel efficiency improved and the hard safety constraints satisfied. Specifically, all constraints involved are addressed appropriately with convex approximation, such that the convexity property of the reformulated optimization problem is exhibited. Then, a parallel optimization algorithm is presented to solve the reformulated optimization problem, with an embodied iterative nearest neighbor search strategy to determine the optimal passing sequence. It is noteworthy that the travel efficiency is enhanced and the computation burden is considerably alleviated with the proposed innovation development. We also examine the proposed method in CARLA simulator and perform thorough comparisons to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.
