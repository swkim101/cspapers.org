In social media analysis, gender prediction is one of the most important tasks of user profiling. Web users often post messages in a timeline manner to record their living moments. These messages containing texts and images, constitute long multi-modal data that potentially represents the living style, preference, or opinion regarding users. Therefore, it is feasible to predict the gender of a user by utilizing such living moments. However, the rich modalities (time, length, text, and image) of living moments with difficult challenges have not been fully exploited by the research communities for practical applications. To this end, we propose a novel gender prediction framework based on user-posted living Moments MomNet). The MomNet mainly consists of a moment memory module and a central executive module inspired by the two characteristics of working memory theory. One is that humans can associate related information to facilitate memory. Our moment memory module aggregates similar uni-modal moments of a user to form different chunks and encode the chunks into moment memory representations. The other is that humans coordinate information from different modalities to make judgments. Our central executive module is designed to coordinate comprehensive attentions of moment memory representations from texts, images, and their combinations. Finally, a softmax classifier is used to predict gender. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world public dataset show that our framework achieves 86.63% accuracy and outperforms all state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy.
