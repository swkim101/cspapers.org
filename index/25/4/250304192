In recent years, the automation of machine learning and data science (AutoML) has attracted significant attention. One under-explored dimension of AutoML is being able to automatically utilize domain knowledge (such as semantic concepts and relationships) located in historical code or literature from the problem's domain. In this paper, we demonstrate Semantic Feature Discovery, which enables users to interactively explore features semantically discovered from existing data science code and external knowledge. It does so by detecting semantic concepts for a given dataset, and then using these concepts to determine relevant feature engineering operations from historical code and knowledge.
