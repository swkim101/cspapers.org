Climate change has a severe impact on the overall ecosystem of the whole world, including humankind. This demo paper presents Climate Bot - a machine reading comprehension system for question answering over documents about climate change. The proposed Climate Bot provides an interface for users to ask questions in natural language and get answers from reliable data sources. The purpose of the climate bot is to spread awareness about climate change and help individuals and communities to learn about the impact and challenges of climate change. Additionally, we open-sourced an annotated climate change dataset CCMRC to promote further research on the topic. This paper describes the dataset collection, annotation, system design, and evaluation.
