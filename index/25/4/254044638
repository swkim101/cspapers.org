The performance of a camera network monitoring a set of targets depends crucially on the configuration of the cameras. In this paper, we investigate the reconfiguration strategy for the parameterized camera network model, with which the sensing qualities of the multiple targets can be optimized globally and simultaneously. We first propose to use the number of pixels occupied by a unit-length object in image as a metric of the sensing quality of the object, which is determined by the parameters of the camera, such as intrinsic, extrinsic, and distortional coefficients. Then, we form a single quantity that measures the sensing quality of the targets by the camera network. This quantity further serves as the objective function of our optimization problem to obtain the optimal camera configuration. We verify the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations and experiments, and the results reveal its improved performance on the AprilTag detection tasks.
