A distributed system is one that consists of separate elements located at different points in space, the functions and resources of the system are divided between the elements, and the location in space affects the functioning of the system as a whole. A special case of distributed systems is distributed control systems (DCS). In today's market, there are a large number of distributed control systems created at different times and by different companies. In the work, a method of decentralized coordination of control of distributed cyber-physical systems with continuous objects is developed, a RKFS model with a continuous production object and resource state management is developed, which is characterized by taking into account the mutual influence of controlled elements of a continuous production object and resource costs for production and is presented in in the form of a two-flow graph, an indicator of the level of coordination is proposed, which determines the state of coordination in the interval from chaos to a given deterministic state, which allows to evaluate the effectiveness of the coordination system, the criterion of coordination of the RKFS with continuous production facilities, which is based on the model of a continuous production facility, and distribution of states of object elements in space and time, the method of forecasting the state of distributed cyber-physical systems with continuous objects, which is based on the RKFS model with a continuous production object and resource management of state and space-time spectrum, has been improved states and disturbances.
