In our technology-dependent modern world, it is imperative to monitor the Sun for space weather threats to critical infrastructure. Topological data analysis (TDA) is a new set of mathematical techniques used in data analysis and machine learning. We demonstrate that TDA can robustly detect and classify solar surface and coronal activity. This technique is a promising step toward future application in predictive space weather modeling.
