Graph meta learning aims to learn historical knowledge from training graph neural networks (GNNs) models and adapt it to downstream learning tasks in a target graph, which has drawn increasing attention due to its ability of knowledge transfer and fast adaptation. While existing graph meta learning approaches assume the learning tasks are from the same graph domain but lack the solution for multi-domain adaptation. In this paper, we address the multi-domain generalized graph meta learning problem, which is challenging due to non-Euclidean data, inequivalent feature spaces, and heterogeneous distributions. To this end, we propose a novel solution called MD-Gram for multi-domain graph generalization. It introduces an empirical graph generalization method that uses empirical vectors to form a unified expression of non-Euclidean graph data. Then it proposes a multi-domain graphs transformation approach to transform the learning tasks from multiple source-domain graphs with inequivalent feature spaces into a common domain, where graph meta learning is conducted to learn generalized knowledge. It further adopts a domain-specific GNN enhancement method to learn a customized GNN model to achieve fast adaptation in the unseen target domain. Extensive experiments based on four real-world graph domain datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in multi-domain graph meta learning tasks.
