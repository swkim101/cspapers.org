Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators are increasingly developed to pursue high efficiency in DNN computing. However, the IP protection of the DNNs deployed on such accelerators is an important topic that has been less addressed. Although there are previous works that targeted this problem for CMOS-based designs, there is still no solution for ReRAM-based accelerators which pose new security challenges due to their crossbar structure and non-volatility. ReRAM's non-volatility retains data even after the system is powered off, making the stored DNN model vulnerable to attacks by simply reading out the ReRAM content. Because the crossbar structure can only compute on plaintext data, encrypting the ReRAM content is no longer a feasible solution in this scenario. In this paper, we propose SRA - a secure ReRAM-based DNN accelerator that stores DNN weights on crossbars in an encrypted format while still maintaining ReRAM's in-memory computing capability. The proposed encryption scheme also supports sharing bits among multiple weights, significantly reducing the storage overhead. In addition, SRA uses a novel high-bandwidth SC conversion scheme to protect each layer's intermediate results, which also contain sensitive information of the model. Our experimental results show that SRA can effectively prevent pirating the deployed DNN weights as well as the intermediate results with negligible accuracy loss, and achieves 1.14X performance speedup and 9% energy reduction compared to ISAAC - a non-secure ReRAM-based baseline.
