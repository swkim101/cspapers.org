It is common for a web page to include links which help visitors discover related pages on other sites. When a link ceases to work (e.g., because the page that it is pointing to either no longer exists or has been moved), users could rely on an archived copy of the linked page. However, due to the incompleteness of web archives, a sizeable fraction of dead links have no archived copies. We study this problem in the context of Wikipedia. Broken external references on Wikipedia which lack archived copies are marked as "permanently dead". But, we find this term to be a misnomer, as many previously dysfunctional links work fine today. For links which do not work, it is rarely the case that no archived copies exist. Instead, we find that the current policy for determining which archived copies for an URL are not erroneous is too conservative, and many URLs are archived for the first time only after they no longer work. We discuss the implications of our findings for Wikipedia and the web at large.
