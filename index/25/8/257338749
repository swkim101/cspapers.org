Although plastic is ubiquitous in marine systems, our current knowledge of its transport is limited. Recent studies suggest size-selective removal of small plastic particles (<5 mm) from the ocean surface as a result of the formation of a biofilm (the “plastisphere”) on the microplastic particle (MP) surface. This localized microenvironment can isolate the microcosm from the adjacent aqueous medium, and thus protect component alien species from the surrounding physico-chemical conditions. Apart from resulting in specific conditions for the transfer of alien species through the environment, the plastisphere can impact MP hydrodynamics and cause MPs to move through the water column, initially sinking. The importance of this phenomenon has not been previously considered for these particles. The size-dependent vertical movement of MPs through the water column determines their distribution, which will vary with time of exposure and colonization. Some plastisphere organisms have plastic-degrading activities, which could be harnessed in marine depollution strategies. This article seeks to increase our understanding of the role of biofilms in the biological dynamics and diffusion of plastic microparticles.
