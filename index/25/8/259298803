In recent decades, an increasing number of large graphs with millions of nodes have been collected and constructed. Despite their utility, analyzing such graphs is hindered by high computational costs and visualization difficulties. To tackle these issues, researchers have developed graph subsampling approaches that extract representative nodes to provide a rough sketch of the graph that preserves its global properties. By selecting representative nodes, these graph subsampling methods can help researchers estimate the graph statistics, e.g., the number of communities, of the large graph from the subsample. However, the available subsampling methods, such as degree node sampler and random walk sampler, tend to overlook minority communities, as they prioritize nodes with high degrees. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging community information hidden within the graph for subsampling. Although the community structure is typically unknown, geometric methods can reveal community structure information by defining an analog of Ricci curvature on the graph, known as the Ollivier Ricci curvature. We introduce a new subsampling algorithm called the Ollivier Ricci curvature Gradient-based subsampling (ORG-sub) algorithm based on our asymptotic results regarding the within-community and between-communities edgesâ€™ OR curvature. The ORG-sub algorithm makes two significant contributions: Firstly, it provides a rigorous theoretical guarantee that the probability of taking all communities into the final subgraph converges to one. Secondly, extensive experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm.
