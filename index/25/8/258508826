We present BigKV, a key-value cache specifically designed for caching large objects in an all-flash array (AFA). The design of BigKV is centered around the unique property of a cache: since it contains a copy of the data, exact bookkeeping of what is in the cache is not critical for correctness. By ignoring hash collisions, approximating metadata information, and allowing data loss from failures, BigKV significantly increases the cache hit ratio and keeps more useful objects in the system. Experiments on a real AFA show that our design increases the throughput by 3.1Ã— on average and reduces the average and tail latency by 57% and 81%, respectively.
