The performance of road defect segmentation (a.k.a. pixel-level road defect detection) has been improved alongside with remarkable achievement of deep learning. Those improvements need a large-scale and well-constructed dataset. However, road surface materials or designs vary from country to country, and the patterns of defects are hard to pre-define. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-source domain adaptation method to boost the performance of road defect segmentation on an unlabelled dataset. The proposed method generates multi-source ensembled labels using transferred information from models trained with multiple labelled source domains, which are utilised as supervisory signals for the unlabelled target domain. Furthermore, to reduce the domain gap between each source domain and a target domain, these domains are re-aligned with outlier repositioning to improve the defect segmentation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on Cracktree200, CRACK500, CFD, and Crack360 datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing unsupervised road defect segmentation methods and achieves competitive performance compared with recent supervised methods.
