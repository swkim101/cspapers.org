In recent years, learning-based autonomous systems have emerged as a promising tool for automating many crucial tasks. The key question is how we can build trust in such systems for safety-critical applications. My research aims to focus on the creation and validation of safety frameworks that leverage multiple sources of information. The ultimate goal is to establish a solid foundation for a long-term research program aimed at understanding the role of fidelity in simulators for safety validation and robot learning.
