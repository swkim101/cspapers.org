This study focuses on localization and mapping for UGVs when they are deployed in environments with non-level roads. In these scenarios, the vehicles need to travel through flat but not necessarily level grounds, i.e., ascent or descent, which may cause drifts of the robot pose and distortion of the map. We develop a low-drift LiDAR odometry and mapping approach for the UGV with LiDAR as the only exteroceptive sensor. A factor-graph based pose optimization method is developed with a specifically designed factor named slope factor. This factor includes the slope information that is estimated from a real-time LiDAR data stream. The slope information is also used to enhance the loop-closure detection procedure. Moreover, an incremental pitch estimation mechanism is designed to achieve further pose estimation refinement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed framework in real-world environments. The odometry drift is lower and the map is more precise than experiments with the state-of-the-arts. Notably, on the Kitti dataset, our method also exhibits convincing performance, demonstrating its strength in more general application scenarios.
