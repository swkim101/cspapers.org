This tutorial is proposed based upon the recently released open-source library Dive into Graphs (DIG) along with hands-on code examples. DIG is a turnkey library that considers four frontiers in graph deep learning, including self-supervised learning of GNNs, 3D GNNs, explainability of GNNs, and graph generation. It provides data interfaces, common algorithms, and evaluation metrics for each direction. It has 255,000+ visitors, 11,000+ installations, and 1,100+ stars within a year and is becoming a robust and dominant ecosystem for graph neural network research. In this tutorial, we will review representative methodologies for these four directions and show hands-on code examples to demonstrate how to effortlessly implement benchmarks using DIG. This tutorial targets a broad audience working on or interested in various research themes. To encourage audience participation, we will promote our tutorial in advance on social media, reading groups, and library contribution community. We anticipate this tutorial would attract more researchers to these interesting and promising topics, leading to a more active community, eventually generating both scientific values and real-world impacts.
