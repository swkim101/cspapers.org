We present a secure device pairing approach, called BiTouch, using the human body as a conductor to generate and transmit user-specific pairing keys for advancing touch-to-access policy. BiTouch is designed based on the observation that the human body responds uniquely to electrical signals flowing through it. Built-in microphones on devices are essentially used to capture ambient sound as entropy and convert it into an electrical signal, which is subsequently transmitted by the body for device pairing. We implement BiTouch using off-the-shelf microphones and evaluate it with 31 participants. The results demonstrate that BiTouch ensures the user's legitimacy and key transmission reliability, and achieves a pairing success rate of 97.74% and an equal error rate of 2.28%.
