Leaf wetness detection is one of the key technologies for preventing plant diseases in agriculture. In this poster, we propose mmLeaf, leveraging a commercial off-the-shelf millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar to detect actual leaf wetness in diverse environments and lighting conditions. mmLeaf captures mmWave signals reflected by monitored leaves with a two-dimensional (2D) scanning system. Then, we use a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to reconstruct the signal distribution of different planes of the leaves. A deep learning model takes the fused signal distribution as inputs to classify the leaf wetness. We implement mmLeaf using a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and evaluate its performance with a potted plant indoors. By exploring the use of mmWave signals, mmLeaf delivers an end-to-end detection framework that achieves up to 90% accuracy in classifying leaf wetness under different distances.
