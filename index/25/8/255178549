Model predictive control is a promising method in robot control tasks. How to design an effective model structure and efficient prediction framework for model predictive control is still an open challenge. To reduce the time consumption and avoid compounding-error of the multi-step prediction process in model predictive control, we propose a single-model simultaneous framework, which uses single dynamics model to predict the entire prediction horizon simultaneously by taking all control actions with the current state as inputs. Based on this framework, we further propose an adversarial dynamics model that contains two parts. The generator provides a dynamics model for the prediction process, while the discriminator provides constraints that are hard to describe by manually defined loss. This adversarial dynamics model can accelerate training and improve model accuracy in unstructured environments. Experiments conducted in Gazebo simulator and on a real mobile robot demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the single-model simultaneous framework with an adversarial dynamics model.
