Simulated user retrieval system interactions enable studies with controlled user behavior. To this end, the SimIIR framework offers static, rule-based methods. We present an extended SimIIR 2.0 version with new components for dynamic user type-specific Markov model-based interactions and more realistic query generation. A flexible modularization ensures that the SimIIR 2.0 framework can serve as a platform to implement, combine, and run the growing number of proposed search behavior and query simulation ideas.
