Graph neural networks (GNN) are powerful tools in many web research problems. However, existing GNNs are not fully suitable for many real-world web applications. For example, over-smoothing may affect personalized recommendations and the lack of an explanation for the GNN prediction hind the understanding of many business scenarios. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a new second-order continuous GNN which naturally avoids over-smoothing and enjoys better interpretability. There is some research interest in continuous graph neural networks inspired by the recent success of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, there are some remaining problems w.r.t. the prevailing first-order continuous GNN frameworks. Firstly, augmenting node features is an essential, however heuristic step for the numerical stability of current frameworks; secondly, first-order methods characterize a diffusion process, in which the over-smoothing effect w.r.t. node representations are intrinsic; and thirdly, there are some difficulties to integrate the topology of graphs into the ODEs. Therefore, we propose a framework employing second-order graph neural networks, which usually learn a less stiff transformation than the first-order counterpart. Our method can also be viewed as a coupled first-order model, which is easy to implement. We propose a semi-model-agnostic method based on our model to enhance the prediction explanation using high-order information. We construct an analog between continuous GNNs and some famous partial differential equations and discuss some properties of the first and second-order models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and the results outperform related baselines.
