Comprehensive studies of synthetic optical flow datasets have attempted to reveal what properties lead to accuracy improvement in learning-based optical flow estimation. However, manually identifying and verifying the properties that contribute to accurate optical flow estimation require large-scale trial-and-error experiments with iteratively generating whole synthetic datasets and training on them, i.e ., impractical. To address this challenge, we propose a differentiable optical flow data generation pipeline and a loss function to drive the pipeline, called DFlow. DFlow efficiently synthesizes a dataset effective for a target domain without the need for cumbersome try-and-errors. This favorable property is achieved by proposing an efficient dataset comparison method that uses neural networks to approximately encode each dataset and compares the proxy networks instead of explicitly comparing datasets in a pairwise way. Our experiments show the competitive performance of our DFlow against the prior arts in pre-training. Furthermore, compared to competing datasets, DFlow achieves the best fine-tuning performance on the Sintel public benchmark with RAFT.
