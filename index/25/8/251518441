Knowledge graph reasoning plays a pivotal role in many real-world applications, such as network alignment, computational fact-checking, recommendation, and many more. Among these applications, knowledge graph completion (KGC) and multi-hop question answering over knowledge graph (Multi-hop KGQA) are two representative reasoning tasks. In the vast majority of the existing works, the two tasks are considered separately with different models or algorithms. However, we envision that KGC and Multi-hop KGQA are closely related to each other. Therefore, the two tasks will benefit from each other if they are approached adequately. In this work, we propose a neural model named BiNet to jointly handle KGC and multi-hop KGQA, and formulate it as a multi-task learning problem. Specifically, our proposed model leverages a shared embedding space and an answer scoring module, which allows the two tasks to automatically share latent features and learn the interactions between natural language question decoder and answer scoring module. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed BiNet model addresses both multi-hop KGQA and KGC tasks simultaneously with superior performance. Experiment results show that BiNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of KGQA and KGC benchmark datasets.
