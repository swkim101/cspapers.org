In this paper we present BOEM-SLAM, a backend for visual-inertial SLAM systems capable of creating a globally consistent trajectory and map without retaining the entire history of data. By leveraging the hidden Markov model structure, BOEM-SLAM can summarize historical data into sufficient statistics and then discard it. As a data-efficient algorithm, BOEM-SLAM addresses the growing computational costs and storage requirements of the SLAM backend. To demonstrate the performance of our algorithm we compare BOEM-SLAM to other fundamental approaches on both synthetic data and the EuRoC dataset. For evaluation on the EuRoC dataset, we use the open source okvis frontend and apply the Lie group state space representation and visual outlier removal. Overall, BOEM-SLAM shows a considerably lower computation time with comparable estimation performance. For example, the processing time of BOEM-SLAM is 50 times smaller than the optimization-based method using simulated data and 5 times smaller than the optimization-based method in the EuRoC dataset experiments.
