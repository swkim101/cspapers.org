Simultaneous orthophoto stitching during the flight of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can greatly promote the practicability and instantaneity of diverse applications such as emergency disaster rescue, digital agriculture, and cadastral survey, which is of remarkable interest in aerial photogrammetry. However, the inaccurately estimated camera poses and the intuitive fusion strategy of existing methods lead to misalignment and distortion artifacts in orthophoto mosaics. To address these issues, we propose a Georeferenced Real-time Orthophoto Stitching method (GeoROS), which can achieve efficient and accurate camera pose estimation through exploiting geolocation information in monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and fuse transformed images via orthogonality-preserving criterion. Specifically, in the SLAM process, georeferenced tracking is employed to acquire high-quality initial camera poses with a geolocation based motion model and facilitate non-linear pose optimization. Meanwhile, we design a georeferenced mapping scheme by introducing robust geolocation constraints in joint optimization of camera poses and the position of landmarks. Finally, aerial images warped with localized cameras are fused by considering both the orthogonality of camera orientation relative to the ground plane and the pixel centrality to fulfill global orthorectification. Besides, we construct two datasets with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) information of different scenarios and validate the superiority of our GeoROS method compared with state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency.
