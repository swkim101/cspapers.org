We provide an interior point method based on quasi-Newton iterations, which only requires first-order access to a strongly self-concordant barrier function. To achieve this, we extend the techniques of Dunagan-Harvey [STOC ’07] to maintain a preconditioner, while using only first-order information. We measure the quality of this preconditioner in terms of its relative excentricity to the unknown Hessian matrix, and we generalize these techniques to convex functions with a slowly-changing Hessian. We combine this with an interior point method to show that, given first-order access to an appropriate barrier function for a convex set K, we can solve well-conditioned linear optimization problems over K to ε precision in time O((T+n2)√nνlog(1/ε)), where ν is the self-concordance parameter of the barrier function, and T is the time required to make a gradient query. As a consequence we show that: Linear optimization over n-dimensional convex sets can be solved in time O((Tn+n3)log(1/ε)). This parallels the running time achieved by state of the art algorithms for cutting plane methods, when replacing separation oracles with first-order oracles for an appropriate barrier function. We can solve semidefinite programs involving m≥ n matrices in ℝn× n in time O(mn4+m1.25n3.5log(1/ε)), improving over the state of the art algorithms, in the case where m=Ω(n3.5/ω−1.25). Along the way we develop a host of tools allowing us to control the evolution of our potential functions, using techniques from matrix analysis and Schur convexity.
