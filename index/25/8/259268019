One of the cornerstones in censorship circumvention is fully encrypted protocols, which encrypt every byte of the payload in an attempt to “look like nothing”. In early November 2021, the Great Firewall of China (GFW) deployed a new censorship technique that passively detects—and subsequently blocks— fully encrypted trafﬁc in real time. The GFW’s new censorship capability affects a large set of popular censorship circum-vention protocols, including but not limited to Shadowsocks, VMess, and Obfs4. Although China had long actively probed such protocols, this was the ﬁrst report of purely passive detection, leading the anti-censorship community to ask how detection was possible. In this paper, we measure and characterize the GFW’s new system for censoring fully encrypted trafﬁc. We ﬁnd that, instead of directly deﬁning what fully encrypted trafﬁc is, the censor applies crude but efﬁcient heuristics to exempt trafﬁc that is unlikely to be fully encrypted trafﬁc; it then blocks the remaining non-exempted trafﬁc. These heuristics are based on the ﬁngerprints of common protocols, the fraction of set bits, and the number, fraction, and position of printable ASCII characters. Our Internet scans reveal what trafﬁc and which IP addresses the GFW inspects. We simulate the inferred GFW’s detection algorithm on live trafﬁc at a university network tap to evaluate its comprehensiveness and false positives. We show evidence that the rules we inferred have good coverage
