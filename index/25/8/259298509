Traditional Dictionary Learning (DL) aims to approximate data vectors as sparse linear combinations of basis elements (atoms) and is widely used in machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing. To extend DL to graphs, Vincent-Cuaz et al. 2021 proposed a method, called GDL, which describes the topology of each graph with a pairwise relation matrix (PRM) and compares PRMs via the Gromov–Wasserstein Discrepancy (GWD). However, the lack of robustness often excludes GDL from a variety of real-world applications since GWD is sensitive to the structural noise in graphs. This paper proposes an improved graph dictionary learning algorithm based on a robust Gromov–Wasserstein discrepancy (RGWD) which has theoretically sound properties and an efficient numerical scheme. Based on such a discrepancy, our dictionary learning algorithm can learn atoms from noisy graph data. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves good performance on both simulated and real-world datasets.
