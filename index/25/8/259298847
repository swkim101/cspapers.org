Face detection (FD) has achieved remarkable success over the past few years, yet, these leaps often arrive when consuming enormous computation costs. Moreover, when considering a realistic situation, i.e., building a lightweight face detector under a computation-scarce scenario, such heavy computation cost limits the application of the face detector. To remedy this, several pioneering works design tiny face detectors through off-the-shelf neural architecture search (NAS) technologies, which are usually applied to the classification task. Thus, the searched architectures are sub-optimal for the face detection task since some design criteria between detection and classification task are different. As a representative, the face detection backbone design needs to guarantee the stage-level detection ability while it is not required for the classification backbone. Furthermore, the detection backbone consumes a vast body of inference budgets in the whole detection framework. Considering the intrinsic design requirement and the virtual importance role of the face detection backbone, we thus ask a critical question: How to employ NAS to search FD-friendly backbone architecture? To cope with this question, we propose a distribution-dependent stage-aware ranking score (DDSAR-Score) to explicitly characterize the stage-level expressivity and identify the individual importance of each stage, thus satisfying the aforementioned design criterion of the FD backbone. Based on our proposed DDSAR-Score, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the challenging Wider Face benchmark dataset and achieve dominant performance across a wide range of compute regimes. In particular, compared to the tiniest face detector SCRFD-0.5GF, our method is +2.5 % better in Average Precision (AP) score when using the same amount of FLOPs.
