Monocular depth estimation is fundamental for 3D scene understanding and downstream applications. However, even under the supervised setup, it is still challenging and ill-posed due to the lack of full geometric constraints. Although a scene can consist of millions of pixels, there are fewer high-level patterns. We propose iDisc to learn those patterns with internal discretized representations. The method implicitly partitions the scene into a set of high-level patterns. In particular, our new module, Internal Discretization (ID), implements a continuous-discrete-continuous bottleneck to learn those concepts without supervision. In contrast to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model does not enforce any explicit constraints or priors on the depth output. The whole network with the ID module can be trained end-to-end, thanks to the bottleneck module based on attention. Our method sets the new state of the art with significant improvements on NYU-Depth v2 and KITTI, outperforming all published methods on the official KITTI benchmark. iDisc can also achieve state-of-the-art results on surface normal estimation. Further, we explore the model generalization capability via zero-shot testing. We observe the compelling need to promote diversification in the outdoor scenario. Hence, we introduce splits of two autonomous driving datasets, DDAD and Argoverse. Code is available at http://vis.xyz/pub/idisc.
