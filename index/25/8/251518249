With the advancement of GPS and remote sensing technologies and the pervasiveness of smartphones and IoT devices, an enormous amount of spatiotemporal data are being collected from various domains. Knowledge discovery from spatiotemporal data is crucial in addressing many grand societal challenges, ranging from flood disaster management to monitoring coastal hazards, and from autonomous driving to disease forecasting. The recent success in deep learning technologies in computer vision and natural language processing provides new opportunities for spatiotemporal data mining, but existing deep learning techniques also face unique spatiotemporal challenges (e.g., autocorrelation, non-stationarity, physics awareness). This workshop provides a premium platform for researchers from both academia and industry to exchange ideas on the opportunities, challenges, and cutting-edge techniques related to deep learning for spatiotemporal data.
