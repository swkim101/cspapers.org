In online information systems, users make decisions based on factors of several specific aspects, such as brand, price, etc. Existing recommendation engines ignore the explicit modeling of these factors, leading to sub-optimal recommendation performance. In this paper, we focus on the real-world scenario where these factors can be explicitly captured (the users are exposed with decision factor-based persuasion texts, i.e., persuasion factors). Although it allows us for explicit modeling of user-decision process, there are critical challenges including the persuasion factor's representation learning and effect estimation, along with the data-sparsity problem. To address them, in this work, we present our POEM (short for Persuasion factOr Effect Modeling) system. We first propose the persuasion-factor graph convolutional layers for encoding and learning representations from the persuasion-aware interaction data. Then we develop a prediction layer that fully considers the user sensitivity to the persuasion factors. Finally, to address the data-sparsity issue, we propose a counterfactual learning-based data augmentation method to enhance the supervision signal. Real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework of modeling the effect of persuasion factors.
