Robots have predominantly been used in automating tasks in structured industrial environments, however, with the advances in technology they are starting to take part in roles in dynamic everyday life scenarios. As a result, the tasks executed by robotic systems will also grow in sophistication. Grasping and dexterous manipulation are critical aspects that allow humans to execute these sophisticated tasks, enabling them to interact with their environment. As such, emulating the human hand can be advantageous for interacting with a world designed for humans. However, directly replicating the anatomical structure of the hand produces designs that are fully actuated, expensive, and which require sophisticated controls and sensing to operate efficiently. In this paper, we present two different versions of the New Dexterity adaptive, humanlike robot hand that is capable of executing robust caging grasps under a wide range of environmental uncertainties (e.g., object pose uncertainties). One of the versions has a classic, fixed thumb base while the second one incorporates an additional degree of freedom at the thumb base, which enables a translational motion for repositioning the thumb and adjusting the aperture. This design choice enhances the inhand manipulation capabilities of the robot hand, improving also the power grasping capabilities for larger objects. The performances of the proposed robot hand designs are experimentally validated and compared through three different tests: i) grasping experiments involving everyday-life objects, ii) force experiments that evaluate their force exertion capabilities, and iii) in-hand manipulation experiments that demonstrate and compare their dexterity.
