360° videos are getting popular providing an immersive streaming experience for the user, nevertheless, demand high bandwidth in mobile networks due to their larger spherical frames. In this preliminary work, we propose to combine frame interpolation and super resolution methods to optimize tile based 360° video delivery by streaming them at low qualities in network and increasing the quality leveraging Multi Access Edge Computing. We propose a mechanism to adaptively decide this quality conversion at the client side which improves average video quality by 30% and bandwidth saving by 43.3% compared to existing tile based streaming.
