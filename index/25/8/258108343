Do patterns of eye-hand coordination observed during real-world object interactions apply to digital, screen-based object interactions? We adapted a real-world object interaction task (physically transferring cups in sequence about a tabletop) into a two-dimensional screen-based task (dragging-and-dropping circles in sequence with a cursor). We collected gaze (with webcam eye-tracking) and cursor position data from 51 fully-remote, crowd-sourced participants who performed the task on their own computer. We applied real-world time-series data segmentation strategies to resolve the self-paced movement sequence into phases of object interaction and rigorously cleaned the webcam eye-tracking data. In this preliminary investigation, we found that: 1) real-world eye-hand coordination patterns persist and adapt in this digital context, and 2) remote, online, cursor-tracking and webcam eye-tracking are useful tools for capturing visuomotor behaviours during this ecologically-valid human-computer interaction task. We discuss how these findings might inform design principles and further investigations into natural behaviours that persist in digital environments.
