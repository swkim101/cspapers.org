Miniaturization of robotic grippers enables precise manipulation of small-size objects. However, most microgrippers are actuated by rigid actuators, and thus retain challenges such as micro-fabrication, complex structure, and lack of compliance. Here, we present a compliant microgripper driven by a soft polymer actuator. The proposed millimeter-scale soft polymer actuator can produce a linear displacement and output force with a fast operation. Then, we designed the gripper linkage to convert the linear displacement of the actuator into a gripping motion. Fabricated compliant microgripper has a size of $\boldsymbol{10\times 10\times 10}\ \mathbf{mm}^{3}$ and a weight of 0.36 g, with a maximum gripping width of 8 mm. Demonstration of the gripper shows the feasibility of gripping various sub-millimeter scale objects regardless of their shape owing to its compliance.
