Play-dough is a brightly-colored, easy-to-make, and familiar material. We have developed and tested custom play-dough materials that can be employed in 3D printers designed for clay. This paper introduces a set of recipes for 3D printable play-dough along with an exploration of these materialsâ€™ print characteristics. We explore the design potential of play-dough as a sustainable fabrication material, highlighting its recyclability, compostability, and repairability. We demonstrate how custom-color prints can be designed and constructed and describe how play-dough can be used as a support material for clay 3D prints. We also present a set of example artifacts made from play-dough and discuss opportunities for future research.
