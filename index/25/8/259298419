Dynamic graphs are ubiquitous across disciplines where observations usually change over time. Regressions on dynamic graphs often contribute to diverse critical tasks, such as climate early-warning and traffic controlling. Existing ho-mophily Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) adopt physical connections or feature similarity as adjacent matrix to perform node-level aggregations. However, on dynamic graphs with diverse node-wise relations, exploiting a pre-defined fixed topology for message passing inevitably leads to the aggregations of target-deviated neighbors. We designate such phenomenon as the topology-task discordance, which naturally challenges the homophily assumption. In this work, we revisit node-wise relationships and explore novel homophily measurements on dynamic graphs with both signs and distances, capturing multiple node-level spatial relations and temporal evolutions. We discover that advancing homophily ag-gregations to signed target-oriented message passing can effectively resolve the discordance and promote aggregation capacity. Therefore, a GReTo is proposed, which performs signed message passing in immediate neighborhood, and exploits both local environments and target awareness to realize high-order message propagation. Empirically, our solution achieves significant improvements against best baselines, notably improving 24.79% on KnowAir and 3.60% on Metr-LA.
