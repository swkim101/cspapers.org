As robots become more and more intelligent, the complexity of the algorithms behind them is increasing. Since these algorithms require high computation power from the onboard robot controller, the weight of the robot and energy consumption increases. A promising solution to tackle this issue is to relocate the expensive computation to the cloud. In this pioneering work, the possibility of relocating a state-of-the-art nonlinear control is investigated. To this end, the Unified Force-Impedance Controller (UFIC) is relocated to a remote location and high frequency feedback loop is established by including the remote controller in the loop. Passivity analysis is used to ensure the stability of the whole system, comprising the robot in interaction with the environment, the communication channel, as well as the remote controller. The instability associated with the communication channel is resolved by Time Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA). The performance of the proposed framework is experimentally evaluated on a robot arm in interaction with the environment. The results illustrate the stability of the system to a time-varying delay of up to 50 Â± 10ms.
