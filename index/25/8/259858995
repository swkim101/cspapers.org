Fast, byte-addressable persistent memory (PM) is becoming a reality in products. However, porting legacy kernel file systems to fully support PM requires substantial effort and encounters the challenge of bridging the gap between block-based access granularity and byte-addressability. Moreover, new PM-specific file systems remain far from production-ready, preventing them from being widely used. In this paper, we propose P 2 C ACHE , a novel in-kernel caching mechanism to explore how legacy kernel file systems can effectively evolve in the face of fast, byte-addressable PM. P 2 C ACHE exploits a read/write-distinguishable memory hierarchy upon a tiered memory system involving both PM and DRAM. P 2 C ACHE leverages PM to serve all write requests for instant data durability and strong crash consistency while using DRAM to serve most read I/Os for high I/O performance. Further, P 2 C ACHE employs a simple yet effective synchronization model between PM and DRAM by leveraging device-level parallelism. Our evaluation shows that P 2 C ACHE can significantly increase the performance of legacy kernel file systems – e.g., by 200x for RocksDB on Ext4 – meanwhile equipping them with instant data durability and strong crash consistency, similar to PM-specialized file systems.
