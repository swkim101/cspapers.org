This paper investigates group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO), with the purpose to learn a model that performs well over m different distributions. First, we formulate GDRO as a stochastic convex-concave saddle-point problem, and demonstrate that stochastic mirror descent (SMD), using m samples in each iteration, achieves an O ( m (log m ) /ϵ 2 ) sample complexity for finding an ϵ -optimal solution, which matches the Ω( m/ϵ 2 ) lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. Then, we make use of techniques from online learning to reduce the number of samples required in each round from m to 1 , keeping the same sample complexity. Specifically, we cast GDRO as a two-players game where one player simply performs SMD and the other executes an online algorithm for non-oblivious multi-armed bandits. Next, we consider a more practical scenario where the number of samples that can be drawn from each distribution is different, and propose a novel formulation of weighted GDRO, which allows us to derive distribution-dependent convergence rates. Denote by n i the sample budget for the i -th distribution, and assume n 1 ≥ n 2 ≥ · · · ≥ n m . In the first approach, we incorporate non-uniform sampling into SMD such that the sample budget is satisfied in expectation, and prove that the excess risk of the i -th distribution decreases at an O ( √ n 1 log m/n i ) rate. In the second approach, we use mini-batches to meet the budget exactly and also reduce the variance in stochastic gradients, and then leverage stochastic mirror-prox algorithm, which can exploit small variances, to
