Convolutional neural network inference on video input is computationally expensive and requires high memory bandwidth. Recently, DeltaCNN [26] managed to reduce the cost by only processing pixels with significant updates over the previous frame. However, DeltaCNN relies on static camera input. Moving cameras add new challenges in how to fuse newly unveiled image regions with already processed regions efficiently to minimize the update rate - without increasing memory overhead and without knowing the camera extrinsics of future frames. In this work, we propose MotionDeltaCNN, a sparse CNN inference framework that supports moving cameras. We introduce spherical buffers and padded convolutions to enable seamless fusion of newly unveiled regions and previously processed regions â€“ without increasing memory footprint. Our evaluation shows that we outperform DeltaCNN by up to 90% for moving camera videos.
