As advanced algorithms enable robots to handle more challenging tasks and operate more autonomously, the on-board computer cannot meet the increased demands regarding computing power and memory storage in an efficient way. Leveraging the massive computing power of the cloud and low-latency connectivity to the edge can compensate for this lack of computing resources. However, this introduces a new challenge related to the deployment of complex robotic software across multiple devices, especially in a large-scale system. This paper presents KubeROS, a unified and fully managed platform for automated deployment of robotic applications developed on top of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2), in a hybrid computing infrastructure with robots, edge and cloud. KubeROS uses Kubernetes from Cloud Native Computing as its underlying software orchestration framework. It aims to help researchers and developers with no prior cloud computing knowledge deploy their ROS2-based robotic applications at any scale. KubeROS eliminates the need for system configuration and network setup. We demonstrate the applicability of KubeROS by deploying a fleet of simulated mobile manipulators in a clas-sical pick-and-place application. The experiments demonstrate the effects of different deployment strategies for vision-based motion planning under different fleet sizes and workloads. In addition, KubeROS improves task performance by using high-performance computing at the edge and in the cloud, and achieves high resource efficiency when using the shared deployment strategy.
