Graph convolutional networks have been successfully applied to the task of event detection. However, existing works rely heavily on a fixed syntactic parse tree structure from an external parser. In addition, the information content extracted for aggregation is determined simply by the (syntactic) edge direction or type but irrespective of what semantics the vertices have, which is somewhat rigid. With this work, we propose a novel graph convolutional method that combines an adaptive graph generation technique and a multi-channel selection strategy. The adaptive graph generation technique enables the gradients to pass through the graph sampling layer by using the ST-Gumbel-Softmax trick. The multi-channel selection strategy allows two adjacent vertices to automatically determine which information channels to get through for information extraction and aggregation. The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on ACE2005 dataset.
