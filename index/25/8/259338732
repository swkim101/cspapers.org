Confined and cluttered aquatic environments present a number of significant challenges with respect to inspection by robotic platforms, including localisation and communications. Some of these can be mitigated by using collaborative heterogeneous multi-robot teams. An important element of such a system is collaborative control. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting an Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS), leader-follower control system for heterogeneous aquatic robots. Experiments were conducted in an uncluttered pond to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. The results show robots can maintain tracking each other with maximum $x$ and $y$ displacements of 0.42 m and 0.41 m, the maximum projection distance in the xy-plane of maintaining formation is 0.45 m, showing the stability and feasibility of deploying such system on underwater platforms.
