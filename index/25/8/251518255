Feature selection plays an impactful role in deep recommender systems, which selects a subset of the most predictive features, so as to boost the recommendation performance and accelerate model optimization. The majority of existing feature selection methods, however, aim to select only a fixed subset of features. This setting cannot fit the dynamic and complex environments of practical recommender systems, where the contribution of a specific feature varies significantly across user-item interactions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive feature selection framework, AdaFS, for deep recommender systems. To be specific, we develop a novel controller network to automatically select the most relevant features from the whole feature space, which fits the dynamic recommendation environment better. Besides, different from classic feature selection approaches, the proposed controller can adaptively score each example of user-item interactions, and identify the most informative features correspondingly for subsequent recommendation tasks. We conduct extensive experiments based on two public benchmark datasets from a real-world recommender system. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaFS, and its excellent transferability to the most popular deep recommendation models.
