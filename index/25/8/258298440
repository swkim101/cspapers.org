In dynamic interaction graphs, user-item interactions usually follow heterogeneous patterns, represented by different structural information, such as user-item co-occurrence, sequential information of user interactions and the transition probabilities of item pairs. However, the existing methods cannot simultaneously leverage all three structural information, resulting in suboptimal performance. To this end, we propose øurs, a triple structural information modeling method for accurate, explainable and interactive recommendation on dynamic interaction graphs. Specifically, øurs consists of 1) a dynamic ideal low-pass graph filter to dynamically mine co-occurrence information in user-item interactions, which is implemented by incremental singular value ecomposition (SVD); 2) a parameter-free attention module to capture sequential information of user interactions effectively and efficiently; and 3) an item transition matrix to store the transition probabilities of item pairs. Then, we fuse the predictions from the triple structural information sources to obtain the final recommendation results. By analyzing the relationship between the SVD-based and the recently emerging graph signal processing (GSP)-based collaborative filtering methods, we find that the essence of SVD is an ideal low-pass graph filter, so that the interest vector space in øurs can be extended to achieve explainable and interactive recommendation, making it possible for users to actively break through the information cocoons. Experiments on six public datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of øurs in accuracy, explainability and interactivity.
