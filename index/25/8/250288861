In recent years, companies in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry have started exploring how artificial intelligence (AI) can reduce time-consuming and repetitive tasks. One use case that can benefit from the adoption of AI is the determination of quantities in floor plans. This information is required for several planning and construction steps. Currently, the task requires companies to invest a significant amount of manual effort. Either digital floor plans are not available for existing buildings, or the formats cannot be processed due to lack of standardization. In this paper, we therefore propose a human-in-the-loop approach for the detection and classification of symbols in floor plans. The developed system calculates a measure of uncertainty for each detected symbol which is used to acquire the knowledge of human experts for those symbols that are difficult to classify. We evaluate our approach with a real-world dataset provided by an industry partner and find that the selective acquisition of human expert knowledge enhances the model’s performance by up to 10.5%—resulting in an overall prediction accuracy of 92.1% on average. We further design a pipeline for the generation of synthetic training data that allows the systems to be adapted to new construction projects with minimal manual effort. Overall, our work supports professionals in the AEC industry on their journey to the data-driven generation of business value.
