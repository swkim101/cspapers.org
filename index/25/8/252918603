Very few methods for hybrid federated learning, where clients only hold subsets of both features and samples, exist. Yet, this scenario is very important in practical settings. We provide a fast, robust algorithm for hybrid federated learning that hinges on Fenchel Duality. We prove the convergence of the algorithm to the same solution as if the model was trained centrally in a variety of practical regimes. Furthermore, we provide experimental results that demonstrate the performance improvements of the algorithm over a commonly used method in federated learning, FedAvg, and an existing hybrid FL algorithm, HyFEM. We also provide privacy considerations and necessary steps to protect client data.
