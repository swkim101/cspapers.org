Mobile edge computing (MEC) offers the infrastructure for improving data caching performance structurally by deploying edge servers at the network edge within users' close geographic proximity. Popular data like viral videos can be cached on edge servers to serve users with low latency. Investigating the integrity of these edge data is critical and challenging as edge servers often suffer from unreliability and constrained resources. Meanwhile, EDI (edge data integrity) investigation must be performed by edge servers collaboratively at the edge to avoid excessive backhaul network traffic. There are two main challenges in practice: 1) there is a lack of Byzantine-tolerant collaborative investigation method; and 2) edge servers may be reluctant to collaborate without proper incentives. To tackle these challenges systematically, this paper proposes a novel scheme named EdgeWatch to enable robust and collaborative EDI investigation in a decentralized manner based on blockchain. Under EdgeWatch, edge servers collaborate on EDI investigation following a novel integrity consensus. A blockchain system comprises of three main components is built as the infrastructure to facilitate integrity consensus: 1) an incentive mechanism that motivates edge servers to participate in EDI investigation; 2) a reputation system that elects reliable leaders for block consensus; and 3) a leader randomization technique that protects leaders from targeted attacks. We evaluate it against three representative schemes experimentally. The results demonstrate the high precision, efficiency, and robustness of EdgeWatch.
