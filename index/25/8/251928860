We present a portable multiscopic camera system with a dedicated model for novel view and time synthesis in dynamic scenes. Our goal is to render high-quality images for a dynamic scene from any viewpoint at any time using our portable multiscopic camera. To achieve such novel view and time synthesis, we develop a physical multiscopic camera equipped with five cameras to train a neural radiance field (NeRF) in both time and spatial domains for dynamic scenes. Our model maps a 6D coordinate (3D spatial position, 1D temporal coordinate, and 2D viewing direction) to view-dependent and time-varying emitted radiance and volume density. Volume rendering is applied to render a photo-realistic image at a specified camera pose and time. To improve the robustness of our physical camera, we propose a camera parameter optimization module and a temporal frame interpolation module to promote information propagation across time. We conduct experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets to evaluate our system, and the results show that our approach outperforms alternative solutions qualitatively and quantitatively. Our code and dataset are available at https://yuenfuilau.github.io/.
