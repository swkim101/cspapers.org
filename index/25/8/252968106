We provide theoretical bounds on the worst case performance of the greedy algorithm in seeking to maximize a normalized, monotone, but not necessarily submodular ob-jective function under a simple partition matroid constraint. We also provide worst case bounds on the performance of the greedy algorithm in the case that limited information is available at each planning step. We specifically consider limited information as a result of unreliable communications during distributed execution of the greedy algorithm. We utilize notions of curvature for normalized, monotone set functions to develop the bounds provided in this work. To demonstrate the value of the bounds provided in this work, we analyze a variant of the benefit of search objective function and show, using real-world data collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle, that theoretical approximation guarantees are achieved despite non-submodularity of the objective function.
