Similar to previous iterations, the epiDAMIK @ KDD workshop is a forum to promote data driven approaches in epidemiology and public health research. Even after the devastating impact of COVID-19 pandemic, data driven approaches are not as widely studied in epidemiology, as they are in other spaces. We aim to promote and raise the profile of the emerging research area of data-driven and computational epidemiology, and create a venue for presenting state-of-the-art and in-progress results-in particular, results that would otherwise be difficult to present at a major data mining conference, including lessons learnt in the 'trenches'. The current COVID-19 pandemic has only showcased the urgency and importance of this area. Our target audience consists of data mining and machine learning researchers from both academia and industry who are interested in epidemiological and public-health applications of their work, and practitioners from the areas of mathematical epidemiology and public health.
