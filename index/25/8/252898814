Recent advances have demonstrated that voice assistants or speech recognition systems can be manipulated by malicious and inaudible voice commands. However, the previously proposed attacks require an acoustical generator (e.g., a speaker or a capacitor) to trigger mechanical vibrations at a microphone diaphragm. In this work, we investigate a new type of inaudible command attack using wireless chargers. Specifically, the magnetic interference generated by a wireless charger can induce an inaudible sound at a nearby microphone, without triggering any mechanical vibrations, even if the microphone is equipped with a Faraday cage and an internal electromagnetic interference filter already. By taking advantage of this new insight, we will present a novel inaudible command attack demo that can inject inaudible voice commands into smart devices that are being charged or near to a charger. We conduct extensive experiments with 17 victim devices (iPhone, Huawei, Samsung, etc.) and six types of voice assistants (Siri, Google STT, Bixby, etc.). Evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed attack with commercial charging settings.
