Negative pairs, especially hard negatives as combined with common negatives (easy to discriminate), are essential in contrastive learning, which plays a role of avoiding degenerate solutions in the sense of constant representation across different instances. Inspired by recent hard negative mining methods via pairwise mixup operation in vision, we propose M-Mix, which dynamically generates a sequence of hard negatives. Compared with previous methods, M-Mix mainly has three features: 1) adaptively choose samples to mix; 2) simultaneously mix multiple samples; 3) automatically assign different mixing weights to the selected samples. We evaluate our method on two image datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100), five node classification datasets (PPI, DBLP, Pubmed, etc), five graph classification datasets (IMDB, PTC_MR, etc), and two downstream combinatorial tasks (graph edit distance and node clustering). Results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance under self-supervised settings. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sherrylone/m-mix.
