Event ontology provides a shared and formal specification about what happens in the real world and can benefit many natural language understanding tasks. However, the independent development of event ontologies often results in heterogeneous representations that raise the need for establishing alignments between semantically related events. There exists a series of works about ontology alignment (OA), but they only focus on the entity-based OA, and neglect the event-based OA. To fill the gap, we construct an Event Ontology Alignment ( EventOA ) dataset based on FrameNet and Wikidata, which consists of 900+ event type alignments and 8,000+ event argument alignments. Furthermore, we propose a multi-view event ontology alignment (MEOA) method, which utilizes description information (i.e., name, alias and definition) and neighbor information (i.e., subclass and superclass) to obtain richer representation of the event ontologies. Extensive experiments show that our MEOA outperforms the existing entity-based OA meth-ods and can serve as a strong baseline for Even-tOA research.
