This paper proposes a graph-based meta learning approach to separately predict water quantity and quality variables for river segments in stream networks. Given the heterogeneous water dynamic patterns in large-scale basins, we introduce an additional meta-learning condition based on physical characteristics of stream segments, which allows learning different sets of initial parameters for different stream segments. Specifically, we develop a representation learning method that leverages physical simulations to embed the physical characteristics of each segment. The obtained embeddings are then used to cluster river segments and add the condition for the meta-learning process. We have tested the performance of the proposed method for predicting daily water temperature and streamflow for the Delaware River Basin (DRB) over a 14 year period. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method in predicting target variables even using sparse training samples. We also show that our method can achieve robust performance with different numbers of clusterings.
