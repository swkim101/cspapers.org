In modern electronic manufacturing processes, multi-layer Printed Circuit Board (PCB) routing requires connecting more than hundreds of nets with perplexing topology under complex routing constraints and highly limited resources, so that takes intense effort and time of human engineers. PCB fanout as a pre-design of PCB routing has been proved to be an ideal technique to reduce the complexity of PCB routing by pre-allocating resources and pre-routing. However, current PCB fanout design heavily relies on the experience of human engineers, and there is no existing solution for PCB fanout automation in industry, which limits the quality of PCB routing automation. To address the problem, we propose a neuralized PCB fanout method by deep reinforcement learning. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first in the literature to propose the automation method for PCB fanout. We combine with Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and attention-based network to train our fanout policy model and value model. The models learn representations of PCB layout and netlist to make decisions and evaluations in place of human engineers. We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to update the parameters of the models. In addition, we apply our PCB fanout method to a PCB router to improve the quality of PCB routing. Extensive experimental results on real-world industrial PCB benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves 100% routability in all industrial cases and improves wire length by an average of 6.8%, which makes a significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
