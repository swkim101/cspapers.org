This paper proposes an Efficient Multi-view Graph Clustering with Comprehensive Fusion (EMGC²F) model and a corresponding efficient optimization algorithm to address multi-view graph clustering tasks effectively and efficiently. Compared to existing works, our proposals have the following highlights: 1) EMGC²F directly finds a consistent cluster indicator matrix with a Super Nodes Similarity Minimization module from multiple views, which avoids time-consuming spectral decomposition in previous works. 2) EMGC²F comprehensively mines information from multiple views. More formally, it captures the consistency of multiple views via a Cross-view Nearest Neighbors Voting (CN²V) mechanism, meanwhile capturing the importance of multiple views via an adaptive weighted-learning mechanism. 3) EMGC²F is a parameter-free model and the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is far less than existing works, demonstrating the practicability. Empirical results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposals outperform SOTA competitors both in effectiveness and efficiency.
