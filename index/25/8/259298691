We show that a stochastic version of optimistic mirror descent (OMD), a variant of mirror descent with recency bias, converges fast in general games. More specifically, with our algorithm, the individual regret of each player vanishes at a speed of O (1 /T 3 / 4 ) and the sum of all players’ regret vanishes at a speed of O (1 /T ) , which is an improvement upon the O (1 / √ T ) convergence rate of prior stochastic algorithms, where T is the number of interaction rounds. Due to the advantage of stochastic methods in the computational cost
