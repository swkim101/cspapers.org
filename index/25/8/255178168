Planar pushing is a fundamental robot manipulation task with most algorithms built upon the quasi-static as-sumption. Under this assumption the end-effector should apply force on the pushed object along the full moving trajectory. This means that the target position must lie in the robot's workspace. To enable a robot to deliver objects outside of its workspace and facilitate faster delivery, the quasi-static assumption should be lifted in favour of dynamical manipulation. In this work, we propose a two-staged data-driven manipulation method to hit an unknown object to reach a target position. This expands the reachability of the manipulated object beyond the robot's workspace. The robot equipped with a tactile sensor first explores for the stable pushing region (SPR) on the given object by using a gain-scheduling PD control with the contact centre estimated to maintain full contact between the object and the end-effector. In the second stage, a learning-based approach is used to generate the impulse the object should receive at the SPR to reach a target sliding distance. The performance of proposed method is evaluated on a KUKA LBR iiwa 14 R820 robot manipulator and a XELA tactile sensor.
