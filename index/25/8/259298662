We prove that image classifiers are fundamentally sensitive to small perturbations in their inputs. Specifically, we show that given some image space of n -by- n images, all but a tiny fraction of images in any image class induced over that space can be moved outside that class by adding some perturbation whose p -norm is O ( n 1 / max( p, 1) ) , as long as that image class takes up at most half of the image space. We then show that O ( n 1 / max( p, 1) ) is asymptotically optimal. Finally, we show that an increase in the bit depth of the image space leads to a loss in robustness. We supplement our results with a discussion of their implications for vision systems
