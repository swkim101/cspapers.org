Knowledge networks/graphs provide a powerful approach for data discovery, integration, and reuse. The NSF's new Convergence Accelerator program, which focuses on transitioning research to practice and translational research, announced Track A on the Open Knowledge Network (OKN). The program calls for multidisciplinary and multi-sector teams to work together to build a cooperative and shared open knowledge network infrastructure to drive innovation across science, engineering, and humanities. This workshop aims to invite researchers, practitioners, and the general public to brainstorm the ideas related to OKN, collaboratively build KGs for different domains or applications, develop AI algorithms to provide intelligent services based on OKN, and discuss the social and economic implications related to OKN.
