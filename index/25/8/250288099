Geographical information provided in social media data is useful for many valuable applications. However, only a small proportion of social media posts are explicitly geotagged with their posting locations, which makes the pursuit of these applications challenging. Motivated by this, we propose a 2-level hierarchical classification method that builds upon a BERT model, coupled with textual information and temporal context, which we denote HierBERT. As far as we are aware, this work is the first to utilize a 2-level hierarchical classification approach alongside BERT and temporal information for geolocation prediction. Experimental results based on two social media datasets show that HierBERT outperforms various state-of-art baselines in terms of accuracy and distance error metrics.
