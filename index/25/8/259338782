Is it possible for a synthetic to realistic domain adapted neural network in single image depth estimation to truly generalize on real world data? The resultant, adapted model will only generalize on the realistic domain dataset, which only reflects a small portion of the true, real world. As a result, the network still has to cope with the potential danger of domain shift between the realistic domain dataset and the real world data. Instead, a viable solution is to design the model to be capable of continuously adapting to the distribution of data it receives at test-time. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation method that is capable of adapting to the domain shift at test-time. Our method adapts to the unseen test-time domain, by updating the network using our proposed objective functions. Following former work, we reduce the entropy of the current prediction for refinement and adaptation. We propose a Logit Order Enforcement loss that can prevent the network from deviating into wrong solutions, which can result from the mere reduction of the aforementioned entropy. Qualitative and quantitative results show the effectiveness of our method. Our method reduces the dependency on training data by 5.8Ã— on average, while achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and domain generalization methods (DG) on the KITTI dataset.
