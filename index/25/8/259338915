Dubins coverage has been extensively researched to address the coverage path planning (CPP) problem of a known environment for the curvature-constrained robot. However, its fixed-speed assumption prevents the robot from accelerating to reduce the time and limits its flexibility to avoid obstacles. Therefore, this paper presents a collision-free CPP approach (CFC) for the obstacle-constrained environment, which enhances time efficiency by constructing the variable-speed Dubins paths and ensures robot safety by building a risk potential surface for representing the possibility of collision. Furthermore, CFC models the CPP problem as an asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP) and utilizes a graph pruning strategy to reduce the computational cost. Comparison tests with other Dubins coverage methods demonstrate that CFC provides shorter coverage times and better runtimes than the other Dubins coverage methods while preventing collision risk between the robot and obstacles. Physical experiments in a laboratory setting demonstrate the applicability of CFC to the physical robot.
