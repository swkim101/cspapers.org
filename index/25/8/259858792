This paper presents a principled approach to operating sys-tem teaching that complements the existing practices. Our methodology takes state transition systems as first-class citizens in operating systems teaching and demonstrates how to effectively convey non-trivial research systems to junior OS learners within this framework. This paper also presents the design and implementation of a minimal operating sys-tem model with nine system calls covering process-based isolation, thread-based concurrency, and crash consistency, with a model checker and interactive state space explorer for exhaustively examining all possible system behaviors
