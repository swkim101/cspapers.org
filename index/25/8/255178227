For the proper functioning of mobile manipulator-type autonomous robot performing complicated tasks in a human-robot coexistence environment, tasks and motions must be planned simultaneously. In such environments, a human and robot should collaborate with each other. Therefore, the robot must act in accordance with the human and avoid useless actions duplicated with those of humans. However, any action undertaken by a human has uncertainty, and thus, predicting them correctly is challenging. This study proposed probabilistic task and motion planning considering both deterministic and probabilistic environment changes caused by robot and human actions temporarily and spatially, respectively. First, the environmental changes were modeled, where the robot is capable of recognizing the possibility of environmental changes. Second, in task planning, the probabilities of each environmental change owing to human actions was minimized. Finally, in motion planning, a movement path connecting each task in a planned order was planned, thereby enabling the robot to perform actions not duplicated with those by a human. Furthermore, the plans generated were compared without considering possibility of human actions and the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified. Consequently, the proposed method was confirmed to reduce the time required for finishing the tasks.
