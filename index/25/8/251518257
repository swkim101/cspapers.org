We present GradMask, a simple adversarial example detection scheme for natural language processing (NLP) models. It uses gradient signals to detect adversarially perturbed tokens in an input sequence and occludes such tokens by a masking process. GradMask provides several advantages over existing methods including improved detection performance and an interpretation of its decision with a only moderate computational cost. Its approximated inference cost is no more than a single forward- and back-propagation through the target model without requiring any additional detection module. Extensive evaluation on widely adopted NLP benchmark datasets demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of GradMask. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Han8931/grad_mask_detection
