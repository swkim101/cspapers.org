As the fundamental basis of sponsored search, relevance modeling measures the closeness between the input queries and the candidate ads. Conventional relevance models solely rely on the textual data, which suffer from the scarce semantic signals within the short queries. Recently, user historical click behaviors are incorporated in the format of click graphs to provide additional correlations beyond pure textual semantics, which contributes to advancing the relevance modeling performance. However, user behaviors are usually arbitrary and unpredictable, leading to the noisy and sparse graph topology. In addition, there exist other types of user behaviors besides clicks, which may also provide complementary information. In this paper, we study the novel problem of heterogeneous behavior graph learning to facilitate relevance modeling task. Our motivation lies in learning an optimal and task-relevant heterogeneous behavior graph consisting of multiple types of user behaviors. We further propose a novel HBGLR model to learn the behavior graph structure by mining the sophisticated correlations between node semantics and graph topology, and encode the textual semantics and structural heterogeneity into the learned representations. Our proposal is evaluated over real-world industry datasets, and has been mainstreamed in the Bing ads. Both offline and online experimental results demonstrate its superiority.
