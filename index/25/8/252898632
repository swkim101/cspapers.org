In this paper, we investigate the impacts of location on the spectral distribution of received light, i.e., the intensity of light for different wavelengths, in indoor environments. Our findings show that, even when using the same light source, different locations exhibit slightly different spectral distribution due to reflections from their localised environment containing different materials or colours. Based on this observation, we present Spectral-Loc, a novel indoor localization method that employs light spectrum information to detect the device's position. Because spectrum sensors are increasingly being used in new products and applications, such as white balance in smartphone photography, Spectral-Loc can be quickly implemented without the need for extra hardware or infrastructure. We used a commercially available light spectrum sensor, the AS7265x, to prototype Spectral-Loc, which can measure light intensity over 18 different wavelength sub-bands. We benchmark the localization accuracy of Spectral-Loc against the conventional light intensity sensors that provide only a single intensity value. Our evaluations in two indoor areas, a meeting room and a large office, show that using light spectral information considerably decreases the localization error for different percentiles.
