One way of ensuring operator's safety during human-robot collaboration is through Speed and Separation Monitoring (SSM), as defined in ISO standard ISO/TS 15066. In general, it is impossible to avoid all human-robot collisions: consider for instance the case when the robot does not move at all, a human operator can still collide with it by hitting it of her own voluntary motion. In the SSM framework, it is possible however to minimize harm by requiring this: if a collision ever occurs, then the robot must be in a stationary state (all links have zero velocity) at the time instant of the collision. In this paper, we propose a time-optimal control policy based on Time-Optimal Path Parameterization (TOPP) to guarantee such a behavior. Specifically, we show that: for any robot motion that is strictly faster than the motion recommended by our policy, there exists a human motion that results in a collision with the robot in a non-stationary state. Correlatively, we show, in simulation, that our policy is strictly less conservative than state-of-the-art safe robot control methods. Additionally, we propose a parallelization method to reduce the computation time of our pre-computation phase (down to about 0.5 sec, practically), which enables the whole pipeline (including the pre-computation) to be executed at runtime, nearly in real-time. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our method in a scenario: time-optimal, safe control of a 6-dof industrial robot.
