Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) is a popular method for human motion analysis. In the context of these methods it is necessary to pay attention to the reliability of the results. This paper proposes an approach based on the evaluation of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions relying on a complete analysis with Singular Value Decomposition and provides a detailed analysis of reliability. With respect to a ground truth, our simulations illustrate how the proposed method analyzes the reliability of the resolution. After introducing a clear methodology, the properties of the matrices are studied with different noise levels and different experimental models and conditions. We show how to implement the method, step by step, by explaining the numerical difficulties encountered during the resolution and thus how to make the results of the IOC problem reliable.
