The deployment of robots for Gas Source Localization (GSL) tasks in hazardous scenarios significantly reduces the risk to humans and animals. Gas sensing using mobile robots focuses primarily on simplified scenarios, due to the complexity of gas dispersion, with a current trend towards tackling more complex environments. However, most state-of-art GSL algorithms for environments with obstacles only depend on local information, leading to low efficiency in large and more structured spaces. The efficiency of GSL can be improved dramatically by coupling it with a global knowledge of gas distribution in the environment. However, since gas dispersion in a built environment is difficult to model analytically, most previous work incorporating a gas dispersion model was tested under simplified assumptions, which do not take into consideration the impact of the presence of obstacles to the airflow and gas plume. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic algorithm that enables a robot to efficiently localize gas sources in built environments, by combining a state-of-the-art probabilistic GSL algorithm, Source Term Estimation (STE) with a learned plume model. The pipeline of generating gas dispersion datasets from realistic simulations, the training and validation of the model, as well as the integration of the learned model with the STE framework are presented. The performance of the algorithm is validated both in high-fidelity simulations and real experiments, with promising results obtained under various obstacle configurations.
