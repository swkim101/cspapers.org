Pre-trained language model (PLM) can be stealthily misled to target outputs by back-door attacks when encountering poisoned samples, without performance degradation on clean samples. The stealthiness of backdoor attacks is commonly attained through minimal cross-entropy loss ﬁne-tuning on a union of poisoned and clean samples. Existing defense paradigms provide a workaround by detecting and removing poisoned samples at pre-training or inference time. On the contrary, we provide a new perspective where the backdoor attack is directly reversed. Speciﬁcally, maximum entropy loss is incorporated in training to neutralize the minimal cross-entropy loss ﬁne-tuning on poisoned data. We defend against a range of backdoor attacks on classiﬁcation tasks and sig-niﬁcantly lower the attack success rate. In extension, we explore the relationship between intended backdoor attacks and unintended dataset bias, and demonstrate the feasibility of the maximum entropy principle in de-biasing.
