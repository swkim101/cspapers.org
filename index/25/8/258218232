Data physicalisation is a technique that encodes data through the geometric and material properties of an artefact, allowing users to engage with data in a more immersive and multi-sensory way. However, current methods of data physicalisation are limited in terms of their reconfigurability and the types of materials that can be used. Acoustophoresis—a method of suspending and manipulating materials using sound waves—offers a promising solution to these challenges. In this paper, we present DataLev, a design space and platform for creating reconfigurable, multimodal data physicalisations with enriched materiality using acoustophoresis. We demonstrate the capabilities of DataLev through eight examples and evaluate its performance in terms of reconfigurability and materiality. Our work offers a new approach to data physicalisation, enabling designers to create more dynamic, engaging, and expressive artefacts.
