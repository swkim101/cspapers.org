Federated learning—multi-party, distributed learning in a decentralized environment—is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, more so than centralized learning. This is because malicious clients can collude and send in carefully tailored model updates to make the global model inaccurate. This motivated the development of Byzantine-resilient federated learning algorithms, such as Krum, Bulyan, FABA, and FoolsGold. However, a recently developed untargeted model poisoning attack showed that all prior defenses can be bypassed. The attack uses the intuition that simply by changing the sign of the gradient updates that the optimizer is computing, for a set of malicious clients, a model can be diverted from the optima to increase the test error rate. In this work, we develop FLAIR—a defense against this directed deviation attack (DDA), a state-of-the-art model poisoning attack. FLAIR is based on our intuition that in federated learning, certain patterns of gradient flips are indicative of an attack. This intuition is remarkably stable across different learning algorithms, models, and datasets. FLAIR assigns reputation scores to the participating clients based on their behavior during the training phase and then takes a weighted contribution of the clients. We show that where the existing defense baselines of FABA [IJCAI ’19], FoolsGold [Usenix ’20], and FLTrust [NDSS ’21] fail when 20-30% of the clients are malicious, FLAIR provides byzantine-robustness upto a malicious client percentage of 45%. We also show that FLAIR provides robustness against even a white-box version of DDA.
