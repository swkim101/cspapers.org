Personalized review summarization in recommender systems is a challenging task of generating condensed summaries for product reviews while preserving the salient content of reviews. Recently, Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have become a new paradigm in text generation for the strong ability of natural language comprehension. However, it is nontrivial to apply PLMs in personalized review summarization directly since there are rich personalized information (e.g., user preferences and product characteristics) to be considered, which is crucial to the salience estimation of input review. In this paper, we propose a pre-trained personalized review summarization method, which aims to effectively incorporate the personalized information of users and products into the salience estimation of the input reviews. We design a personalized encoder that could identify the salient contents of the input sequence by jointly considering the semantic and personalized information respectively (i.e., ratings, user and product IDs, and linguistic features), yielding personalized representations for the input reviews and history summaries separately. Moreover, we design an interactive information selection mechanism that further identiÔ¨Åes the salient contents of the input reviews and selects relative information from the history summaries. The results on real-world datasets show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines and could generate
