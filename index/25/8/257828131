For the first time AFM (atomic-force microscopy) was used to record significant changes in the geometric parameters of the image of erythrocytes in vitro under conditions of glycolytic starvation (ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) deficiency). The difference in the action of antioxidants, phenosan K, and Ihfan-10 on erythrocytes that we detected with AFM seems to be mainly due to their difference in hydrophobicity. We used the AFM method to research the self-organization of the components of the active center of P450 (Porphyrin-450) metalloenzymes that are part of a class of hemoproteins with functions of affinity to molecular oxygen O2. Stable supramolecular nanostructures in the form of triangular prisms based on the iron porphyrin complex with amino acids due to self-assembly involving intermolecular hydrogen bonds were received. A possible scheme for the formation of such structures is proposed.
