A novel mechanism to derive self-entanglement-free path for tethered differential-driven robots is proposed in this work. The problem is tailored to the applications of tethered robots without an omni-directional tether re-tractor which is often encountered when an omni-directional tether retracting mechanism is incapable of being jointly equipped with other geometrically complex devices (e.g. a manipulator), for instance the disaster recovery, spatial exploration, etc. Without a special consideration on the spatial relation between the pose of the mobile base and the tether, self-entanglement appears when the robot moves, resulting in unsafe motion of the robot and potential damage to the tether. In this paper, the self-entanglement-free constraint is modelled as the admissible orientation of the tether anchoring on the robot with respect to the robot's heading orientation. A searching-based path planning algorithm is then proposed to generate a near optimal path solution with guaranteed null of tether self-entanglement. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is compared with the motions without considering self-entanglement-free constraint, illustrated in challenging planning cases, and validated in realworld scenes. An open-source implementation has also been provided for the benefit of the robotics community.
