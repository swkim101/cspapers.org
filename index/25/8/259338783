Recent work on battery-free soft robotics has demonstrated the use of liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) to build shape-changing materials activated by applied external heat. However, sources of heat must typically be in direct field-of-view of the robot (i.e. NIR, laser, and visual light EM sources or convective heats guns), be tethered to an external power supply (i.e. thermoelectric heating or resistive joule heaters), or require a heavy on-board battery that limits mobility and range. This paper presents a novel battery-free soft-robotics platform that can crawl through confined, enclosed, and hard-to-reach spaces (e.g. packages, machinery, pipes, etc.), hidden from view of heating infrastructure. This is achieved through the co-design of a soft robotics platform and integrated soft conductive traces that enable wireless (microwave) heating through remote stimulation. We achieve fast actuation through a careful choice of materials and the overall mechanical structure of the robot to maximize heating efficiency. Further, the robot is actively tracked through enclosed spaces using a mm Wave radar to direct heat to its location. We provide a detailed evaluation on the robot's heating efficiency, location-tracking accuracy and crawling speed.
