This paper presents a model-based approach to reconstructing the large deformations of slender flexible beams through strain-gauge deflection sensors. Using the principal axes decomposition of structural compliance, a closed-form kinetostatics model can be obtained to characterize the non-linear force-deformation behavior of the flexible beams under-going large-scale deflection. Owing to analytical derivation of the system Jacobian, the efficient Newton-Raphson method is employed to determine the equilibrium configuration of the flexible beams, as well as the corresponding reaction force. To verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method, an experimental apparatus is built up, on which a variety of experiments are conducted. The results show that for a 300 mm long beam, the tip position can be predicted with an accuracy of 1.27 mm, 4.42 mm, and 1.17Â°, respectively, for the x, y directions and rotation. Accordingly, the estimation errors for the planar forces and torque are 0.075 N (3.33%), 0.155 N (14.23%), and 0.027 Nm (26.84%), respectively.
