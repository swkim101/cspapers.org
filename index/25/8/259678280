This work investigates the evolution of latent space when deep learning models are trained incrementally in non-stationary environments that stem from concept drift. We propose a methodology for visualizing the incurred change in latent representations. We further show that classes not targeted by concept drift can be negatively affected, suggesting that the observation of all classes during learning may regularize the latent space.
