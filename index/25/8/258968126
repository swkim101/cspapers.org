Similar to community detection, partitioning the nodes of a network according to their structural roles aims to identify fundamental building blocks of a network. The found partitions can be used, e.g., to simplify descriptions of the network connectivity, to derive reduced order models for dynamical processes unfolding on processes, or as ingredients for various graph mining tasks. In this work, we offer a fresh look on the problem of role extraction and its differences to community detection and present a definition of node roles related to graph-isomorphism tests, the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and equitable partitions. We study two associated optimization problems (cost functions) grounded in ideas from graph isomorphism testing, and present theoretical guarantees associated to the solutions of these problems. Finally, we validate our approach via a novel"role-infused partition benchmark", a network model from which we can sample networks in which nodes are endowed with different roles in a stochastic way.
