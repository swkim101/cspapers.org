Code-switching, or switching between languages, occurs for many reasons and has important linguistic, sociological, and cultural implications. Multilingual speakers code-switch for a variety of communicative functions, such as expressing emotions, borrowing terms, making jokes, introducing a new topic, etc. The function of code-switching may be quite useful for the analysis of linguists, cognitive scientists, speech therapists, and others, but is not readily apparent. To remedy this situation, we anno-tate and release a new dataset of functions of code-switching in Spanish-English. We build the first system (to our knowledge) to automatically identify a wide range of functions for which speakers code-switch in everyday speech, achieving an accuracy of 75% across all functions.
