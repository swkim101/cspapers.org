This paper presents a soft earthworm robot that is capable of both efficient locomotion and obstacle avoidance. The robot is designed to replicate the unique locomotion mechanisms of earthworms, which enable them to move through narrow and complex environments with ease. The robot consists of multiple segments, each with its own set of actuators, that are connected through rigid plastic joints, allowing for increased adaptability and flexibility in navigating different environments. The robot utilizes proprioceptive sensing and control algorithms to detect and avoid obstacles in real-time while maintaining efficient locomotion. The robot uses a pneumatic actuation system to mimic the circumnutation behavior exhibited by plant roots in order to navigate through complex environments. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the robot for navigating through cluttered environments, making this development significant for various fields of robotics, including search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and medical procedures.
