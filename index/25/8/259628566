Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is the task to extract aspects, opinions and associated sentiments from sentences. Previous studies do not adequately consider the complicated interactions between aspect and opinion terms in both extraction logic and strategy. We present a novel Double Policy Network with Multi-Tag based Reward model (DPN-MTR), which adopts two networks ATE, TSOTE and a Trigger Mechanism to execute ASTE task following a more logical framework. A Multi-Tag based reward is also proposed to solve the limitations of existing studies for identifying aspect/opinion terms with multiple tokens (one term may consist of two or more tokens) to a certain extent. Extensive experiments are conducted on four widely-used benchmark datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in generally improving the performance on ASTE significantly.
