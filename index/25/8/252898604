This paper presents the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of a wireless biomedical implant platform exploiting the magnetoelectric effect for wireless power and bi-directional communication. As an emerging wireless power transfer method, magnetoelectric is promising for mm-scaled bio-implants because of its superior misalignment sensitivity, high efficiency, and low tissue absorption compared to other modalities [46, 59, 60]. Utilizing the same physical mechanism for power and communication is critical for implant miniaturization, but low-power magnetoelectric uplink communication has not been achieved yet. For the first time, we design and demonstrate near-zero power magnetoelectric backscatter from the mm-sized implants by exploiting the converse magnetostriction effects. The system for demonstration consists of an 8.2-mm3 wireless implantable device and a custom portable transceiver. The implant's ASIC interfacing with the magnetoelectric transducer encodes uplink data by changing the transducer's load, resulting in resonance frequency changes for frequency-shift-keying modulation. The magnetoelectrically backscattered signal is sensed and demodulated through frequency-to-digital conversion by the external transceiver. With design optimizations in data modulation and recovery, the proposed system archives > 1-kbps data rate at the 335-kHz carrier frequency, with a communication distance greater than 2 cm and a bit error rate less than 1E-3. Further, we validate the proposed system for wireless stimulation and sensing, and conducted ex-vivo tests through a 1.5-cm porcine tissue. The proposed magnetoelectric backscatter approach provides a path towards miniaturized wireless bio-implants for advanced biomedical applications like closed-loop neuromodulation.
