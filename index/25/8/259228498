Bio-oils derived from the pyrolysis of lignin-based biomass often contain a variety of oxygenated compounds, which can compromise their usefulness as a fuel. To improve the quality of bio-oil, catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a crucial step that removes oxygen from the oil in the form of water. In this study, we showed that MFI nanosheets are excellent supports for Ru-catalysts. We synthesized highly crystalline MFI nanosheets using a simple hydrothermal seeding procedure; the final material was obtained in 56 h of crystallization. We investigated the activity of Ru supported on different materials. Our findings indicated that Ru supported on hierarchical MFI demonstrated excellent activity in HDO of guaiacol. Our results demonstrated that Ru/ZNS-56 achieved nearly 100% selectivity towards cyclohexane under mild conditions (200 Â°C, 50 bar H2, 1 h).
