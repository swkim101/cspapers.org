Time series analysis is ubiquitous and important in various areas, such as Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) in cloud computing, AI-powered Business Intelligence (BI) in E-commerce, Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), etc. In real-world scenarios, time series data often exhibit complex patterns with trend, seasonality, outlier, and noise. In addition, as more time series data are collected and stored, how to handle the huge amount of data efficiently is crucial in many applications. We note that these significant challenges exist in various tasks like forecasting, anomaly detection, and fault cause localization. Therefore, how to design effective and efficient time series models for different tasks, which are robust to address the aforementioned challenging patterns and noise in real-world scenarios, is of great theoretical and practical interests. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive and organized tutorial on the state-of-the-art algorithms of robust time series analysis, ranging from traditional statistical methods to the most recent deep learning based methods. We will not only introduce the principle of time series algorithms, but also provide insights into how to apply them effectively in practical real-world industrial applications. Specifically, we organize the tutorial in a bottom-up framework. We first present preliminaries from different disciplines including robust statistics, signal processing, optimization, and deep learning. Then, we identify and discuss those most-frequently processing blocks in robust time series analysis, including periodicity detection, trend filtering, seasonal-trend decomposition, and time series similarity. Lastly, we discuss recent advances in multiple time series tasks including forecasting, anomaly detection, fault cause localization, and autoscaling, as well as practical lessons of large-scale time series applications from an industrial perspective.
