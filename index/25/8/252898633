This paper presents ABC, the AR(augmented reality), and BLE combined target detector in a crowd of objects. The AR design of BLE analysis is a ready-to-use option for the ever-growing app-based ride market. The carefully designed AR tags and BLE beacons effectively collaborate to identify the target car. Such that a passenger can pinpoint the ride from a far distance. ABC consistently identify the target in a realistic environment through evaluations.
