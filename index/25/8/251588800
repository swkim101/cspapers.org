This paper presents a case for educating software engineering students in artificial intelligence methods. The relationships and interactions between software engineering and artificial intelligence and the characteristic nature of artificial intelligence methodology are discussed. Aims for an AI course for software engineering students are outlined. The structure of such a course and a strategy for teaching the subject are discussed, that the author has used successfully with undergraduate software engineers.
