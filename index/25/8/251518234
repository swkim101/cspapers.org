Adversarial learning methods and their applications such as generative adversarial network, adversarial robustness, and security and privacy, have prevailed and revolutionized the research in machine learning and data mining. Their importance has not only been emphasized by the research community but also been widely recognized by the industry and the general public. Continuing the synergies in previous years, this third annual workshop aims to advance this research field. The AdvML'22 workshop consists of four tracks: (i) open-call paper submissions; (ii) invited speakers; (iii) rising star awards and presentations; and (iv) panel discussion on AdvML.
