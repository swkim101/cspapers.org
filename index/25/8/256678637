In the present research, the occurrence of contamination by microplastics in the water column was investigated in 15 sample sites along the rivers Guapimirim, Macacu and Maracanã—important rivers that flow into Guanabara Bay, a very polluted estuarine environment in Brazil. The correctidentified polymers were manually counted and classified as to their morphology and color using a binocular stereomicroscope and were characterized by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The total mean abundance of particles was 3651.5 items m−3, ranging from 3.6 to 51,166.5 items m−3. Plastic debris was identified in all samples, with a predominance of fibers (67.3%). Polyethylene, polyester fiber and high-density polyethylene (50%) were the major polymers, and the main colors were transparent followed by black and blue in all the water bodies studied. The highest quantities of microplastics were found in the Maracanã River. The figures show that microplastic concentrations are correlated to the level of urbanization.
