Role arbitration in human-robot collaboration (HRC) is a dynamically changing process that is affected by many factors such as physical workload, environmental changes and trust. In order to address this dynamic process, a trust-based role arbitration method is studied in this research. A computational model of robot trust and self-confidence (TSC) in physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) is proposed. The TSC model is defined as a function of objective robot and human co-worker performance. A role arbitration method is then proposed based on the TSC model presented. The human-in-the-loop experiments with a collaborative robot are conducted to verify the TSC-based role arbitration method. The results show that the proposed method could achieve superior human-robot combined performance, reduce human co-workers' workload, and improve subjective preference.
