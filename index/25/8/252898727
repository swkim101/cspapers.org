In recent years, with the increase in users' demand for location services, the research of Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) has attracted much attention. Many researchers proposed schemes to estimate the user's location based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values of wireless technologies. However, the RSSI value is affected by signal interference seriously. This causes the accuracy of the positioning to be greatly reduced. To solve this problem, we use Computer Vision (CV) to replace traditional solutions in this paper. CV is known for its high performance and low complexity. The proposed scheme is capable of inferring the current location of users in the possible candidates from the interior structural features of buildings captured by cameras and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) drawing.
