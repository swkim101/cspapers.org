Loss functions serve as the foundation of supervised learning and are often chosen prior to model development. To avoid potentially ad hoc choices of losses, statistical decision theory describes a desirable property for losses known as \emph{properness}, which asserts that Bayes' rule is optimal. Recent works have sought to \emph{learn losses} and models jointly. Existing methods do this by fitting an inverse canonical link function which monotonically maps $\mathbb{R}$ to $[0,1]$ to estimate probabilities for binary problems. In this paper, we extend monotonicity to maps between $\mathbb{R}^{C-1}$ and the projected probability simplex $\tilde{\Delta}^{C-1}$ by using monotonicity of gradients of convex functions. We present {\sc LegendreTron} as a novel and practical method that jointly learns \emph{proper canonical losses} and probabilities for multiclass problems. Tested on a benchmark of domains with up to 1,000 classes, our experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms the natural multiclass baseline under a $t$-test at 99% significance on all datasets with greater than 10 classes.
