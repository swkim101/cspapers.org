In this paper, we present an online planning-scheduling approach for battery-powered autonomous aerial robots. The approach consists of simultaneously planning a coverage path and scheduling onboard computational tasks. We further derive a novel variable coverage motion robust to air-borne constraints and an empirically motivated energy model. The model includes the energy contribution of the schedule based on an automatic computational energy modeling tool. Our experiments show how an initial flight plan is adjusted online as a function of the available battery, accounting for uncertainty. Our approach remedies possible in-flight failure in case of unexpected battery drops, e.g., due to adverse atmospheric conditions, and increases the overall fault tolerance.
