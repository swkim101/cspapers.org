The 3rd IADSS Workshop on Data Science Standards follows a tradition of two prior KDD workshops and the initial workshop at ICDM-2018. The theme of the 2022 workshop is: Hiring, Assessing and Upskilling Data Science Talent. Organized by the Initiative for Analytics and Data Science (IADSS.org) at KDD, the workshop provides a platform to discuss industry needs and practices around external and internal talent pipeline development in data science. We aim to provide an understanding of the data science job market, and the critical role of collaboration between academic institutions and industry to meet the increasing need for talent. IADSS conducts ongoing research in this domain. In this workshop, we share detailed findings and observations from this research. In addition to contribution from researchers and industry practitioners through an open call for papers, the workshop features several invited presentations and invited speakers. In order to achieve intended aim, interactive panels will discuss topics of interest and feedback from the workshop will be used to produce post-workshop learnings. This workshop is designed as a half-day working meeting with short talks, invited panels and discussion sessions to plan for future steps in the topic. Post conference, learnings from the workshop will be available at the workshop's home page: https://www.iadss.org/kdd2022
