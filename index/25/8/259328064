In this work, we introduce a lightweight secure aggregation protocol that guarantees liveness (i.e., guaranteed output delivery), robust against faulty inputs and security against malicious clients. First, we improve upon prior works in the “star”-like topology network with a central coordinating (also output) party, Bonawitz et al. (ACM CCS 2017) and Bell et al. (ACM CCS 2020), which are not robust against faulty inputs. Recent works, RoFL (Burkhalter et al.) and (concurrent work) ACORN (Bell et al.) show how to rely on zero-knowledge proofs to address such attacks at expense of significantly high computation costs. We also compare our protocol against the PRIO system by Gibbs and Boneh (USENIX 2017) which achieves the same task in an incomparable security model. We benchmark our protocol with implementation and demonstrate its concrete efficiency. Our solution scales to 1000s of clients, requires only a constant number of rounds, outperforms prior work in computational cost, and has competitive communication cost.
