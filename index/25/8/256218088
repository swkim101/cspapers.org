Five schemes of double bypass engines with variable working process were considered. Computer simulation of three models of double bypass engines in the ASTRA system, which covers the entire cycle of thermogasodynamic design of a gas turbine engine was carry out. The prototype engine is a turbojet engine with an afterburner - RD-33. Except for thermodynamic calculations, calculations carries out of the flight cycle, mass characteristics of the power plant and the aircraft, as well as efficiency criteria. Varying the values of the degree of bypass and double bypass, were obtained the values of the total mass of the power plant and fuel required for a flight at a given range - Msu+t and fuel consumption in kg per 1 ton-kilometer of transported cargo - Ct.km. As a result, it is concluded that the most rational and favorable ratio of efficiency parameters was obtained from the double bypass gas turbine engine of the variable duty cycle FLADE VCE. The resulting parameters exceed the values of efficiency parameters the prototype engine by 13%. These parameters can be used to perform structural and parametric optimization of parameters in order to reduce fuel costs and increase the efficiency of engines with a complex cycle, designed for military aviation, on the cruising section of the flight.
