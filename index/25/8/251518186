What are data and network models? What are efficient algorithms? What are meaningful solutions? Big Data, Network Sciences, and Machine Learning have fundamentally challenged the basic characterizations in computing, from the conventional graph-theoretical modeling of networks to the traditional polynomial-time worst-case measures of efficiency: For a long time, graphs have been widely used for defining the structure of social and information networks. However, real-world network data and phenomena are much richer and more complex than what can be captured by nodes and edges. Network data is multifaceted, and thus network sciences require new theories, going beyond classic graph theory and graph-theoretical frameworks, to capture the multifaceted data. More than ever before, it is not just desirable, but essential, that efficient algorithms should be scalable. In other words, their complexity should be nearly linear or even sub-linear with respect to the problem size. Thus, scalability, not just polynomial-time computability, should be elevated as the central complexity notion for characterizing efficient computation. In this talk, I will discuss some aspects of these challenges. Using basic tasks in network analysis, geometric embedding, game theory, and machine learning as examples, I will highlight the role of big models, scalable algorithms and axiomatization in shaping our understanding of "effective solution concepts," which need to be both mathematically meaningful and algorithmically efficient.
