SUNNY is a k-nearest neighbors based Algorithm Selection (AS) approach that schedules and runs a number of solvers for a given unforeseen problem. In this work we present sunny-as2, an enhancement of SUNNY for generic AS scenarios that advances the original approach with wrapper-based feature selection, neighborhood-size configuration and a greedy approach to speed-up the training phase. Empirical evidence shows that sunny-as2 is competitive w.r.t. state-of-the-art AS approaches.
