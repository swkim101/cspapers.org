The successful integration of domestic service robots into home environments can bring significant services and convenience to the general population and possibly mitigate important societal issues, such as care provision for older adults. However, home environments are complex, dynamic and object-rich. It is, thus, very probable that service robots will encounter ambiguity while interacting with household items. To enable service robots to be more adaptive, we proposed a learning so-cial referencing computational framework and experimentally evaluated the framework on a mobile manipulator robot, Fetch, in object selection scenarios. The framework allows the robot to (1) detect and analyze the ambiguity level based on the robot's view and user's command, (2) assess the human's attention level and attract their attention, (3) disambiguate references to objects using human feedback and (4) learn novel objects after clarification from the user. System evaluation results are presented. The framework is modular and can be applied to different robotic platforms.
