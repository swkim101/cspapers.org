Videos are convenient resources for asynchronous learning, but they lack interpersonal interactions found in synchronous classrooms. Due to missed social connectedness, the isolated video-based learners experience low emotional, behavioral, and cognitive engagement. This work presents "Scripted Vicarious Dialogues" (SVD), a technique for engaging students in a pseudo-social experience of witnessing scripted dialogues between virtual characters (teaching assistants and students) around a video. We conducted a participatory design study to derive design guidelines for SVD. The findings indicate the need to distinguish the virtual components and to give students control of the dialogueâ€™s pace. We then implemented an interactive prototype of SVD and evaluated it (N=40) against a non-social, direct-learning baseline. The results show that the preference for SVD versus the baseline is polarized (25 of 40 preferred SVD; no neutral preferences), and those who preferred SVD had significantly higher emotional and behavioral engagement with SVD compared to the baseline.
