Zero-shot node classification is a very important challenge for classical semi-supervised node classification algorithms, such as Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) which has been widely applied to node classification. In order to predict the unlabeled nodes from unseen classes, zero-shot node classification needs to transfer knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes. It is crucial to consider the relations between the classes in zero-shot node classification. However, the GCN only considers the relations between the nodes, not the relations between the classes. Therefore, the GCN can not handle the zero-shot node classification effectively. This paper proposes a Dual Bidirectional Graph Convolutional Networks (DBiGCN) that consists of dual BiGCNs from the perspective of the nodes and the classes, respectively. The BiGCN can integrate the relations between the nodes and between the classes simultaneously in an united network. In addition, to make the dual BiGCNs work collaboratively, a label consistency loss is introduced, which can achieve mutual guidance and mutual improvement between the dual BiGCNs. Finally, the experimental results on real-world graph data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
