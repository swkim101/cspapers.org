We consider the problem of computing the 1-Wasserstein distance W(μ, ν) between two d-dimensional discrete distributions μ and ν whose support lie within the unit hypercube. There are several algorithms that estimate W(μ, ν) within an additive error of ε. However, when W(μ, ν) is small, the additive error ε dominates, leading to noisy results. Consider any additive approximation algorithm with execution time T (n, ε). We propose an algorithm that runs in O(T (n, ε/d) log n) time and boosts the accuracy of estimating W(μ, ν) from ε to an expected additive error of min{ε, (d logd/ε n)W(μ, ν)}. For the special case where every point in the support of μ and ν has a mass of 1/n (also called the Euclidean Bipartite Matching problem), we describe an algorithm to boost the accuracy of any additive approximation algorithm from ε to an expected additive error of min{ε, (d log log n)W(μ, ν)} in O(T (n, ε/d) log log n) time.
