Unikernels gained an increasing interest in the recent years because they provide efficient resource allocation and high performance for cloud services by bundling the application with a minimal set of OS services in a guest VM. Although a unikernel is by design small and lightweight, fleets of unikernels based on the same image are not necessarily more efficient than containers because the latter can rely upon OS primitives for sharing memory. Futhermore, porting POSIX applications on top of unikernels brings a new challenge: what does fork() mean in the world of unikernels where there is memory isolation within a VM? Lacking fork() support significantly reduces the applicability of unikernels in popular cloud applications. In this paper we address these shortcomings and show that cloning unikernels makes way to further improvements and enables full functionality of popular cloud applications, such as NGINX and Redis. Our solution, Nephele, extends the Xen virtualization platform and provides autoscaling capabilities to unikernel based VMs. Nephele provides 8x faster instantiation times and can run 3x more active unikernel VMs on the same hardware compared to booting separate unikernels.
