Text-conditioned image editing has recently attracted considerable interest. However, most methods are currently limited to one of the following: specific editing types (e.g., object overlay, style transfer), synthetically generated images, or requiring multiple input images of a common object. In this paper we demonstrate, for the very first time, the ability to apply complex (e.g., non-rigid) text-based semantic edits to a single real image. For example, we can change the posture and composition of one or multiple objects inside an image, while preserving its original characteristics. Our method can make a standing dog sit down, cause a bird to spread its wings, etc. â€“ each within its single high-resolution user-provided natural image. Contrary to previous work, our proposed method requires only a single input image and a target text (the desired edit). It operates on real images, and does not require any additional inputs (such as image masks or additional views of the object). Our method, called Imagic, leverages a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model for this task. It produces a text embedding that aligns with both the input image and the target text, while fine-tuning the diffusion model to capture the image-specific appearance. We demonstrate the quality and versatility of Imagic on numerous inputs from various domains, showcasing a plethora of high quality complex semantic image edits, all within a single unified framework. To better assess performance, we introduce TEdBench, a highly challenging image editing benchmark. We conduct a user study, whose findings show that human raters prefer Imagic to previous leading editing methods on TEdBench.
