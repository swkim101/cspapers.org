Modern DNN workloads increasingly rely on activation functions consisting of computationally complex operations. This poses a challenge to current accelerators optimized for convolutions and matrix-matrix multiplications. This work presents Flex-SFU, a lightweight hardware accelerator for activation functions implementing non-uniform piecewise interpolation supporting multiple data formats. Non-Uniform segments and floating-point numbers are enabled by implementing a binary-tree comparison within the address decoding unit. An SGD-based optimization algorithm with heuristics is proposed to find the interpolation function reducing the mean squared error. Thanks to non-uniform interpolation and floating-point support, Flex-SFU achieves on average 22.3x better mean squared error compared to previous piecewise linear interpolation approaches. The evaluation with more than 700 computer vision and natural language processing models shows that Flex-SFU can, on average, improve the end-to-end performance of state-of-the-art AI hardware accelerators by 35.7%, achieving up to 3.3x speedup with negligible impact in the modelsâ€™ accuracy when using 32 segments, and only introducing an area and power overhead of 5.9% and 0.8% relative to the baseline vector processing unit.
