Whisker-based tactile sensors have the potential to perform fast and accurate 3D mappings of the environment, complementing vision-based methods under conditions of glare, reflection, proximity, and occlusion. However, current algorithms for mapping with whiskers make assumptions about the conditions of contact, and these assumptions are not always valid and can cause significant sensing errors. Here we introduce a new whisker sensing system with a tapered, flexible whisker. The system provides inputs to two separate algorithms for estimating radial contact distance on a whisker. Using a Gradient-Moment (GM) algorithm, we correctly detect contact distance in most cases (within 4% of the whisker length). We introduce the Z-Dissimilarity score as a new metric that quantifies uncertainty in the radial contact distance estimate using both the GM algorithm and a Moment-Force (MF) algorithm that exploits the tapered whisker design. Combining the two algorithms ultimately results in contact distance estimates more robust than either algorithm alone.
