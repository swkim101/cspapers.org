Expressive text-to-speech aims to generate high-quality samples with rich and diverse prosody, which is hampered by dual challenges : 1) prosodic attributes in highly dynamic voices are difficult to capture and model without intonation; and 2) highly multimodal prosodic representations cannot be well learned by simple regression (e.g., MSE) objectives, which causes blurry and over-smoothing predictions. This paper proposes Prosody-TTS, a two-stage pipeline that enhances prosody modeling and sampling by introducing several components: 1) a self-supervised masked autoencoder to model the prosodic representation without relying on text transcriptions or local prosody attributes, which ensures to cover diverse speaking voices with superior generalization; and 2) a diffusion model to sample diverse prosodic patterns within the latent space, which prevents TTS models from generating samples with dull prosodic performance. Experimental results show that Prosody-TTS achieves new state-of-the-art in text-to-speech with natural and expressive synthesis. Both subjective and objective evaluation demonstrate that it exhibits superior audio quality and prosody naturalness with rich and diverse prosodic attributes. 1
