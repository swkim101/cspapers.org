In this paper, we address the task of cloze-style multiple choice question (MCQs) distractor generation. Our study is featured by the following designs. First, we propose to formulate the cloze distractor generation as a Text2Text task. Second, we propose pseudo Kullback-Leibler Divergence for regulating the generation to consider the item discrimination index in education evaluation. Third, we explore the candidate augmentation strategy and multi-tasking training with cloze-related tasks to further boost the generation performance. Through experiments with benchmarking datasets, our best perfom-ring model advances the state-of-the-art result from 10.81 to 22.00 (p@1 score).
