This work aims for transferring a Transformer-based image compression codec from human perception to machine perception without fine-tuning the codec. We propose a transferable Transformer-based image compression framework, termed TransTIC. Inspired by visual prompt tuning, TransTIC adopts an instance-specific prompt generator to inject instance-specific prompts to the encoder and task-specific prompts to the decoder. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method is capable of transferring the base codec to various machine tasks and outperforms the competing methods significantly. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt to utilize prompting on the low-level image compression task.
