Localization has achieved great attention in 5G networks, pushed by standardization. However, experimentation in 5G networks lacks the integration of network function modules designed for localization. We present our implementation of the 5G Localization Management Function. It complies with the 3GPP standard and OpenAirInterface, the most advanced framework that implements a full 5G-New Radio stack. We show that we are able to extend the functionality of OpenAirInterface, enabling location services. Finally, we demonstrate that the tool's performance satisfies the 5G Key Performance Indicators required by 3GPP for localization.
