Anticipating the future behavior of pedestrians is a crucial part of deploying Automated Driving Systems (ADS) in urban traffic scenarios. Most recent works utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract visual information, which is then input to a recurrent neural network (RNN) along with pedestrian-specific features like location and speed to obtain temporal features. However, the majority of these approaches lack the ability to parse the relationships of the related objects in the specific traffic scene, which leads to omitting the interactions between the pedestrians and the interactions between the pedestrians and the traffic. For this purpose, we propose a graph-structured model which can dig out pedestrians' dynamic constraints by constructing a traffic-aware scene graph within each frame. In addition, to capture pedestrian movement more effectively, we also introduce a temporal feature representation model, which first uses inter-frame and intra-frame GRU (II-GRU) to mine inter-frame information and intra-frame information together, and then employs a novel attention mechanism to adaptively generate attention weights. Extensive experiments on the JAAD and PIE datasets prove that our proposed model is effective in reaching and enhancing the state-of-the-art performance.
