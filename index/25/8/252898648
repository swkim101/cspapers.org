Open radio access network (O-RAN) introduces a new architecture with new components and interfaces, which suffers from numerous security challenges and risks. The C-Plane denial-of-service (DoS) attack is considered one of the security threats for O-RAN fronthaul interface (FHI) [6]. In this paper, we develop a software tool named 'C-Plane DoS Attacker' to conduct the C-Plane DoS attack for O-RAN FHI. The effectiveness of the proposed C-Plane DoS Attacker is verified on top of a DU-RU testbed developed based on the source code provided by the O-RAN Software Community (OSC).
