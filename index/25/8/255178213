In this study, seated walk, a movement of walking while sitting on a chair with casters, is realized on a musculoskeletal humanoid from human teaching. The body is balanced by using buttock-contact sensors implemented on the planar interskeletal structure of the human mimetic musculoskeletal robot. Also, we develop a constrained teaching method in which one-dimensional control command, its transition, and a transition condition are described for each state in advance, and a threshold value for each transition condition such as joint angles and foot contact sensor values is determined based on human teaching. Complex behaviors can be easily generated from simple inputs. In the musculoskeletal humanoid MusashiOLegs, forward, backward, and rotational movements of seated walk are realized.
