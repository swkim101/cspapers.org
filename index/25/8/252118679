We present DIY-IPS - Do It Yourself - Indoor Positioning System, an open-source real-time indoor positioning mobile application. DIY-IPS detects users' indoor position by employing dual-band RSSI fingerprinting of available WiFi access points. The app can be used, without additional infrastructural costs, to detect users' indoor positions in real time. We published our app as an open source to save other researchers time recreating it. The app enables researchers/users to (1) collect indoor positioning datasets with a ground truth label, (2) customize the app for higher accuracy or other research purposes (3) test the accuracy of modified methods by live testing with ground truth. We ran preliminary experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the app.
