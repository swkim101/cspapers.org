Conversational search and recommendation systems can ask clarifying questions through the conversation and collect valuable information from users. However, an important question remains: how can we extract relevant information from the user's utterances and use it in the retrieval or recommendation in the next turn of the conversation? Utilizing relevant information from users' utterances leads the system to better results at the end of the conversation. In this paper, we propose a model based on reinforcement learning, namely RelInCo, which takes the user's utterances and the context of the conversation and classifies each word in the user's utterances as belonging to the relevant or non-relevant class. RelInCo uses two Actors: 1) Arrangement-Actor, which finds the most relevant order of words in user's utterances, and 2) Selector-Actor, which determines which words, in the order provided by the arrangement Actor, can bring the system closer to the target of the conversation. In this way, we can find relevant information in the user's utterance and use it in the conversation. The objective function in our model is designed in such a way that it can maximize any desired retrieval and recommendation metrics (i.e., the ultimate
