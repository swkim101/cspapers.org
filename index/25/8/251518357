Business documents are central to the operation of all organizations, and they come in all shapes and sizes: project reports, planning documents, technical specifications, financial statements, meeting minutes, legal agreements, contracts, resumes, purchase orders, invoices, and many more. The ability to read, understand and interpret these documents, referred to here as Document Intelligence (DI), is challenging due to not only many domains of knowledge involved, but also their complex formats and structures, internal and external cross references deployed, and even less-than-ideal quality of scans and OCR oftentimes performed on them. This workshop aims to explore and advance the current state of research and practice in answering these challenges.
