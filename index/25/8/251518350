Network motif is a kind of frequently occurring subgraph that reflects local topology in graphs. Although network motif has been studied in graph analytics, e.g., social network and biological network, it is yet unclear whether network motif is useful for analyzing online transaction network that is generated in applications such as instant messaging and e-commerce. In this work, we analyze online transaction networks from the perspective of network motif. We define vertex features based on size-2 and size-3 motifs, and introduce motif-based centrality measurements. We further design motif-based vertex embedding that integrates weighted motif counts and centrality measurements. Afterward, we implement a distributed framework for motif detection in large-scale online transaction networks. To understand the effectiveness of motif for analyzing online transaction network, we study the statistical distribution of motifs in various kinds of graphs in Tencent and assess the benefit of motif-based embedding in a range of downstream graph analytical tasks. Empirical results show that our proposed method can efficiently find motifs in large-scale graphs, help interpretability, and benefit downstream tasks.
