We propose a novel Visible Light Positioning (VLP) method, called Iris, that uses light spectral information (LSI) to localize humans completely passively in the sense that it neither requires the user to carry any device, nor does it require any modifications to existing lighting infrastructure. Iris localizes a user based on the interference they produce on the LSI recorded at an array of spectral sensors embedded in the environment. We design a deep neural network that can effectively learn location fingerprints directly from the sensor LSI data and predict locations accurately under varying lighting conditions. We prototype Iris using a commercial-off-the-shelf light spectral sensor, AS7265x, which can measure light intensity over 18 different wavelength channels. We benchmark Iris against the state-of-the-art passive VLPs that rely on conventional photo-sensors capable of measuring only a single light intensity value aggregated over the entire visible spectrum. Our evaluations over two typical indoor environments, a 25 m2 one-bedroom apartment and a 13m Ã— 8m office space, demonstrate that Iris can significantly reduce both the localization errors and the number of required sensors, while increasing robustness against changes in environmental lighting.
