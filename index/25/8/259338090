Teleoperation of robots in space is challenging due to high latency and limited workspace visibility. Previously, the Interactive Planning and Supervised Execution (IPSE) and Augmented Virtuality systems were developed to reduce failure risk. These tools were visualized on a 3D da Vinci surgical console and operated using the da Vinci manipulators or visualized on conventional monitors and operated with a keyboard and mouse. Experimental studies indicated operator preference for the latter. In this work, we develop a 3D virtual reality (VR) interface for IPSE, implemented on a Meta Quest 2 head-mounted display (HMD), and evaluate it against the prior 2D, keyboard-and-mouse-based interface. The results demonstrate improved operator load with the 3D VR interface, with no decrease in task performance, while also providing cost and portability benefits compared to the conventional 2D interface.
