Wireless sensor networks, made so that objects and people can be found without devices, are an important part of our high-tech world. This poster aims to show how heterogeneous convolutional neural networks can be used to improve a radio tomographic imaging system that can find people indoors precisely. In addition to original algorithmic solutions, the system's advantages include using properly designed and integrated devices---radio probes---whose task is to emit Wi-Fi waves and measure the received signal strength. Thanks to the use of the two-stage approach, the sensitivity, resolution, and accuracy of imaging have increased. Furthermore, our solution works well for radio tomography and other types of tomography because it is easy to understand and can be used in many ways.
