Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications have the potential to dramatically increase the throughput of 5G-and-beyond wireless networks. However, the challenging propagation conditions typical of higher frequencies require expensive base station densification to guarantee reliable Radio Access Networks (RANs). Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB), a solution where wireless access and backhaul use the same waveform, spectrum, and protocol stack, has been proposed and standardized as a highly effective means of decreasing these costs. While IAB is considered a key enabler for high-frequency RANs, experimental research in this context is hampered by the lack of accessible testing platforms. In this demonstration, we showcase IABEST, a large-scale end-to-end IAB testbed based on open-source software and compatible with off-the-shelf hardware. We show how to deploy IABEST capabilities at scale on Colosseum, a publicly available massive channel emulator. Finally, we show how IABEST can support researchers in data collection and algorithm testing from the highest levels of network abstraction down to scheduling decisions.
