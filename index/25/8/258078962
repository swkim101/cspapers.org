Developing robotic technologies for use in human society requires ensuring the safety of robots' navigation behaviors while adhering to pedestrians' expectations and social norms. However, understanding complex human-robot interactions (HRI) to infer potential cooperation and response among robots and pedestrians for cooperative collision avoid-ance is challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel socially-aware navigation benchmark called NaviS Tar, which utilizes a hybrid Spatio- Temporal grAph tRansformer to understand interactions in human-rich environments fusing crowd multi-modal dynamic features. We leverage an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm with preference learning to train a policy and a reward function network with supervi-sor guidance. Additionally, we design a social score function to evaluate the overall performance of social navigation. To compare, we train and test our algorithm with other state-of-the-art methods in both simulator and real-world scenarios independently. Our results show that NaviSTAR outperforms previous methods with outstanding performance11The source code and experiment videos of this work are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/san-navistar
