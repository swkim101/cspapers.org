 Self-Piercing Riveting (SPR) is one of the most commonly used methods for joining dissimilar materials in the automotive industry. These joints are popular due to their adaptability, high performance and short cycle time. However, since these joints involve two dissimilar materials, they are susceptible to galvanic corrosion in the presence of an electrolyte which is driven by the difference in the equilibrium potential of the metals. This can affect the safety and resilience of these joints. In this paper, we focus on galvanic corrosion in Al-Fe SPR joints. A Machine learning (ML) based surrogate model, which is based off of FE simulations, for statistical corrosion analysis is developed. This model enables the resilience and reliability analysis of SPR joints under corrosion environment. In this study, first a physics-based finite element (FE) corrosion model has been developed to simulate the galvanic corrosion between a Fe cathode and an Al anode of a SPR joint. This model takes into account the effect of the crystal microstructure of the Al anode and the precipitation of the corrosion product. Several geometric and environmental factors including crevice gap, roughness of anode, conductivity, pH and the temperature of the electrolyte that effect corrosion are investigated. A thorough Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) analysis is conducted for the overall corrosion behavior of the Fe-Al SPR joints using a novelistic Probabilistic Confidence-Based Adaptive Sampling (PCAS) technique. PCAS is used to train the surrogate model by identifying the critical sampling points and thus reducing the overall computational costs. It is found that the electrolyte temperature has the largest effects on the material loss and needs to be managed closely for better corrosion control. By understanding the corrosion performance and resultant uncertainty impact on SPR joints, the reliability and resilience of these joints can be improved.
