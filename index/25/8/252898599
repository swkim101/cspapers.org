In general, GPS receivers cannot be used for indoor settings and multizone infrastructure needs to be configured to create secure zones. Since a user may have different working roles in different zones, therefore, we are proposing here a solution for fixed IT infrastructure using IoT devices, sensors, and IoT cloud services to create a technology-agnostic secure zone in home/business/industry where sensing of natural parameters like location, temperature, pressure, light, images, sound, etc. are used to create a unique hash of a zone. AWS IoT greengrass core device coordinates with all IoT devices/sensors and creates the hash of a zone. MAC address is hashed using zone hash and a unique token for the PC is generated. All PC tokens are mapped with zone ID into the IT system deployed in the cloud and AWS IoT greengrass core device deployed in home/business/industry. This token and biometric a user needs to share during login to decide allowed roles for a user in that zone.
