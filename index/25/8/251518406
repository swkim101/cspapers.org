Pick-up and delivery (P&D) services such as food delivery have achieved explosive growth in recent years by providing customers with daily-life convenience. Though many service providers have invested considerably in routing tools, more and more practitioners realize that significant deviations exist between workers' actual routes and planned ones. So it is not wise to feed "optimal routes" as workers' actual service routes into downstream tasks (e.g., arrival-time prediction and order dispatching), whose performances count on the accuracy of route prediction, i.e., to predict the future service route of a worker's unfinished tasks. Therefore, to meet the rising calling for route prediction models that can capture workers' future routing behaviors, in this paper, we formulate the Pick-up and Delivery Route Prediction task (PDRP task for short) from the graph perspective for the first time, then propose a dynamic spatial-temporal graph-based model, named Graph2Route. Unlike previous sequence-based models, our model leverages the underlying graph structure and features into the encoding and decoding process. Moreover, the dynamic graph-based nature can spontaneously describe the evolving relationship between different problem instances. As a result, abundant decision context information and various spatial-temporal information of node/edge can be fully utilized in Graph2Route to improve the prediction performance. Offline experiments over two real-world industry-scale datasets under different P&D services (i.e., food delivery and package pick-up) and online A/B test demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.
