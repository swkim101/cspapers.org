The large-scale vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are defined based on the classical VRPs with thousands of customers. It is an important optimization problem in modern logistic systems, since efficiently obtaining high-quality solutions can greatly reduce operation expenses as well as improve customer satisfaction. Most existing algorithms, including traditional non-learning heuristics and learning-based methods, only perform well on small-scale instances with usually no more than hundreds of customers. In this paper we present a novel Rewriting-by-Generating (RBG) framework which solves large-scale VRPs hierarchically. RBG consists of a rewriter agent that refines the customer division globally and an elementary generator to infer regional solutions locally. It is also flexible with multiple CVRP variant problems and could be continuously evolved with more up-to-date generator designs. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RBG framework. It outperforms HGS, one of the best heuristic method for CVRPs and also shortens the inference time. Online evaluation is also conducted on a deployed express platform in Guangdong, China, where RBG shows advantages to other alternative built-in algorithms.
