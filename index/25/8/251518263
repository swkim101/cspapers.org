Neural network capability in symbolic computation has emerged in much recent work. However, symbolic computation is always treated as an end-to-end blackbox prediction task, where human-like symbolic deductive logic is missing. In this paper, we argue that any complex symbolic computation can be broken down to a sequence of finite Fundamental Computation Transformations (FCT), which are grounded as certain mathematical expression computation transformations. The entire computation sequence represents a full human understandable symbolic deduction process. Instead of studying on different end-to-end neural network applications, this paper focuses on approximating FCT which further build up symbolic deductive logic. To better mimic symbolic computations with math expression transformations, we propose a novel tree representation learning architecture GATE (Graph Aggregation Transformer Encoder) for math expressions. We generate a large-scale math expression transformation dataset for training purpose and collect a real-world dataset for validation. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of producing step-by-step human-like symbolic deduction sequences with the proposed approach, which outperforms other neural network approaches and heuristic approaches.
