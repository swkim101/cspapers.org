While people’s perceptions of targeted ads have been studied extensively from a Western perspective (e.g., North America, Europe), we know little about users’ perceptions in the South Asian region. We interviewed 40 participants from two South Asian countries, Bangladesh and India, to explore their perceptions and practices regarding targeted ads on social media platforms. Participants identified emerging ad types, such as influencer-based ads and soft ads, through articles. In addition, participants often outweighed discounts over product quality when viewing ads. We also observed novel user mental models of targeted ads based on mobile app permissions and excessive AI usage. Participants often preferred ad control over transparency. While most participants rarely used ad settings, some controlled ads by changing mobile app permissions or muting ads on social media platforms. Participants also raised concerns about fraudulent targeted ads and privacy violations due to device sharing. We present potential design ideas to mitigate these concerns.
