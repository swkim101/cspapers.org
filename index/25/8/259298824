Despite evidence from sociolinguistics that larger groups of speakers tend to 1 develop more structured languages, the use of populations has failed to yield 2 significant benefits in emergent multi-agent communication. In this paper we 3 reassess the validity of the standard training protocol and illustrate its limitations. 4 Specifically, we analyze population-level communication at the equilibrium in 5 sender-receiver Lewis games. We find that receivers co-adapt to senders they 6 are interacting with, which limits the effect of the population. Informed by this 7 analysis, we propose an alternative training protocol based on “partitioning” agents. 8 Partitioning isolates sender-receiver pairs, limits co-adaptation, and results in a new 9 global optimization objective where agents maximize (1) their respective "internal" 10 communication accuracy and (2) their alignment with other agents. In experiments, 11 we find that agents trained in partitioned populations are able to communicate 12 successfully with new agents which they have never interacted with and tend to 13 develop a shared language. Moreover, we observe that larger populations develop 14 languages that are more compositional. Our findings suggest that scaling up to 15 populations in multi-agent communication can be beneficial, but that it matters 16 how we scale up. 17
