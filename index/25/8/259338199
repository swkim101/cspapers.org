This paper presents a novel device that can be used to perform kinesthetic corrective feedback for robotic systems. KRIS (Kinesthetic Robotic Interaction System) is a device that can be mounted on the end-effector of an articulated robot. From here it can be manipulated by a human to give corrective feedback to the robot system during execution and in an intuitive way. The device can provide feedback in six degrees of freedom while giving passive haptic feedback to the user about both the position, rotation, and movement of the robot. We evaluated KRIS in a user study with respect to a baseline based on keyboard feedback in the areas of usability, intuitiveness, accuracy of corrections, and user task load. KRIS outperformed our baseline on the first three metrics and performed similar on task load. We believe that KRIS can enable a wide variety of robots to be taught interactively by non-expert humans in diverse collaborative settings.
