The Ph.D research project aims to explore the potential of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization paradigm in conjunction with classic software architectures for Artificial Intelligence applications. The intended goal is to investigate and formalize a possible integration path between Multi-agent System architectures and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. Starting from the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents standards, we will extend basic primitives to integrate Multi-agent Systems on Distributed Ledger Technology networks. Possible deployment of services and applications in the Internet-of-Things, Artificial Intelligence and Distributed Machine Learning areas will be tested. Application of Data Analysis techniques on datasets built on such a framework will be also addressed.
