Vulnerabilities pose a significant challenge in ensuring cyberse-security for information systems. In the past, vulnerabilities were mainly associated with functional defects in system software and hardware, known as "in-band vulnerabilities," whereby "band" refers to the functional domain. However, with the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), new security issues have emerged that traditional vulnerability categorization may not fully cover. IoT devices rely on sensors and actuators to interact with the real world, but this interaction process between physical and digital systems has created defects that are difficult to analyze and detect. These defects include unintentional coupling effects of sensors from ambient analog signals or abnormal channels that were not intentionally designed, collectively known as "out-of-band vulnerabilities." Various security incidents have highlighted the prevalence of out-of-band vulnerabilities in IoT systems, and their activation can result in serious consequences. To address this issue, we propose a vulnerability categorization framework that includes out-of-band vulnerabilities and provides examples for each category. Our talk highlights the need to shift the research paradigm for system security to encompass both in-band and out-of-band vulnerabilities in the intelligence era. Finally, we explore potential solutions for mitigating out-of-band vulnerabilities and securing IoT devices.
