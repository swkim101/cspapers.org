TinyML: Tiny in size, big in impact! This paper presents TinyML-CAM pipeline for real-time and memory-efficient image recognition on IoT boards. TinyML-CAM can be used by developers to implement their customized tasks in â‰ˆ 30 minutes, with minimal code configuration. We evaluated TinyML-CAM by using it to create a RandomForestClassifier (RF) based real-time image recognition system, which ran at 80 FPS and consumed only 1 kB of RAM on ESP32.
