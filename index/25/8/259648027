In the case where an interstitial atom is located in a close-packed atomic row of the crystal lattice, it is called a crowdion. Crowdions play an important role in the processes of mass and energy transfer resulting from irradiation, severe plastic deformation, ion implantation, plasma and laser processing, etc. In this work, supersonic N-crowdions (N=1,Â 2) in fcc lattices of lead and nickel are studied by the method of molecular dynamics. Modeling shows that the propagation distance of a supersonic 2-crowdion in lead at a high initial velocity is less than that of a supersonic 1-crowdion. In other fcc metals studied, including nickel, supersonic 2-crowdions have a longer propagation distance than 1-crowdions. The relatively short propagation distance of supersonic 2-crowdions in lead is due to their instability and rapid transformation into supersonic 1-crowdions. This feature of the dynamics of supersonic N-crowdions in lead explains its high radiation-shielding properties.
