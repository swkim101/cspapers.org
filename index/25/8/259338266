Safety is paramount for robots used in environments they share with humans. In such scenarios, security is also growing in importance. However, conventional approaches to analysing safety requirements are aimed at identifying hazards only. Security-related aspects such as cyber threats, cyber attacks and vulnerabilities have hardly been integrated into analysis and design methods to date. The methods available so far for the joint analysis of safety and security are based on established methods of safety engineering, where the amount of information is very large and usually stored in text- and table-based documents. This makes it challenging for engineers to systematically assess and maintain safety and security information. Thus, adequate tool support for robot engineers is required to cope with the increased complexity and to manage the safety and security risks. In this paper, we demonstrate that robot's safety and security information can be expressed, stored, analysed and queried in a knowledge graph representation paving the way to automated analysis. More specifically, we apply an integrated, systems-oriented safety and security co-analysis approach, namely STPA-Safesec, to a robot performing disinfection tasks in domestic environments. By querying the resulting graph of safety and security artefacts, we automatically retrieve hazardous scenarios, identify gaps in the analysis and increase our understanding of the overall risks of the robot.
