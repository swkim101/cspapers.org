Large-scale shape-changing interfaces (SCIs) such as shape-changing walls offer opportunities for enhancing user experiences within buildings, e.g., for navigation. However, due to the embryonic nature of SCI technologies, designing and explaining the shape features that are beneficial to users is challenging. Previous work used virtual platforms (2D video or Projected Augmented Reality) to design SCI. This paper explores how Virtual Reality (VR) can provide an immersive experience that can help in designing large-scale SCI. We follow a co-design approach in which we use VR to obtain usersâ€™ impressions of shape-changing walls. Then, we conduct co-design sessions to understand how shape-changing walls can be designed to become ambient and blend with the environment. We report our results to guide the design of shape-changing walls as well as discuss how our approach can provide valuable insights into how a VR experience, prior to design, and can help in the design process.
