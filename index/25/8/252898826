Besides the communication function, various RF signals such as WiFi and RFID have been actively exploited for sensing purposes recently. However, a missing component of existing RF sensing is sensing under device motions. This paper takes the first step to involve device mobility into the ecosystem of RF sensing. Owning to the miniaturization and low cost of ultra-wideband (UWB) chips in recent years, we propose to integrate the accuracy of UWB sensing with device mobility to support truly ubiquitous RF sensing. This is a challenging task because the motion artifacts from RF devices can easily overwhelm the target motion, such as subtle chest displacement for respiration sensing. In this demo, we propose Mobi2Sense to support sensing under device motions. We propose novel signal processing schemes to remove the effect of device motions on sensing and prototype Mobi2Sense using a commodity UWB module. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that Mobi2Sense is able to "hear" music and "see" human respiration at high accuracy in the presence of device motions.
