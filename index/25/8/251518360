The goal of the 21th International Workshop on Data Mining in Bioinformatics (BIOKDD 2022) is to encourage KDD researchers to solve the numerous problems and challenges in Bioinformatics using Data Mining technologies. Based on the organizers' expertise and communities, BIOKDD 2022 features 2 closely related themes "Biomedical Ontologies" and "Biological Data Visualization". These themes encourage the knowledge graph community and the data visualization community to work together to solve the many challenging problems in Bioinformatics with new perspectives. The key goal is to accelerate the convergence between Data Mining and Bioinformatics communities to expedite discoveries in basic biology, medicine and healthcare.
