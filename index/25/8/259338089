Physical Human-Robot Interaction(pHRI) re-quires taking safety into account from the design board to the collaborative operation of any robot. For collaborative robotic environments, where human and machine are sharing space and interacting physically, the analysis and quantification of impacts becomes very relevant and necessary. Furthermore, analyses of this kind are a valuable source of information for the design of safer, more efficient pHRI. In the definition of the first parameter for dynamic impact analysis, the dynamic impact mitigation capacity was considered for certain configurations of the robot, but the design characteristics of the robot, such as the inertia of actuators, were not included. This paradigm changed when MIT presented the “impact mitigation factor” (IMF) with which, in addition to considering the ability of a certain robot to mitigate impacts for every configuration, it was possible to quantify backdriveability by taking the inertia of actuators into account for the calculation of the factor. However, IMF was proposed as a method to analyse floating robots like. This paper presents the Generalised Impact Absorption Factor (GIAF), suitable for both floating and fixed-base robots. GIAF is a valuable design parameter, as it provides information about the backdriveability of each joint, while allowing the comparison of impact response between floating and fixed-base robotic platforms. In this work, the mathematical definition of GIAF is developed and examples of possible uses of GIAF are presented.
