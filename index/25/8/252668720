This paper develops a novel slip estimator using the invariant observer design theory and Disturbance Observer (DOB). The proposed state estimator for mobile robots is fully proprioceptive and combines data from an inertial measurement unit and body velocity within a Right Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (RI-EKF). By embedding the slip velocity into SE3 (3) matrix Lie group, the developed DOB-based RI-EKF provides real-time velocity and slip velocity estimates on different terrains. Experimental results using a Husky wheeled robot confirm the mathematical derivations and effectiveness of the proposed method in estimating the observable state variables. Open-source software is available for download and reproducing the presented results.
