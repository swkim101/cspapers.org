We consider the problem of balancing the load among servers in dense racks for microsecond-scale workloads. To balance the load in such settings, tens of millions of scheduling decisions have to be made per second. Achieving this throughput while providing microsecond-scale latency is extremely challenging. To address this challenge, we design a fully decentralized load-balancing framework, which allows servers to collectively balance the load in the system. We model the interactions among servers as a cooperative stochastic game. To find the game's parametric Nash equilibrium, we design and implement a decentralized algorithm based on multi-agent-learning theory. We empirically show that our proposed algorithm is adaptive and scalable while outperforming state-of-the art alternatives.
