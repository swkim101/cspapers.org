In the recent years, the deep reinforcement learning community has achieved impressive success to tackle real-world challenges. In this work, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning agent to perform floorplanning, one of the early stages of VLSI physical design. Traditional methods to solve floorplanning problem are intractable for large circuit netlists and impossible to learn from past experience. We adopt the domain knowledge of floorplanning representation and propose a learning-based method that directly predicts block id and location through an RL framework. The resulting solutions are platform-independent and can be converted into layout within $O(n)$ time. We encode the hypernet information in the circuit netlist in a one-to-one mapping through hypergraph neural networks. Furthermore, We deploy transformer-like action selection to allow for transferability and generalization across netlist circuits with different sizes and handle the large discrete action space. This allows the parameter space of our model to remain the same regardless of the number of blocks. Our RL agent is able to transfer previously learnt knowledge to quickly optimize a new design with different size and purpose. To our knowledge, this is the first work to select both id and block position with an entirely end-to-end learning-based framework that can generalize. Results on publicly available benchmarks of GSRC and MCNC demonstrate that our method can outperform the baselines while being able to generalize.
