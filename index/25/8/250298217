Spatiotemporal modeling in an unified architecture is key for video action recognition. This paper proposes a Shrinking Temporal Attention Transformer (STAT), which efficiently builts spatiotemporal attention maps considering the attenuation of spatial attention in short and long temporal sequences. Specifically, for short-term temporal tokens, query token interacts with them in a fine-grained manner in dealing with short-range motion. It then shrinks to a coarse attention in neighborhood for long-term tokens, to provide larger receptive field for long-range spatial aggregation. Both of them are composed in a short-long temporal integrated block to build visual appearances and temporal structure concurrently with lower costly in computation. We conduct thorough ablation studies, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple action recognition benchmarks including Kinetics400 and Something-Something v2, outperforming prior methods with 50% less FLOPs and without any pretrained model.
