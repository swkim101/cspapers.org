Heterogeneous teams of multiple mobile robots will be important for future scientific explorations of extraterrestrial surfaces or hazardous areas. Mission operation in such harsh, unknown environments poses diverse challenges. Robots need to cooperate autonomously due to the large network latency to the ground station while operators need to adapt the ongoing mission flexibly based on new discoveries obtained during execution. Furthermore, shared situational awareness between operators and roboticists is highly required to deal with execution failures promptly. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes the high-level mission operation framework ROSMC. The concept of mission synchronization to robots enables continuous mission adaptations and future planning by operators while robots execute the mission autonomously. The ROS-based GUIs enable operators to intuitively create and monitor the mission for robots as well as to communicate with roboticists smoothly. The proposed framework was evaluated by a pilot study with a simulator and demonstrated at a Moon-analogue field on Mt. Etna in Sicily, Italy, involving 3 robots and around 70 researchers for 4 weeks.
