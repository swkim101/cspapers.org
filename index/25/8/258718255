The group isomorphism problem determines whether two groups, given by their Cayley tables, are isomorphic. For groups with order n, an algorithm with n(logn + O(1)) running time, attributed to Tarjan, was proposed in the 1970s (Miller, STOC 1978). Despite the extensive study over the past decades, the current best group isomorphism algorithm has an n(1 / 4 + o(1))logn running time (Rosenbaum 2013). The isomorphism testing for p-groups of (nilpotent) class 2 and exponent p has been identified as a major barrier to obtaining an no(logn) time algorithm for the group isomorphism problem. Although the p-groups of class 2 and exponent p have much simpler algebraic structures than general groups, the best-known isomorphism testing algorithm for this group class also has an nO(logn) running time. In this paper, we present an isomorphism testing algorithm for p-groups of class 2 and exponent p with running time nO((logn)5/6) for any prime p > 2. Our result is based on a novel reduction to the skew-symmetric matrix tuple isometry problem (Ivanyos and Qiao, SIAM J. Computing, 2019). To obtain the reduction, we develop several tools for matrix space analysis, including a matrix space individualization-refinement method and a characterization of the low rank matrix spaces.
