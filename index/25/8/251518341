Heterogeneous graph streams are very common in the applications today. Although representation learning has advantages in prediction accuracy, it is inherently deficient in the abilities to interpret or to reason well. It has long been realized as far back as in 1990 by Marvin Minsky that connectionist networks and symbolic rules should co-exist in a system and overcome the deficiencies of each other. The goal of this paper is to show that it is feasible to simultaneously and efficiently perform representation learning (for connectionist networks) and rule learning spontaneously out of the same online training process for graph streams. We devise such a system called RL$^2$, and show, both analytically and empirically, that it is highly efficient and responsive for graph streams, and produces good results for both representation learning and rule learning in terms of prediction accuracy and returning top-quality rules for interpretation and building dynamic Bayesian networks.
