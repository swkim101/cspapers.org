ANSYS finite element model of the compressor pipeline system was developed to investigate the dynamic behavior of the pipe and define the places of high vibration. ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) was used for modeling. The calculation results of the model allow us to define high vibration areas and sound pressure level of the pipeline. In order to reduce high vibroacoustic parameters the vibration dampers were installed in the places with highest vibration amplitude. The model of vibration damper was included in the model of pipeline system. The calculation re-sults of the vibration and pulsation of pipeline system with and without dampers were demon-strated effectiveness of the dampers.
