Jumping motion is an effective way to overcome large obstacles, especially for the miniature robots. However, controlling of the jumping trajectory on a centimeter scale robot is not easy due to the limitation of size and payload. None of the jumping robots lighter than 90 g achieved the feedback control of their jumping height and take-off angle independently. In this work, we proposed a miniature 6 g jumping robot that ensured the feedback control of jumping trajectory. Two simple PD controllers were used in take-off angle and jumping height control, respectively. The robot can control its jumping height from 0 to 73cm, take-off angle from −20° to +20° with respect to the vertical direction. The control errors of the jumping height and the take-off angle were less than 5 cm and 2°, respectively. The robot can hop upon different obstacles exactly, greatly increased the controllability of the micro jumping robot.
