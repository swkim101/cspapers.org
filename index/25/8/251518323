An average consumer spends 8+ hours a day across all devices interacting with online content almost entirely sponsored by advertisements. At over $450B global market size in 2022 and expected to pass $1T by 2027, online advertising has already surpassed traditional ads in global spend. Moreover, computational advertising in particular is perhaps the most visible and ubiquitous application of machine learning and one that interacts directly with consumers. When done right, ads help us enrich our lives and creep us out when done badly. Looking at the published literature over the last few years, many researchers might consider computational advertising as a mature field. Yet, the opposite is true. The field is evolving, however, from ads controlled by monolithic publishers and randomly rotating banner ads to highly personalized content experiences in news feeds on mobile devices and even on TV-all utilizing data amassed from petabytes of stored user data. Ads are far from done.
