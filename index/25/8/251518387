Recently, the research of dialogue systems has been widely concerned, especially task-oriented dialogue systems, which have received increased attention due to their wide application prospect. As a core component, dialogue state tracking (DST) plays a key role in task-oriented dialogue systems, and its function is to parse natural language dialogues into dialogue state formed by slot-value pairs. It is well known that dialogue state tracking has been well studied and explored on current benchmark datasets such as the MultiWOZ. However, almost all current research completely ignores the user negative feedback utterances that exist in real-life conversations when a system error occurs, which often contains user-provided corrective information for the system error. Obviously, user negative feedback utterances can be used to correct the inevitable errors in automatic speech recognition and model generalization. Thus, in this paper, we will explore the role of negative feedback utterances in dialogue state tracking in detail through simulated negative feedback utterances. Specifically, due to the lack of dataset involving negative feedback utterances, first, we have to define the schema of user negative feedback utterances and propose a joint modeling method for feedback utterance generation and filtering. Then, we explore three aspects of interaction mechanism that should be considered in real-life conversations involving negative feedback utterances and propose evaluation metrics related to negative feedback utterances. Finally, on WOZ2.0 and MultiWOZ2.1 datasets, by constructing simulated negative feedback utterances in training and testing, we not only verify the important role of negative feedback utterances in dialogue state tracking, but also analyze the advantages and disadvantages of different interaction mechanisms involving negative feedback utterances, lighting future research on negative feedback utterances.
