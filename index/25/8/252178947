Modern data center applications experience frequent branch mispredictions– degrading performance, increasing cost, and reducing energy efficiency in data centers. Even the state-of the-art branch predictor, TAGE-SC-L, suffers from an average branch Mispredictions Per Kilo Instructions (branch-MPKI) of 3.0 (0.5-7.2) for these applications since their large code footprints exhaust TAGE-SC-L’s intended capacity. In this work, we propose Whisper, a novel profile-guided mechanism to avoid branch mispredictions. Whisper investigates the in-production profile of data center applications to identify precise program contexts that lead to branch mispredictions. Corresponding prediction hints are then inserted into code to strategically avoid those mispredictions during program execution. Whisper presents three novel profile-guided techniques: (1) hashed history correlation which efficiently encodes hard-to-predict correlations in branch history using lightweight Boolean formulas, (2) randomized formula testing which selects a locally-optimal Boolean formula from a randomly selected subset of possible formulas to predict a branch, and (3) the extension of Read-Once Monotone Boolean Formulas with Implication and Converse Non-Implication to improve the branch history coverage of these formulas with minimal overhead. We evaluate Whisper on 12 widely-used data center applications and demonstrate that Whisper enables traditional branch predictors to achieve a speedup close to that of an ideal branch predictor. Specifically, Whisper achieves an average speedup of 2.8% (0.4%-4.6%) by reducing 16.8% (1.7%-32.4%) of branch mispredictions over TAGE-SC-L and outperforms the state-of the-art profile-guided branch prediction mechanisms by 7.9% on average.
