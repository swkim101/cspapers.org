This work establishes rigorous, novel and widely applicable stability guarantees and transferability bounds for graph convolutional networks -- without reference to any underlying limit object or statistical distribution. Crucially, utilized graph-shift operators (GSOs) are not necessarily assumed to be normal, allowing for the treatment of networks on both undirected- and for the first time also directed graphs. Stability to node-level perturbations is related to an 'adequate (spectral) covering' property of the filters in each layer. Stability to edge-level perturbations is related to Lipschitz constants and newly introduced semi-norms of filters. Results on stability to topological perturbations are obtained through recently developed mathematical-physics based tools. As an important and novel example, it is showcased that graph convolutional networks are stable under graph-coarse-graining procedures (replacing strongly-connected sub-graphs by single nodes) precisely if the GSO is the graph Laplacian and filters are regular at infinity. These new theoretical results are supported by corresponding numerical investigations.
