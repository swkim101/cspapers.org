The paper introduces DiSProD, an online planner developed for

environments with probabilistic transitions in continuous state and

action spaces. DiSProD builds a symbolic graph that captures the

distribution of future trajectories, conditioned on a given policy,

using independence assumptions and approximate propagation of

distributions. The symbolic graph provides a differentiable

representation of the policy's value, enabling efficient gradient-based

optimization for long-horizon search. The propagation of approximate

distributions can be seen as an aggregation of many trajectories, making

it well-suited for dealing with sparse rewards and stochastic

environments. An extensive experimental evaluation compares DiSProD to

state-of-the-art planners in discrete-time planning and real-time

control of robotic systems. The proposed method improves over existing

planners in handling stochastic environments, sensitivity to search

depth, sparsity of rewards, and large action spaces. Additional

real-world experiments demonstrate that DiSProD can control ground

vehicles and surface vessels to successfully navigate around obstacles.
