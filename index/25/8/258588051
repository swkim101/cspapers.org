Motion deblurring is a critical ill-posed problem that is important in many vision-based robotics applications. The recently proposed event-based double integral (EDI) provides a theoretical framework for solving the deblurring prob-lem with the event camera and generating clear images at high frame-rate. However, the original EDI is mainly designed for offline computation and does not support real-time requirement in many robotics applications. In this paper, we propose the fast EDI, an efficient implementation of EDI that can achieve real-time online computation on single-core CPU devices, which is common for physical robotic platforms used in practice. In experiments, our method can handle event rates at as high as 13 million event per second in a wide variety of challenging lighting conditions. We demonstrate the benefit on multiple downstream real-time applications, including localization, vi-sual tag detection, and feature matching.
