Graph representation learning has been extensively studied, and recent models can well incorporate both node features and graph structures. Despite these progress, the inherent scalability challenge for classical computers of processing graph data and solving the downstream tasks (many are NP-hard) is still a bottleneck for existing classical graph learning models. On the other hand, quantum computing is known a promising direction for its theoretically verified scalability as well as the increasing evidence for the access to physical quantum machine in near-term. Different from many existing classical-quantum hybrid machine learning models on graphs, in this paper we take a more aggressive initiative for developing a native quantum paradigm for (attributed) graph representation learning, which to our best knowledge, has not been fulfilled in literature yet. Specifically, our model adopts the well-established theory and technique in quantum computing e.g. quantum random walk, and adapt it to the attributed graph. Then the node attribute quantum state sequence is fed into a quantum recurrent network to obtain the final node embedding. Experimental results on three public datasets show the effectiveness of our quantum model which also outperforms a classical learning approach GraphRNA notably in terms of efficiency even on a classical computer. Though it is still restricted to the classical loss-based learning paradigm with gradient descent for model parameter training, while our computing scheme is compatible with quantum computing without involving classical computers. This is in fact largely in contrast to many hybrid quantum graph learning models which often involve many steps and modules having to be performed on classical computers.
