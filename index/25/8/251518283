In streaming media applications, like music Apps, songs are recommended in a continuous way in users' daily life. The recommended songs are played automatically although users may not pay any attention to them, posing a challenge of user attention bias in training recommendation models, i.e., the training instances contain a large number of false-positive labels (users' feedback). Existing approaches either directly use the auto-feedbacks or heuristically delete the potential false-positive labels. Both of the approaches lead to biased results because the false-positive labels cause the shift of training data distribution, hurting the accuracy of the recommendation models. In this paper, we propose a learning-based counterfactual approach to adjusting the user auto-feedbacks and learning the recommendation models using Neural Dueling Bandit algorithm, called NDB. Specifically, NDB maintains two neural networks: a user attention network for computing the importance weights that are used for modifying the original rewards, and another random network trained with dueling bandit for conducting online recommendations based on the modified rewards. Theoretical analysis showed that the modified rewards are statistically unbiased, and the learned bandit policy enjoys a sub-linear regret bound. Experimental results demonstrated that NDB can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.
