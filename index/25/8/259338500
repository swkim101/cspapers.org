Nowadays ubiquitous robots must be adaptive and easy to use. To this end, dynamical system-based imitation learning plays an important role. In fact, it allows to realize stable and complex robotic tasks without explicitly coding them, thus facilitating the robot use. However, the adaptation capabilities of dynamical systems have not been fully exploited due to the lack of closed-loop implementations making use of visual feedback. In this regard, the integration of visual information allows higher flexibility to cope with environmental changes. This work presents a dynamical system-based imitation learning for visual servoing, based on the large projection task priority formulation. The proposed scheme enables complex and stable visual tasks, as demonstrated by a simulation analysis and experiments with a robotic manipulator.
