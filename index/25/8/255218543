Polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) are a group of nanocarriers employed in a wide range of applications. Characterization is a fundamental step in PNPs formulation and many basic techniques are available to provide chemical-physical information such as dimensions, surface potential, stability and solubility. Recently, these techniques have been implemented with more innovative ones to obtain more precise knowledge of the nanomaterials. In this review we analyzed the state of the art in the field of polymeric nanoparticles produced by Italian laboratories. We described all methods available for PNPs characterization with their applications as drug delivery systems. We also reported the different types of molecules that were recently used for PNPs functionalization, a fundamental step in delivering drugs specifically to their targets and then resulting in reduced side effects in patients.
