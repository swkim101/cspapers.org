Recent advances in robotic mapping enable robots to use both semantic and geometric understanding of their surroundings to perform complex tasks. Current methods are optimized for reconstruction quality, but they do not provide a measure of how certain they are of their outputs. Therefore, algorithms that use these maps do not have a way of assessing how much they can trust the outputs. We present a mapping approach that unifies semantic information and shape completion inferred from RGBD images and computes confidence scores for its predictions. We use a Gaussian Process (GP) classification model to merge confidence scores (if available) for the given information. A novel aspect of our method is that we lift the measurement to a learned metric space over which the GP parameters are learned. After training, we can evaluate the uncertainty of objects' completed shapes with their semantic information. We show that our approach can achieve more accurate predictions than a classic GP model and provide robots with the flexibility to decide whether they can trust the estimate at a given location using the confidence scores.
