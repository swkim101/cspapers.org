Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in regression and classiﬁcation problems applied to text, in areas such as sentiment analysis and medical decision-making processes. We propose a novel form for node attributes within a GNN based model that captures node-speciﬁc embeddings for every word in the vocabulary. This provides a global representation at each node, coupled with node-level updates according to associations among words in a transcript. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the approach by augmenting the accuracy of measuring major depressive disorder (MDD). Prior research has sought to make a diagnostic prediction of depression levels from patient data using several modalities, including audio, video, and text. On the DAIC-WOZ benchmark, our method outperforms state-of-art methods by a substantial margin, including those using multiple modalities. Moreover, we also evaluate the performance of our novel model on a Twitter sentiment dataset. We show that our model outperforms a general GNN model by leveraging our novel 2-D node attributes. These results demonstrate the generality of the proposed method.
