Due to the powerful capability to gather the information of neighborhood nodes, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has become a widely explored hotspot in recent years. As a well-established extension, Graph AutoEncoder (GAE) succeeds in mining underlying node representations via evaluating the quality of adjacency matrix reconstruction from learned features. However, limited works on GAE were devoted to leveraging both semantic and topological graphs, and they only indirectly extracted the relationships between graphs via weights shared by features. To better capture the connections between nodes from these two types of graphs, this paper proposes a graph neural network dubbed Dual Low-Rank Graph AutoEncoder (DLR-GAE), which takes both semantic and topological homophily into consideration. Differing from prior works that share common weights between GCNs, the presented DLR-GAE conducts sustained exploration of low-rank information between two distinct graphs, and reconstructs adjacency matrices from learned latent factors and embeddings. In order to obtain valid adjacency matrices that meet certain conditions, we design some surrogates and projections to restrict the learned factor matrix. We compare the proposed model with state-of-the-art methods on several datasets, which demonstrates the superior accuracy of DLR-GAE in semi-supervised classification.
