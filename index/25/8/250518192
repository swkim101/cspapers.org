Impacts and other non-smooth behaviors are usually unwanted in robotic applications. However, several industrial tasks such as deburring, removing excess material, and assembling/fitting, involve impacts between objects, which can benefit from robotic automation due to the risks posed to human health. Towards this objective, in this paper, we propose a method for optimal impact planning and pre-configuration for torque-controlled robots. We thus employ a well-known impulsive contact model to plan the impact force and create a hierarchical quadratic programming based controller capable of minimizing the robot's peak torques by reconfiguring its joints optimally, before the impact occurs. The results obtained from multiple experiments during an industrial deburring task are discussed. Using a 7-DoF manipulator, we show consistent results, both in terms of accuracy of the impact force tracking with respect to the desired forces, and in terms of peak torques reduction and uniform torques distribution.
