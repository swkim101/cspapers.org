Existing situated visualization models assume the user is able to directly interact with the objects and spaces to which the data refers (known as physical referents). We review a growing body of work exploring scenarios where the user interacts with a proxy representation of the physical referent rather than immediately with the object itself. This introduces a complex mixture of immediate situatedness and proxies of situatedness that goes beyond the expressiveness of current models. We propose an extended model of situated visualization that encompasses Immediate Situated Visualization and ProxSituated (Proxy of Situated) Visualization. Our model describes a set of key entities involved in proxSituated scenarios and important relationships between them. From this model, we derive design dimensions and apply them to existing situated visualization work. The resulting design space allows us to describe and evaluate existing scenarios, as well as to creatively generate new conceptual scenarios.
