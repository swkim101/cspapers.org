In this paper, we introduce Shop the Look, a web-scale fashion and home product visual search system deployed at Amazon. Building such a system poses great challenges to both science and engineering practices. We leverage large-scale image data from the Amazon product catalog and adopt effective strategies to reduce the human effort required to annotate data. By employing state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, we train detection, recognition, and feature extraction models to bridge the domain gap between in-the-wild query images and product images which are taken under controlled settings. Our system is designed to achieve a balance between result accuracy and efficiency. The run-time service is optimized to provide retrieval results to users with low-latency. The scalable offline index-building pipeline adapts to the dynamic Amazon catalog that contains billions of products. We present both quantitative and qualitative evaluation results to demonstrate the performance of our system. We believe that the fast-growing Shop the Look service is shaping the way that customers shop on Amazon.
