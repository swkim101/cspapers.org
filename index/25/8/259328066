The increasingly popular virtual personal assistant (VPA) services, e.g., Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, enable third-party developers to create and release VPA apps for end users to access through smart speakers. Given that VPA apps handle sensitive personal data, VPA service providers require developers to release a privacy policy document to declare their data handling practice. The privacy policies are regarded as legal or semi-legal documents, which are usually lengthy and complex for users to understand. In this work, we conducted a subjective study to investigate the level of users’ understanding of the privacy policies, targeting the VPA apps (i.e., skills) of Amazon Alexa, the most popular VPA service. Our study focused on technical terms, one of the greatest hurdles to users’ understanding. We found that 84.2% of our participants faced difficulty in understanding technical terms appeared in the skills’ privacy policies, even for participants with IT background. Additionally, 64.3% of them reported that explanations for the technical terms are generally lacking. To address this issue, we proposed two principles, i.e., domain-specificity principle and implication-oriented principle, to guide skill developers in creating easy-to-understand privacy policies. We evaluated their effectiveness by creating explanation sentences for 23 representative terms and examining users’ understanding through a second user study. Our results show that using explanation sentences based on these principles can significantly improve users’ understanding.
