Diffusion models have achieved promising results on generative learning recently. However, because diffusion processes are most naturally applied on the unconstrained Euclidean space R d , key challenges arise for developing diffusion based models for learning data on constrained and structured domains. We present a simple and unified framework to achieve this that can be easily adopted to various types of domains, including product spaces of any type (be it bounded/unbounded, continuous/discrete, categorical/ordinal
