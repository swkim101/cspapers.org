 In this work, an optimization model was constructed to help address important design and operation questions for a novel system combining natural gas power plants with carbon capture and thermal storage. A control co-design (CCD) approach is taken where key plant sizing decisions (including storage capacities and energy transfer rates) and operational control (e.g., when to store and use thermal energy and operate the plant) are considered in an integrated manner using a simultaneous CCD strategy. The optimal design, as well as the operation of the system, are determined for an entire year (either all-at-once or through a moving prediction horizons strategy) in a large, sparse linear optimization problem. The results demonstrate both the need for optimal operation to enable a fair economic assessment of the proposed system as well as optimal sizing decisions due to sensitivity to a variety of scenarios, including different market conditions, site locations, and technology options.
