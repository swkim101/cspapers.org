Taxonomy expansion is the process of incorporating a large number of additional nodes (i.e., ''queries'') into an existing taxonomy (i.e., ''seed''), with the most important step being the selection of appropriate positions for each query.
Enormous efforts have been made by exploring the seed's structure.
However, existing approaches are deficient in their mining of structural information in two ways: poor modeling of the hierarchical semantics and failure to capture directionality of the is-a relation.
This paper seeks to address these issues by explicitly denoting each node as the combination of inherited feature (i.e., structural part) and incremental feature (i.e., supplementary part).
Specifically, the inherited feature originates from ''parent'' nodes and is weighted by an inheritance factor.
With this node representation, the hierarchy of semantics in taxonomies (i.e., the inheritance and accumulation of features from ''parent'' to ''child'') could be embodied.
Additionally, based on this representation, the directionality of the is-a relation could be easily translated into the irreversible inheritance of features.
Inspired by the Darmois-Skitovich Theorem, we implement this irreversibility by a non-Gaussian constraint on the supplementary feature.
A log-likelihood learning objective is further utilized to optimize the proposed model (dubbed DNG), whereby the required non-Gaussianity is also theoretically ensured.
Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets verify the superiority of DNG relative to several strong baselines.
