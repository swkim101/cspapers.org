We present a novel bird's-eye-view (BEV) detector with perspective supervision, which converges faster and bet-suits modern image backbones. Existing state-of-the-art BEV detectors are often tied to certain depth pretrained backbones like Vo Vn et, hindering the synergy between booming image backbones and BEV detectors. To address this limitation, we prioritize easing the optimization of BEV detectors by introducing perspective view supervision. To this end, we propose a two-stage BEV detector; where proposals from the perspective head are fed into the birdâ€™ s-eye-view head for final predictions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive ablation studies focusing on the form of supervision and the gener-ality of the proposed detector. The proposed method is ver-ified with a wide spectrum of traditional and modern image backbones and achieves new SoTA results on the large-scale nuScenes dataset. The code shall be released soon.
