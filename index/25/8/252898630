As the human hand makes direct physical contact with smartphones, significant efforts have recently been made to study the behavioral information of hand gripping of smartphones for user authentication purposes. Most existing methods leverage hand gripping behavior (e.g., gripping gesture, gripping position, gripping strength) of smartphones as biometrics to identify users. However, behavioral-based biometric authentication approaches may suffer from two problems: authentication performance (accuracy) degradation due to high-intra class variations arising from changes in user behavior over time, and vulnerability under spoofing attacks. To address these issues, we propose HoldPass, which is a behavior-independent in-hand user authentication method using vibration. HoldPass is able to adapt to the changes of hand gripping behavior of smartphones by extracting unique and stable physical features of human hands and eliminating the behavior-related prior information. Specifically, in HoldPass, we propose an adversarial neural network to achieve authentication based on unique physical features. Experiments with 10 users show that HoldPass can authenticate users with 97.39% accuracy while keeping False Accepted Rates (FAR) at a minimum of 2.1%.
