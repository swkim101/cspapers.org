Machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown great potential in edge-computing environments, however, the literature mainly focuses on model inference only. We investigate how ML can be operationalized and how in-situ curation can improve the quality of edge applications, in the context of ML-assisted environmental surveys. We show that camera-enabled ML systems deployed on edge devices can enable scientists to perform real-time monitoring of species of interest or characterization of natural habitats. However, the benefit of this new technology is only as good as the quality and accuracy of the edge ML model inferences. In this demonstration, we show that with small additional time investment, domain scientists can manually curate ML model outputs and thus obtain highly reliable scientific insights, leading to more effective and scalable environmental surveys.
