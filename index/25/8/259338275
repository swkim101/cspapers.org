The paper presents a novel domain-specific language, RoboSC, for developing supervisory controllers for robotic applications. RoboSC supports concepts of ROS/ROS2 and supervisory control theory. It enables users to focus on the modeling and the synthesis process of supervisory controllers for ROS applications only because it generates all artifacts needed to connect such controllers to ROS applications and deploy them. Validation tests with actual and simulated robots show the approach's feasibility and indicate reduced coding effort.
