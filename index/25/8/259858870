This paper presents a schema-aware end-to-end neural network model for handling task-oriented dialogues based on a dynamic set of slots within a schema. Contrary to existing studies that proposed end-to-end approaches for task-oriented dialogue systems by relying on a unified schema across domains, we de-sign our approach to support a domain covering multiple services where diverse schemas are available. To enable better generalizability among services and domains with different schemas, we supply the schemaâ€™s context information including slot descriptions and value constraints to the model. The experimental results on a well-known Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset demonstrated the performance improvement by the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art baselines in terms of end-to-end modeling, dialogue state tracking task, and generalization on new services and domains using a limited number of dialogues. 1
