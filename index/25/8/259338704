With the advancement of industrial manufacturing and an increase in introduction of robots in the workspace, the need of safe operation, communication and information sharing is paramount. The work presented here focuses on cyber-physical system integration through Digital Twin (DT) technology. Our novel DT architecture is based on a model-free Neuro-Adaptive controller (NAC), and an edge-computing scheme for scene monitoring. The NAC can account for varying robot dynamics in both real and virtual environments, and allows for the DT system to expand the realm of cyber-physical integration without expensive model tuning. The edge-computing device introduced in our architecture, observes the robot's workspace from a distance with a wider field of view. This wide viewpoint, enhances the detection and mitigation of any obstacles entering the robot's workspace during operation. We experimentally evaluated the performance of our proposed architecture by introducing dynamic obstacles during a pick-and-place task that both the physical robot and its digital twin had to avoid. Results show that the proposed DT architecture successfully integrates the novel controller and edge-computing elements and successfully performs the given navigation task. The results also show that NAC outperforms a PD controller with more than 70% improvement in joint tracking error between the physical and virtual robots. It was observed that the latency experienced while using NAC is about 48 % lower than when Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller was operational.
