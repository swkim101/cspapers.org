By leveraging the mechanical motions on the body surface conducted by physiological activities, many works have achieved radio-frequency(RF)-based physiological sensing. However, previous works generally simplify the model on both the mechanism of physiological motion and the signal propagation around the human body, which leads to the loss of valuable information. In this paper, we introduce the concept of micro-motion(MM) camera to provide a more cognitive imaging modality to observe torso surface motion comprehensively so as to dynamically image the motions of the breath and cardiac activities. We develop a sub-6G MMCamera prototype system. The camera functionality is implemented to prove the concept novelty from the view of respiratory-cardiovascular system monitoring. Our result shows that the proposed system could provide fine-grid torso surface motion imaging with breath and cardiac activities distributed over the entire thorax and abdomen.
