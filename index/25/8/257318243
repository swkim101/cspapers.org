In the last few years, quantum dots (QDs) have attracted research interest in different fields of science and technology. Despite their applications, it is essential to understand how nanomaterials (with different crystal sizes) are metabolized inside organisms. Thus, the focus of this study was on an evaluation of how crystal sizes of CdSTe QDs affect the viability and response of the cytochrome P450 system in CHO-K1 and HEP-G2 cells. CdSTe QDs were synthesized using a microwave-assisted system at different reaction temperatures (60, 120, 150, and 180 Â°C) to obtain different crystal sizes. The optical and structural characterization confirmed four crystal sizes from 3 to 8 nm. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that CdSTe QDs are incorporated into both cell lines. Viability studies suggested that CHO-K1 cells are more sensitive than HEP-G2 cells to CdSTe QDs and Cd+2 ions. The responsible mechanisms for the toxicity of QDs and Cd+2 are apoptosis followed by necrosis. The activity of CYP 1A1, 1A2, and 3A4 isoenzymes suggests that the smallest CdSTe crystals are recognized in a manner similar to that of Cd+2. Furthermore, the largest CdSTe crystals can have different metabolic routes than Cd+2.
