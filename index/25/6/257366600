An ACM/IEEE-CS/AAAI task force is undertaking a review of the computer science curriculum guidelines. The task force aims to generate an initial draft, known as CS2023, by the end of 2023. It is anticipated that the resulting curriculum guidelines will impact computer science curriculum globally until at least 2034. This review process is undertaken approximately every decade and was last completed in 2013 with the resulting ACM/IEEE CS2013 document CS2013 has served the community well and planned revisions focus on the removal of topics that are no longer relevant, identification of emerging topics, or topics with increased importance or relevance. An integral part of the review process is to solicit input from a wide audience. While reviews can be made on-line, the purpose of this Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) session is to present the proposed changes to the programming languages knowledge area and to solicit input from the attendees. There are substantial changes being proposed and timely feedback is essential for an informed process. Two of the major changes are the migration to a competency model, similar to that described in CS2020, and the replacement of Tier-1 and Tier-2 hours with a CS-core that all computer science students should know, and a KA-core which students specializing in the knowledge area should know.
