rvcodec.js is an open-source, online RISC-V instruction encoder-decoder, specifically geared towards students learning about instruction formats. For improved usability, rvcodec.js uses bright colors to visually map the relationships between the instruction's assembly tokens and binary fields. Students can, for example, quickly identify which bits in the binary representation correspond to a certain immediate value in the assembly instruction. rvcodec.js is available at https://luplab.gitlab.io/rvcodecjs/.
