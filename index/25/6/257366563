This poster reports on the second iteration of a workshop to help elementary teachers create lesson plans that integrate culturally relevant computer science (CS) learning opportunities. Findings include revisions to the workshop from the previous year and reveal the extent to which teachers used supports for culturally relevant pedagogy to refine their lesson ideas. The presentation will discuss results and share workshop artifacts.
