Over recent years, graph convolutional networks emerged as powerful node clustering methods and have set state of the art results for this task. In this paper, we argue that some of these methods are unnecessarily complex and propose a node clustering model that is more scalable while being more effective. The proposed model uses Laplacian smoothing to learn an initial representation of the graph before applying an efficient self-expressive subspace clustering procedure.
This is performed via learning a factored coefficient matrix. These factors are then embedded into a new feature space in such a way as to generate a valid affinity matrix (symmetric and non-negative) on which an implicit spectral clustering algorithm is performed. 
Experiments on several real-world attributed datasets demonstrate the cost-effective nature of our method with respect to the state of the art.
