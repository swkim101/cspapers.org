Research has revealed the positive effects of reflection on helping students manage their psychological well-being. Hence, we are motivated to investigate the design space of how we can communicate the values of doing reflections. We limit our work to voice reflection because of its inclusivity and effectiveness. We designed a pilot survey on Qualtrics to collect qualitative responses and integrated voice recording features from Phonic.ai. Participants were presented with 4 sample voice recordings related to college students' daily lives and asked to complete a simple voice reflection activity based on the samples they listened to. Then, they were asked to provide feedback on these examples. We deployed the survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and collected 221 effective responses. By conducting thematic analysis, we found several insightful themes: emotional speech, diverse content, and clear structure are important elements to include, while examples should avoid being overly scripted. The findings suggest ways to design effective examples to engage students in voice reflections and open up the possibilities for further investigations into the design features of voice reflection platforms.
