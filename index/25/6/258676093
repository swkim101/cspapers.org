 Engineering design often involves representation in at least two levels of abstraction: the system-level, represented by lumped parameter models (LPMs), and the geometric-level, represented by distributed parameter models (DPMs). Functional design innovation commonly occurs at the system-level, followed by a geometric-level realization of functional LPM components. However, comparing these two levels in terms of behavioral outcomes can be challenging and time-consuming, leading to delays in design translations between system and mechanical engineers. In this paper, we propose a simulation-free scheme that compares LPMs and spatially-discretized DPMs based on their model specifications and behaviors of interest, regardless of modeling languages and numerical methods. We adopt a model order reduction (MOR) technique that a priori guarantees accuracy, stability, and convergence to improve the computational efficiency of large-scale models. Our approach is demonstrated through the model consistency analysis of several mechanical designs, showing its validity, efficiency, and generality. Our method provides a systematic way to compare system-level and geometric-level designs, improving reliability and facilitating design translation.
