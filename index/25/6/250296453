The developmental approach, simulating a cognitive development of a human, arises as a way to nurture a human-level commonsense and overcome the limitations of data-driven approaches. However, neither a virtual environment nor an evaluation platform exists for the overall development of core cognitive skills. We present the VECA(Virtual Environment for Cognitive Assessment), which consists of two main components: (i) a first benchmark to assess the overall cognitive development of an AI agent, and (ii) a novel toolkit to generate diverse and distinct cognitive tasks. VECA benchmark virtually implements the cognitive scale of Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-IV(Bayley-4), the gold-standard developmental assessment for human infants and toddlers. Our VECA toolkit provides a human toddler-like embodied agent with various human-like perceptual features crucial to human cognitive development, e.g., binocular vision, 3D-spatial audio, and tactile receptors. We compare several modern RL algorithms on our VECA benchmark and seek their limitations in modeling human-like cognitive development. We further analyze the validity of the VECA benchmark, as well as the effect of human-like sensory characteristics on cognitive skills.
