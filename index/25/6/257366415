Faculty diversity is a key concern across U.S. colleges and universities, especially in computer science (CS) departments, where there is both a faculty shortage and a lack of diversity among faculty. Given the crucial role CS faculty play in shaping the field, in terms of both producing knowledge and mentoring the next generation of computer scientists, developing diverse and robust pathways to the professoriate must be an institutional priority. This panel will offer interdisciplinary perspectives from scholarly experts in CS and higher education, leveraging panelists' knowledge about diversity and equity in pathways to the CS professoriate. Panelists will provide relevant empirical insights about students' academic pathways and institutional practices that may broaden access to faculty careers. Panelists will also engage in a conversation about reimagining pathways to the CS professoriate with equity-minded policies and practices.
