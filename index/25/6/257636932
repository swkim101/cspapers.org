Box-supervised instance segmentation has gained much attention as it requires only simple box annotations instead of costly mask or polygon annotations. However, existing box-supervised instance segmentation models mainly focus on mask-based frameworks. We propose a new end-to-end training technique, termed BoxSnake, to achieve effective polygonal instance segmentation using only box annotations for the first time. Our method consists of two loss functions: (1) a point-based unary loss that constrains the bounding box of predicted polygons to achieve coarse-grained segmentation; and (2) a distance-aware pairwise loss that encourages the predicted polygons to fit the object boundaries. Compared with the mask-based weakly-supervised methods, BoxSnake further reduces the performance gap between the predicted segmentation and the bounding box, and shows significant superiority on the Cityscapes dataset.
