In this study, we aim to develop a model that comprehends a natural language instruction (e.g., “Go to the living room and get the nearest pillow to the radio art on the wall”) and generates a segmentation mask for the target everyday object. The task is challenging because it requires (1) the understanding of the referring expressions for multiple objects in the instruction, (2) the prediction of the target phrase of the sentence among the multiple phrases, and (3) the generation of pixel-wise segmentation masks rather than bounding boxes. Studies have been conducted on language-based segmentation methods; however, they sometimes mask irrelevant regions for complex sentences. In this paper, we propose the Multimodal Diffusion Segmentation Model (MDSM), which generates a mask in the first stage and refines it in the second stage. We introduce a crossmodal parallel feature extraction mechanism and extend diffusion probabilistic models to handle crossmodal features. To validate our model, we built a new dataset based on the well-known Matterport3D and REVERIE datasets. This dataset consists of instructions with complex referring expressions accompanied by real indoor environmental images that feature various target objects, in addition to pixel-wise segmentation masks. The performance of MDSM surpassed that of the baseline method by a large margin of +10.13 mean IoU.
