In this lightning talk, I reflect on the ongoing rise of software infrastructures for educational experiments and their role in potential shifts in Computer Science Education research. I outline some emerging challenges and opportunities for scientific discovery and educational practice. In particular, I discuss overlapping interventions, experimental design optimization, and knowledge accumulation from multi-cohort multi-site studies.
