Hand-drawn sketches and sketch colourization are the most laborious but necessary steps for fashion designers to design exquisite clothes, especially when the fashion design requires distinctive and personal characteristics from designer style. This paper presents an artificial intelligent aided fashion design system, namely StyleMe, to support the automatic generation of clothing sketches with designer style. Given the clothing pictures specified by the designer, StyleMe can use deep learning based generative model to generate clothing sketches that are consistent with the designer style. The system also supports intelligent colourization on clothing sketch by style transfer, according to specified styles from the real fashion images. Through a series of performance evaluations and user studies, we found that our system can generate effective clothing sketches as good as fashion designersâ€™ human work, and significantly improve the efficiency of fashion design with its sketch colourization method.
