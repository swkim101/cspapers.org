Clustering is important for domain adaptive person re-identification(re-ID). A majority of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods conduct clustering on the target domain and then use the generated pseudo labels for adaptive training. Albeit important, the clustering pipeline adopted by current literature is quite standard and lacks consideration for two characteristics of re-ID, i.e., 1) a single person has various feature distribution in multiple cameras. 2) a personâ€™s occurrence in the same camera are usually temporally continuous. We argue that the multi-camera distribution hinders clustering because it enlarges the intra-class distances. In contrast, the temporal continuity prior is beneficial, because it offers clue for distinguishing some look-alike person (who are temporally far away from each other). These two insight motivate us to propose a novel Divide-And-Regroup Clustering (DARC) pipeline for re-ID UDA. Specifically, DARC divides the unlabeled data into multiple camera-specific groups and conducts local clustering within each camera. Afterwards, it regroups those local clusters potentially belonging to the same person into a unity. Through this divide-and-regroup pipeline, DARC avoids directly clustering across multiple cameras and focuses on the feature distribution within each individual camera. Moreover, during the local clustering, DARC uses the temporal continuity prior to distinguish some look-alike person and thus reduces false positive pseudo labels. Consequentially, DARC effectively reduces clustering errors and improves UDA. Importantly, we show that DARC is compatible to many pseudo label-based UDA methods and brings general improvement. Based on a recent UDA method, DARC advances the state of the art (e.g, 85.1% mAP on MSMT-to-Market and 83.1% mAP on PersonX-to-Market).
