This paper proposes a Finite-Time Nonlinear Sliding Mode Control (FTNSMC) for wind turbine system-based squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) connected to grid trough LCL filter. The proposed FTNSMC employs a sliding surface based on the nonlinear integral function to improve the system performance. Both, the generator-side and grid-side converters are controlled to ensure the robustness and stability of the power system subjected to grid voltage faults. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed control strategy compared with the conventional Sliding Mode Control (SMC) method and confirm its robustness against grid faults and disturbances.
