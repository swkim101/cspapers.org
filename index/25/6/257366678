CS education advocates have made substantial progress toward getting states to provide universal K-12 computing education. But as computers and networking continue to drive the third industrial revolution, artificial intelligence and robotics are driving the fourth. What should states be doing now about K-12 AI education? In 2021 AI4K12.org organized The State of AI Education in Your State Workshop and held a series of follow-up meetings for state education officials and other interested parties to help plan for the introduction of AI into their state's K-12 computing education standards. Some are already well along in the work. In this lightning talk we highlight progress in several states and refer attendees to resources where they can form new professional connections and begin contributing to this effort. This work is crucial to prepare students for the economic and social disruptions anticipated to result from the AI-powered fourth industrial revolution that is already under way. Attendees interested in contributing to the development of AI education in their state should contact their state's Department of Education to find out what efforts are currently in progress. Resources for networking include the AI4K12 mailing list, ISTE's Professional Learning Community for AI educators, and CS or AI education advocacy groups such as Code.org, CS4ALL, AI4ALL, and aiEDU.
