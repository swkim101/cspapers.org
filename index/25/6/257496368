Finger-tip tactile sensors are increasingly used for robotic sensing to establish stable grasps and to infer object properties. Promising performance has been shown in a number of works for inferring adjectives that describe the object, but there remains a question about how each taxel contributes to the performance. This paper explores this question with empirical experiments, leading insights for future finger-tip tactile sensor usage and design: one tactile sensor instead of a pair of sensors is sufficient for symmetric objects and interaction motions; dense taxels are beneficial for texture-related adjectives, but can be distracting to non-texture-related ones; and a frame-rate much lower than the BioTac sensor can satisfy the demand of inferring object adjectives in the PHAC-2 dataset.
