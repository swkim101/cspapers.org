In the modern world, with the rapid technological advancements in the field of electricity, innovative techniques are being employed to optimize electric power generation. These techniques involve a combination of conventional energy sources (coal, gas, etc.) with Renewable Energy Sources (RES) (PV, wind, etc.) to meet the electric power demands. Unfortunately, the intermittent nature of these RES has a detrimental effect on the system's power quality. To counter this issue, an efficient, intelligent, and advanced control method that employs a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) in parallel with Fractional Order Proportional Integral Controller (FOPI) is proposed for Load Frequency Control (LFC) of the connected power system. With the help of this controller, an optimum solution for this problem is established in this study to enhance the power quality of the overall system by reducing the frequency fluctuations in the system. In the end, system responses to load changes have been analyzed and compared with those of state-of-the-art controllers like the Firefly Algorithm (FA) tuned PI, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) tuned PI, and MPC tuned PI to show the adequacy of the proposed controller.
