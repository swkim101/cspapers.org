In this paper, we present a fast, lightweight odometry method that uses the Doppler velocity measurements from a Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) lidar without data association. FMCW lidar is a recently emerging technology that enables per-return relative radial velocity measurements via the Doppler effect. Since the Doppler measurement model is linear with respect to the 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) vehicle velocity, we can formulate a linear continuous-time estimation problem for the velocity and numerically integrate for the 6-DOF pose estimate afterward. The caveat is that angular velocity is not observable with a single FMCW lidar. We address this limitation by also incorporating the angular velocity measurements from a gyroscope. This results in an extremely efficient odometry method that processes lidar frames at an average wall-clock time of 5.64ms on a single thread, well below the 10Hz operating rate of the lidar we tested. We show experimental results on real-world driving sequences and compare against state-of-the-art Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based odometry methods, presenting a compelling tradeoff between accuracy and computation. We also present an algebraic observability study, where we demonstrate in theory that the Doppler measurements from multiple FMCW lidars are capable of observing all 6 degrees of freedom (translational and angular velocity).
