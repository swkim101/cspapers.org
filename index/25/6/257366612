In this project, students use python dictionaries as a database to store data on fatal police shootings. After familiarizing themselves with the data, students compute the percentage of fatal police shootings with a black subject and compare this with the percentage of the United States population who are black. They repeat this computation, restricting to only shootings with an unarmed subjects. Finally, students write a short reflection on their work and results. This project is suitable for Introduction to Computer Science I, taught in Python. It teaches students to use Python dictionaries effectively, to study an important social justice issue. This project is special because of the incorporation of important and impactful real-world data, while using only the concepts known by a CS 1 student and providing practice with these concepts.
