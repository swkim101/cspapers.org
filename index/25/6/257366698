This study examines metacognition in program comprehension by purposefully inserting errors in a sequence of code tracing and intent problems. Participants were 39 students reasoning about DeMorgan's Laws from a series of test cases. Student performance suggests a range of faulty attributions and a need to further exemplify good and bad practices to develop proper standards for evaluating the products of cognitive processes.
