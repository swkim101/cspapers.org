The current ACM/IEEE/AAAI Computer Science Curricula is approaching ten years of age. The CS2023 Steering Committee began efforts to update this important document in spring 2021 (csed.acm.org). The aim of this session is to seek feedback from the community on an advanced draft of the Society, Ethics and Professionalism (SEP) knowledge area. Much has transpired in the last decade within these domains including the role of social media in our daily lives, professional roles, and even our elections. Today, fake news, data leaks, hacks, and scandals involving personal information are rife. The impact of computing on society has never been more high-stakes, our ethics have never been tested in these ways, and the need for up-to-date professionalism has never been greater. In this light we seek to gather as many diverse views as possible to help us shape a Society, Ethics & Professionalism knowledge area that can serve the community and our students for the next decade.
