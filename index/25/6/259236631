Micro/nanoprocessing of materials using lasers is currently an active research topic. In that research, the choice of the laser to be used is critical, but the F2 laser, which has the shortest wavelength (157 nm) among commercially available lasers, has few research compared to its potential. In this paper, we discovered a new photochemical processing by using an F2 laser to irradiate an amorphous carbon thin film. The short wavelength and high photon energy of the F2 laser can photoexcite the surface of the thin film at high density and generate active oxygen atoms O(1D) by photodecomposition of atmospheric oxygen molecules. As a result, the optical change of the amorphous carbon thin film was induced without thickness reduction, and a micron-sized network-like, reticulated structural change was formed in the thin film surface after one month at the latest. The formed micron-sized reticulated structure was relatively swollen, and a graphitization occurred in the structure, observed by Raman spectroscopy. However, the structure was not observed when the laser irradiated area became smaller. This work has made it possible to form a micron-sized reticulated structure including carbon nanocrystals in an amorphous carbon, which is expected to further expand the applications of carbon materials.
