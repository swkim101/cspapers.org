This poster presents lessons learned from offering three iterations of summer professional development (PD) for rural fourth- to sixth-grade teachers. Participating teachers attended a PD on Utah's new state science standards, computer science concepts, and the integration of computer science within science. With each iteration, the content covered in the PD became more focused, and a higher percentage of teachers expressed intent to integrate CS in their elementary science classrooms. The last year of the PD relied heavily on a Teacher-Learner-Observer model to familiarize teachers with the TIPP&SEE lesson structure before encouraging teachers to modify an existing TIPP&SEE lesson for integration in science. All nine participants in this latest cohort plan to create their own TIPP&SEE lessons; eight of the nine have already completed and taught their lessons by December. The poster shares the PD agenda, links to teacher-developed Scratch lessons integrating CS in elementary science, and lessons learned from three years of workshops delivered to teachers from rural districts.
