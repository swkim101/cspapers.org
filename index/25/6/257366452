Mobile technologies are rapidly evolving to provide faster and better services, with the 5th Generation (5G) being actively rolled out. Any new technology brings along the responsibility of managing its security. Educating the future generation is of utmost importance to help them navigate the ever changing cyber landscape. Considering this issue we have developed a course on the 5G mobile technology and security for the undergraduate level. The goal is to help bridge the gap between undergraduate knowledge and the high technical, usually at the graduate level, seen in most 5G security courses. The course is first designed to provide students with the foundations of 5G technology critical to the security posture of any organization. Then, with the background set, the course covers the security aspects of these underlying components. This poster presents the course modules developed with respect to the NIST CAE Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/cae/pdf/unclass-cae-cd_ku.pdf Knowledge Units (KUs) for cybersecurity, and primary analysis based on student performance pertaining to our Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs). We have offered the course as individual study research topic to students and hope to extend the lessons to a full-fledged course. We offer a repository of subset of assignments we created.
