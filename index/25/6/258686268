We propose bounded fitting as a scheme for learning

description logic concepts in the presence of ontologies. A main

advantage is that the resulting learning algorithms come with

theoretical guarantees regarding their generalization to unseen

examples in the sense of PAC learning. We prove that, in contrast,

several other natural learning algorithms fail to provide such

guarantees. As a further contribution, we present the system SPELL

which efficiently implements bounded fitting for the description

logic ELHr based on a SAT solver, and compare its performance to a

state-of-the-art learner.
