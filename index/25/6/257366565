In this poster, we describe our experience with the creation of innovative pedagogy to teach Game Design and Development to Computer Science students. We followed a multidisciplinary approach made possible through collaboration by faculty from CS and Arts & Digital Media. The goal of this work is to promote the development of professional skills by providing students with a project-based learning environment that resembles actual work conditions. Preliminary evaluation of student outcomes are encouraging and indicative of the potential benefits of our approach.
