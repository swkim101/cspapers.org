Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) such as quadrotors equipped with manipulation mechanisms have the potential to assist humans in tasks such as construction and package delivery. Cables are a promising option for manipulation mechanisms due to their low weight, low cost, and simple design. However, designing control and planning strategies for cable mechanisms presents challenges due to indirect load actuation, nonlinear configuration space, and highly coupled system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) method that enables a team of quadrotors to manipulate a rigid-body payload in all 6 degrees of freedom via suspended cables. Our approach can concurrently exploit, as part of the receding horizon optimization, the available mechanical system redundancies to perform additional tasks such as inter-robot separation and obstacle avoidance while respecting payload dynamics and actuator constraints. To address real-time computational requirements and scalability, we employ a lightweight state vector parametrization that includes only payload states in all six degrees of freedom. This also enables the planning of trajectories on the SE (3) manifold load configuration space, thereby also reducing planning complexity. We validate the proposed approach through simulation and real-world experiments.
