This poster presents a model for supporting prospective authors of POGIL (Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning) activities for computer science courses. 36 participants knowledgeable about POGIL attended a virtual kickoff event in May 2022 and many chose to participate in a POGIL Activity Writing Retreat in June 2022. By the end of the summer, 29 different authors drafted 73 activities in nine different areas of CS. 62 activities were revised until approved by the program as high-quality POGIL activities ready for classroom testing, doubling the number of peer-reviewed POGIL activities in CS. This model of supporting instructors as they write POGIL activities has been so successful that the POGIL Project is considering adopting it for the future. The poster shares links to the CS POGIL activities (http://cspogil.org) and summarizes lessons learned from the Activity Writing Program that would be useful for supporting authors of other forms of learning activities.
