This CS2 assignment asks students to implement a literal flood fill. Students are given a terrain containing bodies of water, then write a flood fill algorithm to determine what parts of the terrain will be under water as sea levels rise. Our provided starter files include terrains from around the world and allow students to explore how coastal areas will be impacted by differing amounts of sea level rise. The underlying model is very simple - students see the terrain as a 2D array of real numbers representing heights in meters, and water can flow in each of the four cardinal directions. The resulting images give a striking sense of how coastal areas may be impacted by climate change.
