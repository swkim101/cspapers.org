Most translation tasks among languages belong to the zero-resource translation problem where parallel corpora are unavailable. Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) enables one-pass translation using shared semantic space for all languages compared to the two-pass pivot translation but often underperforms the pivot-based method. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named as Unified Multilingual Multiple teacher-student Model for NMT (UM4). Our method unifies source-teacher, target-teacher, and pivot-teacher models to guide the student model for the zero-resource translation. The source teacher and target teacher force the student to learn the direct source-target translation by the distilled knowledge on both source and target sides. The monolingual corpus is further leveraged by the pivot-teacher model to enhance the student model. Experimental results demonstrate that our model of 72 directions significantly outperforms previous methods on the WMT benchmark.
