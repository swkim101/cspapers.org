A novel study of plasmonic material comparison has been performed on a dual polarized photonic crystal fiber (PCF) based square lattice microchannel incorporated surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor which has. Lead and bismuth have been individually deposited on to the micro channel and the performance parameters of the sensor have then been studied and compared. The Finite Element Method (FEM) has been adopted to carry out the numerical investigations. Using lead, for the x- and y-polarized modes respectively, the sensor achieved a highest wavelength sensitivity of 36,000 nm/RIU and 55,000 nm/RIU, maximum amplitude sensitivity of-436.9 $\boldsymbol{\text{RIU}^{-1}}$ and -719.4 $\boldsymbol{\text{RIU}^{-1}}$, minimum resolution of $\boldsymbol{2.8\times 10^{-6}}$ RIU and $\boldsymbol{1.8\times 10^{-6}}$ RIU, and the highest figure of merit (FOM) of 3007.5 RIU−1and 426.9 $\boldsymbol{\text{RIU}^{-1}}$, along with a wide analyte refractive index (RI) sensing range. Using bismuth, for dual polarized modes, the sensor obtained a highest wavelength sensitivity of 15,000 nm/RIU and 60,000 nm/RIU, maximum amplitude sensitivity of -241.4 RIU−1 and -224.1 RIU−1, minimum resolution of $\boldsymbol{6.7\times 10^{-6}}$ RIU and $\boldsymbol{1.7\times 10^{-6}}$ RIU, highest FOM of 188.6 RIU−1 and 127.7 $\mathbf{RIU}^{-1}$, in addition to a broad RI sensing range. The signal to noise ratio (SNR), detection limit, sensor length, and the detection accuracy have also been investigated for the dual polarization using the two metals. With its extremely impressive performance parameters and wide sensing range, the sensor can be used to detect a broad spectrum of analytes, especially, chlorodifluoromethane refrigerant R-22, pseudomonas bacteria, and ethyl-, methyl-, propyl-based alcohol.
