The article presents the basic principles of three-dimensional mathematical modeling of the operation of a thrust plain bearing with fixed pads of the compressor. The model is based on the periodic thermoelastohydrodynamic (PTEHD) theory, which allows calculating the temperature at the inlet to the pad and considering the complete thermal picture. A description of the main provisions of the numerical implementation is given. In the stationary operation of the bearing, using the Sm2Px3TxT program, numerical experiments were carried out aimed at studying different boundary conditions to the Reynolds equation, the physics of the hydrodynamic process in the lubricating and boundary films of the bearing and the heat propagation in the body of the pad and thrust collar.
