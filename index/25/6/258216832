Self-directed learning is becoming a significant skill for learners. However, learners may suffer from difficulties such as distractions, a lack of motivation, and so on. While self-tracking technologies have the potential to address these challenges, existing tools and systems mainly focused on tracking computer-based learning data in classroom contexts. Little is known about how students track and make sense of their learning data from non-classroom learning activities and which types of learning data are personally meaningful for learners. In this paper, we conducted a qualitative study with 24 users of Timing, a mobile learning tracking application in China. Our findings indicated that users tracked a variety of qualitative learning data (e.g., videos, photos of learning materials, and emotions) and made sense of this data using different strategies such as observing behavioral and contextual details in videos. We then provided implications for designing non-classroom and non-computer-based personal learning tracking tools.
