The effects of temperature and surfactant on the shape of candle droplets that solidify at air-water interfaces were investigated. In pure water, triangular or quadrangular shaped candle droplets were formed when the temperature was ≤6 °C and round shape droplets were observed when the temperature was ≥10 °C. In SDS/water solutions ≥ 0.5 mM, oval or concave bowl-shaped candle droplets were formed when the temperature was ≤6 °C and round shape droplets were observed when the temperature was ≥10 °C. The formation mechanisms of the different shapes were explored and discussed.
