In this poster, we present the design of a browser-based Arduino programming tool, CASMM, to support computational thinking and making in science classrooms. This tool allows for unique integration of research tools, lesson planning, and scaffolding for learning computational thinking concepts and block-based programming. This poster will describe four key features of a block-based LMS: (1) reduced-scoped programming toolbox, (2) block locking, (3) lesson plans and starter code templates; and (4) low-tech code replay for researchers. Through discussion of this tool, we aim to catalyze conversations about integrating new scaffolding techniques into block-based programming environments to better support classroom use and research.
