Teaching full-stack web development requires the instructor not only keep up with rapidly changing technology but also grapple with thorny questions of hosting. Many of the solutions for professional developers, unsurprisingly, do not work well in an academic environment, and their use entails much compromise and jury-rigging. In this workshop, participants will discover how to make the setting up of that essential infrastructure much easier as they work through small examples of full-stack work (no prior experience necessary). We look at tooling that provides environments similar to what one would find in industry (compatible with all major languages and platforms), but not at the expense of what academics need: support for creating and grading assignments, collaboration, privacy, FERPA compliance, and the like.
