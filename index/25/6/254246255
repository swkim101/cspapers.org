Recent advancements in neural rendering have paved the way for a future marked by the widespread distribution of visual data through the sharing of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model weights. However, while established techniques exist for embedding ownership or copyright information within conventional visual data such as images and videos, the challenges posed by the emerging NeRF format have remained unaddressed. In this paper, we introduce StegaNeRF, an innovative approach for steganographic information embedding within NeRF renderings. We have meticulously developed an optimization framework that enables precise retrieval of hidden information from images generated by NeRF, while ensuring the original visual quality of the rendered images to remain intact. Through rigorous experimentation, we assess the efficacy of our methodology across various potential deployment scenarios. Furthermore, we delve into the insights gleaned from our analysis. StegaNeRF represents an initial foray into the intriguing realm of infusing NeRF renderings with customizable, imperceptible, and recoverable information, all while minimizing any discernible impact on the rendered images.
