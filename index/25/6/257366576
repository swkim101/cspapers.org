Computational thinking is now included in K-5 classrooms and this has led to a demand for new interactive and collaborative learning tools that engage a younger audience. Block-based programming and educational games have both been shown to be effective at engaging children, however they have limitations with respect to supporting collaborative learning and equitable access. Our goal in designing Run, Llama, Run was to build on the positive aspects of block-based programming and educational games while also addressing these limitations. Furthermore, we are using Run, Llama, Run as a platform to explore the trade-offs between digital and tangible interfaces to understand how best to support equitable access while maintaining learning, engagement, and collaboration.
