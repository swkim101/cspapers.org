In this report, we describe the Open Catalyst Challenge held at NeurIPS 2021, focusing on using machine learning (ML) to accelerate the search for low-cost catalysts that can drive reactions converting renewable energy to storable forms. Specifically, the challenge required participants to develop ML approaches for relaxed energy prediction, i
