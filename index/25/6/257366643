There are many researchers in the Computer Science Education field who have moved into this area from a different field of research. This can present challenges for these researchers, who have not come from, and may not currently be in, CSEd research groups where knowledge of the area is plentiful. Key challenges are building networks and getting to know people, conventions, conferences and so on in the field. The proposed session is designed to help those who have moved into the field - whether recently or some years ago - to build connections and share knowledge about how to thrive and progress in the field. Our intention is to build this into an ongoing network that will support those currently in the field with this background as well as those wanting to move into the field in the future.
