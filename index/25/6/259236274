This study presents an improved process able to attain enhanced classification of vestibular dysfunction in clinical examination to provide quantitative evaluation of healthy or vestibular disorders (VD) cases. Associated to vestibular system, vertigo presents an ordinary symptom. Indeed, ocular nystagmus detection can be a baking indication to differentiate between diverse VD. For truthful measurements from eye movement response, the videonystagmography (VNG) technique introduces a vital role in the constantly medical analysis. Yet, vestibular syndromes demonstrate a huge variety in their characteristics that lead to numerous complications for typical VNG examination. The proposed automated approach deals with the discriminant features selection and classification from nystagmus parameters based on four VNG tests that can donate the appreciation of VD diseases. The chief contribution of this paper is the proposal feature reduction by linear discriminant analysis algorithm and classification into three VD categories focused on the support vector machine (SVM) method for estimating the anomalous topics within a reduced processing time. Results on 120 cases including different VD diseases and healthy display the ability of the proposed scheme when compared to the state of the art approaches. The proposed system offers appropriate classification rates and confirms a respectable aptitude for fully computerized VD distinction.
