Project-based learning (PjBL) is a desirable form of active learning that facilitate student engagement, team work and problem solving. Current literature in PjBL have studied the merits, demerits, implementation strategies and the impact of PjBL on student performance. However, PjBL has not been properly studied from the lens of Industry Standard Tools and Practices (IST&Ps). Currently, the specific learning effectiveness of PjBL vis-a-vis IST&Ps are largely unknown. To provide insight into the effectiveness of PjBL in relation to IST&Ps, we implemented PjBL in our class using 5 popular IST (SQL, Atlassian Jira, GitHub, Jenkins, and planning poker) and 3 most common Agile Development practices as ISP. We collected data from 120 students juniors and seniors using RIMMS as our instrument. Data was analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our preliminary results shows that IST&P has significantly positive impact over learning effectiveness, and students' engagement.
