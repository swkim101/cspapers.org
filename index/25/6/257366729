To help students develop a critical eye for human and (increasingly) machine-generated artifacts such as code, documentation, and more, this workshop proposes Refute questions. Students are given an artifact created for a stated purpose and asked: Why does the artifact fail to serve that purpose? Students must provide evidence demonstrating this failure. After a hands-on introduction to Refute questions in their originally proposed context (an alternative to 'Explain in Plain English' questions), participants will receive and review a richer variety of Refute questions for autograded formative and summative assessments, targeting a CS1 course in Python. Then, based on their interest, they will join a subgroup to create theme-specific Refute questions and identify theme-specific challenges such as question-generation and evaluation strategies. Finally, as a group, participants will identify a wish-list of Refute-related tools to be created and research questions to be answered. The workshop caters to a diverse audience: CS instructors at all levels, designers of Intelligent Tutoring Systems and interactive e-books, and CS education researchers.
