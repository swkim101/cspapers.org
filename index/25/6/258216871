Computational toys and apps, or coding kits, are the primary learning media for young children to engage in Computational Thinking concepts and skills. However, how coding kits are designed to welcome children of different genders remains unclear, a critical research gap given that computing is mostly a male-dominated field. Drawing on relevant literature, we develop a framework of gender-related design features in toys (i.e., boy-oriented, girl-oriented, or gender-neutral features) and employ it to examine gender-related design features in commercially available coding kits for young children aged seven and under (N=110). The findings reveal the lopsided gender representation in coding kits, e.g., their physical forms and supported coding activities are predominantly boy-oriented. We discuss design and research implications for coding kits to welcome participation from children of different genders, especially young girls whose preferred design features are underrepresented in current designs.
