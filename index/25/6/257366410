In this poster, we present iCAP (In Class Activity Participation), an Audience Response System (ARS) for student engagement during introductory programming lectures. iCAP is a web-based solution, allowing student access from any laptop, tablet, or phone with access to a modern browser. Therefore, iCAP increases the flexibility and convenience of educator-student interaction. This poster introduces iCAP's functionalities and compares student mastery of learning outcomes among students taught with and without question-based learning methodology.
