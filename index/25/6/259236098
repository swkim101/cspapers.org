Many nations' goals now include the construction and operation of new renewable energy projects. To maximize the utilization of renewable energy, the system must be coupled with energy storage systems (ESSs). To save costs, ESSs must be effectively allocated and sized. To size the ESSs as effectively as possible, several strategies and methodologies have been explored. Moreover, the most effective ESS distribution helps in expense saving and system reliability improvement. This research has devised an efficient way to size and distribute ESSs utilizing AC optimal power flow approach. The proposed technique was assessed using the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system, and the findings supported the suggested technique. The results include optimal sizes and placements for various ESSs to be incorporated into the network. Additionally, a calculation of the system's reliability showed its improvement as a result.
