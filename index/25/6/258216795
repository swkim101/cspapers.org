Inclusive workplaces require mutual efforts between neurotypical (NT) and neurodivergent (ND) employees to understand one another’s viewpoints and experiences. Currently, the majority of inclusivity training places the burden of change on NDs to conform to NT social-behavioral standards. Our research examines moving toward a more equal effort distribution by exploring virtual reality (VR) design opportunities to build NTs’ understanding of ND workplace experiences. Using participatory design, including generative toolkits and design meetings, we surfaced two main themes that could bridge gaps in understanding: (1) NTs’ recognition of NDs’ strengths and efforts at work, and (2) NTs’ understanding of NDs’ differences. We present a strengths-based assessment of ND traits in the workplace, focusing on how workplaces can support NDs’ success. Finally, we propose VR simulation designs that communicate these themes to represent ND experiences, emphasizing their strengths and viewpoints so that NT co-workers can better empathize and accommodate them.
