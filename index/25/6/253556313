It is critical to identify pathogens such as Vibrio Cholera, Escherichia Coli (E. coli), Bacillus Anthracis, and Enterococcus Faecalis, which cause infections in the blood, lungs, and other bodily parts. We present here a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensor-based Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) for the detection of pathogenic bacteria which pollute drinking water. The proposed sensor exhibits excellent performance characteristics, and it has the configuration of detecting analyte samples externally. The sensor is built with a basic square lattice of PCF, covered with a thin chemically stable gold layer. The sensor's performance is studied numerically using a finite element (FE)-based simulation tool, where the highest wavelength sensitivity is found to be 5161 nm/RIU for detecting Enterococcus Faecalis bacteria. Other critical parameters such as Signal to Noise Ratio, Detection Limit, and Sensor Length are also evaluated and presented for the proposed PCF biosensor
