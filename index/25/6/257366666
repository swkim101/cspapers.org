We describe the use of comics to teach computing by having learners create, design, and arrange comic panels. We designed comic-based learning toolkits, guided by the following research question: How do we support the informal learning of computing concepts for elementary school learners through a physical comic-based learning toolkit? This question emerged as a result of our partnership with a community organization that teaches art to elementary school learners through the production and distribution of art subscription boxes. Subscription boxes contain art materials and instruction manuals that learners can use to create artistic artifacts at home. Partnering with the organization, we explored how to teach computing through art activities and designed a subscription box for comic creation activities that used materials such as paper comic panels, coloring pens, magnets, and activity manuals. Our learning toolkits guide learners to use computing concepts in the story-crafting process, for example: decomposing narratives with comic panels, sequencing comic panels to create a narrative flow, using conditionals (e.g., if-else) for character decision-making within the story, using loops to repeat comic story events, and iterating on or refining the comic to create and develop a cohesive narrative flow.
