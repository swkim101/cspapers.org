Grasping of objects using multi-fingered robotic hands often fails due to small uncertainties in the hand motion control and the object's pose estimation. To tackle this problem, we propose a grasping adjustment strategy based on tactile seroving. Our technique employs feedback from a sensorized multi-fingered robotic hand to collaboratively servo the fingers and palm to achieve the desired grasp. We demonstrate the performance of our method through simulation and physical experiments by having a robot grasp different objects under conditions of variable uncertainty. The results show that our approach achieved a higher success rate and tolerated greater uncertainty than an open-looped grasp.
