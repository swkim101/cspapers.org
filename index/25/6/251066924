Recent findings (e.g., arXiv:2103.00065) demonstrate that modern neural networks trained by full-batch gradient descent typically enter a regime called Edge of Stability (EOS). In this regime, the sharpness, i.e., the maximum Hessian eigenvalue, first increases to the value 2/(step size) (the progressive sharpening phase) and then oscillates around this value (the EOS phase). This paper aims to analyze the GD dynamics and the sharpness along the optimization trajectory. Our analysis naturally divides the GD trajectory into four phases depending on the change of the sharpness. We empirically identify the norm of output layer weight as an interesting indicator of sharpness dynamics. Based on this empirical observation, we attempt to theoretically and empirically explain the dynamics of various key quantities that lead to the change of sharpness in each phase of EOS. Moreover, based on certain assumptions, we provide a theoretical proof of the sharpness behavior in EOS regime in two-layer fully-connected linear neural networks. We also discuss some other empirical findings and the limitation of our theoretical results.
