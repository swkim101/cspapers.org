Studying misconceptions, researchers often face a choice between getting insight into students' thinking (using free text interviews) and the number of processed answers (which affects the study's validity). In this poster, we propose a technique of analysis students' answers at free-text questions requiring interpreting program trace lines to study misconceptions of control flow statements. It allows labeling free-text answers for quantitative study and processing them more efficiently than during unstructured interviews while still getting free expressions of students' thoughts.
