Reconnaissance Blind Chess is an imperfect-information variant of chess with significant private information that challenges state-of-the-art algorithms. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and several organizing partners held the second NeurIPS machine Reconnaissance Blind Chess competition in 2021. 18 bots competed in 9,180 games, revealing a dominant champion with 91% wins. The top four bots in the tournament matched or exceeded the performance of the inaugural tournamentâ€™s winner. However, none of the algorithms converge to an optimal, unexploitable strategy or appear to have addressed the core research challenges associated with Reconnaissance Blind Chess.
