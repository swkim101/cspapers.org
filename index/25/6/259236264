Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) leverage computations to operate physical objects in real-world environments, and increasingly more CPS-based applications have been designed for life-critical applications. Therefore, any vulnerability in such a system can lead to severe consequences if exploited by adversaries. In this paper, we present a data predictive recovery system to safeguard the CPS from sensor attacks, assuming that we can identify compromised sensors from data. Our recovery system guarantees that the CPS will never encounter unsafe states and will smoothly recover to a target set within a conservative deadline. It also guarantees that the CPS will remain within the target set for a specified period. Major highlights of our paper include (i) the recovery procedure works on nonlinear systems, (ii) the method leverages uncorrupted sensors to relieve uncertainty accumulation, and (iii) an extensive set of experiments on various nonlinear benchmarks that demonstrate our frameworkâ€™s performance and efficiency.
