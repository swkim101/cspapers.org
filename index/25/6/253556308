In this work, a dual-band, dual-polarized mechanical antenna for 5G MIMO application is proposed. By characterizing the surface currents according to specific resonant modes, the patch antenna structure has been reduced in size while the electrical length remains the same. The proposed antenna covers the n40 and the n41 bands ofthe sub-6 GHz 5G applications with a wide bandwidth of 24% $(\vert \mathrm{S}_{11}\vert$ and $\vert \mathrm{S}_{22}\vert \leq-15\text{dB})$ and a peak gain of 9.2 dBi. In addition, the proposed antenna also has high isolation, and Cross-polar discrimination (XPD) of 25 dB. Due to its mechanical properties, the antenna is a good candidate for mass production and industrial uses.
