Families and youth often interact with artificial intelligence (AI) and are stakeholders in technology. However, while AI can enhance interactions with technology, it is well-known that AI can also be biased and cause harm. Therefore, AI literacy is important, such that users understand both some technical components (e.g., training data, what is and is not AI and why), as well as ethical aspects (e.g., bias in society reflected in AI-powered technology) in order to make informed and empowered decisions about interacting with technologies. AI learning opportunities are scarce, and few leverage informal intergenerational learning as an opportunity for youth to engage with topics in AI and ethics. Games are an underexplored yet promising route for intergenerational play and learning for families and youth without much prior exposure to computing or AI. This talk highlights how and why games are particularly fitting to support families in gaining AI literacy through (1) games as an educational tool to build stronger mental models of AI, (2) intergenerational play as a way to scaffold adults and children in having a dialogue about more complex ethical considerations of AI, and (3) position families in roles of influence, where they may be empowered as techno-social change agents. We believe that games can help fill a gap by making AI literacy, an important family matter, accessible to a range of adult and youth learners.
