Recent news and national reports have significantly increased interest in new approaches for teaching responsible computing to help students understand, evaluate, and address the social impact of existing and emerging computing technologies. This 3-hour workshop will be offered in two workshop format sessions: in-person and online. The first part of each session will introduce responsible computing and its connections to RESPECT and Cultural Competence in Computing (3C). Next, we will provide a short overview of our own work in teaching responsible computing along with frameworks, tools, and best practices. We will showcase four different approaches to teaching responsible computing across institutional settings (high school, college, university), interdisciplinary partnerships (computing, philosophy, STS, digital humanities), and instructional formats (dedicated courses, embedded lessons, design challenges, bootcamps). The workshop presentations will focus on practical advice about how to get started, available resources, securing support from administration and colleagues, and other considerations for this work. In the second half of the workshop, participants will work in small groups to co-design potential lessons based on shared topical interests, institutional settings, and/or learning objectives. Facilitators will provide guidance, recommendations, and classroom examples to help the small groups to complete draft lessons that will be disseminated among workshop participants and on the workshop website. A laptop or internet connected device is needed to participate in the small group activity. Handouts/materials will be provided on the workshop website.
