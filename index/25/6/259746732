Exploration into quantum machine learning has grown
tremendously in recent years due to the ability of quantum
computers to speed up classical programs. However, these ef-
forts have yet to solve unsupervised similarity detection tasks
due to the challenge of porting them to run on quantum com-
puters. To overcome this challenge, we propose SLIQ, the
first open-sourced work for resource-efficient quantum sim-
ilarity detection networks, built with practical and effective
quantum learning and variance-reducing algorithms.
