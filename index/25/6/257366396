In this Birds-of-a-Feather session, we aim to create a collaborative environment for people to explore, share ideas about project-based learning (PBL) and get started on developing and/or revising hands-on projects for their courses. We invite conversations about the need for project-based learning and its impact on students, the challenges of designing and deploying projects, and the value that projects add to the computer science (CS) curriculum. Our goal is multi-fold: 1) To create an open forum for discussing the value and impact of project-based learning 2) To discuss and evaluate the potential and challenges of incorporating projects into the CS curriculum 3) To engage in conversation about the impact of using real-world problems as challenges and inspiration 4) To share expertise and best practices about creating interdisciplinary opportunities for students via the use of projects 5) To discuss the impact on bridging the gap between academia and industry by incorporating ''sponsored" projects into the CS curriculum
