Computational thinking can be deemed as thinking in algorithmic way, with which one can transpose given problems into computer algorithms. Since computational thinking requires abstract reasoning, it should not depend on particular programming languages. Unfortunately, introductory programming courses (CS1) often give students false impression that their goals are to teach a particular programming language. This study shares the design of new pedagogy for CS1 that removes dependency on a particular language and promotes computational thinking by teaching multiple programming languages simultaneously. Specifically, chosen programming languages range from low-level to high-level to expose students to different levels of abstraction from the details of computer architecture. Initial student survey responses from both trial and control groups show that there are significant improvements for the trial groups.
