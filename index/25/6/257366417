Concerns about academic misconduct are nearly ubiquitous among educators, and are especially prevalent in computer science. However most conversations relating to misconduct focus on how students cheat, how to detect when they do, and how to discipline offenders. This emphasis on "detect and punish" can have severe negative consequences, including toxic classroom cultures, adversarial student-staff relationships, and massive mental and emotional workloads for instructors. In this panel, we examine possible root causes for misconduct in CS courses and advocate for shifting the narrative to focus on designing and delivering courses that discourage misconduct by being inclusive and supportive to all students. We also offer concrete suggestions for approaches to reduce mis-conduct through non-punitive means.
