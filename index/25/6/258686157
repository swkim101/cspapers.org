We study the approximability of an existing framework for clustering edge-colored hypergraphs, which is closely related to chromatic correlation clustering and is motivated by machine learning and data mining applications where the goal is to cluster a set of objects based on multiway interactions of different categories or types. We present improved approximation guarantees based on linear programming, and show they are tight by proving a matching integrality gap. Our results also include new approximation hardness results, a combinatorial 2-approximation whose runtime is linear in the hypergraph size, and several new connections to well-studied objectives such as vertex cover and hypergraph multiway cut.
