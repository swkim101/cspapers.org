Application of Robust Control Toolbox for Time Delay Systems implemented in the Matlab system to the oscillating plant with uncertain time delay using the D-K iteration and algebraic approach. The algebraic approach combines the structured singular value, algebraic theory and algorithm of global optimization solving remaining issues in structured singular value framework. The algorithm of global optimization can be alternated with direct search methods such as Nelder-Mead simplex method giving solutions for problems with one local extreme. As a global optimization method, Differential Migration is used proved to be reliable in solving this type of problems. The D-K iteration represents a standard method in the structured singular value theory. The results obtained from the D-K iteration are compared with the algebraic approach.
