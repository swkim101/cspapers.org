Many computer science departments have chosen to hire faculty to teach in teaching-track positions that parallel the standard tenure-track position, providing the possibility of promotion, longer-term contracts, and higher pay for excellence in teaching and service. This birds-of-a-feather is designed to gather educators, both experienced and new to teaching track positions, who are currently in such a position to share their experiences as members of the faculty of their departments and schools. This year, we plan on discussing the impacts of institutional leadership on teaching faculty. Our discussion will encourage teaching faculty to share the extent to which they are included and valued in leadership positions. It will also ask teaching faculty the extent to which they have support and advocacy among non-teaching-faculty leaders at their institutions.
