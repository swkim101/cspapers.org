In Fall 2021, a preliminary study was conducted to gain insight into students' perceptions of the importance of professional dispositions to their computing courses and career. Students filled out a pre-survey, post-assignment reflection exercises, and a post-survey. We found that 1) students rated dispositions as being maximally important for the course and their career on the pre- and post-surveys; 2) students rated dispositions not relevant to the course lower than those that were relevant; and 3) students rated their application of dispositions in course assignments lower than they had rated the importance of the dispositions for success in the course in the pre-survey.
