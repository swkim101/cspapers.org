In our previous works, we presented Logic-Muse as an Intelligent Tutoring System that helps learners improve logical reasoning skills in multiple contexts. Logic-Muse components were validated and argued by experts throughout the designing process (ITS researchers, logicians, and reasoning psychologists). A catalog of reasoning errors (syntactic and semantic) has been established, in addition to an explicit representation of semantic knowledge and the structures and meta-structures underlying conditional reasoning. A Bayesian network with expert validation has been developed and used in a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) process that allows the inference of the learner skills. 
This paper presents an evaluation of the learner-model components in Logic-Muse (a bayesian learner model). We conducted a study and collected data from nearly 300 students who processed 48 reasoning activities. These data were used to develop a psychometric model for initializing the learner's model and validating the structure of the initial Bayesian network. We have also developed a neural architecture on which a model was trained to support a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) process. The proposed neural architecture improves the initial version of DKT by allowing the integration of expert knowledge (through the Bayesian Expert Validation Network) and allowing better generalization of knowledge with few samples. The results show a significant improvement in the predictive power of the learner model. The analysis of the results of the psychometric model also illustrates an excellent potential for improving the Bayesian network's structure and the learner model's initialization process.
