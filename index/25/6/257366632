One of SIGCSE's missions is to provide occasion for K-12 teachers and college/university professors to network, developing understanding of each other's roles as educators and generating ideas for collaborations for the sake of broadening participation in computing. We aim to promote opportunities for researchers and K-12 practitioners to work together in a BoF in order to participate in discussion regarding a)K-12 members' interests regarding CS education research; b) strategies for increasing opportunities for K-12 membersc) researcher/K12 collaborations d) ideas for future grants and/or collaborations The expected audience are the college/university faculty interested in K-12 education, as well as K-12 teachers or administrators interested in college/university CS education research. Regarding K-12/University collaborations, one might only think of the benefits to students. Yet, opportunities for learning and growth on the part of teachers and university faculty as work partners fosters motivation on both sides. This unexpected, valuable outcome has been documented in the literature as well [1,2,3]. The organizers of this BoF each have valued the learning from such collaborations and represent various roles as collaborative researchers from both sides.
