This paper studies a novel social commerce practice known as "help-and-haggle," whereby an online consumer can ask friends to help her "haggle" over the price of a product. Each time a friend agrees to help, the price is cut by a random amount, and if the consumer cuts the product price down to zero within a time limit, she will get the product for free; otherwise, the product reverts to the original price. Help-and-haggle enables the firm to promote its product and boost its social reach as consumers effectively refer their friends to the firm. We model the consumer's dynamic referral behavior in help-and-haggle and solve for the optimal price-cut distribution for the firm that trades off social reach, promotion expense, and product sales. Our results are as follows.
