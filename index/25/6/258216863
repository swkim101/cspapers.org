Virtual exhibitions have long been regarded as an extension of information delivery for physical exhibitions. However, what virtual exhibitions can offer audiences as a novel experience independently from physical exhibitions has been largely unexplored. In this study, we aim to understand the promises and challenges of experiencing and curating exhibitions in VR by interviewing nine expert curators. Drawing from expert insights, we summarized a set of design guidelines to inform what we can learn and adapt from physical exhibitions when curating in VR. Then, using an autobiographical design approach, we curated an interactive exhibition in VRChat to explore novel interaction techniques. We also hosted an open tour guide in the user study to validate our design guidelines with thirty participants. Results show that our approach of curating an exhibition in VRChat provided the participants with engaging and novel experiences interacting with the exhibits and other audiences.
