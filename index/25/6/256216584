In this work, a thermoelectric generator was manufactured in order to study its operation in evaporative systems of liquefied natural gas and further refine its design to increase the efficiency of energy recovery inherent in liquefied natural gas during its liquefaction. As a result of the tests, a power of 2.2 W was obtained at a nitrogen flow rate of 10.17 g / s, design flaws were noted, which can be eliminated to increase the generator efficiency.
