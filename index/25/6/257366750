SIGCSE is packed with teaching insights and inspiration. However, we get these insights and inspiration from hearing our colleagues talk about their teaching. Why not watch them teach? This session does exactly that! Six exceptional educators will present innovative content just as they would to their students. The moderator, Colleen Lewis, will describe their pedagogical moves and how they connect to education research. The goal of the session is to inspire SIGCSE attendees by highlighting innovative instruction by exceptional educators. Attendees can adopt the content and/or pedagogical moves from each microteaching example.
