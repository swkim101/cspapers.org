Modern software systems heavily rely on external libraries developed by third-parties to ensure efficient development. However, frequent library upgrades can lead to compatibility issues between the libraries and their client systems. In this paper, we introduce Compsuite, a dataset that includes 123 real-world Java client-library pairs where upgrading the library causes an incompatibility issue in the corresponding client. Each incompatibility issue in Compsuite is associated with a test case authored by the developers, which can be used to reproduce the issue. The dataset also provides a command-line interface that simplifies the execution and validation of each issue. With this infrastructure, users can perform an inspection of any incompatibility issue with the push of a button, or reproduce an issue step-by-step for a more detailed investigation. We make Compsuite publicly available to promote open science. We believe that various software analysis techniques, such as compatibility checking, debugging, and regression test selection, can benefit from Compsuite. The demonstration video of Compsuite is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DQGsGs_65s.
