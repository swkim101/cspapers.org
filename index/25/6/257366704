This session takes inspiration from the highly successful "Nifty Assignments" special session, but instead highlights high quality multiple-choice questions that can be used for Peer Instruction. Peer Instruction is a pedagogical practice characterized by asking students to answer challenging, conceptual questions in class. For each question, students individually respond, discuss the question in small groups, and respond again based on their new understanding. Peer Instruction has been widely identified as an important instructional technique in teaching computing. In this session, members of the community will present some of their best Peer Instruction questions along with a short explanation that provides the pedagogical content knowledge indicating why the question is a good question. If you are interested in learning more about Peer Instruction or finding new questions for your course(s), this session is for you.
