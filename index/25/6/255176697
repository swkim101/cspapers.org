Predicting object motion behaviour is a challenging but crucial task for safe decision making and path planning for an autonomous vehicle. It is challenging in large part due to the uncertain, multi-modal, and practically intractable set of possible agent-agent and agent-space interactions, especially in urban driving settings. Models solely based on constant velocity or social force have an inherent bias and may lead to inaccurate predictions across the prediction horizon whereas purely data driven approaches suffer from a lack of a holistic set of rules governing predictions. We tackle this problem by introducing MPC-PF: a novel potential field-based trajectory predictor that incorporates social interaction and is able to tradeoff between inherent model biases across the prediction horizon. Through evaluation on a variety of common urban driving scenarios, we show that our model is capable of producing accurate predictions for both short and long term timesteps. We also demonstrate the significance of our model architecture through an ablation study.
