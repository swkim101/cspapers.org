Is it worth and feasible to push mobile core network functions to low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations? While this paradigm is being tested in space and promises new values, it also raises scalability, performance, and security concerns based on our study with datasets from operational satellites and 5G. A major challenge is today's stateful mobile core, which suffers from signaling storms in satellites' extreme mobility, intermittent failures in outer space, and attacks when unavoidably exposed to untrusted foreign locations. To this end, we make a case for a stateless mobile core in space. Our solution, SpaceCore, decouples states from orbital core functions, simplifies location states via geospatial addressing, eliminates unnecessary state migrations in satellite mobility by shifting to geospatial service areas, and localizes state retrievals with device-as-the-repository. Our evaluation with datasets from operational satellites and 5G shows SpaceCore's 17.5Ã— over existing solutions signaling reductions and resiliency to failures/attacks.
