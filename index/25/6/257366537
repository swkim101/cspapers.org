Equitable instruction requires that students who are part of a linguistic minority (i.e., they use a language different from that of the majority in their area) are provided instruction that allows them to accomplish course goals. To date, studies on the experience of novice programmers who are in a linguistic minority are quite rare. This poster is an effort to address that gap: it examines the programming process data of students learning Java (n = 2,621) from around the world, some of whom were a linguistic minority. Results indicate that there are statistically significant differences between students in linguistic minorities and majorities for two types of interaction with the IDE: editing events and file events. This finding is one step toward understanding the programming behavior of linguistic minorities.
