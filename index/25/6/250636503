Chronic disease management involves frequent administration of invasive lab procedures in order for

clinicians to determine the best course of treatment

regimes for these patients. However, patients are

often put off by these invasive lab procedures and

do not follow the appointment schedules. This has

resulted in poor management of their chronic conditions leading to unnecessary disease complications. An AI system that is able to personalize the

prediction of individual patient lab test responses

will enable clinicians to titrate the medications to

achieve the desired therapeutic outcome. Accurate prediction of lab test response is a challenge because these patients typically have co-morbidities and their treatments might influence the target lab test response. To address this,

we model the complex interactions among different medications, diseases, lab test response, and

fine-grained dosage information to learn a strong

patient representation. Together with information

from similar patients and external knowledge such

as drug-lab interactions and diagnosis-lab interaction, we design a system called KALP to perform

personalized prediction of patients’ response for a

target lab result and identify the top influencing

factors for the prediction. Experiment results on

real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of

KALP in reducing prediction errors by a significant

margin. Case studies show that the identified factors are consistent with clinicians’ understanding.
