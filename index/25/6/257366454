College Board's Advanced Placement® Program (AP®) enables academically prepared students to pursue college-level studies while still in high school. AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) introduces students to the breadth of computer science. AP CSP teachers need more ready-made resources for students who are absent from class. These teachers need a way to convey the most important technical concepts that absent students miss as well as a way to assess these students' learning to prepare them for the AP exam best. This project entailed the development of Kahoot interactive lessons that AP CSP teachers can assign to students to teach, reinforce, and assess important computer science and programming concepts. These lessons consist of terminology, a video to explain the concept(s), and checks for understanding. Twelve Kahoot interactive lessons and an instructor guide were created and published online.
