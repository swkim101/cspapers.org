Network binarization (i.e., binary neural networks, BNNs) can efficiently compress deep neural networks and accelerate model inference but cause severe accuracy degradation. Existing BNNs are mainly implemented based on the commonly used full-precision network backbones, and then the accuracy is improved with various techniques. However, there is a question of whether the full-precision network backbone is well adapted to BNNs. We start from the factors of the performance degradation of BNNs and analyze the problems of directly using full-precision network backbones for BNNs: for a given computational budget, the backbone of a BNN may need to be shallower and wider compared to the backbone of a full-precision network. With this in mind, Depth-Width Reshaping (DWR) is proposed to reshape the depth and width of existing full-precision network backbones and further optimize them by incorporating pruning techniques to better fit the BNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the analytical result and the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the original backbones, the DWR backbones constructed by the proposed method result in close to O(âˆšs) decrease in activations, while achieving an absolute accuracy increase by up to 1.7% with comparable computational cost. Besides, by using the DWR backbones, existing methods can achieve new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy (e.g., 67.2% on ImageNet with ResNet-18 as the original backbone). We hope this work provides a novel insight into the backbone design of BNNs. The code is available at https://github.com/pingxue-hfut/DWR.
