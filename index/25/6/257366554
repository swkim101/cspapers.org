This special session furthers the work associated with SIGCSE Reads and the growing community of SIGCSE members who connect to each other through science fiction. This session extends the experiences of earlier sessions by addressing the global and cultural experiences that our students will face in the computing profession through examining works of fiction. The work of the special session will involve diving into the cultural context of this year's SIGCSE Reads stories with discussion about how this experience can be translated to the classroom, with the goal of better preparing students to consider their computing degrees and careers in a pluralistic, global, equitable and just context.
