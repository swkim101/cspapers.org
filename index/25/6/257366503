The Source Academy is a community-built immersive online environment for learning computing with the book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP). An interactive version of the textbook is integrated into the system, and the programming environment of the Source Academy allows learners to focus on SICP-specific sublanguages of JavaScript (Python and Scheme versions in preparation). The environment includes tools to support SICP's mental models for computational processes and data, including a stepper that animates the substitution model of Chapter 1, a data visualizer that supports the box-and-pointer diagrams of Chapter 2, and a visualizer for the environment model of Chapter 3. The system is web-based (no software installation required) and supports dynamically loadable plugins (modules) for programming with graphics, audio, image, and video processing. An extension called Source Academy @ X provides Learning Management System features such as the management of programming assessments and their manual and automatic grading. Source Academy @ X includes gamification components such as achievements, contests, levels, and a game that offers a narrative to contextualize the assessments. The 45-minute demo provides CS educators with an overview of the Source Academy, including its tools, modules, and textbook integration, the Source Academy @ X extension for course management and a preview of Python and Scheme versions.
