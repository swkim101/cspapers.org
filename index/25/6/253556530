This paper describes an industrial wireless LAN system that includes the media access control and physical layer. The proposed system can support both synchronous and asynchronous communication which are mostly known as EtherCAT and RS-232C, respectively. The experimental results on hardware boards show the spectrum of our proposed system corresponding with the parameters set. In addition, the communication error rate of the proposed system is also considered in this paper. By formulating the communication error rate, we can quantitatively evaluate the communication performance and reduce the verification time. In the simulation result, we evaluate that the communication quality required for an industrial system is satisfied.
