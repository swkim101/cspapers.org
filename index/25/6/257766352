In practice, encoding invariances into models helps sample complexity. In this work, we tighten and generalize theoretical results on how invariances improve sample complexity. In particular, we provide minimax optimal rates for kernel ridge regression on any manifold, with a target function that is invariant to an arbitrary group action on the manifold. Our results hold for (almost) any group action, even groups of positive dimension. For a finite group, the gain increases the"effective"number of samples by the group size. For groups of positive dimension, the gain is observed by a reduction in the manifold's dimension, in addition to a factor proportional to the volume of the quotient space. Our proof takes the viewpoint of differential geometry, in contrast to the more common strategy of using invariant polynomials. Hence, this new geometric viewpoint on learning with invariances may be of independent interest.
