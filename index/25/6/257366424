Cybersecurity education domain comprises of different curriculum design and teaching methods such as traditional lecture-based instruction, lectures coupled with lab exercises, peer instruction teaching, and concept maps. Traditional lectures combined with hands-on exercises is often the instructional de facto in this discipline. However, these narrowly-focused hands-on exercises such as NDG Netlabs, are typically designed in a hand holding fashion where students are instructed to follow a step-by-step approach to complete a series of tasks associated to the topic. A key missing piece in this pedagogy is the absence of problem solving & critical thinking skills. Hence, the approach fails short in providing students with an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of often complex and invariably intertwined cybersecurity concepts - a norm in the real world cybersecurity incidents. The authors believe that problem-based learning (PBL) pedagogy holds substantial promise in addressing these shortcomings and improving student learning in cybersecurity education. The project proposes a PBL approach for a ethical hacking and network defense curriculum.
