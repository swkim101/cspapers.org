Computing departments increasingly use synchronous remote learning (SRL) to offer courses. This poster reports on initial survey results to better understand undergraduate computing students' experiences with SRL as compared to in-person educational environments, particularly the extent to which SRL fulfilled their needs for developing social bonds with faculty and other students. Regardless of demographic categories, students feel that social presence factors in classes are important and find in-person environments better at accommodating them.
