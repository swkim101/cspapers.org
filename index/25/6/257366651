Traditional assessment of students' ability to learn course material is often based against individual or group achievement through tests, homework, quizzes, project, etc. The standard for achievement on such assignments are often based on a standard for what is 'correct' or a rubric and students are rated against that standard. The purpose of this birds of a feather session is to brainstorm engagement and assessment involving student versus student interactions. Can competition between students be a useful tool for student engagement in the classroom? Does direct student-to-student competitions provide an adequate assessment of student success? Do learning objectives in computer science (CS) and software engineering (SE) lead to topics in competition? The goal is to consider existing and new platforms for competition in CS and SE as well as discuss reflections from others who have had success and/or failures.
