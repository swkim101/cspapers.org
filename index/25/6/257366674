Providing Computer Science (CS) students with a proper case study for Mobile App Programming and IT Project Management courses is challenging, especially when it should be focussed on the vital issues and differ every year. The authors as the research and didactic staff are involved in the multidisciplinary R&D project called Friendly City, which aims to promote the accessibility of architectural heritage to the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community by adding Audio Descriptions (AD) to 85 public places in Lodz (Poland). That is why the IT targets of the project were chosen as a case study in the mentioned courses. CS students as well as History of Art and Psychology ones with BVI or sighted beneficiaries play a crucial role during both courses. They will be working with the Lodz BVI Association to prepare their final project solution.
