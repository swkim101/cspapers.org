Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, institutions have had to shift and adapt rapidly to the ever-changing academic landscape. In response, several new, short-term initiatives were set in motion and new policies were, at least temporarily, adopted to support this rapid change. In computer science, specifically, there were new tools utilized, new modes of delivery employed, and new community engagement practices embraced. As a side effect of all this change, an evolving set of faculty and student expectations emerged. The results of two ITiCSE working groups, looking at the impacts of pandemic-related changes to the educational landscape from the perspective of faculty [1] and students [2], are presented. These are shared with an eye towards identifying strategic change and initiatives that might benefit the future of computing. Academic and administrative leaders within computer science share their thoughts regarding the future direction of computer science and strategic opportunities that can be leveraged. Through this session, a community of practice will be formed in order to catalyze knowledge sharing amongst leaders in computer science who are working to build upon the strategic initiatives that took place during this time of rapid change.
