Equitable computer science (CS) instruction for marginalized students and in poor communities everywhere is hindered by social barriers such as 1) the lack of teacher expertise with knowledge to positively engage marginalized students in CS, especially in Advanced Placement CS courses, and 2) racially segregated communities and schools that permeate in states like Georgia, and others across the nation. The racial segregation of students, including but not limited to Native American, Black and Hispanic groups, keeps them perpetually locked out of quality CS education. That said, AP CS Principles often provides the first AP STEM experience for Black, Hispanic, and first-generation students who take it. Furthermore, students who take AP CS Principles are more likely to declare a STEM or CS major in college [1]. Leaders of this BOF will provide opportunities for CS educators, researchers, and practitioners to discuss their efforts on broadening participation in computing at the high school level, and participants will also be able to generate recommendations and strategies that move efforts toward ensuring equity in AP CS courses for historically underrepresented students in CS.
