Cybersecurity is a growing job field--and even for students who don't go on to pursue cybersecurity careers, it is crucial to have some level of security awareness. But until recently, the intrigue and opportunity of cybersecurity was usually not introduced until advanced undergraduate CS courses. However, the real world implications and applied nature of the topic lends itself well to catching the interest of a diverse group of students in CS at a younger age. The Teaching Security lessons (available at teachingsecurity.org for free) introduce the foundational ideas of cybersecurity through threat modeling and exploring the human aspects of identity and authentication. They were prepared by subject-matter experts with research backgrounds in cybersecurity. Our lessons are appropriate for any high school or introductory undergrad computer science class or program, and no previous cybersecurity background or teaching experience is required for attendees. In the interactive workshop, we will model the Teaching Security lessons. Participants will learn how to begin developing the "security mindset" by teaching students a simplified version of threat modeling. We will also model lessons on authentication and social engineering. The workshop will also provide opportunities for attendees who have taught cybersecurity to share their own strategies.
