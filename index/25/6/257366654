As the CS for All movement grows, school leaders are increasingly looking for examples of successful and equitable implementation at the local level. This panel, featuring members of a research- practice partnership, lifts up case studies of three disparate local education agencies and how they scaled and sustained equitable computer science education in their local context. Each study focuses on a different aspect of equitable computer science implementation: building computer science education capacity for teachers; partnering with families and local industry; and getting a computer science-focused resolution passed through the school board of a large district. These case studies will be presented alongside the CS Equity Guide and Workshop, resources developed by school administrators for their colleagues across the state. Panelists will discuss how their specific contexts framed the specific implementation effort, and how a multi- faceted approach to computer science implementation can assist with equity at the forefront of these efforts.
