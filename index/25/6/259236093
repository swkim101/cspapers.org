Ensuring the data integrity of messages transmitted over the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus and other vehicular networks is achieved through the implementation of cryptographic authentication protocols. However, these protocols raise concerns about a significant increase in response time due to the restrictions on CAN frame size and bandwidth. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact on response time of CAN and CAN Flexible Data-rate (CAN FD) messages with the implementation of cryptographic message authentication codes (MACs) and the periodic transmission of these codes. Our evaluation is based on a randomized schedulability experiment to provide insights into the overhead incurred by adding authentication to the frame payloads.
