Topic models are powerful tools to get an overview of large collections of text data, a situation that is prevalent in industry applications. A rising trend within topic modeling is to directly cluster dimension-reduced embed-dings created with pretrained language models. It is difficult to evaluate these models because there is no ground truth and automatic measurements may not mimic human judgment. To address this problem, we created a tool called STELLAR for interactive topic browsing which we used for human evaluation of topics created from a real-world dataset used in industry. Embeddings created with BERT were used together with UMAP and HDBSCAN to model the topics. The human evaluation found that our topic model creates coherent topics. The following discussion revolves around the requirements of industry and what research is needed for production-ready systems.
