Quantum computing (QC) is a rapidly growing field linking the disciplines of mathematics, physics, and computer science. CS students and software developers are a natural talent pool for the future QC workforce, but existing QC simulation and visualization tools are not designed with their background in mind. We present QC.py, a full-featured, open-source Python simulation and visualization tool for quantum circuits, with a feature set tailored to the background of CS students and software practitioners.
