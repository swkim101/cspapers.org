This workshop will introduce computer science teachers (both secondary and post-secondary) to Runestone ebooks and highlight some exciting new features including support for Peer Instruction and new types of Parsons problems. Runestone Interactive (See http://runestone.academy) is an open-source platform for free ebooks. The ebooks support coding in the browser, code visualization/stepping, and a wide variety of practice activities, including multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and mixed-up code (Parsons) problems. The Parsons problems are adaptive, which means that the difficulty of a problem is based on a learner's performance. Over 30 free textbooks are available including ones for CS1, CS2, web development, data science, discrete math, and Advanced Placement (AP) CS (both courses). The presenters have several years of experience creating and using Runestone ebooks. Several studies have demonstrated good usability and positive learning and attitude impacts on students using these ebooks. Participants will gain hands-on experience with the interactive features. Participants will learn how to use the instructor tools which allow them to create a custom course, enroll students in a custom course, create assignments, grade assignments, view student progress, and optionally require use of a spaced practice tool. Participants will also try out the new support for Peer Instruction and new types of Parsons problems. Laptop Required.
