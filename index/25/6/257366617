"Proof Buddy" is an online browser based tool designed to teach proof writing to beginning computer science students. It has been designed from the ground up with educational purposes in mind and has been used successfully with hundreds of students since January 2022 at Drexel University. The tool helps students build and check proofs in a variety of systems. It is capable of doing Natural Deduction, both Boolean logic and first order logic, and is being extended to Equational Reasoning. Important instructor-centered features include that the teacher can create assignments of proof problems, which the software can auto score and have results uploaded into their school's LMS. Additionally, the tool allows proofs to be saved and exported and used as new rules. When this feature is used by the instructor, it permits a customization of the allowable rules. When this feature is used by the students, it allows them to create their own lemmas which reduces the cognitive load of a more intricate proof.
