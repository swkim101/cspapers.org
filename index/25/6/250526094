Using machine learning to solve combinatorial optimization (CO) problems is challenging, especially when the data is unlabeled. This work proposes an unsupervised learning framework for CO problems. Our framework follows a standard relaxation-plus-rounding approach and adopts neural networks to parameterize the relaxed solutions so that simple back-propagation can train the model end-to-end. Our key contribution is the observation that if the relaxed objective satisfies entry-wise concavity, a low optimization loss guarantees the quality of the final integral solutions. This observation significantly broadens the applicability of the previous framework inspired by Erdos' probabilistic method. In particular, this observation can guide the design of objective models in applications where the objectives are not given explicitly while requiring being modeled in prior. We evaluate our framework by solving a synthetic graph optimization problem, and two real-world applications including resource allocation in circuit design and approximate computing. Our framework largely outperforms the baselines based on na\"{i}ve relaxation, reinforcement learning, and Gumbel-softmax tricks.
