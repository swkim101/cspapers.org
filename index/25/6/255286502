The paper evaluates the factors caused by the massive construction of renewable energy sources (RES), which in turn reduce their energy efficiency, and the significant generation capacity, which depends on weather conditions, causes difficulty in balancing the modes of electric power systems. General-purpose electrical networks are used to transmit the electricity generated by them. They affect the technical and economic parameters of electrical networks. In particular, with an increase in the amount of electricity in the balance of electric power systems (EPS). 
A method of structuring electricity losses caused by power flows in electrical networks, which appear in them from green generation, is proposed, which will make it possible to increase the efficiency of RES use in mode balancing by including them in the generation schedule for the next day. As a consequence of improving the accuracy of generation forecasting, which increases the energy efficiency of such sources. 
The method is based on a mathematical model of the electrical network for determining losses, in which current distribution coefficients in circuits from RES nodes and node voltages are used. As a result, a matrix of power loss distribution coefficients in lines is formed, which depends on the flow of power along the line from each circuit node. To form the array of data needed to determine losses, the steady-state mode of the electrical network is calculated or experimental measurement data is used. It is shown that the values of electricity losses in electrical networks caused by RES can be used during the operational planning of the electricity balance in the UES and, since they are addressable, their cost can be compensated accordingly.
