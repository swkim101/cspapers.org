In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid representation and end-to-end trainable network architecture to model fully editable and customizable neural avatars. At the core of our work lies a representation that combines the modeling power of neural fields with the ease of use and inherent 3D consistency of skinned meshes. To this end, we construct a trainable feature codebook to store local geometry and texture features on the vertices of a deformable body model, thus exploiting its consistent topology under articulation. This representation is then employed in a generative auto-decoder architecture that admits fitting to unseen scans and sampling of realistic avatars with varied appearances and geometries. Furthermore, our representation allows local editing by swapping local features between 3D assets. To verify our method for avatar creation and editing, we contribute a new highquality dataset, dubbed CustomHumans, for training and evaluation. Our experiments quantitatively and qualitatively show that our method generates diverse detailed avatars and achieves better model fitting performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our code and dataset are available at https://ait.ethz.ch/customhumans.
