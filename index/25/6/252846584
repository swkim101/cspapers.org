Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are finding use in applications that place increasing emphasis on robustness to external disturbances including extreme wind. However, traditional multirotor UAV platforms do not directly sense wind; conventional flow sensors are too slow, insensitive, or bulky for widespread integration on UAVs. Instead, drones typically observe the effects of wind indirectly through accumulated errors in position or trajectory tracking. In this work, we integrate a novel flow sensor based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) hot-wire technology developed in our prior work [1] onto a multirotor UAV for wind estimation. Our sensor is omnidirectional (in the plane), lightweight, fast, and accurate. In order to achieve superior hover performance in windy conditions, we train a ‘wind-aware’ residual-based controller via reinforcement learning using simulated wind gusts and their aerodynamic effects on the drone. In extensive hardware experiments, we demonstrate the wind-aware controller out-performing two strong ‘wind-unaware’ baseline controllers in challenging windy conditions. See: youtu.be/KWqkH9Z-338.
