Community Colleges provide a variety of academic and terminal degrees, such as associates in applied science and certificates of completion. Data Science is considered an emerging computing area that spans many areas of study and impacts academics and the workforce. The ACM published in 2021 Data Science Task Force Computing Competencies for Undergraduate Data Science Curricula, a curricular report articulates the role of computing discipline-specific contributions to this emerging field. Although this report counts 12 knowledge areas that impact academics and industry, there is an opportunity to align these areas in a two-year context. In this poster, we present the adoption of the ACM report from a two-year perspective.
