In this paper, a broadband reconfigurable reflectarray antenna (RRA) based on a polarization rotation unit cell is proposed. The reconfigurable polarization rotation unit cell utilizes just a single substrate layer and 4 PIN diodes. By switching ON/OFF states of PIN diodes, the reflective phase of the unit cell shifts 180°. A 16×16 RRA is designed, showing an excellent 1-dB gain bandwidth, from 12.5 GHz to 16 GHz in the YOZ plane. The proposed RRA also has a good 2D beam scanning performance with an angle range from − 50° to + 50°.
