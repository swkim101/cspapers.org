In response to the persistent diversity gap that exists in the computing field, we implemented a five-day professional development (PD) workshop for elementary teachers on integrating computational thinking (CT) and culturally responsive teaching (CRT) practices into their existing science instruction. An explicit focus of this PD was to engage teachers in analyzing CT- and CRT-integrated science classroom scenarios (i.e., vignettes). Our analyses of video and written data of teachers' vignette responses indicate that while their understanding of CT increased as a result of the PD, the teachers need additional support around CRT. We suggest that future studies explore how teachers define and enact CRT, especially within their unique contexts.
