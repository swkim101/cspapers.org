This paper proposes a simplified judgment to improve decoding performance of physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) format 2 using Reed-Muller code in fifth-generation new radio (5G NR). In this paper, descrambled sequence is divided into two halves and they are sequentially decoded. To obtain information bits and transmission state, this paper only compares decoding results of two halves with the full sequence instead of considering the additional result between two halves. In other words, discontinuous transmission (DTX) judgment becomes less strictly in order to reduce acknowledge missed detection probability (PACK). As a result, decoding process is not only simpler but it also offers significant improvement in terms of PACK. On the other hand, DTX to ACK probability (PDTX) is steadily managed within the allowable threshold although it is slightly increased due to the trade-off relationship with PACK. Feasibility of the proposed method is experimentally validated with different receiving antenna numbers under practical condition. The acquired results shows that the proposed approach is suitable for practical applications since it fully complies with all technical requirements by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP).
