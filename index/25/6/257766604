Despite the recent emergence of video captioning models, how to generate vivid, fine-grained video descriptions based on the background knowledge (i.e., long and informative commentary about the domain-specific scenes with appropriate reasoning) is still far from being solved, which however has great applications such as automatic sports narrative. Based on soccer game videos and synchronized commentary data, we present GOAL, a benchmark of over 8.9k soccer video clips, 22k sentences, and 42k knowledge triples for proposing a challenging new task setting as Knowledge-grounded Video Captioning (KGVC). We experimentally test existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on this resource to demonstrate the future directions for improvement in this challenging task. We hope that our data resource (now available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/goal) can serve researchers and developers interested in knowledge-grounded cross-modal applications.
