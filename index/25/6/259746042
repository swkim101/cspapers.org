Multi-label classification (MLC), which assigns multiple labels to each instance, is crucial to domains from computer vision to text mining. Conventional methods for MLC require huge amounts of labeled data to capture complex dependencies between labels. However, such labeled datasets are expensive, or even impossible, to acquire. Worse yet, these pre-trained MLC models can only be used for the particular label set covered in the training data. Despite this severe limitation, few methods exist for expanding the set of labels predicted by pre-trained models. Instead, we acquire vast amounts of new labeled data and retrain a new model from scratch. Here, we propose combining the knowledge from multiple pre-trained models (teachers) to train a new student model that covers the union of the labels predicted by this set of teachers. This student supports a broader label set than any one of its teachers without using labeled data. We call this new problem knowledge amalgamation for multi-label classification. Our new method, Adaptive KNowledge Transfer (ANT), trains a student by learning from each teacherâ€™s partial knowledge of label dependencies to infer the global dependencies between all labels across the teachers. We show that ANT succeeds in unifying label dependencies among teachers, outperforming five state-of-the-art methods on eight real-world datasets.
