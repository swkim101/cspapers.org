In this paper, we present Health Buddy, a voice agent integrated into commercially available Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) to support informal self-regulated learning (SRL) of health-related topics through multiple learning strategies and examine the efficacy of Health Buddy on learning outcomes for younger and older adults. We conducted a mixed-factorial-design experiment with 26 younger and 25 older adults, assigned to three SRL strategies (within-subjects): monologue, dialogue-based scaffolding building, and conceptual diagramming. We found that while younger adults benefit more from scaffolding building and conceptual diagramming, both younger and older adults showed equivalent learning outcomes. Furthermore, interaction fluency (operationalized by the number of conversational breakdowns) was associated with learning outcomes regardless of age. While older adults did not experience less fluent conversations, interaction fluency affected their technology acceptance toward VUIs more than younger ones. Our study discusses age-related learning differences and has implications for designing VUI-based learning programs for older adults.
