Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved outstanding achievements in abstractive single-document summarization (SDS). However, such benefits may not fully extend to multi-document summarization (MDS), where the handling of cross-document information is more complex. Previous works either design new MDS architectures or apply PLMs bluntly with concatenated source documents as a reformulated SDS task. While the former does not utilize previous pre-training efforts and may not generalize well across different domains, the latter may not sufficiently attend to the intricate cross-document relationships unique to MDS tasks. Instead, we enforce hierarchy on both the encoder and decoder to better utilize a PLM to facilitate multi-document interactions for the MDS task. Across 10 MDS benchmarks from various domains, our method outperforms or is competitive with the previous best models, including those with additional MDS pre-training or with more parameters. It outperforms its corresponding PLM backbone by up to 3 Rouge-L and is favored by humans.
