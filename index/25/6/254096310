Applications such as employees sharing office spaces over a workweek
can be modeled as problems where agents are matched to resources
over multiple rounds. Agents' requirements limit the set of compatible
resources and the rounds in which they want to be matched. Viewing such an
application as a multi-round matching problem on a bipartite compatibility
graph between agents and resources, we show that a solution 
(i.e., a set of matchings, with one matching per round) can be found
efficiently if one exists. To cope with situations where a solution does not exist, we consider two extensions. In
the first extension, a benefit function is defined for each agent and the
objective is to find a multi-round matching to maximize the total benefit. For a
general class of benefit functions satisfying certain properties (including
diminishing returns), we show that this multi-round matching problem is
efficiently solvable. This class includes utilitarian and Rawlsian welfare
functions. 
For another benefit function, we show that the maximization
problem is NP-hard. 
In the second extension, the objective is to generate advice to
each agent (i.e., a subset of requirements to be relaxed) subject to a
budget constraint so that the agent can be matched.
We show that this budget-constrained advice generation problem is NP-hard.
For this problem, we develop an integer linear programming formulation as well
as a heuristic based on local search.
 We experimentally evaluate our algorithms on
synthetic networks and apply them to two real-world situations: shared
office spaces and matching courses to classrooms.
