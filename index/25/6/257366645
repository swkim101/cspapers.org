Mobile application development is an increasingly common and popular elective in computer science departments. This course can be an ideal vessel to introduce, or cement the understanding of multiple concepts covered in other computer science courses, such as UI design, networking, multi-threading and software engineering. The existence of multiple platforms for mobile application development and the absence of standard textbooks on the topic has led to the creation of a great variety of courses taught at many different levels. The purpose of this BoF is to enable instructors of mobile application development courses to exchange ideas about their courses and their learning goals, and how the platform, teaching methods and assignments they use enable them to reach these goals. Topics of discussion could include, but need not be limited to: platforms and languages used, topics covered, favorite assignments, assessment and difficulties encountered when teaching the course. This BoF may also be of interest to instructors who would like to develop a mobile application development course. This should be a great opportunity for them to learn the variety of options available to them in this course.
