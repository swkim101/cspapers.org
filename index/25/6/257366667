Women and people from historically marginalized groups are recognized as underrepresented in computer science (CS) courses. We approach this issue by building a K-12 teacher workforce as role models to K-12 students. In this project, we develop a K-12 CS Educator Certificate Program and provide scholarships to 20 Black, Latina, and Native American women in-service teachers. To support these scholars, we provided a community of practice that includes mentoring from experienced CS educators and flexible tutoring from CS content experts. Through these efforts to increase diversity and representation in those who teach CS, we are making strides toward all students seeing themselves in the field of CS.
