Precise and accurate predictions over boundary areas are essential for semantic segmentation. However, the commonly-used convolutional operators tend to smooth and blur local detail cues, making it difficult for deep models to generate accurate boundary predictions. In this paper, we introduce an operator-level approach to enhance semantic boundary awareness, so as to improve the prediction of the deep semantic segmentation model. Specifically, we first formulate the boundary feature enhancement as an anisotropic diffusion process. We then propose a novel learnable approach called semantic diffusion network (SDN) to approximate the diffusion process, which contains a parameterized semantic difference convolution operator followed by a feature fusion module. Our SDN aims to construct a differentiable mapping from the original feature to the inter-class boundary-enhanced feature. The proposed SDN is an efficient and flexible module that can be easily plugged into existing encoder-decoder segmentation models. Extensive experiments show that our approach can achieve consistent improvements over several typical and state-of-the-art segmentation baseline models on challenging public benchmarks. The code will be released soon.
