When vibrations are synchronized with our actions, we experience them as material properties. This has been used to create virtual experiences like friction, counter-force, compliance, or torsion. Implementing such experiences is non-trivial, requiring high temporal resolution in sensing, high fidelity tactile output, and low latency. To make this style of haptic feedback more accessible to non-domain experts, we present Haptic Servos: self-contained haptic rendering devices which encapsulate all timing-critical elements. We characterize Haptic Servosâ€™ real-time performance, showing the system latency is <5 ms. We explore the subjective experiences they can evoke, highlighting that qualitatively distinct experiences can be created based on input mapping, even if stimulation parameters and algorithm remain unchanged. A workshop demonstrated that users new to Haptic Servos require approximately ten minutes to set up a basic haptic rendering system. Haptic Servos are open source, we invite others to copy and modify our design.
