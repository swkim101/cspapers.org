 Deterministic optimization may lead to unreliable design results if significant uncertainty exists. Including reliability constraints in reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) can solve such a problem. It is difficult to use current RBDO methods to deal with time- and space-independent reliability when responses vary randomly with respect to time and space. This study employs an envelope method for time- and space-dependent reliability for the optimal design. To achieve high accuracy, we propose an inverse envelope method that converts a time- and space-dependent limit-state function into a time- and space-independent counterpart, and then the second-order saddlepoint approximation is used to estimate the probability of failure. The strategy is to find an equivalent most probable point for a given permitted probability of failure for each of the reliability constraint. To achieve high efficiency, the new method uses a sequential optimization process to decouples the double-loop structure of RBDO. The overall optimization is performed with a sequence of cycles consisting of deterministic optimization and reliability analysis. The constraints of the deterministic optimization are formulated using the equivalent most probable points. The accuracy and efficiency are demonstrated with four examples, including one mathematical problem and three engineering problems.
