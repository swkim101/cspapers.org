Over the past year, our AI4GA team of university faculty and middle school teachers have co-designed a middle school AI curriculum. In this poster we share how we used co-design both as a tool for collaboratively developing engaging AI activities and as a mechanism for mutual professional development. We explain our co-design process, give examples of curriculum materials provided to teachers, and showcase several teacher-created activities. We believe this approach to curriculum development centers the lived experiences of teachers and leverages the knowledge and expertise of university researchers to create high quality and engaging AI learning experiences for K-12 students.
