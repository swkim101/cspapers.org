Image/video denoising in low-light scenes is an extremely challenging problem due to limited photon count and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach with contrastive learning to address this issue. Inspired by the success of contrastive learning used in some high-level computer vision tasks, we bring in this idea to the low-level denoising task. In order to achieve this goal, we introduce a new denoising contrastive regularization (DCR) to exploit the information of noisy images and clean images. In the feature space, DCR makes the denoised image closer to the clean image and far away from the noisy image. In addition, we build a new feature embedding network called Wnet, which is more effective to extract high-frequency information. We conduct the experiments on a real low-light dataset that captures still images taken on a moonless clear night in 0.6 millilux and videos under starlight (no moon present). The results show that our method can achieve a higher PSNR and better visual quality compared with existing methods.
