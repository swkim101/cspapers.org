The recent global development of smart devices in the field of low-power wide area network (LPWAN) technology and cloud computing has enabled transition of numerous industries towards smart solutions. An accelerated growth was experienced in the field of oil and gas (O&G) industry, for the various operation of upstream, downstream, fault management, and monitoring that is expected to increase exponentially. The advanced solutions facilitated by LPWAN and cloud have great advantages over manual wired/wireless such as decreased infrastructure cost, reliable and fast communication systems, ubiquitous access to business applications and flexible business model. In LPWAN, narrowband internet-of-things (NB-IOT) is one the most promising technologies that offers a huge benefit in terms of QoS, Latency, reliability, range, cost and battery lifetime. Given the advantages of NB-IOT, in this paper we propose a framework for utilizing the NB-IOT with the major cloud technologies available in the market for fault detection and monitoring in the O&G industry.
