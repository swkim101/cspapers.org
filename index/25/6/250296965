Recently, deep unfolding networks (DUNs) based on optimization algorithms have received increasing attention, and their high efficiency has been confirmed by many experimental and theoretical results. Since this type of networks combines model-based traditional optimization algorithms, they have high interpretability. In addition, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are often used to explain deep neural networks, and provide some inspiration for designing innovative network models. In this paper, we transform DUNs into first-order ODE forms, and propose a high-order numerical architecture for ODE-inspired deep unfolding networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish the relationship between DUNs and ODEs. Moreover, we take two representative DUNs as examples, apply our architecture to them and design novel DUNs. In theory, we prove the existence, uniqueness of the solution and convergence of the proposed network, and also prove that our network obtains a fast linear convergence rate. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and advantages of our architecture.
