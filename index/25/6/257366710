In this poster we present "DoodleIt,'' an interactive web application that performs sketch recognition and an afterschool curriculum that teaches students the key concepts of convolutional neural network (CNN). With DoodleIt, students make simple line drawings on a canvas area and a previously-trained CNN identifies the object drawn. The application visualizes the different layers that are involved in the process of CNN, including a display of kernels, the resulting feature maps, and the percentage of match at output neurons. We used DoodleIt as a part of 18-hour curriculum to introduce students to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. Our findings indicate that students were able to understand the functionality of the kernels and feature maps involved in the CNN to perform rudimentary image recognition.
