In this Birds of a Feather (BoF) session, we aim to create and foster a safe and open environment that allows graduate students share experiences and issues with graduate studies in CSEd research. We invite genuine and honest conversations about the challenges facing rising academics and professionals in this area. We have three goals: (1) to foster a community of support among CSEd grad students from around the world, (2) to connect students with new opportunities and ways of thinking about CSEd, and (3) to cultivate mentorship among participants and send them off with potential collaborators, supporters, and advocates.
