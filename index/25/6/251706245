The goal of this paper is the design and implementation of a control prototype using a camera for experiments of control algorithms and strategies. The physical implementation relies on a prototype built for a ball on a planar system. The prototype uses additive manufacturing techniques for printing special parts. The system actuation is made with servomotors and the sensing system is an intelligent position and velocity sensor made from a standard USB camera. Using a standard PID controller the system has able send the ball to a desired location and make the ball follow a circular trajectory. Results were obtained by simulation and validated experimentally.
