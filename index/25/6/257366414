Whether it is following an influencer on social media, face-timing with friends and family, or participating in online classes, students are accustomed to forming personal connections through their devices via "talking head" images in which a speaker directly addresses their audience. This poster explores leveraging this phenomenon to connect a human context with CS1 assignments by augmenting their descriptions with videos featuring a cameo appearance by the (fictitious) individual who needs the program. The featured speaker can describe the motivation for the assignment, put requirements into context, or provide a rationale for improvements or updates. These talking-head-style videos, which can be easily created using platforms such as Zoom and YouTube, reinforce the notion that programming is creating a product for clients and users. Further, by featuring individuals of diverse ages, genders, races, and ethnicities, cameo videos provide a valuable opportunity to present problem-solving in an inclusive way. This poster provides example cameo videos paired with assignments, tips on how to easily create them, and student feedback as to their effectiveness in providing a human-centered, diverse, and motivational context for programming assignments. Sample cameo videos and corresponding programming assignments, as well as a how-to video for easily creating a cameo video, are available at youtube.com/virt-university.
