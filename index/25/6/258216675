Over the years, the task of AI-assisted data annotation has seen remarkable advancements. However, a specific type of annotation task, the qualitative coding performed during thematic analysis, has characteristics that make effective human-AI collaboration difficult. Informed by a formative study, we designed PaTAT, a new AI-enabled tool that uses an interactive program synthesis approach to learn flexible and expressive patterns over user-annotated codes in real-time as users annotate data. To accommodate the ambiguous, uncertain, and iterative nature of thematic analysis, the use of user-interpretable patterns allows users to understand and validate what the system has learned, make direct fixes, and easily revise, split, or merge previously annotated codes. This new approach also helps human users to learn data characteristics and form new theories in addition to facilitating the “learning” of the AI model. PaTAT’s usefulness and effectiveness were evaluated in a lab user study.
