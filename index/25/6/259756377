The computation of trajectory similarity is a crucial task in many spatial data analysis applications. However, existing methods have been designed primarily for trajectories in Euclidean space, which overlooks the fact that real-world trajectories are often generated on road networks. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel framework, called GRLSTM (Graph-based Residual LSTM). To jointly capture the properties of trajectories and road networks, the proposed framework incorporates knowledge graph embedding (KGE), graph neural network (GNN), and the residual network into the multi-layer LSTM (Residual-LSTM). Specifically, the framework constructs a point knowledge graph to study the multi-relation of points, as points may belong to both the trajectory and the road network. KGE is introduced to learn point embeddings and relation embeddings to build the point fusion graph, while GNN is used to capture the topology structure information of the point fusion graph. Finally, Residual-LSTM is used to learn the trajectory embeddings.To further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the final trajectory embeddings, we introduce two new neighbor-based point loss functions, namely, graph-based point loss function and trajectory-based point loss function. The GRLSTM is evaluated using two real-world trajectory datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that GRLSTM outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods significantly.
