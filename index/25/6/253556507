The isolation of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna system with dual-sense circular polarization (CP) is investigated in this paper. This paper explains the coupling mechanism of this antenna type and proposes a simple decoupling structure for isolation enhancement. The proposed decoupling network is then applied to a CP MIMO antenna. The results demonstrate that the isolation of the proposed CP MIMO antenna is significant improve over wide operating bandwidth while keeping a small element spacing.
