Computer science and engineering students in college get introduced to high-level language programming (Java, C++, Python) early in their first year and later to computer organization and architecture courses. Most students lack a clear understanding of the architecture of a computer before learning how to write code for the first time. This deficiency is due to the lack of courses focused on computer architecture and organization early in high school. Even though introductory computer science courses are now offered from 6th to 12th grade, in some schools, the curriculum lacks emphasis on the fundamentals of computer architecture. Students interested in computer science should be capable of building a simple processor to better understand the design principles of a computer. We are developing a simulator that allows students to build a custom RISC-V processor and run programs on it. The increasing interest in the RISC-V ISA, and its fast adoption for chip design, make this instruction set a great candidate for this educational tool.
