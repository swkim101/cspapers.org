Network measurement is important to data center operators. Most existing efforts focus on developing new implementation schemes for measurement tasks. Little attention is paid to on-the-fly task reconfiguration. Due to resource constraints, it is impossible to configure all needed tasks at start-up and dynamically turn on/of them. To support real-time reconfiguration of many different tasks, a key observation is that it is unnecessary to bind a task and its implementation at the compilation phase. We design FlyMon, the first sketch-based measurement system that can make on-the-fly reconfigurations on a large set of measurement tasks. FlyMon introduces the concept of Composable Measurement Units (CMUs), which are general operation units that support reconfigurable implementation for measurement tasks combined from different flow keys and flow attributes. FlyMon maps the design of CMUs to programmable switches' data planes so that the number of compacted CMUs can be maximized. FlyMon also provides dynamic memory management. We prototype FlyMon on Tofino and currently enable four frequently used flow attributes. Each CMU Group (with 3 CMUs) can concurrently perform up to 96 isolated measurement tasks with less than 8.3% hardware resources. The tasks can be deployed with configurable memory size at the millisecond level. By cross-stacking, FlyMon can deploy up to 27 CMUs in one pipeline of Tofino.
