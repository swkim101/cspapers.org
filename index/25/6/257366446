This poster presents a virtual hackathon model for high school girls that has been implemented six times from Summer 2020 to Spring 2022. The model was designed to attract a diverse group of girls and engage them in activities that inspire them towards a computing career. We will present analyses of student authentic learning outcomes drawn from post-event survey responses, Apps submitted by project teams, and judging scores and feedback.
