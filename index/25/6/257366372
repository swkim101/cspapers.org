Spring 2023 marks 10 years since \snap was first used with students, and the Snap! Cloud was developed for sharing projects. Since then, nearly 700,000 students and educators have worked on more than 6 million Snap! projects. This BOF serves as an opportunity to meet with the large community of Snap! users that attend SIGCSE. The past three releases have focused on power ideas, such as native array-based data programming, building microworlds, and metaprogramming. We want to have a chance to share success stories, and then discuss: what's next? Notes, projects and examples from this BOF will be shared at https://bjc.link/snap-bof-sigcse23
