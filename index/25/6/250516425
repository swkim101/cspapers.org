The gaits of locomoting systems are typically designed to maximize some sort of efficiency, such as cost of transport or speed. Equally important is the ability to modulate such a gait to effect turning maneuvers. For drag-dominated systems, geometric mechanics provides an elegant and practical framework for both ends—gait design and gait modulation. Within this framework, “constraint curvature” maps can be used to approximate the net displacement of robotic systems over cyclic gaits. Gait optimization is made possible under a previously reported “soap-bubble” algorithm. In this work, we propose both local and global gait morphing algorithms to modify a nominal gait to provide single-parameter steering control. Using a simplified swimmer, we numerically compare the two approaches and show that for modest turns, the local approach, while suboptimal, nevertheless proves effective for steering control. A potential advantage of the local approach is that it can be readily applied to soft robots or other systems where local approximations to the constraint curvature can be garnered from data, but for which obtaining an exact global model is infeasible.
