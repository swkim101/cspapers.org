Academic Integrity (AI) violations have long been a concern of educators and academic institutions within all fields of study. AI violations can consist of a broad range of student behaviors that are considered dishonest, including but not limited to plagiarism, copying others' assignments, and paying for others to complete their work [1]. As the risks for academic integrity issues become ever more prevalent, particularly as more academic institutions rely on online course formats, researchers are continually attempting to identify what underlying factors lead students to commit AI violations. The COVID-19 pandemic among other factors has contributed to the rise in online learning formats. This change in course modality combined with easier access to digital resources has lowered the boundary for many students for violating AI, thus increasing our need to understand what factors influence students to consider violating AI. This poster represents an initial step in a larger research study looking at the relationship between AI violations and students' sense of belonging within their discipline. This poster presents findings from a literature review looking to identify research investigating students' beliefs regarding AI, institutional policies for AI violations, and underlying causes for AI violations. Findings from this literature review are mixed; while several factors have been identified that contribute to students' propensity to violate AI, few concrete solutions have been proposed or evaluated, indicating that there is a need for further research.
