In a live streaming chat on a video streaming service, it is crucial to filter out toxic comments with online processing to prevent users from reading comments in real-time. However, recent toxic language detection methods rely on deep learning methods, which can not be scalable considering inference speed. Also, these methods do not consider constraints of computational resources expected depending on a deployed system (e
