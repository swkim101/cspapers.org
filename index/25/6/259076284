Min-max routing problems aim to minimize the maximum tour length among multiple agents as they collaboratively visit all cities, i.e., the completion time. These problems include impactful real-world applications but are known as NP-hard. Existing methods are facing challenges, particularly in large-scale problems that require the coordination of numerous agents to cover thousands of cities. This paper proposes Equity-Transformer to solve large-scale min-max routing problems. First, we model min-max routing problems into sequential planning, reducing the complexity and enabling the use of a powerful Transformer architecture. Second, we propose key inductive biases that ensure equitable workload distribution among agents. The effectiveness of Equity-Transformer is demonstrated through its superior performance in two representative min-max routing tasks: the min-max multi-agent traveling salesman problem (min-max mTSP) and the min-max multi-agent pick-up and delivery problem (min-max mPDP). Notably, our method achieves significant reductions of runtime, approximately 335 times, and cost values of about 53% compared to a competitive heuristic (LKH3) in the case of 100 vehicles with 1,000 cities of mTSP.
