This study investigates the Computational Thinking skill differences among novice programmers in relation to gender. Block-based visual programming languages such as Scratch particularly benefit K-12 programmers because they learn how to code intuitively. Our study analyzed 124 (62 males, 62 females) Scratch projects on the Scratch website, categorized projects on the basis of each user's gender and project type, and compared their Computational Thinking scores. The results of this study suggest that project types preferred by males require more programming construct reflected in the Computational Thinking score than that of females. Because gender differences appear by project type, project type presumably influences the gender gap in scores.
