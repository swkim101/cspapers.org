Few would argue that modern careers across a wide range of disciplines can be performed in the absence of computing in one form or another. As such, it is becoming increasingly important for our education system to appropriately prepare students for the modern world by integrating computing and computational thinking into how students learn disciplinary content (i.e. disciplines outside of computer science). However, how to best perform this integration is not yet known, nor is there likely to be one ''best'' method. In this session, we will facilitate a discussion of the variety of ways in which post-secondary institutions are actively using computing to support disciplinary learning by highlighting examples while also considering mechanisms not yet explored. We invite anyone who wants to learn more about current efforts, share their own experiences, and contribute ideas for future endeavors. In an effort to maximize the diversity of perspectives in this discussion, we've included discussion leaders who span a variety of roles within curriculum development and classroom instruction and encourage participants from all levels and backgrounds.
