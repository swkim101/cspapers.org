Editing (e.g., editing conceptual diagrams) is a typical office task that requires numerous tedious GUI operations, resulting in poor interaction efficiency and user experience, especially on mobile devices. In this paper, we present a new type of human-computer collaborative editing tool (CET) that enables accurate and efficient editing with little interaction effort. CET divides the task into two parts, and the human and the computer focus on their respective specialties: the human describes high-level editing goals with multimodal commands, while the computer calculates, recommends, and performs detailed operations. We conducted a formative study (N = 16) to determine the concrete task division and implemented the tool on Android devices for the specific tasks of editing concept diagrams. The user study (N = 24 + 20) showed that it increased diagram editing speed by 32.75% compared with existing state-of-the-art commercial tools and led to better editing results and user experience.
