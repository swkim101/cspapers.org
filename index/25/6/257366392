This session will help educators, staff, and administrators gain understanding and confidence in using inclusive language to refer to identities and demographic groups. Using human-centered terminology for identities based on characteristics like race, gender, disability status, etc. improves inclusivity for historically minoritized students and colleagues in computing. This session provides tools to learn current best practices and also to navigate the changing landscape of respectful language that supports diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Framed by an NCWIT resource---Videos that Spark Conversations---and led by a panel of expert practitioners in the CS Ed community, attendees will watch and discuss three, short videos on topics including norms for discussing identities, disability, and ethnicity. In this session, participants will (1) engage in expert-guided small group discussions; (2) learn inclusive terminology and the reasons why specific terms are used for 3 types of identities; and (3) learn how to use the Videos that Spark Conversations resource to continue learning and share knowledge with others.
