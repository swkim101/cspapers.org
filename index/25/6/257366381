A Musikalisches WÃ¼rfelspiel (musical dice game) is a process for generating music by concatenating a random sequence of precomposed musical fragments. In this programming assignment, students "compose" a Viennese waltz in the style of Mozart by playing a sequence of 32 sound files that are chosen at random (from a library of 272) according to the results of throwing dice. It is a captivating demonstration not only of the power of randomness but also of how much can be accomplished by combining a simple idea with a tiny bit of code. This work champions a new genre of programming assignment that is characterized by playing a sequence of sound files (analogous to printing a sequence of strings, but more engaging!). In this assignment, the sound files are precomposed fragments from classical music. Following this blueprint, the author has developed a series of novel programming exercises in which the sound files are musical notes, speech, drum loops, and ringtones. We hope that this work will inspire other teachers to craft new assignments in this style.
