Electrical energy monitoring and management is an integrated system that includes planning, supporting operations, as well as evaluating power efficiency at manufacturing plants. Monitoring electrical energy usage is the key to saving energy and improving its safety. From there, it is possible to control and reduce energy consumption such as reducing costs, reducing carbon emissions, and reducing risks. Research in this paper applies a wireless data transmission platform combined with an embedded microcontroller system to build a real-time data collection system to monitor and manage power usage and production data. A complete model with standard features is introduced to realize the technology.
