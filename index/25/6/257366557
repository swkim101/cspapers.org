Here, we present findings from our research study conducted on a series of STEM workshops we developed and implemented in a local summer program for young Black boys. Data were collected and analyzed from surveys, student work, and field observations. Our preliminary findings suggest that youth began to acknowledge benefits in having both tech and sports within the same learning space. Specifically, they began to connect digital technologies with sports and consider them as mediating tools for acquiring and refining athletics skills.
