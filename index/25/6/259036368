In this study, we developed polyethylene glycol-4000-based hydrogels for ketorolac tromethamine-controlled delivery systems through a free radical polymerization method. The developed hydrogels were subjected to FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, porosity analysis, dynamic swelling analysis, release studies, etc. The successful crosslinking and stability of the prepared hydrogels were confirmed by FTIR, DSC, and TGA analysis. The surface morphology and the reduction in the crystallinity of the polymer after grafting were shown by SEM and XRD analysis. Similarly, the soluble part of the developed hydrogels was eliminated from their insoluble part by the Soxhlet extraction process. Higher dynamic swelling and drug release were observed at high pH values compared to low pH values. High porosity was perceived with high concentrations of the monomers and polymer and decreased with the high incorporation of a crosslinker. The release mechanism of all formulations followed non-Fickian diffusion. The results demonstrate that the developed polyethylene glycol-4000 hydrogels could serve as promising controlled drug delivery carriers.
