In 2021, National Science Foundation (NSF) Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) directorate implemented a Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) plan requirement for all medium and larger research proposals in Core, CPS, and SaTC. This panel comprises faculty and administrators from US computing departments who have participated in the writing of Departmental or Project BPC plans, two in response to NSF's encouragement and one prior. Panelists represent a range of institutions as well as departmental awareness of BPC prior to writing their plans. Regardless of where they or their departments lie in the spectrum of knowing about and implementing BPC activities, and regardless of the current demographic makeup of the students in their major, they all encountered challenges as they wrote their plans. They all also experienced successes, not the least of which is that they succeeded in getting a plan written in accordance with the current guidelines. With the support of a moderator, the three panelists will share their experiences developing BPC plans with the audience, offering lessons learned and tips for overcoming common challenges. Audience members will also receive helpful links and handouts to facilitate the writing of their own departmental or project plans.
