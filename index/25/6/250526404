We propose a novel Parallel Monte Carlo tree search with Batched Simulations (PMBS) algorithm for accelerating long-horizon, episodic robotic planning tasks. Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is an effective heuristic search algorithm for solving episodic decision-making problems whose underlying search spaces are expansive. Leveraging a GPU-based large-scale simulator, PMBS introduces massive parallelism into MCTS for solving planning tasks through the batched execution of a large number of concurrent simulations, which allows for more efficient and accurate evaluations of the expected cost-to-go over large action spaces. When applied to the challenging manipulation tasks of object retrieval from clutter, PMBS achieves a speedup of over 30Ã— with an improved solution quality, in comparison to a serial MCTS implementation. We show that PMBS can be directly applied to real robot hardware with negligible sim-to-real differences. Supplementary material, including video, can be found at https://github.com/arc-l/pmbs.
