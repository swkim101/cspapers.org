CS1 students who program in textual languages often think they are bad at programming, largely because they experience negative self-assessments as they program. I investigate whether students in CS0 contexts using a block-based language have similar self-assessment moments, to find ways to amplify positive self-assessments and ameliorate negative ones. Toward this end, I have designed an affective reporting tool and a study to understand the programming moments that lead to positive or negative student affect for CS0 students. The affective reporting tool was piloted in a CS0 course. 69 out of 75 students voluntarily used the tool, reporting 528 responses over two course periods. This willingness to share their affective data through the new tool shows that students may need such outlets to reflect on and share how they are feeling while programming. The tool was also used in a study where students programmed using the affective reporter, then reflected on and reviewed a video of their programming to tell us more about how they felt while programming. Initial findings show that while some moments are interpreted to be positive or negative by all students, the interpretation of other moments can differ. In future work, the results of these studies will be used to design interventions to help students and improve their programming self-assessments.
