Academic advising brings numerous benefits to the mission of Higher Education Institutions. One central and challenging duty of advisors is course recommendation for term planning. This task requires both knowledge of the study programs as well as a thorough analysis of the students’ unique circumstances. Limited time and a large student population make this task overwhelming. As a result, an important body of research has sought to expedite term planning via data-oriented decision-support tools. The impact of such tools on students has been extensively studied. However, the advisors’ perspective remains largely unexplored. We contribute to redressing this gap by studying how a grade prediction tool shapes academic advisors’ approach to course recommendation. We found that while the advisors’ usual strategies tend to prevail, their recommendations largely depend on the advisee’s historical performance. That said, advisors also acknowledge the limitations of grades as a measure of academic success.
