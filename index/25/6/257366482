Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is interesting to many students and provides an excellent opportunity to observe and practice many aspects of software product development and management. FOSS projects can motivate many software engineering concepts by providing scale, complexity, and on-going product evolution that is difficult to mimic in classroom-only materials. Open source projects have been a major source of innovation in software engineering and many FOSS projects provide excellent case studies of advanced practices in action. Finally, FOSS projects motivate students by providing an authentic, collaborative engagement environment for learning. This BoF will provide an opportunity for instructors to discuss successes and challenges of teaching open source (TOS) in undergraduate computing programs. The discussion topics will include: fitting TOS in an already full curriculum, types of TOS learning activities that can be shared, instructor preparation and getting started teaching open source.
