Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is a new way of leveraging an Internet-of-Things (IoT) system to provide real-time and highly flexible service creation. In an NFV-enabled Internet-of-Things (NIoT) system, several IoT functions implemented as Virtual Network Functions can be linked as a service function chain to build a customized IoT service quickly. It is important for an IoT service to be able to recover from a failure. However, the supply of a resilient IoT service in an NIoT system is challenging due to the coordination of distributed VNF instances. In this paper, we formulate the problem of resilient service coordination in an NIoT system as a mixed integer linear programming model, namely RSOd. The model offers the optimal resource allocation for minimizing service disruption when a failure happens at a node of an NIoT system. We also develop two modified versions of RSOd for different use cases required by an IoT provider. The evaluation results show that RSOd and its modified versions produce the optimal resource allocation in significantly reduced time compared to previous work. The results suggest that an IoT provider should carefully select an appropriate resource allocation strategy as it has to pay a resource cost to minimize the service disruption.
