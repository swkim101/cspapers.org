How should dynamic programming be taught to students experiencing it for the first time? Dynamic programming is a sophisticated programming technique that exercises many aspects of computer science in concert. Because of the deep technical complexity therein, building effective lessons is challenging. In this work we propose a worked example model for teaching dynamic programming that centers around a midterm exam in which the solutions are provided to the students weeks in advance. 35 students were surveyed about their experiences learning dynamic programming with and without this model.
