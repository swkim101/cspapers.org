Optimal trajectory planning is a problem that needs to be solved in robotic applications. The trajectory is optimally designed in terms of travel time at the same time must satisfy different constraints such as limited torque, range of movement of joints in the workspace, and velocity of joints. This paper presents the optimal trajectory planning of the object in the dual-arm system cooperative movement of the object using a genetic algorithm, the genetic algorithm determines the minimum time motion of the object and then builds the optimal trajectory. Being different from previous research, the reference trajectory is assumed to be the same as the real one. Therefore, the torque at the joints is calculated by using the inverse kinematic and dynamic of the dual-arm robot system. The paper proposes to add a controller when planning optimal trajectory, the torque at the robot joints is calculated from the output of the controller. This design ensures similarity between the design trajectory and the actual implementation. Finally, simulation on Matlab-Simulink with different types of orbits has proved the feasibility of the proposed solution.
