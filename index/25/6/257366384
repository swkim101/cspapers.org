There is growing attention for developing professional learning experiences for content area teachers to infuse computational thinking (CT). However, there is little reporting on how teachers continue to implement the CT lessons once professional development (PD) is over. This study provides initial results on our efforts of building project sustainability through teacher autonomy in designing their own CT infusion projects or PDs for their schools. Our initial analysis indicates the need to continue to build teacher autonomy within the professional learning experiences for developing teacher confidence and sustainability of the project.
