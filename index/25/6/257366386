Computer science and engineering students in college get introduced to high-level language programming (Java, C++, Python) early in their first year and later to computer organization and architecture courses. Most students lack a clear understanding of the architecture of a computer before learning how to write code for the first time. This deficiency is due to the lack of courses focused on computer architecture and organization early in high school. Even though introductory computer science courses are now offered from 6th to 12th grade, in some schools, the curriculum lacks emphasis on the fundamentals of computer architecture. This work presents an educational framework suitable for K-12 and undergraduate college students to learn computer architecture by building custom processors, exploring computer subsystems, and observing how programs are simulated in real-time.
