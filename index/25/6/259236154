Modern systems tend to become more autonomous. A system can be considered completely autonomous and robust if it does not just manage its tasks autonomously but also manages the faults and failures by adapting its behaviour without external help from a human. There is a wide range of scientific research on autonomous systems with automated guided vehicles (AGVs), robotic fleets and swarms in the industry and logistics. Most research works consider communication and coordination within an autonomous system, collision avoidance, failure mitigation and fault tolerance. The prime aim of the said research is to achieve the autonomous execution of the task, avoiding possible troubles and tolerating faults in the system. Unfortunately, there is a lack of research regarding troubleshooting within autonomous systems utilizing AGVs. Here, we define troubleshooting as the process of detecting a fault, an error or a failure in the system, isolating it, analysing and eventually eliminating it using a troubleshooter, a robot explicitly made for such purposes. In this work, we present an overview of the state of the art in the field of troubleshooting for AGV-driven autonomous systems. This paper aims to become a starting point for further research in the subject at hand.
