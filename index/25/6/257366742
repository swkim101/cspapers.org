States are moving to adopt Computer Science (CS) education standards to help K-12 teachers adapt and integrate computing /computational thinking (CT) concepts into the curriculum. These approaches also rely heavily on training current and pre-service teachers and creating opportunities to learn CS while also managing the rigors of their education career. This poster presents elements of the collaboration between the Department of CS and Department of Teaching and Learning at Montclair State University (MSU) to bring CS to pre- and in-service educators. Here we will highlight our curriculum work and professional development (PD) series. The New Jersey (NJ) Department of Education has adopted CS Education standards for K-12 and distinctly funded curriculum development and faculty formation programs. MSU has built programs that support teachers through PD experiences in CT and CS. In the 10-month period ending March 2023, we will offer 30 PD opportunities for a CS and CS education. To date, more than 200 educators have received PD to address their educational needs regarding CS curricula.
