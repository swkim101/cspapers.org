In this research, we will provide a brief overview of the SDN architecture and how DDoS can drain a controller's resources. We will then introduce a method to detect the attack based on using statistical analysis with a dynamic threshold value that changes over time, depending on the traffic over a network. Survey and simulation results show that our solution is completely feasible to quickly detect DDoS attacks as well as help improve reliability when compared to other methods using static threshold values.
