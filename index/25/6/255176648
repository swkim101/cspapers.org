Lower Limb Exoskeletons (LLE) have received considerable interest in strength augmentation, rehabilitation, and walking assistance scenarios. For strength augmentation, LLE is expected to have the capability of reducing metabolic energy. However, the energy for adjusting Center of Gravity (CoG) is a main part of the total energy consumed during walking. This paper proposes a novel Human-exoskeleton Cooperative Balance (HCB) strategy which gives assistive torques balance ability and combine with the direction selected by the pilot to achieve balance walking of human-exoskeleton systems. In which, a Dynamic Torque Primitive Model (DTPM) is designed to plan a bionic assistive torque, and the balance parameters obtained by an Inverted Pendulum Model (IPM) is superimposed on it. Finally, the performance improved by the HCB strategy can break the limitation of traditional strategies and substantially increase the efficiency of assistance. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed HCB strategy on the HUman-powered Augmentation Lower EXoskeleton (HUALEX) system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed HCB is more efficient than traditional strategies.
