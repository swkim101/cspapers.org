Cybersecurity is a growing field with ample opportunities for experiential learning, including challenge-based capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions. CTFs are popular training tools among established cybersecurity professionals, and these events grow in participation every year. Because of their popularity among those with prior experience, however, only a small percentage of CTF events are designed to be genuinely beginner-friendly. To effectively respond to the global shortage in cybersecurity skills, we must equip students and teachers with educational tools such as tailored CTFs. This paper investigates the efficacy of hosting CTF competitions developed for high school students with little to no prior cybersecurity experience. The survey feedback indicated the events were not only enjoyable, but also effective at teaching technical skills and concepts through hands-on learning.
