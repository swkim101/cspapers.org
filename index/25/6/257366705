To address the challenge of teaching the interdisciplinary foundations of data science in computing, mathematics and statistics, we propose a mathematical logic based framework to seamlessly and coherently integrate these foundations. A 8-week module based on the framework is implemented in a high school. The results show an overall feasibility of the integrated approach.
