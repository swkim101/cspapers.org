This paper presents a microstrip patch antenna array fed by a multilayer air-filled substrate integrated waveguide (AFSIW) structure. Thanks to the low loss feeding network, the antenna array presents high efficiency in millimeter wave frequencies. For demonstration, a 1×2 antenna array operating at 28 GHz is designed for 5G applications, which shows a realized gain of 10.8 dBi and a total efficiency higher than 90%. The proposed structure can be expanded to M×(2N) antenna array.
