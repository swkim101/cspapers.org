Many students are first exposed to computing in a programming course such as CS1. This course affects their understanding of computing and may affect their intention to major in the program. We investigate the intention to major in computing in relation to demographic factors and factors related to academic success. We deployed surveys at the beginning and end of a CS1 course to gauge students' level of prior experience in programming, elicit demographic factors such as gender and parental education level, and identify their intention to major in computing. Grades from CS1 and CS2 were also collected. Our results suggest that most students do not change their intention to major in computing after taking CS1. Students who were more likely to intend to major in programming at the beginning of the course were those with prior experience, those who identified as men, or students who had a parent with a bachelor's or post-grad degree. We also find that students' grades correlate to their change in program intention. This reinforces the need to change perceptions about computing early, prior to CS1.
