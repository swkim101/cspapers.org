Along with socio-economic development, the number of cars is increasing, which means more and more potential hazards on the road. These dangers come not only from the subjective behavior of the driver but also from objective incidents. Building an automated system to detect incidents in time plays an important role in reducing traffic accidents. This study proposes a fast image processing method to detect driver distractions to give timely warnings. In addition, the objects on the road that are at risk of causing an accident are also recognized and the system warns the driver in real time. Selected study results are also provided to verify the effectiveness of the method.
