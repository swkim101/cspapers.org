This lighting talk discusses the potential for using coding as a new means of self-expression. Coding has been identified as a key 21st-century skill, and as such, it is expected to be vastly acquired already in the early ages of formal education. Coding is a language that adheres to a system of symbols and rules, which, when combined, convey meaning. This postulation has led a few scholars to sustain that coding is a language functioning like any other language. Thus, coding might enable its coders to produce expressive artifacts, similarly to any other natural language, potentially offering a new form of creative writing in the 21st century. A celebrated use of creative writing is in the field of emotional therapy. Writing has been proven an efficient tool in both clinical and non-clinical populations. Nevertheless, despite its effectiveness, some populations are deprived of the great benefits creative writing may enable. Among these are children who do not know how to read and write, as well as adults who struggle with expressive writing. Therefore, we suggest a way for expanding the boundaries of coding to the field of self-expressive writing. We believe that apart from promoting its acquisition as an essential tool in the 21st century, knowing coding at an early age may also endorse general well-being, offering a new, somewhat more reachable, means of self-expression.
