Place recognition is seen as a crucial factor to correct cumulative errors in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) applications. Most existing studies focus on visual place recognition, which is inherently sensitive to environmental changes such as illumination, weather and seasons. Considering these facts, more recent attention has been attracted to use 3-D Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scans for place recognition, which demonstrates more credibility by exerting accurate geometric information. Different from pure geometric-based studies, this paper proposes a novel global descriptor, named SectionKey, which leverages both semantic and geometric information to tackle the problem of place recognition in large-scale urban environments. The proposed descriptor is robust and invariant to viewpoint changes. Specifically, the encoded three-layers key serves as a pre-selection step and a ‘candidate center’ selection strategy is deployed before calculating the similarity score, thus improving the accuracy and efficiency significantly. Then, a two-step semantic iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is applied to acquire the 3-D pose (x, y, θ) that is used to align the candidate point clouds with the query frame and calculate the similarity score. Extensive experiments have been conducted on public Semantic KITTI dataset to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed system over state-of-the-art baselines.
