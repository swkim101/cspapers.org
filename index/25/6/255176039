The magnetic medical microrobots are influenced by diverse factors such as the medium, the geometry of the microrobot, and the imaging procedure. It is worth noting that the size limitations make it difficult or even impossible to obtain reliable physical properties of the system. In this research, to achieve a precise microrobot control using minimum knowledge about the system, an Adaptive Fuzzy Sliding-Mode Control (AFSMC) scheme is designed for the motion control problem of the magnetically actuated microrobots in presence of input saturation constraint. The AFSMC input consists of a fuzzy system designed to approximate an unknown nonlinear dynamical system and a robust term considered for mismatch compensation. According to the designed adaptation laws, the asymptotic stability is proved based on the Lyapunov theorem and Barbalat's lemma. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a comparative simulation study is conducted.
