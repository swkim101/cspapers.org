Blind or visually-impaired, or sight-impaired people pose challenges while using online services. Safety and security are the key issues, and they have to depend upon others while availing of online services. Accessing online banking services is among such challenges. The present paper designs a framework or a model that may be useful for blind users to perform several banking activities independently. The model is labeled as Blind Banking Services Framework (BBSF) model. The feasibility of BBSF was tested in a pilot project. The result indicates that it may be useful if it is modified with the assistance of bank personnel and financial experts. The model is still in its experimental stage, and further data will be collected from a large population.
