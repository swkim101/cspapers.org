Engaging student in Computer Science courses has been linked to higher performance and retention in the major. Yet many of the assignments that we deploy in our courses tend to be fairly academic exercises that do not engage students particularly well. Based on their experience in building systems and assignments to engage students, the presenters will guide the audience through a process they have used in the past to design engaging assignments.
