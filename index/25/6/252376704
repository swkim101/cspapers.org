Vulnerability discovery is an essential aspect of software security. Currently, the demand for security experts significantly exceeds the available vulnerability discovery workforce. Further, the existing vulnerability discovery workforce is highly homogeneous, dominated by white and Asian men. As such, one promising avenue for increasing the capacity of the vulnerability discovery community is through recruitment and retention from a broader population. Although significant prior research has explored the challenges of equity and inclusion in computing broadly, the competitive and frequently self-taught nature of vulnerability discovery work may create new variations on these challenges. This paper reports on a semi-structured interview study (N = 16) investigating how people from marginalized populations come to participate in vulnerability discovery, whether they feel welcomed by the vulnerability discovery community, and what challenges they face when joining the vulnerability discovery community. We find that members of marginalized populations face some unique challenges, while other challenges common in vulnerability discovery are exacerbated by marginalization.
