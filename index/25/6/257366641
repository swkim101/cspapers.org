In the fall of 2019, a team of researchers formed to answer a series of questions in regard to CSE (Computer Science Education) graduate students. What career pathways existed for them and what did they envision for their futures? What opportunities had been presented and what barriers did they face? In seeking to answer such questions, an international community of 332 individuals across 23 different countries was established through networking and light outreach. Registrants were eager to participate, as often they may have lacked support in their own departments, and the community quickly grew. Students' strong interest in networking, mentoring, and increasing personal knowledge in this group, was evidenced by survey responses and participation in hosted events. While the initial project funding has ended, a handful of the graduate students who spearheaded elements of the research work such as analyzing the global CSEd career landscape, compiling institutional profiles, and analyzing the CSEd research landscape, have begun seeking support for their own CSE projects through connections made through the community network. So what becomes of said community now that our own project has ended? Our aim with this poster is, first to showcase this international accomplishment and also garner input and interest for a future home for the community.
