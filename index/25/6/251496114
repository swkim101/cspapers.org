The advent of radio sensing that works through walls & obstacles challenges the notion of indoor privacy. An eavesdropper can deploy such sensing to snoop on their neighbors and a smart sensor embedded with such sensing capabilities can perform large scale behavioral and health data mining. We present RF-Protect, a new framework that enables privacy by injecting fake humans in the sensed data. RF-Protect consists of a novel hardware reflector design that modifies radio waves to create reflections at arbitrary locations in the environment and a new generative mechanism to create realistic human trajectories. RF-Protect's design doesn't require any high bandwidth hardware or physical motion. We implement RF-Protect using commodity hardware and validate its ability to generate fake human trajectories.
