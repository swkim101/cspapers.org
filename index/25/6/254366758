Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are powerful in learning patterns of different vision tasks, but they are sensitive to label noise and may overfit to noisy labels during training. The early stopping strategy averts updating CNNs during the early training phase and is widely employed in the presence of noisy labels. Motivated by biological findings that the amplitude spectrum (AS) and phase spectrum (PS) in the frequency domain play different roles in the animalâ€™s vision system, we observe that PS, which captures more semantic information, can increase the robustness of CNNs to label noise, more so than AS can. We thus propose early stops at different times for AS and PS by disentangling the features of some layer(s) into AS and PS using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) during training. Our proposed Phase-AmplituDe DisentangLed Early Stopping (PADDLES) method is shown to be effective on both synthetic and real-world label-noise datasets. PADDLES out-performs other early stopping methods and obtains state-of-the-art performance.
