3D automatic annotation has received increased attention since manually annotating 3D point clouds is laborious. However, existing methods are usually complicated, e.g., pipelined training for 3D foreground/background segmentation, cylindrical object proposals, and point completion. Furthermore, they often overlook the inter-object feature correlation that is particularly informative to hard samples for 3D annotation. 
To this end, we propose a simple yet effective end-to-end Context-Aware Transformer (CAT) as an automated 3D-box labeler to generate precise 3D box annotations from 2D boxes, trained with a small number of human annotations. We adopt the general encoder-decoder architecture, where the CAT encoder consists of an intra-object encoder (local) and an inter-object encoder (global), performing self-attention along the sequence and batch dimensions, respectively. The former models intra-object interactions among points and the latter extracts feature relations among different objects, thus boosting scene-level understanding.
Via local and global encoders, CAT can generate high-quality 3D box annotations with a streamlined workflow, allowing it to outperform existing state-of-the-arts by up to 1.79% 3D AP on the hard task of the KITTI test set.
