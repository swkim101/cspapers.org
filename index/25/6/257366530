We examine the major challenges AI experts encounter when deploying AI solutions. We conduct in-depth interviews with AI experts to elicit the frequent challenges they face. Our preliminary results highlight several factors that contribute to the challenging nature of the field, namely data scarcity, uncertainty, ill-structured problems, user behavior, and the application domain. This work indicates important areas that can be targeted during the curriculum design and development process.
