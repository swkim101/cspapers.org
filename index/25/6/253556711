We propose a new artificial noise (AN)-aided secure communication scheme that is robust to the eavesdropper's location and number of antennas to achieve a high zero-outage secrecy capacity. Unlike the traditional AN-aided secure communication schemes, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the eavesdropper does not grow with the number of antennas in the proposed scheme. Hence, the eavesdropper cannot remove the AN no matter how many antennas it may have. We derive the secrecy outage probability and the zero-outage secrecy capacity of the proposed scheme in the slow Rayleigh fading channel and investigate the effect of the location and the number of antennas at the eavesdroppers.
