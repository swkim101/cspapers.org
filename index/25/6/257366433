Tower of Hanoi is a classical tutorial example traditionally for introducing recursive algorithms in CS1. This poster describes a lecture of teaching graph algorithms using the graphical representation of the game and its variants in upper-level courses. More specifically, this poster provides a totally different perspective on solving the tower of Hanoi using DFS, BFS, A*, greedy, and other search algorithms on graphs. Students will not only solve the game and its variants in an inspiring way, but also learn a modeling method to convert problems into graphs.
