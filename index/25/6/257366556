The volume of information that can be used in the development of knowledge bases that can be used in education is constantly increasing. Also, this amount of data is very difficult to process and store. When designing a knowledge base to optimize the educational process, it is important to use ontologies. At the moment, the creation of an ontological knowledge model is the most promising option for storing and processing information. The article describes effective approaches for generating an ontological model using machine learning models based on the Transformer model.
