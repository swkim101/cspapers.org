Waste inspection for packaged waste is an important step in the pipeline of waste disposal. Previous methods either rely on manual visual checking or RGB image-based inspection algorithm, requiring costly preparation procedures (e.g., open the bag and spread the waste items). Moreover, occluded items are very likely to be left out. Inspired by the fact that X-ray has a strong penetrating power to see through the bag and overlapping objects, we propose to perform waste inspection efficiently using X-ray images without the need to open the bag. We introduce a novel problem of instance-level waste segmentation in X-ray image for intelligent waste inspection, and contribute a real dataset consisting of 5,038 X-ray images (totally 30,881 waste items) with high-quality annotations (i.e., waste categories, object boxes, and instance-level masks) as a benchmark for this problem. As existing segmentation methods are mainly designed for natural images and cannot take advantage of the characteristics of X-ray waste images (e.g., heavy occlusions and penetration effect), we propose a new instance segmentation method to explicitly take these image characteristics into account. Specifically, our method adopts an easy-to-hard disassembling strategy to use high confidence predictions to guide the segmentation of highly overlapped objects, and a global structure guidance module to better capture the complex contour information caused by the penetration effect. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our dataset is released at WIXRayNet.
