Many user experience (UX) instructors have seen UX opportunities excite students and change their outlook on computing; a recent video of young professionals at Ohio Tech Day 2022 makes a compelling case for the transformative nature of UX work [1]. Building excitement through UX is a good reason for teaching UX, but there are others: - Careers in UX offer exciting high-paying opportunities for computer science majors and other students in computer science courses. - Computer Science and Software Engineering Curriculum 2013/2014 contain recommendations for key UX concepts. - Student engagement with UX concepts may enhance students' sense of worthiness, a known element of success and retention [2]. UX in computing curricula may take many forms, including stand-alone classes and/or modules in software engineering courses. Topics can include a broad range of UX subject matter from the Computer Science and Software Engineering Curriculum 2013/2014. Course activities may vary from theoretical to experiential client-based projects. This BOF will discuss strategies to promote student interest and excitement in UX education.
