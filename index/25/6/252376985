The security of the Android platform beneﬁts greatly from a privileged middleware that provides indirect access to protected resources. This architecture is further enhanced by privilege separating functionality into many different services and carefully tuning ﬁle access control policy to mitigate the impact of software vulnerabilities. However, these services can become confused deputies if they improperly re-delegate ﬁle access to third-party applications through remote procedure call (RPC) interfaces. In this paper, we propose a static program analysis tool called FR E D, which identiﬁes a mapping between Java-based system service RPC interfaces and the ﬁle paths opened within the Java and C/C++ portions of the service. It then combines the Linux-layer ﬁle access control policy with the Android-layer permission policy to identify potential ﬁle re-delegation. We use FR E D to analyze three devices running Android 10 and identify 12 confused deputies that are accessible from third-party applications. These vulnerabilities include ﬁve CVEs with moderate severity, demonstrating the utility of semi-automated approaches to discover subtle ﬂaws in access control enforcement.
