AI recommendation techniques provide users with personalized services, feeding them the information they may be interested in. The increasing personalization raises the hypotheses of the "filter bubble" and "echo chamber" effects. To investigate these hypotheses, in this paper, we inspect the impact of recommendation algorithms on forming two types of ideological isolation, i.e., the individual isolation and the topological isolation, in terms of the filter bubble and echo chamber effects, respectively. Simulation results show that AI recommendation strategies severely facilitate the evolution of the filter bubble effect, leading users to become ideologically isolated at an individual level. Whereas, at a topological level, recommendation algorithms show eligibility in connecting individuals with dissimilar users or recommending diverse topics to receive more diverse viewpoints. This research sheds light on the ability of AI recommendation strategies to temper ideological isolation at a topological level.
