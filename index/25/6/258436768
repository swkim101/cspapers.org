There is extensive literature on perceiving road structures by fusing various sensor inputs such as lidar point clouds and camera images using deep neural nets. Leveraging the latest advance of neural architects (such as transformers) and bird-eye-view (BEV) representation, the road cognition accuracy keeps improving. However, how to cognize the “road” for automated vehicles where there is no well-defined “roads” remains an open problem. For example, how to find paths inside intersections without HD maps is hard since there is neither an explicit definition for “roads” nor explicit features such as lane markings. The idea of this paper comes from a proverb: it becomes a way when people walk on it. Although there are no “roads” from sensor readings, there are “roads” from tracks of other vehicles. In this paper, we propose FlowMap, a path generation framework for automated vehicles based on traffic flows. FlowMap is built by extending our previous work RoadMap [1], a light-weight semantic map, with an additional traffic flow layer. A path generation algorithm on traffic flow fields (TFFs) is proposed to generate human-like paths. The proposed framework is validated using real-world driving data and is amenable to generating paths for super complicated intersections without using HD maps.
