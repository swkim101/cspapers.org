Gaze is promising for hands-free interaction on mobile devices. However, it is not clear how gaze interaction methods compare to each other in mobile settings. This paper presents the first experiment in a mobile setting that compares three of the most commonly used gaze interaction methods: Dwell time, Pursuits, and Gaze gestures. In our study, 24 participants selected one of 2, 4, 9, 12 and 32 targets via gaze while sitting and while walking. Results show that input using Pursuits is faster than Dwell time and Gaze gestures especially when there are many targets. Users prefer Pursuits when stationary, but prefer Dwell time when walking. While selection using Gaze gestures is more demanding and slower when there are many targets, it is suitable for contexts where accuracy is more important than speed. We conclude with guidelines for the design of gaze interaction on handheld mobile devices.
