We present two weakly-supervised deep learning frameworks for person indoor localization through Wi-Fi signal. These two frameworks, namely OT-Isomap and WiCluster, in contrast with prior works, require only room/zone level labels that is easier to acquire, compared to hard-to-acquire centimeter accuracy position labels. The OT-Isomap is a modality-agnostic model and formulates the localization problem in the context of parametric manifold learning and optimal transportation. This framework allows jointly learning a low-dimensional embedding as well as correspondences with a topological map. The WiCluster method is based on self-supervised deep clustering and metric learning models. Inspired by the deep cluster method, the Wi-Fi signals are spatially charted and represented in lower-dimensional space while a triplet margin-loss constrains an isometric representation of data on its 2D/3D intrinsic space. We demonstrate the meter-level accuracy of these two methods on both real-world Wi-Fi and camera-based indoor localization.
