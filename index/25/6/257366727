The computing education (CEd) research community's growth is fueled in part by the growing number of CEd Ph.D. graduates, who are also increasingly entering postdoctoral positions and fellowships. While prior work has shown that postdoctoral researchers have positive effects on research labs, provide essential support to graduate students, and serve critical roles in the research ecosystem, there are no existing support structures for postdoctoral researchers within CEd. As postdocs navigate the challenges of their new positions alongside the demands of research and job searches, they would benefit from a community of peers wherein they could share their experiences and learn from others. This Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) session is an organized space for CEd postdoctoral researchers, including those interested in postdoctoral positions, to build community and share postdoc experiences. Building on prior experience with running a similar BoF space for postdocs in SIGCSE 2022, the BoF discussion leaders is composed of current CEd postdocs, previous CEd postdocs who have taken on academic and research careers, and a CEd researcher from a non-academic space. This combination of diverse experiences, career contexts, and expertise will provide valuable perspectives that will aid in discussions of various postdoc experiences and research and career opportunities. BoF participants will have opportunities to discuss research goals, areas, and activities; exchange advice on navigating career paths and job searches; discuss approaches for mentorship within and outside research labs; and share best practices on the postdoc experience.
