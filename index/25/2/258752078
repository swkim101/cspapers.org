Microfluidics, also known as lab-on-a-chip or micro total analysis systems, can precisely regulate and manipulate micro-sized fluids. They have great potential in biology, chemistry, and medicine, as well as other fields of science. By definition, microfluidic devices operate with small-volume samples and small reactant quantities, which renders them both efficient and affordable. However, such small objects have very demanding requirements for the utilized optical detection system. Due to the specifics of those devices, monitoring the results of experiments is carried out with commercial inverted optical microscopes. Unfortunately, that type of optical device is still expensive. In this article, we present a truly functional, inexpensive, standalone, three-dimensionally printed, and inverted microscope, including the design, engineering, and manufacturing process and some of the experiments that have been conducted with it. Finally, we summarize the advantages of this three-dimensionally printed microscope (including the total fabrication costs) and the future improvements that will be introduced to it.
