In this paper, we propose a novel framework for synthesizing a single multimodal control policy capable of generating diverse behaviors (or modes) and emergent inherent transition maneuvers for bipedal locomotion. In our method, we first learn efficient latent encodings for each behavior by training an autoencoder from a dataset of rough reference motions. These latent encodings are used as commands to train a multimodal policy through an adaptive sampling of modes and transitions to ensure consistent performance across different behaviors. We validate the policy's performance in simulation for various distinct locomotion modes such as walking, leaping, jumping on a block, standing idle, and all possible combinations of inter-mode transitions. Finally, we integrate a task-based planner to rapidly generate open-loop mode plans for the trained multimodal policy to solve high-level tasks like reaching a goal position on a challenging terrain. Complex parkour-like motions by smoothly combining the discrete locomotion modes were generated in $\sim 3$ min. to traverse tracks with a gap of width 0.45 m, a plateau of height 0.2 m, and a block of height 0.4 m, which are all significant compared to the dimensions of our mini-biped platform.
