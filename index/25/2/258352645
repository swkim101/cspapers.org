In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm to control a team of cooperating robots aiming to protect a target from a set of intruders. Specifically, we model the strategy of the defending team by means of an online optimization problem inspired by the emerging distributed aggregative framework. In particular, each defending robot determines its own position depending on (i) the relative position between an associated intruder and the target, (ii) its contribution to the barycenter of the team, and (iii) collisions to avoid with its teammates. We highlight that each agent is only aware of local, noisy measurements about the location of the associated intruder and the target. Thus, in each robot, our algorithm needs to (i) locally reconstruct global unavailable quantities and (ii) predict its current objective functions starting from the local measurements. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is corroborated by simulations and experiments on a team of cooperating quadrotors.
