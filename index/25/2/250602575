E-commerce images are playing a central role in attracting people's attention when retailing and shopping online, and an accurate attention prediction is of significant importance for both customers and retailers, where its research is yet to start. In this paper, we establish the first dataset of saliency e-commerce images (SalECI), which allows for learning to predict saliency on the e-commerce images. We then provide specialized and thorough analysis by high-lighting the distinct features of e-commerce images, e.g., non-locality and correlation to text regions. Correspondingly, taking advantages of the non-local and self-attention mechanisms, we propose a salient SWin-Transformer back-bone, followed by a multi-task learning with saliency and text detection heads, where an information flow mechanism is proposed to further benefit both tasks. Experimental results have verified the state-of-the-art performances of our work in the e-commerce scenario.
