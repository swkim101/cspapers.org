Recent neural network-based wave functions have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in modeling ab-initio ground-state potential energy surface. However, these networks can only solve different spatial arrangements of the same set of atoms. To overcome this limitation, we present Graph-learned orbital embeddings (Globe), a neural network-based reparametrization method that can adapt neural wave functions to different molecules. Globe learns representations of local electronic structures that generalize across molecules via spatial message passing by connecting molecular orbitals to covalent bonds. Further, we propose a size-consistent wave function Ansatz, the Molecular orbital network (Moon), tailored to jointly solve Schr\"odinger equations of different molecules. In our experiments, we find Moon converging in 4.5 times fewer steps to similar accuracy as previous methods or to lower energies given the same time. Further, our analysis shows that Moon's energy estimate scales additively with increased system sizes, unlike previous work where we observe divergence. In both computational chemistry and machine learning, we are the first to demonstrate that a single wave function can solve the Schr\"odinger equation of molecules with different atoms jointly.
