Deep learning has made remarkable achievements for single image haze removal. However, existing deep dehazing models only give deterministic results without discussing the uncertainty of them. 
 There exist two types of uncertainty in the dehazing models: aleatoric uncertainty that comes from noise inherent in the observations and epistemic uncertainty that accounts for uncertainty in the model.
 In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-driven dehazing network (UDN) that improves the dehazing results by exploiting the relationship between the uncertain and confident representations. 
 We first introduce an Uncertainty Estimation Block (UEB) to predict the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty together. Then, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Feature Modulation (UFM) block to adaptively enhance the learned features. UFM predicts a convolution kernel and channel-wise modulation cofficients conitioned on the uncertainty weighted representation.
 Moreover, we develop an uncertainty-driven self-distillation loss to improve the uncertain representation by transferring the knowledge from the confident one.
 Extensive experimental results on synthetic datasets and real-world images show that UDN achieves significant quantitative and qualitative improvements, outperforming the state-of-the-arts.
