Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) has been used in the pipelines of various NLP tasks. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus on which models to use in which tasks. Muddying things further is the lack of comparisons that take differing training sets into account. In this paper, we present an application-focused empirical survey of neural OpenIE models, training sets, and benchmarks in an effort to help users choose the most suitable OpenIE systems for their applications. We find that the different assumptions made by different models and datasets have a statistically significant effect on performance, making it important to choose the most appropriate model for oneâ€™s applications. We demonstrate the applicability of our recommendations on a downstream Complex QA application.
