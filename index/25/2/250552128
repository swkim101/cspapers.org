Multi-object tracking in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos is an important vision task and can be applied in a wide range of applications. However, conventional multi-object trackers do not work well on UAV videos due to the challenging factors of irregular motion caused by moving camera and view change in 3D directions. In this paper, we propose a UAVMOT network specially for multi-object tracking in UAV views. The UAVMOT introduces an ID feature update module to enhance the object's feature association. To better handle the complex motions under UAV views, we develop an adaptive motion filter module. In addition, a gradient balanced focal loss is used to tackle the imbalance categories and small objects detection problem. Experimental results on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that the proposed UAVMOT achieves considerable improvement against the state-of-the-art tracking methods on UAV videos.
