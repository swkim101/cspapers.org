This paper provides an overview of my contributions to a project to measure and predict studentâ€™s mental workload when using digital interactive textbooks. The current work focuses on analysis of clickstream data from the textbook in search of viewing patterns among students. It was found that students typically fit one of three viewing patterns. These patterns can be used in further research to inform creation of new interactive texts for improved student success.
