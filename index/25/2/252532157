This paper proposes a method for learning continuous control policies for exploration and active landmark localization. We consider a mobile robot detecting landmarks within a limited sensing range, and tackle the problem of learning a control policy that maximizes the mutual information between the landmark states and the sensor observations. We employ a Kalman filter to convert the partially observable problem in the landmark states to a Markov decision process (MDP), a differentiable field of view to shape the reward function, and an attention-based neural network to represent the control policy. The approach is combined with active volumetric mapping to promote environment exploration in addition to landmark localization. The performance is demonstrated in several simulated landmark localization tasks in comparison with benchmark methods.
