There have been few high-impact deployments of hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives. We present the benefits and challenges of hardware acceleration of sophisticated cryptographic primitives and protocols, and briefly describe our recent work. We argue the significant potential for synergistic codesign of cryptography and hardware, where customized hardware accelerates cryptographic protocols that are designed with hardware acceleration in mind.
