In deep metric learning for visual recognition, the calibration of distance thresholds is crucial for achieving desired model performance in the true positive rates (TPR) or true negative rates (TNR). However, calibrating this threshold presents challenges in open-world scenarios, where the test classes can be entirely disjoint from those encountered during training. We define the problem of finding distance thresholds for a trained embedding model to achieve target performance metrics over unseen open-world test classes as open-world threshold calibration. Existing posthoc threshold calibration methods, reliant on inductive inference and requiring a calibration dataset with a similar distance distribution as the test data, often prove ineffective in open-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce OpenGCN, a Graph Neural Network-based transductive threshold calibration method with enhanced adaptability and robustness. OpenGCN learns to predict pairwise connectivity for the unlabeled test instances embedded in a graph to determine its TPR and TNR at various distance thresholds, allowing for transductive inference of the distance thresholds which also incorporates test-time information. Extensive experiments across open-world visual recognition benchmarks validate OpenGCN's superiority over existing posthoc calibration methods for open-world threshold calibration.
