This paper proposes a new primitive that allows soft robots to be physically controlled in a completely non-line-of-sight context using wireless energy - a process we call wireless actuation. Soft robots, which are composed entirely of soft materials and exclude any rigid components, are highly flexible platforms that can change their shape. This paper considers a specific class of soft robots composed of liquid-crystal elastomers (LCE) that are entirely electronics-free and engineered to change shape when heated to 60 Â°C. Traditionally, such robotic systems must be in line-of-sight of a light source, such as infrared to be moved, or require an external power supply for Joule heating and often take several tens of seconds to heat. We present WASER, a novel RF-based heating platform that allows electronics-free robots to be actuated rapidly (within a few seconds) and potentially in non-line-of-sight. WASER achieves this through innovations in both wireless systems and material science. On the wireless front, WASER develops a new blind beamforming solution that directs high-power wireless energy at fine spatial granularity without electronics on the robot to provide feedback. On the material science front, WASER exhibits heat-responsive shape-morphing and energy-harvesting material functionalities that allow for rapid wireless heating. We implement and evaluate WASER and demonstrate diverse shape-morphing capabilities.
