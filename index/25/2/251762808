The paper considers the problem of fault identification in dynamic systems described by linear differential equations. To solve this problem, diagnostic observers constructed on the basis of optimal control methods are used. The proposed new method for the synthesis of such observers is based on the idea of introducing a new system with some auxiliary control which plays a role of an unknown vector function describing emerging faults. This control is proposed to be formed in such a way that it provides a minimum for the residual functional. Unlike popular approaches to solving the problem of fault identification based on observers operating in a sliding mode, the proposed method allows us to expand the class of systems for which the identification problem can be solved. It is known that the methods of sliding mode observers design impose certain restrictions on the systems under consideration. The suggested theory is illustrated by an example. The simulation results confirmed the operability of the diagnostic observers synthesized using the method proposed in the work.
