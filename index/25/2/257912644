Clustering has been a major research topic in the field of machine learning, one to which Deep Learning has recently been applied with significant success. However, an aspect of clustering that is not addressed by existing deep clustering methods, is that of efficiently producing multiple, diverse partitionings for a given dataset. This is particularly important, as a diverse set of base clusterings are necessary for consensus clustering, which has been found to produce better and more robust results than relying on a single clustering. To address this gap, we propose Div-Clust, a diversity controlling loss that can be incorporated into existing deep clustering frameworks to produce multiple clusterings with the desired degree of diversity. We conduct experiments with multiple datasets and deep clustering frameworks and show that: a) our method effectively controls diversity across frameworks and datasets with very small additional computational cost, b) the sets of clusterings learned by DivClust include solutions that significantly outperform single-clustering baselines, and c) using an off-the-shelf consensus clustering algorithm, DivClust produces consensus clustering solutions that consistently outperform single-clustering baselines, effectively improving the performance of the base deep clustering framework.
