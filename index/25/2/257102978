The advancement of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has highlighted the lack of a user-friendly framework that can significantly reduce the difficulty of reproducing state-of-the-art ABSA performance, especially for beginners. To meet this demand, we present PyABSA, a modularized framework built on PyTorch for reproducible ABSA. To facilitate ABSA research, PyABSA supports several ABSA subtasks, including aspect term extraction, aspect sentiment classification, and end-to-end aspect-based sentiment analysis. With just a few lines of code, the result of a model on a specific dataset can be reproduced. With a modularized design, PyABSA can also be flexibly extended to incorporate new models, datasets, and other related tasks. Additionally, PyABSA highlights its data augmentation and annotation features, which significantly address data scarcity. The project is available at: https://github.com/yangheng95/PyABSA.
