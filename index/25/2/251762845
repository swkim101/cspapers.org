This paper presents the study of a variable speed wind turbine. The power conversion system is based on a double-fed induction generator (DFIG). The parameters involved in this study are the active and reactive powers exchanged between the DFIG stator and the grid. For this purpose, sliding mode control will be adopted to ensure the control of these powers and obtain the appropriate voltages and currents. The validity of the sliding mode control will be verified with simulations performed on Matlab/Simulink software. In fact, the results obtained verify the performance of such a control to ensure a good quality of energy that will be injected into the electrical network.
