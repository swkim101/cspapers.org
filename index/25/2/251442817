Despite recent progress on conversational systems, they still do not perform smoothly when faced with ambiguous requests. When questions are unclear, conversational systems should have the ability to ask clarifying questions, rather than assuming a particular interpretation or simply responding that they do not understand. While the research community has paid substantial attention to the problem of predicting query ambiguity in traditional search contexts, researchers have paid relatively little attention to predicting when this ambiguity is sufficient to warrant clarification in the context of conversational systems. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for predicting the need for clarification. This method is based on the measured coherency of results from an initial answer retrieval step, under the assumption that a less ambiguous query is more likely to retrieve more coherent results when compared to an ambiguous query. We build a graph from retrieved items based on their context similarity, treating measures of graph connectivity as indicators of ambiguity. We evaluate our approach on two open-domain conversational question answering datasets, ClariQ and AmbigNQ, comparing it with neural and non-neural baselines. Our unsupervised approach performs as well as supervised approaches while providing better generalization.
