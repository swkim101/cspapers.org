This paper outlines an automated creation system for Chinese landscape paintings based on generative adversarial networks. The system consists of three cascaded modules: generation, resizing, and super-resolution. The generation module first generates a square-shaped painting, then the resizing module predicts an appropriate aspect ratio for it and performs resizing, and finally the super-resolution module is used to increase the resolution and improve the quality. After training each module with the images we collected from the web, our system can create high-resolution landscape paintings in arbitrary sizes.
