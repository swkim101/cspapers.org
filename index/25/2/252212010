As robots across domains start collaborating with humans in shared environments, algorithms that enable them to reason over human intent are important to achieve safe inter-play. In our work, we study human intent through the problem of predicting trajectories in dynamic environments. We explore domains where navigation guidelines are relatively strictly defined but not clearly marked in their physical environments. We hypothesize that within these domains, agents tend to exhibit short-term motion patterns that reveal context information related to the agent's general direction, intermediate goals and rules of motion, e.g., social behavior. From this intuition, we propose Social-PatteRNN, an algorithm for recurrent, multi-modal trajectory prediction that exploits motion patterns to encode the aforesaid contexts. Our approach guides long-term trajectory prediction by learning to predict short-term motion patterns. It then extracts sub-goal information from the patterns and aggregates it as social context. We assess our approach across three domains: humans crowds, humans in sports and manned aircraft in terminal airspace, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
