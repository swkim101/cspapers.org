The QUIC standard is expected to replace TCP in HTTP 3.0. While QUIC implements a number of the standard features of TCP differently, most QUIC stacks re-implement standard congestion control algorithms. This is because these algorithms are well-understood and time-tested. However, there is currently no systematic way to ensure that these QUIC congestion control protocols are implemented correctly and predict how these different QUIC implementations will interact with other congestion control algorithms on the Internet. To address this gap, we present QUICbench, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first congestion control benchmarking tool for QUIC stacks. QUICbench determines how closely the implementation of a QUIC congestion control algorithm conforms to the reference (kernel) implementation by comparing their respective throughput-delay tradeoffs. QUICbench can also be used to systematically compare a new QUIC implementation to previous and different implementations of both QUIC and kernel-based congestion control algorithms. Our measurement study suggests that there is already significant deviation between the existing QUIC implementations of standard congestion control algorithms from the reference implementations. We demonstrate how QUICbench can help us identify the implementation differences responsible for these deviations so that they can be suitably corrected.
