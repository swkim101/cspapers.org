With the advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, virtual displays have become integral to how museums, galleries, and other tourist destinations present their collections to the public. However, the current lack of immersion in virtual reality displays limits the user’s ability to experience and appreciate its aesthetics. This paper presents a case study of a creative approach taken by a tourist attraction venue in developing a physical network system that allows visitors to enhance VR’s aesthetic aspects based on environmental parameters gathered by external sensors. Our system was collaboratively developed through interviews and sessions with twelve stakeholder groups interested in art and exhibitions. This paper demonstrates how our technological advancements in interaction, immersion and visual attractiveness surpass those of earlier virtual display generations. Through multimodal interaction, we aim to encourage innovation on the Web and create more visually appealing and engaging virtual displays. It is hoped that the greater online art community will gain fresh insight into how people interact with virtual worlds as a result of this work.
