Source localization, as a reverse problem of graph diffusion, is important for many applications such as rumor tracking, detecting computer viruses, and finding epidemic spreaders. However, it is still under-explored due to the inherent uncertainty of the diffusion process: after a long period of propagation, the same diffusion process may start with diverse sources. Most existing solutions utilize deterministic models and therefore cannot describe the diffusion uncertainty of sources. Moreover, current probabilistic approaches are hard to conduct smooth transformations with variational inference. To overcome the limitations, we propose a probabilistic framework using continuous normalizing flows with invertible transformations and graph neural networks to explicitly model the uncertainty of the diffusion source. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over strong baselines.
