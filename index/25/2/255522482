Industrial robots are increasingly deployed in applications requiring an end effector tool to closely track a specified path, such as in spraying and welding. Performance and productivity present possibly conflicting objectives: tracking accuracy, path speed, and motion uniformity. Industrial robots are programmed through motion primitives consisting of waypoints connected by pre-defined motion segments, with specified parameters such as path speed and blending zone. The actual executed robot motion depends on the robot joint servo controller and joint motion constraints (e.g., velocity, acceleration limits) which are largely unknown to the users. Programming a robot to achieve the desired performance today is time-consuming and mostly manual, requiring tuning a large number of coupled parameters in the motion primitives. The performance also depends on the choice of additional param-eters: possible redundant degrees of freedom, location of the target curve, and the robot configuration. This paper presents a systematic approach to optimize robot motion parameters. The approach first selects the static parameters, then chooses the motion primitives, and finally iteratively updates the waypoints to minimize the tracking error. The ultimate performance objective is to maximize the path speed subject to the tracking accuracy and speed uniformity constraints over the entire path. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach both in simulation and on physical systems for ABB and FANUC robots applied to two challenging example curves. Comparing with the baseline using the current industry practice, the optimized performance shows over 100% performance improvement.
