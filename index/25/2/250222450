Accounts Payable (AP) is a resource-intensive business process in large enterprises for paying vendors within contractual payment deadlines for goods and services procured from them. There are multiple verifications before payment to the supplier/vendor. After the validations, the invoice flows through several steps such as vendor identification, line-item matching for Purchase order (PO) based invoices, Accounting Code identification for Non- Purchase order (Non-PO) based invoices, tax code identification, etc. Currently, each of these steps is mostly manual and cumbersome making it labor-intensive, error-prone, and requiring constant training of agents. Automatically processing these invoices for payment without any manual intervention is quite difficult. To tackle this challenge, we have developed an automated end-to-end invoice processing system using AI-based modules for multiple steps of the invoice processing pipeline. It can be configured to an individual clientâ€™s requirements with minimal effort. Currently, the system is deployed in production for two clients. It has successfully processed around ~80k invoices out of which 76% invoices were processed with low or no manual intervention.
