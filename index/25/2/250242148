Tropical cyclones (TC) are extreme weather phenomena that bring heavy disasters to humans. Existing forecasting techniques contain computationally intensive dynamical models and statistical methods with complex inputs, both of which have bottlenecks in intensity forecasting, and we aim to create data-driven methods to break this forecasting bottleneck. The research goal of my PhD topic is to introduce novel methods to provide accurate and trustworthy forecasting of TC by developing interpretable machine learning models to analyze the characteristics of TC from multiple sources of data such as satellite remote sensing and observations.
