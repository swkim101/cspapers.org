Versatile Internet of Things (IoT) applications call for re-configurable IoT devices that can easily extend new functionality on demand. However, the heterogeneity of functional chips brings difficulties in device customization, leading to inadequate flexibility. In this paper, we propose LEGO, a novel architecture for chip-level re-configurable IoT devices that supports plug-and-play with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) chips. To combat the heterogeneity of functional chips, we first design a novel Unified Chip Description Language (UCDL) with meta-operation and chip specifications to access various types of functional chips uniformly. Then, to achieve chips plug-and-play, we build up a novel platform and shift all chip control logic to the gateway, which makes IoT devices entirely decoupled from specific applications and does not need to make any changes when plugging in new functional chips. Finally, to handle communications overheads, we built up a novel orchestration architecture for gateway instructions, which minimizes instruction transmission frequency in remote chip control. We implement the prototype and conduct extensive evaluations with 100+ types of COTS functional chips. The results show that new functional chips can be automatically accessed by the system within 0.13 seconds after being plugged in, and only bringing 0.53 kb of communication load on average, demonstrating the efficacy of LEGO design.
