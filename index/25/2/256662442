Representing code changes as numeric feature vectors, i.e., code change representations, is usually an essential step to automate many software engineering tasks related to code changes, e.g., commit message generation and just-in-time defect prediction. Intuitively, the quality of code change representations is crucial for the effectiveness of automated approaches. Prior work on code changes usually designs and evaluates code change representation approaches for a specific task, and little work has investigated code change encoders that can be used and jointly trained on various tasks. To fill this gap, this work proposes a novel Code Change Representation learning approach named CCRep, which can learn to encode code changes as feature vectors for diverse downstream tasks. Specifically, CCRep regards a code change as the combination of its before-change and after-change code, leverages a pre-trained code model to obtain high-quality contextual embeddings of code, and uses a novel mechanism named query back to extract and encode the changed code fragments and make them explicitly interact with the whole code change. To evaluate CCRep and demonstrate its applicability to diverse code-change-related tasks, we apply it to three tasks: commit message generation, patch correctness assessment, and just-in-time defect prediction. Experimental results show that CCRep outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques on each task.
