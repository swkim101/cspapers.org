Despite the fact that most real-world software systems today are written in multiple programming languages, existing program analysis based security techniques are still limited to single-language code. In consequence, security ﬂaws (e.g., code vulnerabilities) at and across language boundaries are largely left out as blind spots. We present P OLY C RUISE , a technique that enables holistic dynamic information ﬂow analysis (DIFA) across heterogeneous languages hence security applications empowered by DIFA (e.g., vulnerability discovery) for multilingual software. P OLY C RUISE combines a light language-speciﬁc analysis that computes symbolic dependencies in each language unit with a language-agnostic online data ﬂow analysis guided by those dependencies, in a way that overcomes language heterogeneity. Extensive evaluation of its implementation for Python-C programs against micro, medium-sized, and large-scale benchmarks demonstrated P OLY C RUISE ’s practical scalability and promising capabilities. It has enabled the discovery of 14 unknown cross-language security vulnerabilities in real-world multilingual systems such as NumPy, with 11 conﬁrmed, 8 CVEs assigned, and 8 ﬁxed so far. We also contributed the ﬁrst benchmark suite for systematically assessing multilingual DIFA.
