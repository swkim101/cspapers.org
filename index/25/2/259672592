During the last decades, multi-label classification (MLC) has attracted the attention of more and more researchers due to its wide real-world applications. Many boosting methods for MLC have been proposed and achieved great successes. However, these methods only extend existing boosting frameworks to MLC and take loss functions in multi-label version to guide the iteration. These loss functions generally give a comprehensive evaluation on the label set entirety, and thus the characteristics of different labels are ignored. In this paper, we propose a multi-path AdaBoost framework specific to MLC, where each boosting path is established for distinct label and the combination of them is able to provide a maximum optimization to Hamming Loss. In each iteration, classifiers chain is taken as the base classifier to strengthen the connection between multiple AdaBoost paths and exploit the label correlation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
