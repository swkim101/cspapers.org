The click-based interactive segmentation aims to extract the object of interest from an image with the guidance of user clicks. Recent work has achieved great overall performance by employing feedback from the output. However, in most state-of-the-art approaches, 1) the inference stage involves inflexible heuristic rules and requires a separate refinement model, and 2) the number of user clicks and model performance cannot be balanced. To address the challenges, we propose a click-based and mask-guided interactive image segmentation framework containing three novel components: Cascade-Forward Refinement (CFR), Iterative Click Loss (ICL), and SUEM image augmentation. The CFR offers a unified inference framework to generate segmentation results in a coarse-to-fine manner. The proposed ICL allows model training to improve segmentation and reduce user interactions simultaneously. The proposed SUEM augmentation is a comprehensive way to create large and diverse training sets for interactive image segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach on five public datasets. Remarkably, our model reduces by 33.2%, and 15.5% the number of clicks required to surpass an IoU of 0.95 in the previous state-of-the-art approach on the Berkeley and DAVIS sets, respectively.
