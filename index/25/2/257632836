This paper explores Exit-Less, Isolated, and Shared Access (ELISA), a novel in-memory object sharing scheme for Virtual Machines (VMs). ELISA has the isolation advantage over the shared memory directly exposed to guest VMs while its overhead is smaller than that of host-interposition relying on the costly exit from the VM context. In a nutshell, ELISA isolates shared in-memory objects by Extended Page Table (EPT) separation, and a guest VM accesses them by switching the EPT context using VMFUNC, a low-overhead CPU instruction of Intel CPUs. Our experiment shows that the overhead of ELISA is 3.5 times smaller than that of VMCALL-oriented host-interposition. We demonstrate the benefits of ELISA through two use cases; by replacing VMCALL with ELISA, a VM networking system and an in-memory key-value store exhibit 163% and 64% higher performance respectively.
