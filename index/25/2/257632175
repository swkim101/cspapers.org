In the era of the Web of Things, the Metaverse is expected to be the landing site for the next generation of the Internet, resulting in the increased popularity of related technologies and applications in recent years and gradually becoming the focus of Internet research. The Metaverse, as a link between the real and virtual worlds, can provide users with immersive experiences. As the concept of the Metaverse grows in popularity, many scholars and developers begin to focus on the Metaverse’s ethics and core. This paper argues that the Metaverse should be centered on humans. That is, humans constitute the majority of the Metaverse. As a result, we begin this paper by introducing the Metaverse’s origins, characteristics, related technologies, and the concept of the human-centric Metaverse (HCM). Second, we discuss the manifestation of human-centric in the Metaverse. Finally, we discuss some current issues in the construction of HCM. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of the applications of human-centric technologies in the Metaverse, as well as the relevant HCM application scenarios. We hope that this paper can provide researchers and developers with some directions and ideas for human-centric Metaverse construction.
