Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) ranging sensors have been widely adopted for robotic navigation thanks to their extremely high bandwidth and hence high resolution. However, off-the-shelf devices may output ranges with significant errors in cluttered, severe non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments. Recently, neural networks have been actively studied to improve the ranging accuracy of UWB sensors using the channel-impulse-response (CIR) as input. However, previous works have not systematically evaluated the efficacy of various packet types and their possible combinations in a two-way-ranging transaction, including poll, response and final packets. In this paper, we firstly investigate the utility of different packet types and their combinations when used as input for a neural network. Secondly, we propose two novel data-driven approaches, namely FMCIR and WMCIR, that leverage two-sided CIRs for efficient UWB error mitigation. Our approaches outperform state-of-the-art by a significant margin, further reducing range errors up to 45%. Finally, we create and release a dataset of transaction-level synchronized CIRs (each sample consists of the CIR of the poll, response and final packets), which will enable further studies in this area.
