This paper is dedicated to study the performance of the optimal control for linear systems by sliding mode of the first order with the integration of a Linear Quadratic Regulator LQR, applied to the pendulum. We are interested in the design of an optimal and robust control law which is, derived, to satisfy the precision, the convergence, the speed of and the asymptotic stabilization of the system despite the perturbations and the uncertainties born and a multi-optimization. The goal is to minimize the phenomenon of chattering. Simulation, results have been presented to confirm the usefulness and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.
