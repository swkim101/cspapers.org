Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in learning representations for molecules, which is crucial for various biochemical applications, ranging from property prediction to drug design. However, training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) from scratch often requires abundant labeled molecules, which are expensive to acquire in the real world. To alleviate this issue, tremendous efforts have been devoted to Chemical Pre-trained Models (CPMs), where DNNs are pre-trained using large-scale unlabeled molecular databases and then fine-tuned over specific downstream tasks. Despite the prosperity, there lacks a systematic review of this fast-growing field. In this paper, we present the first survey that summarizes the current progress of CPMs. We first highlight the limitations of training molecular representation models from scratch to motivate CPM studies. Next, we systematically review recent advances on this topic from several key perspectives, including molecular descriptors, encoder architectures, pre-training strategies, and applications. We also highlight the challenges and promising avenues for future research, providing a useful resource for both machine learning and scientific communities.
