Time-consuming performance evaluation is the bottleneck of traditional Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods. Predictor-based NAS can speed up performance evaluation by directly predicting performance, rather than training a large number of sub-models and then validating their performance. Most predictor-based NAS approaches use a proxy dataset to train model-based predictors efficiently but suffer from performance degradation and generalization problems. We attribute these problems to the poor abilities of existing predictors to character the sub-models' structure, specifically the topology information extraction and the node feature representation of the input graph data. To address these problems, we propose a Transformer-like NAS predictor PINAT, consisting of a Permutation INvariance Augmentation module serving as both token embedding layer and self-attention head, as well as a Laplacian matrix to be the positional encoding. Our design produces more representative features of the encoded architecture and outperforms state-of-the-art NAS predictors on six search spaces: NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, DARTS, ProxylessNAS, PPI, and ModelNet.
