The kinegram is a classic animation technique that involves sliding a striped overlay across an interlaced image to create the effect of frame-by-frame motion. While there are known tools for generating kinegrams from preexisting videos and images, there exists no system for capturing and fabricating kinegrams in situ. To bridge this gap, we created KineCAM, an open source1 instant camera that captures and prints animated photographs in the form of kinegrams. We present our experience using KineCAM to create a portrait series, and discuss how this type of customizable instant camera platform can create new opportunities for experimental and social photography.
