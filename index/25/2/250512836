In our daily life, there are many objects represented by cylindrical shapes and ellipsoids. The tops of these objects are formed by elliptic shape primitives. Thus, it is available for a robot to manipulate these objects by ellipse detection. In this work, we propose a novel approach to generating ground truth for training the model based on domain randomization. Using synthetic data generated in this manner, we build an end-to-end deep neural network with a detection backbone and then, combine multiple branches archived from the backbone for sharing the multiple-scale features; further, after employing active rotation filters, the features pass through the region proposal net to form the prediction branches of the box, orientation regression, and object classification; finally, these branches are fused to do ellipse detection, allowing robotic manipulations of cylinders and ellipsoids. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed detector, we show the comparison results with the state-of-the-art detector on synthetic and public datasets. The proposed model for ellipse detection and data generation pipeline based on domain randomization in a simulation are evaluated by a series of robotic manipulations implemented in real application scenarios. The results illustrate a high success rate on real-world grasp attempts despite having only been trained on a synthetic dataset.
