We consider a contrastive learning approach to knowledge graph embedding (KGE) via InfoNCE. For KGE, efficient learning relies on augmenting the training data with negative triples. However, most KGE works overlook the bias from generating the negative triples- false negative triples (factual triples missing from the knowledge graph). We argue that generating high-quality (i.e., hard) negative triples might lead to an increase in false negative triples. To mitigate the impact of false negative triples during the generation of hard negative triples, we propose the Hardness and Structure-aware (HaSa) contrastive KGE method, which alleviates the effect of false negative triples while generating the hard negative triples. Experiments show that HaSa improves the performance of InfoNCE-based KGE approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results in several metrics for WN18RR datasets and competitive results for FB15k-237 datasets compared to classic and pre-trained LM-based KGE methods.
