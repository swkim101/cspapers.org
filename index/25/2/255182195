Remotely controlled hydraulically driven robots are expected to play an important role in extreme environments such as disaster sites, and force feedback is effective for improving the fidelity of the remote environment and the work efficiency. However, it is not reasonable to attach a force sensor directly to the end-point of a hydraulically driven robot. In a previous study, the authors showed that the impact forces, which are important information to improve the fidelity of the remote environment and work efficiency, can be estimated by using the information of acceleration of each link in addition to the cylinder pressures. In this paper, we investigated how many accelerometers and where those accelerometers should be attached on each link by using an index called GDOP (Geometric Dilution Of Precision) to improve the accuracy of impact force estimation. The experimental results show that although the estimation accuracy could not be improved significantly by rearranging the accelerometers, the effect of reducing the noise of the estimated load due to the sensor noise was confirmed.
