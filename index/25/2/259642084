In light of significant issues in the technology industry, such as algorithms that worsen racial biases, the spread of online misinformation, and the expansion of mass surveillance, it is increasingly important to teach the ethics and sociotechnical implications of developing and using artificial intelligence (AI). Using 53 survey responses from engineering undergraduates, this paper measures students' abilities to identify, mitigate, and reflect on a hypothetical AI ethics scenario. We engage with prior research on pedagogical approaches to and considerations for teaching AI ethics and highlight some of the obstacles that engineering undergraduate students experience in learning and applying AI ethics concepts.
