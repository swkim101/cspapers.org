Sequential recommender models typically generate predictions in a single step during testing, without considering additional prediction correction to enhance performance as humans would. To improve the accuracy of these models, some researchers have attempted to simulate human analogical reasoning to correct predictions for testing data by drawing analogies with the prediction errors of similar training data. However, there are inherent gaps between testing and training data, which can make this approach unreliable. To address this issue, we propose an Abductive Prediction Correction (APC) framework for sequential recommendation. Our approach simulates abductive reasoning to correct predictions. Specifically, we design an abductive reasoning task that infers the most probable historical interactions from the future interactions predicted by a recommender, and minimizes the discrepancy between the inferred and true historical interactions to adjust the predictions. We perform the abductive inference and adjustment using a reversed sequential model in the forward and backward propagation manner of neural networks. Our APC framework is applicable to various differentiable sequential recommender models. We implement it on three backbone models and demonstrate its effectiveness. We release the code at https://github.com/zyang1580/APC.
