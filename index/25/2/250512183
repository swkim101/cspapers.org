The variety and complexity of tasks autonomous robots can tackle is constantly increasing, yet we seldom see robots collaborating with humans. Indeed, humans are either requested for punctual help or are given the lead on the whole task. We propose a human-aware task planning approach allowing the robot to plan for a task while also considering and emulating the human decision, action, and reaction processes. Our approach, named Human-Aware Task Planner with Emulation of Human Decisions and Actions (HATP/EHDA), is based on the exploration of multiple hierarchical tasks networks albeit differently whether the agent is considered to be controllable (the robot) or uncontrollable (the human). We present the rationale of our approach along with a formalization and show its potential on an illustrative example.
