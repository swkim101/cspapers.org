The NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial State) conjecture of Freedman and Hastings posits that there exist families of Hamiltonians with all low energy states of non-trivial complexity (with complexity measured by the quantum circuit depth preparing the state). We prove this conjecture by showing that a particular family of constant-rate and linear-distance qLDPC codes correspond to NLTS local Hamiltonians, although we believe this to be true for all current constructions of good qLDPC codes.
