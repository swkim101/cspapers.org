 Many complex engineering systems can be represented in a topological form, such as graphs. This paper utilizes a machine learning technique called Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) to aid designers with challenging, graph-centric design problems. The strategy presented here is to take the graph data and apply GDL to seek the best realizable performing solution effectively and efficiently with lower computational costs. This case study used here is the synthesis of analog electrical circuits that attempt to match a specific frequency response within a particular frequency range. Previous studies utilized an enumeration technique to generate 43,249 unique undirected graphs presenting valid potential circuits. Unfortunately, determining the sizing and performance of many circuits can be too expensive. To reduce computational costs with a quantified trade-off in accuracy, the fraction of the circuit graphs and their performance are used as input data to a classification-focused GDL model. Then, the GDL model can be used to predict the remainder cheaply, thus, aiding decision-makers in the search for the best graph solutions. The results discussed in this paper show that additional graph-based features are useful, favorable total set classification accuracy of 80% in using only 10% of the graphs, and iteratively-built GDL models can further subdivide the graphs into targeted groups with medians significantly closer to the best and containing 88.2 of the top 100 best-performing graphs on average.
