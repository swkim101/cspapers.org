 This paper describes a methodology for automation of measurements in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software by enabling the use of supervised learning algorithms. The paper presents a proof of concept of how dimensions are placed automatically in the drawing at predicted positions. The framework consists of two trained neural networks and a rule-based system. Four steps compound the methodology. 1. Create a data set of labeled images for training a pre-built convolutional neural network (YOLOv5) using CAD automatic procedures. 2. Train the model to make predictions on 2D drawing imagery, identifying their relevant features. 3. Reuse the information extracted from YOLOv5 in a new neural network to produce measurement data. The output of this model is a matrix containing measurement location and size data. 4. Convert the final data output into actual measurements of an unseen geometry using a rule-based system for automatic dimension generation. Although the rule-based system is highly dependent on the problem and the CAD software, both supervised learning models exhibit high performance and reusability. Future work aims to make the framework suitable for more complex products. The methodology presented is promising and shows potential for minimizing human resources in repetitive CAD work, particularly in the task of creating engineering drawings.
