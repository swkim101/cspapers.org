The difficulty associated with the coordinated locomotion of legged robots grows quickly as the number of joints increases. Although prior approaches have addressed this problem through sampling-based planners, learning-based techniques have recently been explored as a means to handle such complexity. Among these recent approaches are systems that utilize probabilistic graphical models in order to infer parameters for central pattern generators (CPGs) which enable the path-following locomotion of highly-articulated legged robots through unstructured terrain. This paper presents a novel formulation of a CPG parameter inference-based path-following controller. The new inference process and accompanying CPG formulation enforce oscillator convergence to the limit-cycle specified by the inferred parameters in addition to biasing towards parameters that quickly reach stable-state. This formulation is shown to improve the performance of CPG parameter inference-based path-following control for legged robots across a number of simulated and physical experiments.
