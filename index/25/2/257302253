In an attempt to widen the family of Phosphorus Metal Halides (MxPyXz) and enable new applications, post-synthetic modifications to the MxPyXz, Cu2P3I2 have been reported. While such a technique suggests access to an entirely new family of MxPyXz-based materials, we report, in this work, that the ion-exchange process seemingly influences important properties such as the crystallographic pattern and vibrational modes.
