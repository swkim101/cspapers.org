Two-party computation (2PC) is promising to enable privacy-preserving deep learning (DL). However, the 2PC-based privacy-preserving DL implementation comes with high comparison protocol overhead from the non-linear operators. This work presents PASNet, a novel systematic framework that enables low latency, high energy efficiency & accuracy, and security-guaranteed 2PC-DL by integrating the hardware latency of the cryptographic building block into the neural architecture search loss function. We develop a cryptographic hardware scheduler and the corresponding performance model for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) as a case study. The experimental results demonstrate that our light-weighted model PASNet-A and heavily-weighted model PASNet-B achieve 63 ms and 228 ms latency on private inference on ImageNet, which are 147 and 40 times faster than the SOTA CryptGPU system, and achieve 70.54% & 78.79% accuracy and more than 1000 times higher energy efficiency. The pretrained PASNet models and test code can be found on Github1.
