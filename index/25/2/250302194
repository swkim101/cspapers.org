We recommend using a model-centric, Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) formalism to obtain useful explanations of trained model behavior, different and complementary to what can be gleaned from LIME and SHAP, popular data-centric explanation tools in Artificial Intelligence (AI).We compare and contrast these methods, and show that data-centric methods may yield brittle explanations of limited practical utility.The model-centric framework, however, can offer actionable insights into risks of using AI models in practice. For critical applications of AI, split-second decision making is best informed by robust explanations that are invariant to properties of data, the capability offered by model-centric frameworks.
