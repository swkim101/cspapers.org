To achieve real-time dynamic simulation analysis and optimization design, a dynamic digital twin of a nonholonomic mobile manipulator (one UR5e mounted on an industrial mobile robot MIR 200) has been developed in this paper. First, the digital twin integrated with dynamics of a mobile manipulator is established. The framework of the dynamic digital twin is presented in detail. Then, the dynamic model of the system has been established with the consideration of the physical interaction between the robot and humans/environments using Lagrange formulation. Finally, the experimental testing has been conducted to validate the dynamic model and evaluate the performances (such as real-time property, accuracy, etc.) of the dynamic digital twin that is integrated with the physical human/environment-robot interaction.
