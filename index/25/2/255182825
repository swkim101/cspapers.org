We have witnessed the broad adoption of Deep Neu-ral Networks (DNNs) in autonomous vehicles (AV). As a safety-critical system, deadline-based scheduling is used to guarantee the predictability of the AV system. However, non-negligible time variations exist for most DNN models in an AV system, even when the whole system is just running one model. The fact that multiple DNNs are running on the same platform makes the time variations issue even more severe. However, none of the existing works have thoroughly studied the root cause of the time variation issue. In the first part of the paper, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study. We found that the inference time variations for a single DNN model are mainly caused by the DNN's multi-stage/multi-branch structure, which has a dynamic number of proposals or raw points. In addition, we found that the uncoordinated contention and cooperation are the roots of the time variations for multi-tenant DNNs inference. Second, based on these insights, we proposed the Prophet system that addresses the time variations in the AV perception system in two steps. The first step is to predict the time variations based on the intermediate results like proposals and raw points. The second step is coordinating the multi-tenant DNNs to ensure the execution progress is close to each other. From the evaluation results on the KITTI dataset, the time prediction of a single model all achieve higher than 91% accuracy for Faster R-CNN, LaneNet, and PINet. Besides, the perception fusion delay is bounded to 150ms, and the fusion drop ratio is reduced from 5.4% to less than 1 percent.
