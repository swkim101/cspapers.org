The constantly increasing demand for electricity and the increasingly widespread use of renewable energy sources significantly impact equalizing peak loads on the grid. One way to balance peak loads is to use energy storage devices. The article provides an overview of the most common energy storage devices, making it possible to compensate for the lack of power in the network quickly. Furthermore, the authors carried out a comparative analysis of three energy stor-age systems (lithium-ion battery, compressed air energy storage system, cryogenic energy storage system) for a human life object and selected the most economically profitable energy storage system.
