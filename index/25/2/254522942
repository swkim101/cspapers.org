The processes of supramolecular aggregation occurring on carbon surfaces in aqueous solutions of bovine serum albumin (BSA) during drying were studied using modern scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The carbon materials studied were highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and glassy carbon (GC). Based on the analysis of SEM images and EDX-scanning element distribution maps, a possible mechanism for the formation of the observed intricate structures on the surface was proposed. The formation of fuzzy lacy structures resembling shadow replicas was explained by relatively strong hydrophobicâ€“hydrophobic interactions of albumin molecules with carbon surfaces.
