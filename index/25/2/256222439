This work reveals the essence and analyzes the advantages and problems on the way of using additive manufacturing in the electrical machines development. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed that this issue is being raised by some scientific groups, but is at an early stage of research. In particular, the main problems are unresolved problems of porosity in printing, a limited list of materials suitable for use, as well as unapproved parameters and methods of using additive technologies in the production of electrical machines. However, despite the indicated disadvantages, additive manufacturing can bring such advantages to the creation of electrical machines as a significant reduction in design and manufacturing time, an increase in the repeatability of products, the possibility of introducing new topologies due to the manufacture of complex structures, and the elimination of manual labor. The authors of the article propose their own approach to the implementation of the first stage of research on the introduction of additive technologies in the electrical machines development. The machine weight reduction and advanced materials with better magnetic characteristics are expected as a result of this work.
