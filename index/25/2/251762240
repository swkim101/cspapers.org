CubeSats are being deployed for a number of activities including Earth observation, telecommunications, scientific experiments, and due to their low cost and flexibility, more often than not, they are even being considered for use in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and debris removal missions. This investigation focuses on using the CubeSat technology to perform autonomous proximity operations with passive target bodies including satellites or space debris. The nonlinear coupled attitude and orbit dynamics for the chaser and the target bodies are modelled and simulated. A nonlinear optimal controller identifies an appropriate rendezvous path. A vision-based navigation system on the chaser satellite records the pose of the target body. The pose observations with stochastic uncertainties are processed using a Kalman filter, and offer state feedback along the satellite path. Such observations in conjunction with the postulated linear control algorithm anchor the chaser to approach the target by maintaining appropriate relative configuration. The linear controller delivers regular maneuvers to compensate for any deviations from the identified reference path. A close-range rendezvous operation is illustrated in a Mission Design Simulator (MDS) tool.
