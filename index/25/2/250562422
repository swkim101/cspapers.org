GUI testing has been prevailing in software testing. However, existing automated GUI testing tools mostly rely on frameworks of a specific platform. Testers have to fully understand platform features before developing platform-dependent GUI testing tools. Starting from the perspective of testerâ€™s vision, we observe that GUIs on different platforms share commonalities of widget images and layout designs, which can be leveraged to achieve platform-independent testing. We propose UniRLTest, an automated software testing framework, to achieve platform independence testing. UniRLTest utilizes computer vision techniques to capture all the widgets in the screenshot and constructs a widget tree for each page. A set of all the executable actions in each tree will be generated accordingly. UniRLTest adopts a Deep Q-Network, a reinforcement learning (RL) method, to the exploration process and formalize the Android GUI testing problem to a Marcov Decision Process (MDP), where RL could work. We have conducted evaluation experiments on 25 applications from different platforms. The result shows that UniRLTest outperforms baselines in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.
