This study is focused on the potential of energy saving for outdoor lighting of Kabul University campus. Its outdoor lighting is not to todayâ€™s energy performance standards, it still uses great number of MH (metal halide) lights for outdoor lighting. We have used lights retrofit, energy management and control scenarios and found that, only lights retrofit can save around 51 % of its current energy consumption. If we consider the dimming and control mechanism, we can save around 83% of its current energy consumption. The payback period is 2.7 years for the first case and 1.7 years for the second case. It declares that the second scenario payback is one year sooner compared to the first scenario.
