Smart contracts are self-executing computer programs deployed on blockchain to enable trustworthy exchange of value without the need of a central authority. With the absence of documentation and specifications, routine tasks such as program understanding, maintenance, verification, and validation, remain challenging for smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a dynamic invariant detection tool, InvCon, for Ethereum smart contracts to mitigate this issue. The detected invariants can be used to not only support the reverse engineering of contract specifications, but also enable standard-compliance checking for contract implementations. InvCon provides a Web-based interface and a demonstration video of it is available at: https://youtu.be/Y1QBHjDSMYk.
