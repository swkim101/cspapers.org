Millimeter-wave backscatter can simultaneously support high-precision sensing and massive communication and represent one prominent technical evolution in next-generation wireless systems. The backscatter tags should ideally work across a wide mmWave spectrum range with consistent signal strength and angular coverage to accommodate highly diverse application scenarios. However, existing tags made of resonant antennas and RFICs only achieve a few GHz of bandwidth and hardly meet these requirements. In this paper, we present UniScatter, a new backscatter tag structure based on metamaterials. The key design of UniScatter is a graphene-based modulator and a lens-based retroreflector, which have consistent electromagnetic responses across an extensive frequency range and wide angular field-of-view. We have developed a robust fabrication process for UniScatter, and tested it on various mmWave sensing and communication devices. Our field tests show that UniScatter can backscatter signals across a wide frequency band from 24 GHz to 77 GHz with consistently high signal strength and wide angular coverage in 3D space.
