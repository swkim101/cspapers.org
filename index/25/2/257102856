Recent work has shown that representation learning plays a critical role in sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) from pixels. Unfortunately, in real-world scenarios, representation learning is usually fragile to task-irrelevant distractions such as variations in background or viewpoint. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel clustering-based approach, namely Clustering with Bisimulation Metrics (CBM), which learns robust representations by grouping visual observations in the latent space. Specifically, CBM alternates between two steps: (1) grouping observations by measuring their bisimulation distances to the learned prototypes; (2) learning a set of prototypes according to the current cluster assignments. Computing cluster assignments with bisimulation metrics enables CBM to capture task-relevant information, as bisimulation metrics quantify the behavioral similarity between observations. Moreover, CBM encourages the consistency of representations within each group, which facilitates filtering out task-irrelevant information and thus induces robust representations against distractions. An appealing feature is that CBM can achieve sample-efficient representation learning even if multiple distractions exist simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that CBM significantly improves the sample efficiency of popular visual RL algorithms and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both multiple and single distraction settings.
