—In smart homes, when an actuator’s state changes, it sends an event notiﬁcation to the IoT hub to report this change (e.g., the door is unlocked). Prior works have shown that event notiﬁcations are vulnerable to spooﬁng and masking attacks. In event spooﬁng, an adversary reports to the IoT hub a fake event notiﬁcation that did not physically occur. In event masking, an adversary suppresses the notiﬁcation of an event that physically occurred. These attacks create inconsistencies between physical and cyber states of actuators, enabling an adversary to indirectly gain control over safety-critical devices by triggering IoT apps. To mitigate these attacks, event veriﬁcation systems (EVS), or broadly IoT anomaly detection systems, leverage physical event ﬁngerprints that describe the relations between events and their inﬂuence on sensor readings. However, smart homes have complex physical interactions between events and sensors that characterize the event ﬁngerprints. Our study of the recent EVS, unfortunately, has revealed that they widely ignore such interactions, which enables an adversary to evade these systems and launch successful event spooﬁng and masking attacks without getting detected. In this paper, we ﬁrst explore the evadable physical event ﬁngerprints and show that an adversary can realize them to bypass the EVS given the same threat model. We develop two defenses, EVS software patching and sensor placement, with the interplay of physical modeling and formal analysis, to generate robust physical event ﬁngerprints and demonstrate how they can be integrated into the EVS. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in two smart home settings that contain 12 actuators and 16 sensors when two different state-of-the-art EVS are deployed. Our experiments demonstrate that 71% of their physical ﬁngerprints are vulnerable to evasion. By incorporating our approach, they build robust physical event ﬁngerprints, and thus, properly mitigate
