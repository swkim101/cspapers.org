This paper presents an application of human-drone interaction (HDI) for inventory management in a ware-house 4.0 that aims at improving the operators' safety and well-being together with increasing efficiency and reducing production costs. In our work, the speed and separation monitoring (SSM) methodology is applied for the first time to HDI, in analogy to the human-robot interaction (HRI) ISO safety requirements as well as the rapid upper limb assessment (RULA), for evaluating the operator's ergonomic posture during the interaction with the drone. With the aim of validating the proposed approach in a realistic scenario, a quadrotor is controlled to perform a pick and place task along a desired trajectory, from the picking bay to the palletizing area where the operator is located, avoiding collisions with the warehouse shelves by implementing the artificial potential field technique (APF) for planning and the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and iterative LQR (iLQR) algorithms for tracking. The obtained results of the HDI architecture simulations are presented and discussed in detail proving the effectiveness of the proposed method for a safe and ergonomic HDI.
