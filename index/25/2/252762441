Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used as a platform for social interaction, including as a means for elders to maintain engagement. However, not many empirical studies have been conducted to examine features of social VR that are most relevant to eldersâ€™ experiences. The current study qualitatively analyzed the behavior of older adults in a collaborative VR environment and evaluated aspects of design that affected their engagement outcomes. We paired 36 participants over the age of 60 from three diverse geographic locations to interact in collaborative VR modules. Video-based observation methods and thematic analyses were used to study their interactions. The results indicated a strong link between conversations about personal lives in VR and social engagement, highlighting the need for social VR to encourage users to create their own stories and share their life experiences. The study provides new insights into design guidelines that could improve social VR for older adults.
