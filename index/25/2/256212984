The paper describes a method developed by the authors that allows the stochastic distribution of output parameters to be determined from known probability distributions of uncertain initial data by means of a mathematical model of the engine. It was found that the number of calls to the mathematical model is such that the calculation taking 7â€“8 uncertain variables into account, even with simple mathematical models, takes a huge amount of time. For this reason, a method was developed to obtain reliable stochastic results with a reduced number of uncertain initial data taken into account, based on sensitivity analysis. The calculated stochastic results were compared with experimental data. It was shown that the difference between the stochastic results of the calculation and the experiment represents a scattering bell (bivariate distribution) and can be described by 4 numerical criteria
