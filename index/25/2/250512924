Automatic disassembly planning for complex industrial products like vehicles checks the expandability of components already at early stages of design. For a fast computation of collision-free disassembly paths, sampling-based rigid body motion planning is used in the literature. However, in real-world scenarios there are circumstances that prevent the finding of plausible collision-free disassembly paths with these conventional motion planners. The most difficult problem is that many components have deformable fastening elements that are modeled in a relaxed state and often as a part of the rigid object. The fastening elements cause unavoidable collisions of the component with its environment along the actual disassembly path. In this paper, we present Iterative Mesh Modification Planning (IMMP). Given the information about fastening elements in advance, our method applies a controlled iterative process of geometric deformations and planning attempts to the component to be disassembled. With this process, we are able to disassemble the component from its installed position with a conventional rigid body motion planner taking fastening elements and also overpressure into account. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on real-world planning scenarios from the automotive industry.
