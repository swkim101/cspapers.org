To counteract the ads and third-party tracking ubiquitous on the web, users turn to blocking tools—ad-blocking and tracking-protection browser extensions and built-in features. Unfortunately, blocking tools can cause non-ad, non-tracking elements of a website to degrade or fail, a phenomenon termed breakage . Examples include missing images, non-functional buttons, and pages failing to load. While the literature frequently discusses breakage, prior work has not systematically mapped and disambiguated the spectrum of user experiences subsumed under “breakage,” nor sought to understand how users experience, prioritize, and attempt to ﬁx breakage. We ﬁll these gaps. First, through qualitative analysis of 18,932 extension-store reviews and GitHub issue reports for ten popular blocking tools, we developed novel taxonomies of 38 speciﬁc types of breakage and 15 associated mitigation strategies. To understand subjective experiences of breakage, we then conducted a 95-participant survey. Nearly all participants had experienced various types of breakage, and they employed an array of strategies of variable effectiveness in response to speciﬁc types of breakage in speciﬁc contexts. Unfortunately, participants rarely notiﬁed anyone who could ﬁx the root causes. We discuss how our taxonomies and re-sults can improve the comprehensiveness and prioritization of ongoing attempts to automatically detect and ﬁx breakage.
