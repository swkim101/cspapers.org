Quantum dots (QDs) have different properties: high electron density, magnetic moment, phosphorescence, photoluminescence (fluorescence), and strong optical absorption. The layer or ligands on the QDs surface has a vital role because they allow the stabilization and practical uses on different matrixes. Ligand exchange is a commonly carried out methodology to incorporate functional groups that alter the solubility, introduce electron transfer partners, integrate biological receptors, or improve the properties of the QDs surface. CdSSe QDs were synthesized using a microwave system using thioglycolic acid (TGA) as a sulfur source and cover agent. The TGA ligand was interchanged with cysteine (Cys), glutamic acid (GA), glutathione (GTO), glutaraldehyde (GLT), and lysine (Lys). The viability and response of the CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4 isoenzymes were directly measured in HEP-G2 cells after exposure to CdSSe-TGA, CdSSe-Cys, CdSSe-GA, CdSSe-GTO, CdSSe-GLT, and CdSSe-Lys. CdSSe and CdSSe-GTO (10 mg/L) decrease viability by around 65%. The response of the cytochrome isoenzymes is based on the organic ligand on the surface of the CdSSe QDs. Changes in CYP 1A1 could be related to carcinogenic xenobiotics. Fluorescence microscopy shows CdSSe QDs on and inside HEPG2 cells. The results confirm that apoptosis and necrosis are the principal mechanisms of decreased viability.
