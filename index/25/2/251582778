Vulnerabilities inherited from third-party open-source software (OSS) components can compromise the entire software security. However, discovering propagated vulnerable code is challenging as it proliferates with various code syntaxes owing to the OSS modifications, more specifically, internal ( e . g ., OSS updates) and external modifications of OSS ( e . g ., code changes that occur during the OSS reuse). In this paper, we present M OVERY , a precise approach for discovering vulnerable code clones (VCCs) from modified OSS components. By considering the oldest vulnerable function and extracting only core vulnerable and patch lines from security patches, M OVERY generates vulnerability and patch signatures that effectively address OSS modifications. For scalability, M OVERY reduces the search space of the target software by focusing only on the codes borrowed from other OSS projects. Finally, M OVERY determines that the function is VCC when it matches the vulnerability signature and is distinctive from the patch signature. When
