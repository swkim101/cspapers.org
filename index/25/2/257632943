RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) has been widely adopted for decades, as it provides enhanced throughput and redundancy beyond what a single disk can offer. Today, enabled by fast datacenter networks, accessing remote block devices with acceptable overhead (i.e. disaggregated storage) becomes a reality (e.g., for serverless applications). Combining RAID with remote storage can provide the same benefits while creating better fault tolerance and flexibility than its monolithic counterparts. The key challenge of disaggregated RAID is to handle extra network traffic generated by RAID, which can consume a vast amount of NIC bandwidth. We present dRAID, a disaggregated RAID system that achieves near-optimal read and write throughput. dRAID exploits peer-to-peer disaggregated data access to reduce bandwidth consumption in both normal and degraded states. It employs non-blocking multi-stage writes to maximize inter-node parallelism, and applies pipelined I/O processing to maximize inter-device parallelism. We introduce bandwidth-aware reconstruction for better load balancing. We show that dRAID provides up to 3× bandwidth improvement. The results on a lightweight object store show that dRAID brings 1.5×-2.35× throughput improvement on various workloads.
