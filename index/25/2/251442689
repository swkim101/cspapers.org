Despite the advantages of their low-resource settings, traditional sparse retrievers depend on exact matching approaches between high-dimensional bag-of-words (BoW) representations of both the queries and the collection. As a result, retrieval performance is restricted by semantic discrepancies and vocabulary gaps. On the other hand, transformer-based dense retrievers introduce significant improvements in information retrieval tasks by exploiting low-dimensional contextualized representations of the corpus. While dense retrievers are known for their relative effectiveness, they suffer from lower efficiency and lack of generalization issues, when compared to sparse retrievers. For a lightweight retrieval task, high computational resources and time consumption are major barriers encouraging the renunciation of dense models despite potential gains. In this work, we propose boosting the performance of sparse retrievers by expanding both the queries and the documents with linked entities in two formats for the entity names: 1) explicit and 2) hashed. We employ a zero-shot end-to-end dense entity linking system for entity recognition and disambiguation to augment the corpus. By leveraging the advanced entity linking methods, we believe that the effectiveness gap between sparse and dense retrievers can be narrowed. We conduct our experiments on the MS MARCO passage dataset. Since we are concerned with the early stage retrieval in cascaded ranking architectures of large information retrieval systems, we evaluate our results using recall@1000. Our approach is also capable of retrieving documents for query subsets judged to be particularly difficult in prior work. We further demonstrate that the non-expanded and the expanded runs with both explicit and hashed entities retrieve complementary results. Consequently, we adopt a run fusion approach to maximize the benefits of entity linking.
