Multivariate time series classiﬁcation (MTSC), one of the most fundamental time series applications, has not only gained substantial research attentions but has also emerged in many real-life applications. Recently, using transformers to solve MTSC has been reported. However, current transformer-based methods take data points of individual timestamps as inputs (timestamp-level), which only capture the temporal dependencies, not the dependencies among variables. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, called SVP-T. Specifically, we ﬁrst propose to take time series subsequences, which can be from different variables and positions (time interval), as the inputs (shape-level). The temporal and variable dependencies are both handled by capturing the long- and short-term dependencies among shapes. Second, we propose a variable-position encoding layer (VP-layer) to utilize both the variable and position information of each shape. Third, we introduce a novel VP-based (Variable-Position) self-attention mechanism to allow the enhancing the attention weights of overlapping shapes. We evaluate our method on all UEA MTS datasets. SVP-T achieves the best accuracy rank when compared with several competitive state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the VP-layer and the VP-based self-attention mechanism. Finally, we present one case study to interpret the result of SVP-T.
