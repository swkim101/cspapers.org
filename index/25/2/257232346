Accurate and reliable sensor calibration is critical for fusing LiDAR and inertial measurements in autonomous driving. This paper proposes a novel three-stage extrinsic calibration method between LiDAR and GNSS/INS for autonomous driving. The first stage can quickly calibrate the extrinsic parameters between the sensors through point cloud surface features so that the extrinsic can be narrowed from a large initial error to a small error range in little time. The second stage can further calibrate the extrinsic parameters based on LiDAR-mapping space occupancy while removing motion distortion. In the final stage, the z-axis (the vertical direction relative to the ground plane) errors caused by the plane motion of the autonomous vehicle are corrected, and an accurate extrinsic parameter is finally obtained. Specifically, This method utilizes the planar features in the environment, making it possible to quickly carry out calibration. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of our method. The codes are open-sourced on the Github website.
