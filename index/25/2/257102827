Name disambiguation---a fundamental problem in online academic systems--is now facing greater challenges with the increasing growth of research papers. For example, on AMiner, an online academic search platform, about 10% of names own more than 100 authors. Such real-world challenging cases have not been effectively addressed by existing researches due to the small-scale or low-quality datasets that they have used. The development of effective algorithms is further hampered by a variety of tasks and evaluation protocols designed on top of diverse datasets. To this end, we present Who Is Who owning, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000,000 papers built using an interactive annotation process, a regular leaderboard with comprehensive tasks, and an easy-to-use toolkit encapsulating the entire pipeline as well as the most powerful features and baseline models for tackling the tasks. Our developed strong baseline has already been deployed online in the AMiner system to enable daily arXiv paper assignments.
