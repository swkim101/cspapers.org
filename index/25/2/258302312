Adult video-sharing has undergone dramatic shifts. New platforms that directly interconnect (often amateur) producers and consumers now allow content creators to promote material across the web and directly monetize the content they produce. OnlyFans is the most prominent example of this new trend. OnlyFans is a content subscription service where creators earn money from users who subscribe to their material. In contrast to prior adult platforms, OnlyFans emphasizes creator-consumer interaction for audience accumulation and maintenance. This results in a wide cross-platform ecosystem geared towards bringing consumers to creatorsâ€™ accounts. In this paper, we inspect this emerging ecosystem, focusing on content creators and the third-party platforms they connect to.
