Universities are having difficulties responding to the upsurge of new students wanting to pursue computer science degrees. Students who attend large computing classes, especially first year students, may find themselves unable to connect with peers and may feel intimidated to reach out to their instructors, which may lead them to feel unwelcome, isolated, and unsupported. This is a problem since computer science remains to be a fast-growing industry with a large demand for new talent in technology. We propose a conceptual framework, rooted in literature in computer science, educational psychology, and human computer interaction, for leveraging emotional learning process (ELP) data and programming behavior data to foster a positive learning environment. The framework posits that promoting empathy through awareness of emotional states and programming behavior will encourage students to help peers and seek help from peers. To scaffold help-seeking and help-giving, software interventions create awareness of peer emotional states, prompting students to express empathy, express gratitude, and ultimately to perform help-seeking and help-giving actions.
