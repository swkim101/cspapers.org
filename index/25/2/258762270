We present XFormer, a novel human mesh and motion capture method that achieves real-time performance on consumer CPUs given only monocular images as input. The proposed network architecture contains two branches: a keypoint branch that estimates 3D human mesh vertices given 2D keypoints, and an image branch that makes prediction directly from the RGB image features. At the core of our method is a cross-modal transformer block that allows information flow across these two branches by modeling the attention between 2D keypoint coordinates and image spatial features. Our architecture is smartly designed, which enables us to train on various types of datasets including images with 2D/3D annotations, images with 3D pseudo labels, and motion capture datasets that do not have associated images. This effectively improves the accuracy and generalization ability of our system. Built on a lightweight backbone (MobileNetV3), our method runs blazing fast (over 30fps on a single CPU core) and still yields competitive accuracy. Furthermore, with a HRNet backbone, XFormer delivers state-of-the-art performance on Huamn3.6 and 3DPW datasets.
