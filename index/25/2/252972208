Route hijacking is one of the most severe security problems in today’s Internet, and route origin hijacking is the most common. While origin hijacking detection systems are already available, they suffer from tremendous pressures brought by frequent legitimate Multiple origin ASes (MOAS) conﬂicts. They detect MOAS conﬂicts on the control plane and then identify origin hijackings by data-plane probing or even manual veriﬁcation. However, legitimate changes in preﬁx ownership can also cause MOAS conﬂicts, which are the majority of MOAS conﬂicts daily. Massive legitimate MOAS conﬂicts consume many resources for probing and identiﬁcation, resulting in high veriﬁcation costs and high veriﬁcation latency in practice. In this paper, we propose a new origin hijacking system Themis to accelerate the detection of origin hijacking. Based on the ground truth dataset we built, we analyze the characteristics of different MOAS conﬂicts and train a clas-siﬁer to ﬁlter out legitimate MOAS conﬂicts on the control plane. The accuracy and recall of the MOAS classiﬁer are 95.49% and 99.20%, respectively. Using the MOAS classi-ﬁer, Themis reduces 56.69% of veriﬁcation costs than Argus, the state-of-the-art, and signiﬁcantly accelerates the detection when many concurrent MOAS conﬂicts occur. The overall accuracy of Themis is almost the same as Argus.
