The conflicts between input privacy and efficiency in single-server non-interactive verifiable computation (NIVC) makes it interesting to consider the multi-server models of NIVC. Although the existing multi-server NIVC schemes provide meaningful improvements, they either require the servers to communicate or leave the clientâ€™s data unprotected. It has been an open problem to design multi-server NIVC with both input privacy and non-communicating servers. In this paper we define a multi-server verifiable computation (MSVC) model where the client secret-shares its input x among non-communicating servers, each server locally computes a function F to get a partial result, and finally the client reconstructs F(x) from all partial results. We construct five MSVC schemes for outsourcing low-degree polynomials and thus answer the open question for such polynomials. Our schemes are t-private such that any t servers learn no information about x. Our schemes are t-secure such that any t servers cannot persuade the client to output wrong results. The privacy and security can be either information-theoretic or computational. Comparing with the existing schemes, our servers can be at least two orders faster.
