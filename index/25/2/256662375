Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) semantic maps have become an essential component of automated driving pipelines due to the rich representation they provide for decision-making tasks. However, existing approaches for generating these maps still follow a fully supervised training paradigm and hence rely on large amounts of annotated BEV data. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing the first self-supervised approach for generating a BEV semantic map using a single monocular image from the frontal view (FV). During training, we overcome the need for BEV ground truth annotations by leveraging the more easily available FV semantic annotations of video sequences. Thus, we propose the SkyEye architecture that learns based on two modes of self-supervision, namely, implicit supervision and explicit supervision. Implicit supervision trains the model by enforcing spatial consistency of the scene over time based on FV semantic sequences, while explicit supervision exploits BEV pseudolabels generated from FV semantic annotations and self-supervised depth estimates. Extensive evaluations on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate that our self-supervised approach performs on par with the state-of-the-art fully supervised methods and achieves competitive results using only 1 % of direct supervision in BEV compared to fully supervised approaches. Finally, we publicly release both our code and the BEV datasets generated from the KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets.
