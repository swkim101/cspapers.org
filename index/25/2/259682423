Detecting objects as multiple keypoints is an important approach in the anchor-free object detection methods while corner pooling is an effective feature encoding method for corner positioning. The corners of the bounding box are located by summing the feature maps which are max-pooled in the x and y directions respectively by corner pooling. In the unidirectional max pooling operation, the features of the densely arranged objects of the same class are prone to occlusion. To this end, we propose a method named Gradient Corner Pooling. The spatial distance information of objects on the feature map is encoded during the unidirectional pooling process, which effectively alleviates the occlusion of the homogeneous object features. Further, the computational complexity of gradient corner pooling is the same as traditional corner pooling and hence it can be implemented efficiently. Gradient corner pooling obtains consistent improvements for various keypoint-based methods by directly replacing corner pooling. We verify the gradient corner pooling algorithm on the dataset and in real scenarios, respectively. The networks with gradient corner pooling located the corner points earlier in the training process and achieve an average accuracy improvement of 0.2%-1.6% on the MS-COCO dataset. The detectors with gradient corner pooling show better angle adaptability for arrayed objects in the actual scene test.
