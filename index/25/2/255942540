Keyphrase identification and classification is a Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval task that involves extracting relevant groups of words from a given text related to the main topic. In this work, we focus on extracting keyphrases from scientific documents. We introduce TA-DA, a Topic-Aware Domain Adaptation framework for keyphrase extraction that integrates Multi-Task Learning with Adversarial Training and Domain Adaptation. Our approach improves performance over baseline models by up to 5% in the exact match of the F1-score.
