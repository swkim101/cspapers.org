A pressing challenge in the design of actuated knee prostheses is the ability to address the high variation of speed and torque requirements for the different types and phases of locomotion. This manuscript presents a novel over-actuated knee prosthesis which makes use of a dual motor actuation architecture to address this issue. It utilizes a high speed/low torque motor to enable natural and highly dynamical motion, as required for swing phases of walking, which is permanently engaged. In addition to this motor, a clutchable uni-directional low dynamics high torque motor is present to assist during the execution of tasks which demand active torque. Preliminary experimental validations have been performed on a healthy subject provided with an able-bodied adapter to demonstrate natural walk patterns and power-assisted sit-to-stand activities.
