Weakly-supervised temporal action localization aims to localize actions in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels. Most existing methods address this problem with a “localization-by-classification” pipeline that localizes action regions based on snippet-wise classification sequences. Snippet-wise classifications are unfortunately error prone due to the sparsity of video-level labels. Inspired by recent success in unsupervised contrastive representation learning, we propose a novel denoised cross-video contrastive algorithm, aiming to enhance the feature discrimination ability of video snippets for accurate temporal action localization in the weakly-supervised setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) an effective pseudo-label denoising module to alleviate the side effects caused by noisy contrastive features, 2) an efficient region-level feature contrast strategy with a region-level memory bank to capture “global” contrast across the entire dataset, and 3) a diverse contrastive learning strategy to enable action-background separation as well as intra-class compactness & inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.
