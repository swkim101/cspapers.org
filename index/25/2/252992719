Readability assessment is a basic research task in the field of education. Traditional methods mainly employ machine learning classifiers with hundreds of linguistic features. Although the deep learning model has become the prominent approach for almost all NLP tasks, it is less explored for readability assessment. In this paper, we propose a BERT-based model with feature projection and length-balanced loss (BERT-FP-LBL) to determine the difficulty level of a given text. First, we introduce topic features guided by difficulty knowledge to complement the traditional linguistic features. From the linguistic features, we extract really useful orthogonal features to supplement BERT representations by means of projection filtering. Furthermore, we design a length-balanced loss to handle the greatly varying length distribution of the readability data. We conduct experiments on three English benchmark datasets and one Chinese dataset, and the experimental results show that our proposed model achieves significant improvements over baseline models. Interestingly, our proposed model achieves comparable results with human experts in consistency test.
