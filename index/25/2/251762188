During design, control, identification and diagnosis of nonlinear systems, the decomposition of the system into sub-models is quite fundamental. This paper focuses on the state filtering of a nonlinear system represented by the classical multi-model based approach.Unlike the multi-model in a decoupled state, this model typically presents state-identical sub-models. By a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMI), we can guarantee the convergence of the error estimation.
