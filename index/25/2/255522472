Accurate localization of a large number of objects over a wide area is one of the keys to the pervasive interaction with the Internet of Things. This paper presents Hawkeye, a new mmWave backscatter that, for the first time, offers over (i) hundred-scale simultaneous 3D localization at (ii) subcentimeter accuracy for over an (iii) hectometer distance. Hawkeye generally applies to indoors and outdoors as well as under mobility. Hawkeye tag's Van Atta array design with retro-reflectivity in both elevation and azimuth planes offers 3D localization and effectively suppresses the multipath. Hawkeye localization algorithm is a lightweight signal processing compatible with the commodity FMCW radar. It uniquely leverages the interplay between the tag signal and clutter, and leverages the spectral leakage for fine-grained positioning. Prototype evaluations in corridor, lecture room, and soccer field reveal 7 mm median accuracy at 160 m range, and simultaneously localize 100 tags in only 33.2 ms. Hawkeye is reliable under temperature change with significant oscillator frequency offset. Demo video: https://tinyurl.com/4zkwxatu
