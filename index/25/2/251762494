Certain applications of wireless sensor networks require that the sensor nodes should be aware of their position relative to the sensor environment. Generally in the applications of positioning in the internet of things (IoT), there is a deficiency of localization precision and concrete results. It is really important to maintain high-efficient localization schemes for the Internet of things, especially for wireless sensor networks. For that, an improved DV-hop algorithm is proposed in this paper to move for more accurate results based on the least square method. Therefore, the weight coefficient is calculated between an anchor node and the other anchor nodes using the mean square method. Then, this weighting coefficient, the hop size, will be applied between the unknown nodes and the anchor nodes in order to determine the distances. The computed hop-size average significantly enhances the positioning accuracy which is approved by the experiments that explain how suitable this improved Last-Square DV-hop Algorithm is for localization in WSN.
