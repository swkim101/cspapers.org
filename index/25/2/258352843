Constant-rate multi-mode systems (MMS) are hybrid systems with finitely many modes and real-valued variables that evolve over continuous time according to mode-specific constant rates. We introduce a variant of linear temporal logic (LTL) for MMS, and we investigate the complexity of the model-checking problem for syntactic fragments of LTL. We obtain a complexity landscape where each fragment is either P-complete, NP-complete or undecidable. These results generalize and unify several results on MMS and continuous counter systems.
