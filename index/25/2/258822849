Designing robust algorithms in the face of estimation uncertainty is a challenging task. Indeed, controllers seldom consider estimation uncertainty and only rely on the most likely estimated state. Consequently, sudden changes in the environment or the robotâ€™s dynamics can lead to catastrophic behaviors. Leveraging recent results in risk-sensitive optimal control, this paper presents a risk-sensitive Extended Kalman Filter that can adapt its estimation to the control objective, hence allowing safe output-feedback Model Predictive Control (MPC). By taking a pessimistic estimate of the value function resulting from the MPC controller, the filter provides increased robustness to the controller in phases of uncertainty as compared to a standard Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The filter has the same computational complexity as an EKF and can be used for real-time control. The paper evaluates the risk-sensitive behavior of the proposed filter when used in a nonlinear MPC loop on a planar drone and industrial manipulator in simulation, as well as on an external force estimation task on a real quadruped robot. These experiments demonstrate the ability of the approach to significantly improve performance in face of uncertainties.
