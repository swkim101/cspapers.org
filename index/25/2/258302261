The user experience of mobile web video streaming is often impacted by insufficient and dynamic network bandwidth. In this paper, we design Bidirectionally Optimized Super-Resolution (BiSR) to improve the quality of experience (QoE) for mobile web users under limited bandwidth. BiSR exploits a deep neural network (DNN)-based model to super-resolve key frames efficiently without changing the inter-frame spatial-temporal information. We then propose a downscaling DNN and a mobile-specific optimized lightweight super-resolution DNN to enhance the performance. Finally, a novel reinforcement learning-based adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithm is proposed to verify the performance of BiSR on real network traces. Our evaluation, using a full system implementation, shows that BiSR saves 26% of bitrate compared to the traditional H.264 codec and improves the SSIM of video by 3.7% compared to the prior state-of-the-art. Overall, BiSR enhances the user-perceived quality of experience by up to 30.6%.
