In the era of big data, fragmented knowledge, multisource heterogeneity, and different representation forms of the same entities in various data sources have posed considerable challenges to entity fusion. How to effectively integrate multisource knowledge for the same entities has provoked vast amounts of attention and research from multiple disciplines. Most existing methods for entity fusion can be categorized into two classes: one is to establish an association between the same entities, and the other is to delete duplicate entities after knowledge fusion and create a new fusion entity. However, in these two classes of methods, the former does not achieve true knowledge fusion and semantic interoperability, while the latter may cause irreversible loss of original information. In this paper, we propose a novel entity fusion scheme: Hypernode. Hypernode fuses the same entity in different data sources into a new entity while retaining the original data. We verify the effectiveness of Hypernode on multiple models of link prediction experiments. Several practical application cases illustrate the applicability of Hypernode in data traceability, open domain knowledge fusion, and multi-modal knowledge graph fusion.
