The advent of large language models (LLMs) has brought about a revolution in the development of tailored machine learning models and sparked debates on redefining data requirements. The automation facilitated by the training and implementation of LLMs has led to discussions and aspirations that human-level labeling interventions may no longer hold the same level of importance as in the era of supervised learning.

This paper presents compelling arguments supporting the ongoing relevance of human-labeled data in the era of LLMs.
