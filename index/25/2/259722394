Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) attracts extensive research interest due to its great significance in reducing the data annotation effort. Collecting high-quality and category-balanced pseudo labels for unlabeled images is critical to addressing the SSOD problem. However, most of the existing pseudo-labeling-based methods depend on a large and fixed threshold to select high-quality pseudo labels from the predictions of a teacher model. Considering different object classes usually have different detection difficulty levels due to scale variance and data distribution imbalance, conventional pseudo-labeling-based methods are arduous to explore the value of unlabeled data sufficiently. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive pseudo labeling strategy, which can assign thresholds to classes with respect to their “hardness”. This is beneficial for ensuring the high quality of easier classes and increasing the quantity of harder classes simultaneously. Besides, label refinement modules are set up based on box jittering for guaranteeing the localization quality of pseudo labels. To further improve the algorithm’s robustness against scale variance and make the most of pseudo labels, we devise a joint feature-level and prediction-level consistency learning pipeline for transferring the information of the teacher model to the student model. Extensive experiments on COCO and VOC datasets indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Especially, it brings mean average precision gains of 2.08 and 1.28 on MS-COCO dataset with 5% and 10% labeled images, respectively.
