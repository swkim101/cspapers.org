In this work, we design an Artificially Intelligent Task Allocator (AITA) that proposes a task allocation for a team of humans. A key property of this allocation is that when an agent with imperfect knowledge (about their teammate's costs and/or the team's performance metric) contests the allocation with a counterfactual, a contrastive explanation can always be provided to showcase why the proposed allocation is better than the proposed counterfactual. For this, we consider a negotiation process that produces a negotiation-aware task allocation and, when contested, leverages a negotiation tree to provide a contrastive explanation. With human subject studies, we show that the proposed allocation indeed appears fair to a majority of participants and, when not, the explanations generated are judged as convincing and easy to comprehend.
