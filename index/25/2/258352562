Robotic perception requires the modeling of both 3D geometry and semantics. Existing methods typically focus on estimating 3D bounding boxes, neglecting finer geometric details and struggling to handle general, out-of-vocabulary objects. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates the detailed occupancy states and semantics of a scene, is an emerging task to overcome these limitations. To support 3D occupancy prediction, we develop a label generation pipeline that produces dense, visibility-aware labels for any given scene. This pipeline comprises three stages: voxel densification, occlusion reasoning, and image-guided voxel refinement. We establish two benchmarks, derived from the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, namely Occ3D-Waymo and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide an extensive analysis of the proposed dataset with various baseline models. Lastly, we propose a new model, dubbed Coarse-to-Fine Occupancy (CTF-Occ) network, which demonstrates superior performance on the Occ3D benchmarks. The code, data, and benchmarks are released at https://tsinghua-mars-lab.github.io/Occ3D/.
