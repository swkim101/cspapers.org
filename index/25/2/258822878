A key promise of voting is that, by accounting for all constituents' preferences, it produces decisions that benefit society overall. It is alarming, then, that all deterministic voting rules have unbounded distortion (i.e., arbitrarily suboptimal social welfare). Existing work usually circumvents this stark impossibility by assuming restrictions on voters' possible latent utilities [Anshelevich et al. 2021]; however, it is not clear whether such assumptions reliably hold in practice, because voters' utilities are, to a large degree, inherent.
