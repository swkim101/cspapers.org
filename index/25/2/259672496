First-order logic (FO) is an important foundation of many domains, including computer science and artificial intelligence. In recent efforts to teach basic CS and AI concepts to children, FO has so far remained absent. In this paper, we examine whether it is possible to design a learning environment that both motivates and enables children to learn the basics of FO. The key components of the learning environment are a syntax-free blocks-based notation for FO, graphics-based puzzles to solve, and a tactile environment which uses computer vision to allow the children to work with wooden blocks. The resulting FOLL-E system is intended to sharpen childrens' reasoning skills, encourage critical thinking and make them aware of the ambiguities of natural language. During preliminary testing with children, they reported that they found the notation intuitive and inviting, and that they enjoyed interacting with the application.
