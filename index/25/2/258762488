Experimentation is the foundation of scientific decision-making on online marketplaces and social networks. However, experiments often suffer from interference where intervening on a participant impacts the outcome of other participants. Under general interference, the causal effect cannot be identified even in a randomized experiment. Interference is especially problematic in marketplaces, where strategic agents compete for scarce resources. For example, consider an experiment comparing two different policies for selecting the reserve price in a second-price advertising auction. Changes in the reserve price ("treatment / intervention") for some advertisers (bidders) can affect other advertisers through market competition, impacting the outcomes of even untreated advertisers.
