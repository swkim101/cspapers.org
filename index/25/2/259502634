Multipath transport allows the simultaneous use of diverse paths on mobile devices to maximize mobile resource usage. Over the years, we have witnessed several mobile multipath deployment examples by network operators and mobile app providers. However, existing deployment methods require modifications to either the network infrastructure or both endpoints. To lower the bar of the deployment, we present Fleety, a mobile system service that provides the multi-path transport capability with client-only modification. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to carry out a large-scale mobile multipath deployment that can support hundreds of mobile applications in the cross-ISP setting. This paper is a retrospective of our experience in building and deploying multipath transport for mobile applications. We reveal several practical deployment challenges and share our experience in dealing with them.
