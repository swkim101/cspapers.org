Dynamic Programming (DP) is one of the most difficult algorithm techniques for undergraduate computer science students to master. RecursionVisualizer is an open-source Python package that seeks to improve how students learn DP. With one line of code, RecursionVisualizer enables users to create beautiful, interactive animations of any DP problem. This addresses specific misunderstandings students have about DP and makes it easier for both educators to teach DP and for students to learn about DP. This paper describes the features of RecursionVisualizer, its educational benefits and various uses.
