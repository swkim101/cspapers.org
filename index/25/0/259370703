We propose a novel challenge for large language models: ellipsis-dependent reasoning. We define several structures of paired examples, where an ellipsis example is matched to its non-ellipsis counterpart, and a question is posed which requires resolution of the ellipsis. Test results show that the best models perform well on non-elliptical examples but struggle with all but the simplest ellipsis structures.
