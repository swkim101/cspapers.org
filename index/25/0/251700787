In this paper, we consider the stability analysis of an anaerobic digestion dynamical model where the gaseous flow and the alkalinity are incorporated. A detailed estimation of the carbon dioxide gas outflow is carried out and the positivity of the solution is demonstrated. We show that the process environment may lead to the coexistence of a stable and an unstable steady-state. The stability analysis and the stabilization of the process are illustrated by a simulation study including the phase portraits related to methanogenic bacteria.
