In the field of 3D perception using 3D LiDAR sensors, ground segmentation is an essential task for various purposes, such as traversable area detection and object recognition. Under these circumstances, several ground segmentation methods have been proposed. However, some limitations are still encountered. First, some ground segmentation methods require fine-tuning of parameters depending on the surroundings, which is excessively laborious and time-consuming. Moreover, even if the parameters are well adjusted, a partial under-segmentation problem can still emerge, which implies ground segmentation failures in some regions. Finally, ground segmentation methods typically fail to estimate an appropriate ground plane when the ground is above another structure, such as a retaining wall. To address these problems, we propose a robust ground segmentation method called Patchwork++, an extension of Patchwork. Patchwork++ exploits adaptive ground likelihood estimation (A-GLE) to calculate appropriate parameters adaptively based on the previous ground segmentation results. Moreover, temporal ground revert (TGR) alleviates a partial under-segmentation problem by using the temporary ground property. Also, region-wise vertical plane fitting (R-VPF) is introduced to segment the ground plane properly even if the ground is elevated with different layers. Finally, we present reflected noise removal (RNR) to eliminate virtual noise points efficiently based on the 3D LiDAR reflection model. We demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative evaluations using a SemanticKITTI dataset. Our code is available at https://aithub.com/url-kaist/patchwork-plusplus
