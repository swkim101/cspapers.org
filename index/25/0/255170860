A large-scale dump truck that automatically transports earth and sand in cooperation with a human-operated backhoe is of interest to the construction industry. A human-operated dump truck generally drives slightly past the desired loading position and then backs up to it for loading the sediment. The turning and loading positions are subjectively decided according to the working posture of the backhoe and the surrounding environment, and the safety margin of cooperative works. Backhoe operators want to perform the same maneuvers for human-operated/automated dump trucks. The movements of the autonomous vehicle should be similar to those of a human-operated one. However, it is difficult to derive a human-like path that does more than minimize costs. This study proposes a path-planning method that generates a path including a turning back, according to the changing backhoe position and surrounding conditions. We modeled the positional relationship during loading between a backhoe and dump truck, determining the loading and turning positions and related parameters from operational data collected in trials with human-operated construction vehicles. The proposed method allowed the autonomous dump truck path to resemble a human-like one. The authors have retrofitted an existing large-scale six-wheeled dump truck for automatic operation. Automatic loading in cooperation with a human-operated backhoe was realized all 17 times using the retrofitted dump. The average stopping accuracy was 0.57 m and 9.7Â°.
