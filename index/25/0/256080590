There is a growing movement in undergraduate computer science (CS) programs to embed ethics across CS classes rather than relying solely on standalone ethics courses. One strategy is creating assignments that encourage students to reflect on ethical issues inherent to the code they write. Building off prior work that has surveyed students after doing such assignments in class, we conducted focus groups with students who reviewed a new introductory ethics-based CS assignment. In this experience report, we present a case study describing our process of designing an ethics-based assignment and proposing the assignment to students for feedback. Participants in our focus groups not only shared feedback on the assignment, but also on the integration of ethics into coding assignments in general, revealing the benefits and challenges of this work from a student perspective. We also generated novel ethics-oriented assignment concepts alongside students. Deriving from tech controversies that participants felt most affected by, we created a bank of ideas as a starting point for further curriculum development.
