Arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (SR) is often tackled using the implicit neural representation (INR) approach, which relies on a position encoding scheme to im-prove its representation ability. In this paper, we introduce orthogonal position encoding (OPE), an extension of po-sition encoding, and an OPE-Upscale module to replace the INR-based upsampling module for arbitrary-scale im-age super-resolution. Our OPE-Upscale module takes 2D coordinates and latent code as inputs, just like INR, but does not require any training parameters. This parameter-free feature allows the OPE-Upscale module to directly perform linear combination operations, resulting in con-tinuous image reconstruction and achieving arbitrary-scale image reconstruction. As a concise SR framework, our method is computationally efficient and consumes less mem-ory than state-of-the-art methods, as confirmed by exten-sive experiments and evaluations. In addition, our method achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art methods in arbitrary-scale image super-resolution. Lastly, we show that OPE corresponds to a set of orthogonal basis, validating our design principle.11Project page: https://github.com/gaochao-s/ope-sr
