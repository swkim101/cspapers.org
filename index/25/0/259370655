We introduce a method that self trains (or bootstraps) neural relation and explanation classifiers. Our work expands the supervised approach of CITATION, which jointly trains a relation classifier with an explanation classifier that identifies context words important for the relation at hand, to semi-supervised scenarios. In particular, our approach iteratively converts the explainable modelsâ€™ outputs to rules and applies them to unlabeled text to produce new annotations.Our evaluation on the TACRED dataset shows that our method outperforms the rule-based model we started from by 15 F1 points, outperforms traditional self-training that relies just on the relation classifier by 5 F1 points, and performs comparatively with the prompt-based approach of CITATION (without requiring an additional natural language inference component).
