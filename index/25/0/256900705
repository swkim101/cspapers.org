Nondeterministic choice is a useful program construct that provides a way to describe the behaviour of a program without specifying the details of possible implementations. It supports the stepwise refinement of programs, a method that has proven useful in software development. Nondeterminism has also been introduced in quantum programming, and termination of nondeterministic quantum programs has been extensively analysed. In this paper, we go beyond termination analysis to investigate the verification of nondeterministic quantum programs where properties are given by sets of hermitian operators on the associated Hilbert space. Hoare-type logic systems for partial and total correctness are proposed which turn out to be both sound and relatively complete with respect to their corresponding semantic correctness. To show the utility of these proof systems, we analyse some quantum algorithms such as quantum error correction scheme, Deutsch algorithm, and a nondeterministic quantum walk. Finally, a proof assistant prototype is implemented to aid in the automated reasoning of nondeterministic quantum programs.
