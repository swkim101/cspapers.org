Pre-travel out-of-town recommendation aims to recommend Point-of-Interests (POIs) to the users who plan to travel out of their hometown in the near future yet have not decided where to go, i.e., their destination regions and POIs both remain unknown. It is a non-trivial task since the searching space is vast, which may lead to distinct travel experiences in different out-of-town regions and eventually confuse decision-making. Besides, users' out-of-town travel behaviors are affected not only by their personalized preferences but heavily by others' travel behaviors. To this end, we propose a Crowd-Aware Pre-Travel Out-of-town Recommendation framework (CAPTOR) consisting of two major modules: spatial-affined conditional random field (SA-CRF) and crowd behavior memory network (CBMN). Specifically, SA-CRF captures the spatial affinity among POIs while preserving the inherent information of POIs. Then, CBMN is proposed to maintain the crowd travel behaviors w.r.t. each region through three affiliated blocks reading and writing the memory adaptively. We devise the elaborated metric space with a dynamic mapping mechanism, where the users and POIs are distinguishable both inherently and geographically. Extensive experiments on two real-world nationwide datasets validate the effectiveness of CAPTOR against the pre-travel out-of-town recommendation task.
