Product bundling is a commonly-used marketing strategy in both offline retailers and online e-commerce systems. Current research on bundle recommendation is limited by: (1) noisy datasets, where bundles are defined by heuristics, e.g., products co-purchased in the same session; and (2) specific tasks, holding unrealistic assumptions, e.g., the availability of bundles for recommendation directly. In this paper, we propose to take a step back and consider the process of bundle recommendation from a holistic user experience perspective. We first construct high-quality bundle datasets with rich meta information, particularly bundle intents, through a carefully designed crowd-sourcing task. We then define a series of tasks that together, support all key steps in a typical bundle recommendation process, from bundle detection, completion, ranking, to explanation and auto-naming. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and in-depth analysis that demonstrate the challenges of bundle recommendation, arising from the need for capturing complex relations among users, products, and bundles, as well as the research opportunities, especially in graph-based neural methods. To sum up, our study delivers new data sources, opens up new research directions, and provides useful guidance for product bundling in real e-commerce platforms.
