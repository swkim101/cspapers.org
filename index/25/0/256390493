The insufficient number of annotated thermal infrared (TIR) image datasets not only hinders TIR image-based deep learning networks to have comparable performances to that of RGB but it also limits the supervised learning of TIR image-based tasks with challenging labels. As a remedy, we propose a modified multidomain RGB to TIR image translation model focused on edge preservation to employ annotated RGB images with challenging labels. Our proposed method not only preserves key details in the original image but also leverages the optimal TIR style code to portray accurate TIR characteristics in the translated image, when applied on both synthetic and real world RGB images. Using our translation model, we have enabled the supervised learning of deep TIR image-based optical flow estimation and object detection that ameliorated in deep TIR optical flow estimation by reduction in end point error by 56.5% on average and the best object detection mAP of 23.9% respectively.
