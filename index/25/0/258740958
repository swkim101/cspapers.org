Mimicking realistic dynamics in 3D garment animations is a challenging task due to the complex nature of multi-layered garments and the variety of outer forces involved. Existing approaches mostly focus on single-layered garments driven by only human bodies and struggle to handle general scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven method, called LayersNet, to model garment-level animations as particle-wise interactions in a micro physics system. We improve simulation efficiency by representing garments as patch-level particles in a two-level structural hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a novel Rotation Equivalent Transformation with Rotation Invariant Attention that leverage the rotation invariance and additivity of physics systems to better model outer forces. To verify the effectiveness of our approach and bridge the gap between experimental environments and real-world scenarios, we introduce a new challenging dataset, D-LAYERS, containing 700K frames of dynamics of 4,900 combinations of multi-layered garments driven by human bodies and randomly sampled wind. Our LayersNet achieves superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. Project page: www.mmlab-ntu.com/project/layersnet/index.html.
