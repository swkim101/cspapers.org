Recent research has shown that developers hesitate to update dependencies and mistrust automated approaches such as Dependabot, since they are afraid of introducing incompatibilities that break their project. In fact, such approaches only suggest naïve updates for a single outdated library but do not ensure compatibility with other dependent libraries in the project. To alleviate this situation and support developers in finding updates with minimal incompatibilities, we present UPCY. UPCY applies the min-(s,t)-cut algorithm and leverages a graph database of Maven Central to identify a list of valid update steps to update a dependency to a target version while minimizing incompatibilities with other libraries. By executing 29,698 updates in 380 projects, we compare the effectiveness of UPCY with the naïve updates applied by state-of-the-art tools. We find that in 41.1% of the cases where the naïve approach fails UPCY generates updates with fewer incompatibilities, and even 70.1% of the generated updates have zero incompatibilities.
