1 Abstract — The construction trade requires repetitive, physically demanding manual tasks which can over time pose severe risks for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) [1]. Exoskeletons and exosuits (collectively called “EXOs” in this work) have substantial potential to protect workers and to increase worker productivity by reducing exertion and fatigue. Despite these potential benefits, EXOs are uncommon in the construction industry. We present preliminary results from a pilot study investigating the knowledge gaps and barriers to EXO adoption. The overall objective of this work is to establish a foundational understanding of how EXOs can transform the future of construction trade work. The described work focuses on industry collaboration and field-based kinematic evaluation of three subjects performing a real-world construction task, removing wooden blocks from a steel-frame wall. We demonstrate the range of motion of the upper extremities of the subjects performing the task unassisted, followed by performing the task wearing two upper-extremity EXOs. This work is a presented in parallel with our separate study (evaluating the effects of a lower back EXO while dumping a gondola of refuse) also presented at this workshop. Our preliminary findings build a foundation of understanding of EXO-enabled construction tasks. This will foster EXO adoption and yield benefits including but not limited to improving the productivity of construction trades, reducing the risks of WMSDs and injuries of trade workers, broadening the workforce participation in construction trades, and extending the career life expectancy of existing trade workers.
