The paper presents a visual interface for manual annotation of language resources for derivational morphology. The interface is web-based and created using relatively simple programming techniques, and yet it rapidly facilitates and speeds up the annotation process, especially in languages with rich derivational morphology. As such, it can reduce the cost of the process. After introducing manual annotation tasks in derivational morphology, the paper describes the new visual interface and a case study that compares the current annotation method to the annotation using the interface. In addition, it also demonstrates the opportunity to use the interface for manual annotation of syntactic trees. The source codes are freely available under the MIT License on GitHub.
