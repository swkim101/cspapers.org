Recent architectures for object detection adopt a Feature Pyramid Network as a backbone for deep feature extraction. Many works focus on the design of pyramid networks which produce richer feature representations. In this work, we opt to learn a dataset-speciﬁc architecture for feature pyramid networks. With the proposed method, the network fuses features at multiple scales, it is efﬁcient in terms of parameters and operations, and yields better results across a variety of tasks and datasets. Starting by a complex network, we adopt Variational Inference to prune redundant connections. Our model, integrated with standard detectors, outperforms the state-of-the-art feature fusion networks.
