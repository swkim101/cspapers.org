Constructing accurate training tuples is crucial for unsupervised local descriptor learning, yet challenging due to the absence of patch labels. The state-of-the-art approach constructs tuples with heuristic rules, which struggle to precisely depict real-world patch transformations, in spite of enabling fast model convergence. A possible solution to alleviate the problem is the clustering-based approach, which can capture realistic patch variations and learn more accurate class decision boundaries, but suffers from slow model convergence. This paper presents HybridDesc, an unsupervised approach that learns powerful local descriptor models with fast convergence speed by combining the rule-based and clustering-based approaches to construct training tuples. In addition, HybridDesc also contributes two concrete enhancing mechanisms: (1) a Differentiable Hyperparameter Search (DHS) strategy to find the optimal hyperparameter setting of the rule-based approach so as to provide accurate prior for the clustering-based approach, (2) an On-Demand Clustering (ODC) method to reduce the clustering overhead of the clustering-based approach without eroding its advantage. Extensive experimental results show that HybridDesc can efficiently learn local descriptors that surpass existing unsupervised local descriptors and even rival competitive supervised ones.
