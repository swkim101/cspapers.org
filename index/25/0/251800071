In this paper, we investigate an optimal delegation model with multidimensional actions and multidimensional states of the world. The principal is responsible for taking an action, and her payoff is influenced by an unknown state of the world, which represents the agent's private information. No monetary transfers are available. Since the principal's and agent's preferences are not aligned, the agent is unwilling to simply disclose the state. The principal can employ arbitrary mechanisms, including stochastic ones, and her objective is to maximize her expected payoff.
