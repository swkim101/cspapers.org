Within the field of multi-robot systems, developing systems that rely only on onboard sensing without the use of external infrastructure (e.g. GNSS) has many potential applications. However, relying only on visual-based modalities for localization presents challenges in terms of accuracy and reliability. We introduce a decentralized multi-robot lateral velocity estimation method for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to improve onboard measurements in case GNSS infrastructure is not available. This method relies on sharing the onboard measurements of neighbors, as well as the estimation of the relative motion of a focal UAV within the swarm, based on observation of coworking robots. The proposed velocity estimation method does not rely on centralized communication to achieve high reliability and scalability within the swarm system. The performance of the state estimation approach has been verified in simulations and real-world experiments. The results have shown that a swarm of UAVs using the proposed velocity estimator can stabilize individual robots when their primary onboard localization source is not reliable enough.
