Generating fluent and informative natural responses while main- taining representative internal states for search optimization is critical for conversational search systems. Existing approaches ei- ther 1) predict structured dialog acts first and then generate natural response; or 2) map conversation context to natural responses di- rectly in an end-to-end manner. Both kinds of approaches have shortcomings. The former suffers from error accumulation while the semantic associations between structured acts and natural re- sponses are confined in single direction. The latter emphasizes generating natural responses but fails to predict structured acts. Therefore, we propose a neural co-generation model that gener- ates the two concurrently. The key lies in a shared latent space shaped by two informed priors. Specifically, we design structured dialog acts and natural response auto-encoding as two auxiliary tasks in an interconnected network architecture. It allows for the concurrent generation and bidirectional semantic associations. The shared latent space also enables asynchronous reinforcement learn- ing for further joint optimization. Experiments show that our model achieves significant performance improvements.
