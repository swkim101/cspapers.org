In recent years, multiplex network embedding has received great attention from researchers. However, existing multiplex network embedding meth-ods neglect structural role information, which can be used to determine the structural similarity be-tween nodes. To overcome this shortcoming, this work proposes a simple, effective, role-based embedding method for multiplex networks, called RMNE. The RMNE uses the structural role information of nodes to preserve the structural similarity between nodes in the entire multiplex network. Speciﬁcally, a role-modiﬁed random walk is designed to generate node sequences of each node, which can capture both the within-layer neighbors, structural role members, and cross-layer structural role members of a node. Additionally, the variant of RMNE extends the existing collaborative embedding method by unifying the structural role information into our method to obtain the role-based node representations. Finally, the proposed meth-ods are evaluated on the network reconstruction, node classiﬁcation, link prediction, and multi-class edge classiﬁcation tasks. The experimental results on eight public, real-world multiplex networks demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods.
