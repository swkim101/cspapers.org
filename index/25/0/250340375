We present LawNet-Viz, a web-based tool for the modeling, analysis and visualization of law reference networks extracted from a statute law corpus. LawNet-Viz is designed to support legal research tasks and help legal professionals as well as laymen visually exploring the article connections built upon the explicit law references detected in the article contents. To demonstrate LawNet-Viz, we show its application to the Italian Civil Code (ICC), which exploits a recent BERT-based model fine-tuned on the ICC. LawNet-Viz is a system prototype that is planned for product development.
