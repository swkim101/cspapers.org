Sensing and processing peripheral input is a ubiquitous capability of personal computers. Text entry on physical and virtual keyboards, mouse pointer motion, and touchscreen gestures are the primary ways in which users interact with websites viewed on desktop and mobile devices. Peripheral input events must pass through a pipeline of hardware and software processes before they reach the web browser. This pipeline is device-dependent and often contains low-frequency polling components, such as USB polling and process scheduling, that influence event timing within the web page.We show that a relatively unique device fingerprint is formed by the timing of peripheral input events. No special permissions are required to register callbacks to keyboard, mouse, and touch events from within a web browser, and the technique works on both desktop and mobile devices. We propose a dual clock model in which both a fast reference clock and slow subject clock are compared through a single time source. With this model, the instantaneous phase of the subject clock is measured and used to construct a phase image. The phase image is then embedded in a low dimensional feature space using FPNET, a convolutional neural network designed to extract a device fingerprint from the instantaneous phase. Performance is evaluated using a dataset containing 300M keyboard events collected from over 228k devices observed in the wild. After about two minutes of typing, a device fingerprint is formed that enables 87.35% verification accuracy among a population of 100k devices. Combined with features that measure user behavior in addition to device behavior, verification accuracy increases to 97.36%. The methods described have potential as a second authentication factor, but could also be used to track Internet users.
