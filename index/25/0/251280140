This paper presents an algorithm for a team of mobile robots to simultaneously learn a spatial field over a domain and spatially distribute themselves to optimally cover it. Drawing from previous approaches that estimate the spatial field through a centralized Gaussian process, this work leverages the spatial structure of the coverage problem and presents a decentralized strategy where samples are aggregated locally by establishing communications through the boundaries of a Voronoi partition. We present an algorithm whereby each robot runs a local Gaussian process calculated from its own measurements and those provided by its Voronoi neighbors, which are incorporated into the individual robot's Gaussian process only if they provide sufficiently novel information. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated in simulation and compared with centralized approaches.
