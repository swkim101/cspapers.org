A large body of recent work highlights the fallacies of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer (ZS-XLT) with large multilingual language models. Namely, their performance varies substantially for different target languages and is the weakest where needed the most: for low-resource languages distant to the source language. One remedy is few-shot transfer (FS-XLT), where leveraging only a few task-annotated instances in the target language(s) may yield sizable performance gains. However, FS-XLT also succumbs to large variation, as models easily overfit to the small datasets. In this work, we present a systematic study focused on a spectrum of FS-XLT fine-tuning regimes, analyzing key properties such as effectiveness, (in)stability, and modularity. We conduct extensive experiments on both higher-level (NLI, paraphrasing) and lower-level tasks (NER, POS), presenting new FS-XLT strategies that yield both improved and more stable FS-XLT across the board. Our findings challenge established FS-XLT methods: e.g., we propose to replace sequential fine-tuning with joint fine-tuning on source and target language instances, offering consistent gains with different number of shots (including resource-rich scenarios). We also show that further gains can be achieved with multi-stage FS-XLT training in which joint multilingual fine-tuning precedes the bilingual source-target specialization.
