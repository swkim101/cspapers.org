Recommender systems have become key components for a wide spectrum of web applications (e.g., E-commerce sites, video sharing platforms, lifestyle applications, etc), so as to alleviate the information overload and suggest items for users. However, most existing recommendation models follow a supervised learning manner, which notably limits their representation ability with the ubiquitous sparse and noisy data in practical applications. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a promising learning paradigm to distill informative knowledge from unlabeled data, without the heavy reliance on sufficient supervision signals. Inspired by the effectiveness of self-supervised learning, recent efforts bring SSL's superiority into various recommendation representation learning scenarios with augmented auxiliary learning tasks. In this tutorial, we aim to provide a systemic review of existing self-supervised learning frameworks and analyze the corresponding challenges for various recommendation scenarios, such as general collaborative filtering paradigm, social recommendation, sequential recommendation, and multi-behavior recommendation. We then raise discussions and future directions of this area. With the introduction of this emerging and promising topic, we expect the audience to have a deep understanding of this domain. We also seek to promote more ideas and discussions, which facilitates the development of self-supervised learning recommendation techniques.
