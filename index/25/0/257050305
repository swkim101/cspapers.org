Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise for developing dialogue management (DM) agents that are non-myopic, conduct rich conversations, and maximize overall user satisfaction. Despite recent developments in RL and language models (LMs), using RL to power conversational chatbots remains challenging, in part because RL requires online exploration to learn effectively, whereas collecting novel human-bot interactions can be expensive and unsafe. This issue is exacerbated by the combinatorial action spaces facing these algorithms, as most LM agents generate responses at the word level. We develop a variety of RL algorithms, specialized to dialogue planning, that leverage recent Mixture-of-Expert Language Models (MoE-LMs) -- models that capture diverse semantics, generate utterances reflecting different intents, and are amenable for multi-turn DM. By exploiting MoE-LM structure, our methods significantly reduce the size of the action space and improve the efficacy of RL-based DM. We evaluate our methods in open-domain dialogue to demonstrate their effectiveness w.r.t.\ the diversity of intent in generated utterances and overall DM performance.
