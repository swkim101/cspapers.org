Despite more than two decades of research on temporal tagging and temporal relation extraction, usable tools for annotating text remain very basic and hard to set up from an average end-user perspective, limiting the applicability of developments to a selected group of invested researchers. In this work, we aim to increase the accessibility of temporal tagging systems by presenting an intuitive web interface, called "Online DATEing", which simplifies the interaction with existing temporal annotation frameworks. Our system integrates several approaches in a single interface and streamlines the process of importing (and tagging) groups of documents, as well as making it accessible through a programmatic API. It further enables users to interactively investigate and visualize tagged texts, and is designed with an extensible API for the inclusion of new models or data formats. A web demonstration of our tool is available at https://onlinedating.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de and public code accessible at https://github.com/satya77/Temporal_Tagger_Service.
