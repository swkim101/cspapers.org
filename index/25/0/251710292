\noindent Session-based recommender systems capture the short-term interest of a user within a session. Session contexts (i.e., a user's high-level interests or intents within a session) are not explicitly given in most datasets, and implicitly inferring session context as an aggregation of item-level attributes is crude. In this paper, we propose \method, which implicitly contextualizes sessions. \method first generates implicit contexts for sessions by creating a session-item graph, learning graph embeddings, and clustering to assign sessions to contexts. \method then trains a session context predictor and uses the predicted contexts' embeddings to enhance the next-item prediction accuracy. Experiments on four datasets show that \method has superior next-item prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art models. A case study of \method on the Reddit dataset confirms that assigned session contexts are unique and meaningful.
