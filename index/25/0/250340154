PISA (Performant Indexes and Search for Academia) provides very efficient implementations of various retrieval algorithms over sparse inverted indices. The highly-optimized C++ implementation, however, has previously only been accessible via command line tools. From indexing to retrieval, 5--6 commands need to be executed in sequence, making the process relatively involved. Further complications when using PISA include a lengthy build process and minimal interoperability with other tools. In this work, we demonstrate a new tool that provides a native Python wrapper around PISA. The wrapper features a simplified interface that adheres to the PyTerrier API, making it easy to use (e.g., via Pandas DataFrames), apply to a multitude of datasets (e.g., those from the ir_datasets package) and combine with other methods (e.g., neural re-ranking and dense retrieval methods).
