Multi-view clustering has received a lot of attentions in data mining recently. Though plenty of works have been investigated on this topic, it is still a severe challenge due to the complex nature of the multiple heterogeneous features. Particularly, existing multi-view clustering algorithms fail to consider the topological structure in the data, which is essential for clustering data on manifold. In this paper, we propose to exploit the implied data manifold by learning the topological relationship between data points. Our method coalesces multiple view-wise graphs with the topological relevance considered, and learns the weights as well as the consensus graph interactively in a unified framework. Furthermore, we manipulate the consensus graph by a connectivity constraint such that the data points from the same cluster are precisely connected into the same component. Substantial experiments on both toy data and real datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms over the clustering performance.
