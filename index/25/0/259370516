In this work, we present DIAGRAPH, an open-source graphical dialog flow editor built on the ADVISER toolkit. Our goal for this tool is threefold: 1) To support subject-experts to intuitively create complex and flexible dialog systems,2) To support rapid prototyping of dialog system behavior, e.g., for research, and 3) To provide a hands-on test bed for students learning about dialog systems.To facilitate this, DIAGRAPH aims to provide a clean and intuitive graphical interface for creating dialog systems without requiring any coding knowledge.Once a dialog graph has been created, it is automatically turned into a dialog system using state of the art language models. This allows for rapid prototyping and testing.Dialog designers can then distribute a link to their finished dialog system or embed it into a website.Additionally, to support scientific experiments and data collection, dialog designers can access chat logs. Finally, to verify the usability of DIAGRAPH, we performed evaluation with subject-experts who extensively worked with the tool and users testing it for the first time, receiving above average System Usability Scale (SUS) scores from both (82 out 100 and 75 out of 100, respectively).In this way, we hope DIAGRAPH helps reduce the barrier to entry for creating dialog interactions.
