Link recommendation is an important and compelling problem at the intersection of recommender systems and online social networks. Given a user, link recommenders identify people in the platform the user might be interested in interacting with. We present RELISON, an extensible framework for running link recommendation experiments. The library provides a wide range of algorithms, along with tools for evaluating the produced recommendations. RELISON includes algorithms and metrics that consider the potential effect of recommendations on the properties of online social networks. For this reason, the library also implements network structure analysis metrics, community detection algorithms, and network diffusion simulation functionalities. The library code and documentation is available at https://github.com/ir-uam/RELISON.
