Live video streaming has become an important form of communication such as virtual conferences. However, for cross-language communication in live video streaming, reading subtitles degrades the viewing experience. To address this problem, our simultaneous dubbing prototype translates and replaces the original speech of a live video stream in a simultaneous manner. Tests on a collection of 90 public videos show that our system achieves a low average latency of 11.90 seconds for smooth playback. Our method is general and can be extended to other language pairs.
