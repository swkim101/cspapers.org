Next Basket Recommendation (NBR) that recommends a basket of items to users has become a promising promotion artifice for online businesses. The key challenge of NBR is rooted in the complicated relations of items that are dependent on one another in a same basket with users' diverse purchasing intentions, which goes far beyond the pairwise item relations in traditional recommendation tasks, and yet has not been well addressed by existing NBR methods that mostly model the inter-basket item relations only. To that end, in this paper, we construct a hypergraph from basket-wise purchasing records and probe the inter-basket and intra-basket item relations behind the hyperedges. In particular, we combine the strength of HyperGraph Neural Network with disentangled representation learning to derive the intent-aware representations of hyperedges for characterizing the nuances of user purchasing patterns. Moreover, considering the information loss in traditional item-wise optimization, we propose a novel basket-wise optimization scheme via an adversarial network to generate high-quality negative baskets. Extensive experiments conducted on four different data sets demonstrate the superior performances over the state-of-the-art NBR methods. Notably, our method is shown to strike a good balance in recommending both repeated and explorative items as a basket.
