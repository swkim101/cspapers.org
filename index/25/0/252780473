. Motivated by hiring pipelines, we study two order selection problems in which applicants for a ﬁnite set of positions must be interviewed or made oﬀers sequentially. There is a ﬁnite time budget for interviewing or making oﬀers, and a stochastic realization after each decision, leading to computationally-challenging problems. In the ﬁrst problem we study sequential interviewing, and show that a computationally-tractable, non-adaptive policy that must make oﬀers immediately after interviewing is approximately optimal, assuming oﬀerees always accept their oﬀers. In the second problem, we assume that applicants have already been interviewed but only accept oﬀers with some probability; we develop a computationally-tractable policy that makes oﬀers for the diﬀerent positions in parallel, which is approximately optimal even relative to a policy that does not need to make parallel oﬀers. Our two results both generalize and improve the guarantees in the work of Purohit et al. [18] on hiring algorithms, from 1/2 and 1/4 to approximation factors that are at least 1 − 1 /e ≈ 63 . 2%.
