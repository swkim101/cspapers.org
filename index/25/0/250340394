Community question answering (CQA) becomes increasingly prevalent in recent years, providing platforms for users with various backgrounds to obtain information and share knowledge. However, the redundancy and lengthiness issues of crowd-sourced answers limit the performance of answer selection, thus leading to difficulties in reading or even misunderstandings for community users. To solve these problems, we propose the dual graph question-answer attention networks (DGQAN) for answer selection task. Aims to fully understand the internal structure of the question and the corresponding answer, firstly, we construct a dual-CQA concept graph with graph convolution networks using the original question and answer text. Specifically, our CQA concept graph exploits the correlation information between question-answer pairs to construct two sub-graphs (QSubject-Answer and QBody-Answer), respectively. Further, a novel dual attention mechanism is incorporated to model both the internal and external semantic relations among questions and answers. More importantly, we conduct experiment to investigate the impact of each layer in the BERT model. The experimental results show that DGQAN model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets (SemEval-2015, 2016, and 2017), outperforming all the baseline models.
