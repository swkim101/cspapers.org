Liposomes encapsulating chloroquine were synthesized and characterized. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering confirmed a liposome size of ~100 nm and uniform shape. Two independent analytical methods were used to quantify chloroquine encapsulation: (i) HPLC, and (ii) UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Using RAW264.7 murine macrophages as model immune cells, cell culture experiments revealed an improved acute cytotoxicity profile of chloroquine encapsulating liposomes with >90% cell viability compared to free chloroquine (cell viability ~30%) at equivalent drug doses. These results may potentially be relevant for liposome-based chloroquine delivery for nanomedicine applications.
