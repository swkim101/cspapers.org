Logs record the behavioral data of running programs and are typically generated by executing log statements. Software developers generally carry out logging practices with clear intentions and associated concerns (I&Cs). However, I&Cs may not be properly fulfilled in source code as log placement - specifically determination of a log statement's context and content - is often susceptible to an individual's profile and experience. Some industrial studies have been conducted to discern developers' main logging I&Cs and the way I&Cs are fulfilled. However, the findings are only based on the developers from a single company in each individual study and hence have limited generalizability. More importantly, there lacks a comprehensive and deep understanding of the relationships between developers' profiles and experiences and their logging practices from a wider perspective. To fill this significant gap, we conducted an empirical study using mixed methods comprising questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interviews, and code analyses with practitioners from a wide range of companies across a variety of industrial domains. Results reveal that while developers share common logging I&Cs and conduct logging practices mainly in the coding stage, their profiles and experiences profoundly influence their logging I&Cs and the way the I&Cs are fulfilled. These findings pave the way to facilitate the acceptance of important logging I&Cs and the adoption of good logging practices by developers
