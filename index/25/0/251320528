The widespread use of smart computer vision systems in our personal spaces has led to an increased consciousness about the privacy and security risks that these systems pose. On the one hand, we want these systems to assist in our daily lives by understanding their surroundings, but on the other hand, we want them to do so without capturing any sensitive information. Towards this direction, this paper proposes a simple, yet robust privacy-preserving encoder called BDQ for the task of privacy-preserving human action recognition that is composed of three modules: Blur, Difference, and Quantization. First, the input scene is passed to the Blur module to smoothen the edges. This is followed by the Difference module to apply a pixel-wise intensity subtraction between consecutive frames to highlight motion features and suppress obvious high-level privacy attributes. Finally, the Quantization module is applied to the motion difference frames to remove the low-level privacy attributes. The BDQ parameters are optimized in an end-to-end fashion via adversarial training such that it learns to allow action recognition attributes while inhibiting privacy attributes. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed encoder design can achieve state-of-the-art trade-off when compared with previous works. Furthermore, we show that the trade-off achieved is at par with the DVS sensor-based event cameras. Code available at: https://github.com/suakaw/BDQ_PrivacyAR.
