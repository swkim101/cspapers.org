Combining query tokens and document tokens and inputting them to pre-trained transformer models like BERT, an approach known as interaction-based, has shown state-of-the-art effectiveness for information retrieval. However, the computational complexity of this approach is high due to the online self-attention computation. In contrast, dense retrieval methods in representation-based approaches are known to be efficient, however less effective. A tradeoff between the two is reached with late interaction methods like ColBERT, which attempt to benefit from both approaches: contextualized token embeddings can be pre-calculated over BERT for fine-grained effective interaction while preserving efficiency. However, despite its success in passage retrieval, it's not straightforward to use this approach for long document retrieval. In this paper, we propose a cascaded late interaction approach using a single model for long document retrieval. Fast intra-ranking by dot product is used to select relevant passages, then fine-grained interaction of pre-stored token embeddings is used to generate passage scores which are aggregated to the final document score. Multi-task learning is used to train a BERT model to optimize both a dot product and a fine-grained interaction loss functions. Our experiments reveal that the proposed approach obtains near state-of-the-art level effectiveness while being efficient on such collections as TREC 2019.
