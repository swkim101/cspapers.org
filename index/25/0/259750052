Taxonomy is formulated as directed acyclic graphs or trees of concepts that support many downstream tasks.
Many new coming concepts need to be added to an existing taxonomy.
The traditional taxonomy expansion task aims only at finding the best position for new coming concepts in the existing taxonomy. 
However, they have two drawbacks when being applied to the real-scenarios.
The previous methods suffer from low-efficiency since they waste much time when most of the new coming concepts are indeed noisy concepts. They also suffer from low-effectiveness since they collect training samples only from the existing taxonomy, which limits the ability of the model to mine more hypernym-hyponym relationships among real concepts.
This paper proposes a pluggable framework called Generative Adversarial Network for Taxonomy Entering Evaluation (GANTEE) to alleviate these drawbacks.
A generative adversarial network is designed in this framework by discriminative models to alleviate the first drawback and the generative model to alleviate the second drawback.
Two discriminators are used in GANTEE to provide long-term and short-term rewards, respectively.
Moreover, to further improve the efficiency, pre-trained language models are used to retrieve the representation of the concepts quickly.
The experiments on three real-world large-scale datasets with two different languages show that GANTEE improves the performance of the existing taxonomy expansion methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.
