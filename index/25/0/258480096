Integer data is typically made diﬀerentially private by adding noise from a Discrete Laplace (or Discrete Gaussian) distribution. We study the setting where diﬀerential privacy of a counting query is achieved using bit-wise randomized response, i.e., independent, random bit ﬂips on the encoding of the query answer. Binary error-correcting codes transmitted through noisy channels with independent bit ﬂips are well-studied in information theory. However, such codes are unsuitable for diﬀerential privacy since they have (by design) high sensitivity, i.e., neighboring integers have encodings with a large Hamming distance. Gray codes show that it is possible to create an eﬃcient sensitivity 1 encoding, but are also not suitable for diﬀerential privacy due to lack of noise-robustness. Our main result is that it is possible, with a constant rate code, to simultaneously achieve the sensitivity of Gray codes and the noise-robustness of error-correcting codes (down to the noise level required for diﬀerential privacy). An application of this new encoding of the integers is a faster, space-optimal diﬀerentially private data structure for histograms.
