The potential for conversational agents offering mental health and legal counseling in an autonomous, interactive, and vitally accessible environment is getting highlighted due to the increased access to information through the internet and mobile devices. A counseling conversational agent should be able to offer higher engagement mimicking the real-time counseling sessions. The ability to empathize or comprehend and feel another personâ€™s emotions and experiences is a crucial quality that promotes effective therapeutic bonding and rapport-building. Further, the use of polite encoded language in the counseling reflects the nobility and creates a familiar, warm, and comfortable atmosphere to resolve human issues. Therefore, focusing on these two aspects, we propose a Polite and Empathetic Mental Health and Legal Counseling Dialogue System (Po-Em-MHLCDS) for the victims of crimes. To build Po-Em-MHLCDS, we first create a Mental Health and Legal Counseling Dataset (MHLCD) by recruiting six employees who are asked to converse with each other, acting as a victim and the agent interchangeably following a fixed stated guidelines. Second, the MHLCD dataset is annotated with three informative labels, viz. counseling strategies, politeness, and empathy. Lastly, we train the Po-Em-MHLCDS in a reinforcement learning framework by designing an efficient and effective reward function to reinforce correct counseling strategy, politeness and empathy while maintaining contextual-coherence and non-repetitiveness in the generated responses. Our extensive automatic and human evaluation demonstrate the strength of the proposed system.
