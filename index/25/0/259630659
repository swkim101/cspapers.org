A critical challenge for open-domain dialogue agents is to generate persona-relevant and consistent responses. Due to the nature of persona sparsity in conversation scenarios, previous persona-based dialogue agents trained with Maximum Likelihood Estimation tend to overlook the given personas and generate responses irrelevant or inconsistent with personas. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine persona-aware training framework to improve the persona consistency of a dialogue agent progressively. Specifically, our framework first trains the dialogue agent to answer the constructed persona-aware questions, making it highly sensitive to the personas to generate persona-relevant responses. Then the dialogue agent is further trained with a contrastive learning paradigm by explicitly perceiving the difference between the consistent and the generated inconsistent responses, forcing it to pay more attention to the key persona information to generate consistent responses. By applying our proposed training framework to several representative baseline models, experimental results show significant boosts on both automatic and human evaluation metrics, especially the consistency of generated responses.
