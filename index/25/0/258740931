In partial label learning (PLL), each training sample is associated with a set of candidate labels, among which only one is valid. The core of PLL is to disambiguate the candidate labels to get the ground-truth one. In disambiguation, the existing works usually do not fully investigate the effectiveness of the non-candidate label set (a.k.a. complementary labels), which accurately indicates a set of labels that do not belong to a sample. In this paper, we use the non-candidate labels to induce a complementary classifier, which naturally forms an adversarial relationship against the traditional PLL classifier, to eliminate the false-positive labels in the candidate label set. Besides, we assume the feature space and the label space share the same local topological structure captured by a dynamic graph, and use it to assist disambiguation. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed approach against state-of-the-art PLL methods on 4 controlled UCI data sets and 6 real-world data sets and reveal the usefulness of complementary learning in PLL.
