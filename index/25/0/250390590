We present a system for document retrieval that combines direct classification with standard content-based retrieval approaches to significantly improve the relevance of the retrieved documents. Our system exploits the availability of an imperfect but sizable amount of labeled data from past queries. For domains such as technical support, the proposed approach enhances the systemâ€™s ability to retrieve documents that are otherwise ranked very low based on content alone. The system is easy to implement and can make use of existing text ranking methods, augmenting them through the novel Q2R orchestration framework. Q2R has been extensively tested and is in use at IBM.
