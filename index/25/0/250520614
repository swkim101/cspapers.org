Few-Shot Image Classification (FSIC) aims to recognize novel image classes with limited data, which is significant in practice. In this paper, we consider the FSIC problem in the case of adversarial examples. This is an extremely challenging issue because current deep learning methods are still vulnerable when handling adversarial examples, even with massive labeled training samples. For this problem, existing works focus on training a network in the meta-learning fashion that depends on numerous sampled few-shot tasks. In comparison, we propose a simple but effective baseline through directly learning generalizable representations without tedious task sampling, which is robust to unforeseen adversarial FSIC tasks. Specifically, we introduce an adversarial-aware mechanism to establish auxiliary supervision via feature-level differences between legitimate and adversarial examples. Furthermore, we design a novel adversarial-reweighted training manner to alleviate the imbalance among adversarial examples. The feature purifier is also employed as post-processing for adversarial features. Moreover, our method can obtain generalizable representations to remain superior transferability, even facing cross-domain adversarial examples. Extensive experiments show that our method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art adversarially robust FSIC methods on two standard benchmarks.
