In e-commerce, ad creatives play an important role in effectively delivering product information to users. The purpose of online creative selection is to learn users' preferences for ad creatives, and to select the most appealing design for users to maximize Click-Through Rate (CTR). However, the existing common practices in the industry usually place the creative selection after the ad ranking stage, and thus the optimal creative fails to reflect the influence on the ad ranking stage. To address these issues, we propose a novel Cascade Architecture of Creative Selection (CACS), which is built before the ranking stage to joint optimization of intra-ad creative selection and inter-ad ranking. To improve the efficiency, we design a classic two-tower structure and allow creative embeddings of the creative selection stage to share with the ranking stage. To boost the effectiveness, on the one hand, we propose a soft label list-wise ranking distillation method to distill the ranking knowledge from the ranking stage to guide CACS learning; and on the other hand, we also design an adaptive dropout network to encourage the model to probabilistically ignore ID features in favor of content features to learn multi-modal representations of the creative. Most of all, the ranking model obtains the optimal creative information of each ad from our CACS, and uses all available features to improve the performance of the ranking model. We have launched our solution in Taobao advertising platform and have obtained significant improvements both in offline and online evaluations.
