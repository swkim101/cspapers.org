Zero-shot cross-lingual event argument extraction (EAE) is a challenging yet practical problem in Information Extraction. Most previous works heavily rely on external structured linguistic features, which are not easily accessible in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates a translation-based method to implicitly project annotations from the source language to the target language. With the use of translation-based parallel corpora, no additional linguistic features are required during training and inference. As a result, the proposed approach is more cost effective than previous works on zero-shot cross-lingual EAE. Moreover, our implicit annotation projection approach introduces less noises and hence is more effective and robust than explicit ones. Experimental results show that our model achieves the best performance, outperforming a number of competitive baselines. The thorough analysis further demonstrates the effectiveness of our model compared to explicit annotation projection approaches.
