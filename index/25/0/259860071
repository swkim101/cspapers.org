Security requirements engineering is a manual and error-prone activity that is often neglected due to the knowledge gap between cybersecurity professionals and software requirements engineers. In this paper, we aim to automate the process of recommending and synthesizing security requirements specifications and therefore supporting requirements engineers in soliciting and specifying security requirements. We investigate the use of Relational Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in automatically synthesizing security requirements specifications. We evaluate our approach using a real case study of the Court Case Management System (CCMS) developed for the Indiana Supreme Court's Division of State Court Administration. We present an approach based on RelGAN to generate security requirements specifications for the CCMS. We show that RelGAN is practical for synthesizing security requirements specifications as indicated by subject matter experts. Based on this study, we demonstrate promising results for the use of GANs in the software requirements synthesis domain. We also provide a baseline for synthesizing requirements, highlight limitations and weaknesses of RelGAN and define opportunities for further investigations.
