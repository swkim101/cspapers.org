This paper studies a robust class of functions from finite words to integers that we call ℤ-polyregular functions. We show that it admits natural characterizations in terms of logics, ℤ-rational expressions, ℤ-rational series and transducers.We then study two subclass membership problems. First, we show that the asymptotic growth rate of a function is computable, and corresponds to the minimal number of variables required to represent it using logical formulas. Second, we show that first-order definability of ℤ-polyregular functions is decidable. To show the latter, we introduce an original notion of residual transducer, and provide a semantic characterization based on aperiodicity.
