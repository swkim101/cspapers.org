Epistemic logics typically talk about knowledge of individual agents or groups of explicitly listed agents. Often, however, one wishes to express knowledge of groups of agents specified by a given property, as in ‘it is common knowledge among economists’. We introduce such a logic of common knowledge, which we term abstract-group epistemic logic (AGEL). That is, AGEL features a common knowledge operator for groups of agents given by concepts in a separate agent logic that we keep generic, with one possible agent logic being ALC. We show that AGEL is EXPTIME-complete, with the lower bound established by reduction from standard group epistemic logic, and the upper bound by a satisfiability-preserving embedding into the full µ-calculus. Further main results include a finite model property (not enjoyed by the full µ-calculus) and a complete axiomatization.
