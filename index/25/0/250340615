Causal contributions measure the strengths of different causes to a target quantity. Understanding causal contributions is important in empirical sciences and data-driven disciplines since it allows to answer practical questions such as “what are the contributions of each cause to the effect?” In this paper, we develop a principled method for quantifying causal contributions. First, we provide desiderata in terms of axioms that causal contribution measures should satisfy and propose the do -Shapley values (inspired by do -interventions (Pearl, 2000)) as a method satisfying these properties. Next, we develop a criterion under which the do -Shapley values can be efficiently inferred from non-experimental data. Finally, we introduce do Shapley estimators exhibiting consistency and statistical robustness. Simulation results corroborate with the proposed theory.
