Multiverse analysis—a paradigm for statistical analysis that considers all combinations of reasonable analysis choices in parallel—promises to improve transparency and reproducibility. Although recent tools help analysts specify multiverse analyses, they remain difficult to use in practice. In this work, we identify debugging as a key barrier due to the latency from running analyses to detecting bugs and the scale of metadata processing needed to diagnose a bug. To address these challenges, we prototype a command-line interface tool, Multiverse Debugger, which helps diagnose bugs in the multiverse and propagate fixes. In a qualitative lab study (n=13), we use Multiverse Debugger as a probe to develop a model of debugging workflows and identify specific challenges, including difficulty in understanding the multiverse’s composition. We conclude with design implications for future multiverse analysis authoring systems.
