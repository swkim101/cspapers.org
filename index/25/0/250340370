Evidence-based fake news detection is to judge the veracity of news against relevant evidences. However, models tend to memorize the dataset biases within spurious correlations between news patterns and veracity labels as shortcuts, rather than learning how to integrate the information behind them to reason. As a consequence, models may suffer from a serious failure when facing real-life conditions where most news has different patterns. Inspired by the success of causal inference, we propose a novel framework for debiasing evidence-based fake news detection\footnoteCode available at https://github.com/CRIPAC-DIG/CF-FEND by causal intervention. Under this framework, the model is first trained on the original biased dataset like ordinary work, then it makes conventional predictions and counterfactual predictions simultaneously in the testing stage, where counterfactual predictions are based on the intervened evidence. Relatively unbiased predictions are obtained by subtracting intervened outputs from the conventional ones. Extensive experiments conducted on several datasets demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality on debiased datasets.
