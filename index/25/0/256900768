Higher-order abstract GSOS is a recent extension of Turi and Plotkin’s framework of Mathematical Operational Semantics to higher-order languages. The fundamental well-behavedness property of all specifications within the framework is that coalgebraic strong (bi)similarity on their operational model is a congruence. In the present work, we establish a corresponding congruence theorem for weak similarity, which is shown to instantiate to well-known concepts such as Abramsky’s applicative similarity for the λ-calculus. On the way, we develop several techniques of independent interest at the level of abstract categories, including relation liftings of mixed-variance bifunctors and higher-order GSOS laws, as well as Howe’s method.
