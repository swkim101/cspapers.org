Quadrupedal landing is a complex process involving large impacts, elaborate contact transitions, and is a crucial recovery behavior observed in many biological animals. This work presents a real-time, optimal landing controller that is free of pre-specified contact schedules. The controller determines optimal touchdown postures and reaction force profiles and is able to recover from a variety of falling configurations. The quadrupedal platform used, the MIT Mini Cheetah, recovered safely from drops of up to 8 m in simulation, as well as from a range of orientations and planar velocities. The controller is also tested on hardware, successfully recovering from drops of up to 2 m.
