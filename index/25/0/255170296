Lower-limb exoskeletons are robotic devices that can provide assistance to human locomotion. Since they are expected to be used in ecological environments, their control strategy should handle different kinds of daily-life situations. Taking inspiration from the human neuromuscular system - and particularly from the socalled motor primitives - may help in adapting the type of delivered assistance to different locomotion tasks. In this work, we validated the combination of simplified primitives and a musculoskeletal model for assisting healthy subjects with a hip exoskeleton. This framework showed adaptation to the user's gait for different slope inclinations, although its effects on the subject's speed and their perceived effort showed no significant improvement compared to wearing the device in transparent mode.
