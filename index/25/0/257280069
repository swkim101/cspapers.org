Autonomous shape and structure formation is an important problem in the domain of large-scale multi-agent systems. In this paper, we propose a 3D structure representation method and a distributed structure formation strategy where settled agents guide free moving agents to a prescribed location to settle in the structure. Agents at the structure formation frontier looking for neighbors to settle act as beacons, generating a surface gradient throughout the formed structure propagated by settled agents. Free-moving agents follow the surface gradient along the formed structure surface to the formation frontier, where they eventually reach the closest beacon and settle to continue the structure formation following a local bidding process. Agent behavior is governed by a finite state machine implementation, along with potential field-based motion control laws. We also discuss appropriate rules for recovering from stagnation points. Simulation experiments are presented to show planar and 3D structure formations with continuous and discontinuous boundary/surfaces, which validate the proposed strategy, followed by a scalability analysis.
