While collaborative robotic arms offer significant safety benefits, safety of the overall manipulator system cannot be guaranteed unless equally strict safety requirements are satisfied by the accompanying end-effector. Current robot grippers are not made in a way that fulfills such a requirement, resulting in collaborative robots needing to operate in a protected environment. This paper presents a novel permanent magnet actuator inside of a conventional industrial electric gripper which results in an end-effector that has an unmatched force range of 1-2N to 43N and exhibits interesting characteristics suited to the requirements of a safe gripper such as torque holding without power, variable stiffness and force sensing.
