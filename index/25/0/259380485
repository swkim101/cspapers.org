Modern search and recommendation systems are optimized using logged interaction data. There is increasing societal pressure to enable users of such systems to have some of their data deleted from those systems. This paper focuses on "unlearning" such user data from neighborhood-based recommendation models on sparse, high-dimensional datasets. We present caboose, a custom top-k index for such models, which enables fast and exact deletion of user interactions. We experimentally find that caboose provides competitive index building times, makes sub-second unlearning possible (even for a large index built from one million users and 256 million interactions), and, when integrated into three state-of-the-art next-basket recommendation models, allows users to effectively adjust their predictions to remove sensitive items.
