Session-based recommendation aims to predict next click action (e.g., item) of anonymous users based on a fixed number of previous actions. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance in various applications. Inspired by the success of GNNs, tremendous endeavors have been devoted to introduce GNNs into session-based recommendation and have achieved significant results. Nevertheless, due to the highly diverse types of potential information in sessions, existing GNNs-based methods perform differently on different session datasets, leading to the need for efficient design of neural networks adapted to various session recommendation scenarios. To address this problem, we propose Automated neural architecture search for Graph-based Session Recommendation, namely AutoGSR, a framework that provides a practical and general solution to automatically find the optimal GNNs-based session recommendation model. In AutoGSR, we propose two novel GNN operations to build an expressive and compact search space. Building upon the search space, we employ a differentiable search algorithm to search for the optimal graph neural architecture. Furthermore, to consider all types of session information together, we propose to learn the item meta knowledge, which acts as a priori knowledge for guiding the optimization of final session representations. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoGSR is able to find effective neural architectures and achieve state-of-the-art results. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the neural architecture search for the session-based recommendation.
