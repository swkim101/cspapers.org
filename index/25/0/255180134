A fully tested autonomous system works predictably under ideal or assumed environment. However, its behavior is not fully defined when some components malfunction or fail. In this paper, we consider automated guided vehicle (AGV), equipped with multiple sensors, executing a traversal task in a static unknown environment. We have analytically studied the system, computed a set of performance and safety metrics, and validated it with simulation results in Webots. We have also analyzed the effect on system performance under independent and correlated sensing errors. We have also performed sensitivity analysis to identify the most critical components in any given system; and this can be utilized to increase the reliability of the system and its conformance to safety objectives.
