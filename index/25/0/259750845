Currently, there is renewed interest in logic-related solutions for AI and Computer Science. The availability of software tools to support the realization of such studies (both as powerful and versatile prototyping tools and as teaching tools) has become a necessity. Intending to contribute to this field, we present a tool that allows the unification of different logic tasks, focused on Computer Logic but adaptable to the treatment in several subfields, contexts, and abstraction levels (LogicUS-LIB, LogicUS-NB, LogicUS-GUI). 

The tool provides a sound framework for two activity fields. On the one hand, in the topic of logic-based systems research, prototyping is facilitated in a relatively fast, simple, and highly adaptable way. On the other hand, in Education, by allowing the student to abstract from low-level execution of algorithms whilst preserving the conceptual structures and procedural methodologies underlying the logical foundations.
