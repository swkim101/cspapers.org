The performance of speech and events recognition systems significantly improved recently thanks to deep learning methods. However, some of these tasks remain challenging when algorithms are deployed on robots due to the unseen mechanical noise and electrical interference generated by their actuators while training the neural networks. Ego-noise reduction as a preprocessing step therefore can help solve this issue when using pre-trained speech and event recognition algorithms on robots. In this paper, we propose a new method to reduce ego-noise using only a microphone array and less than two minute of noise recordings. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the best covariance matrix candidate is selected from a dictionary created online during calibration and used with the Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamformer. Results show that the proposed method runs in real-time, improves the signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) by up to 10 dB, decreases the word error rate (WER) by 55% in some cases and increases the Average Precision (AP) of event detection by up to 0.2.
