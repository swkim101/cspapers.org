Video-language pre-training for text-based video retrieval tasks is vitally important. Previous pre-training methods suffer from the semantic misalignments. The reason is that these methods ignore sequence alignments but focusing on critical token alignment. To alleviate the problem, we propose a video-language pre-training framework, termed videolanguage pre-training For lEarning sEmantic aLignments (FEEL), to learn semantic alignments at the sequence level. Specifically, the global modality reconstruction and the cross- modal self-contrasting method is utilized to learn the alignments at the sequence level better. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FEEL on text-based video retrieval and text-based video corpus moment retrieval.
