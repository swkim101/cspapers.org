Multiview clustering has received increasing attention due to its effectiveness in fusing complementary information without manual annotations. Most previous methods hold the assumption that each instance appears in all views. However, it is not uncommon to see that some views may contain some missing instances, which gives rise to incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) in literature. Although many IMVC methods have been recently proposed, they always encounter high complexity and expensive time expenditure from being applied into large-scale tasks. In this paper, we present a flexible highly-efficient incomplete large-scale multi-view clustering approach based on bipartite graph framework to solve these issues. Specifically, we formalize multi-view anchor learning and incomplete bipartite graph into a unified framework, which coordinates with each other to boost cluster performance. By introducing the flexible bipartite graph framework to handle IMVC for the first practice, our proposed method enjoys linear complexity respecting to instance numbers, which is more applicable for large-scale IMVC tasks. Comprehensive experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm against other IMVC competitors.
