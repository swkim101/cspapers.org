To satiate the comprehensive information need of users, retrieval systems surpassing the boundaries of language are inevitable in the present digital space in the wake of an ever-rising multilingualism. This work presents the first-of-its-kind Bilingual Text Retrieval Explanations (BiTe-REx) aimed at users performing competitor or wage analysis in the automotive domain. BiTe-REx supports users to gather a more comprehensive picture of their query by retrieving results regardless of the query language and enables them to make a more informed decision by exposing how the underlying model judges the relevance of documents. With a user study, we demonstrate statistically significant results on the understandability and helpfulness of the explanations provided by the system.
