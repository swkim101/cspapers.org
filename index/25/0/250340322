Conducting studies involving actual users is a recurring challenge in information retrieval. In this tutorial we will address the main strategic and tactical choices for engaging with, designing and executing user studies, considering both evaluation and formative investigation. The tension between reproducibility and ensuring natural user behaviour will be a recurring focus, seeking to help individual researchers make an intentional and well-argued choice for their research. The presenters have over fifty years of combined experience working in interactive information retrieval, and information interaction in general.
