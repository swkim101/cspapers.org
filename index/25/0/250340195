The title of a product offering is the consolidation of a product's characteristics in textual format for user consumption. The low quality of the textual content of a product's title can negatively influence the entire shopping experience. The negative experience can start with the impossibility of discovering a desired product, going from problems in identifying a product and its characteristics up to the purchase of an unwanted item. A solution to this problem is to establish an indicator that automatically describes the quality of the product title. With this assessment, it is possible to notify sellers who have registered products with poor quality titles and encourage revisions or suggest improvements. The focus of this work is to show how it is possible to assign a score that indicates the descriptive quality of product offers in an e-commerce marketplace environment using unsupervised methods.
