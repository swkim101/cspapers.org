Many papers have addressed the problem of learning the behavior (i.e., the local interaction function at each node) of a networked system through active queries, assuming that the network topology is known. We address the problem of inferring both the network topology and the behavior of such a system through active queries. Our re-sults are for systems where the state of each node is from { 0 , 1 } and the local functions are Boolean. We present inference algorithms under both batch and adaptive query models for dynamical systems with symmetric local functions. These algorithms show that the structure and behavior of such dynamical systems can be learnt using only a polynomial number of queries. Further, we establish a lower bound on the number of queries needed to learn such dynamical systems. We also present experimental results obtained by running our algorithms on synthetic and real-world networks.
