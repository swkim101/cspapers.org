In interacting with stiff environments through teleoperated systems, time delays cause a mismatch between haptic feedback and the expected feedback by the operator. This mismatch causes artefacts in the feedback, which decrease transparency, but so does filtering these artefacts. Through modelling of operator stiffness and the expected feedback force with EMG, the artifacts can be selectively filtered without loss of transparency. We developed several feedback modulation techniques to bring the feedback force closer to the expected force: 1) the average between the modelled operator force and the feedback force, 2) a low pass filter and 3) a scaling modulation. To control for overdamping, a transparency check is included. We show that the averaging approach yields significantly better contacts than unmodulated feedback. None of the modulation algorithms differ significantly from the unmodulated feedback in transparency.
