Generative transformer-based models have reached cutting-edge performance in long document summarization. Nevertheless, this task is witnessing a paradigm shift in developing ever-increasingly computationally-hungry solutions, focusing on effectiveness while ignoring the economic, environmental, and social costs of yielding such results. Accordingly, such extensive resources impact climate change and raise barriers to small and medium organizations distinguished by low-resource regimes of hardware and data. As a result, this unsustainable trend has lifted many concerns in the community, which directs the primary efforts on the proposal of tools to monitor models' energy costs. Despite their importance, no evaluation measure considering models' eco-sustainability exists yet. In this work, we propose Carburacy, the first carbon-aware accuracy measure that captures both model effectiveness and eco-sustainability. We perform a comprehensive benchmark for long document summarization, comparing multiple state-of-the-art quadratic and linear transformers on several datasets under eco-sustainable regimes. Finally, thanks to Carburacy, we found optimal combinations of hyperparameters that let models be competitive in effectiveness with significantly lower costs.
