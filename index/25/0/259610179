Source free domain adaptation (SFDA) transfers a single-source model to the unlabeled target domain without accessing the source data. With the intelligence development of various fields, a zoo of source models is more commonly available, arising in a new setting called multi-source-free domain adaptation (MSFDA). We find that the critical inborn challenge of MSFDA is how to estimate the importance (contribution) of each source model. In this paper, we shed new Bayesian light on the fact that the posterior probability of source importance connects to discriminability and transferability. We propose Discriminability And Transferability Estimation (DATE), a universal solution for source importance estimation. Specifically, a proxy discriminability perception module equips with habitat uncertainty and density to evaluate each sample's surrounding environment. A source-similarity transferability perception module quantifies the data distribution similarity and encourages the transferability to be reasonably distributed with a domain diversity loss. Extensive experiments show that DATE can precisely and objectively estimate the source importance and outperform prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that DATE can take the most popular SFDA networks as backbones and make them become advanced MSFDA solutions.
