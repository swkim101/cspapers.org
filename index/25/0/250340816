Steerable models can provide very general and ﬂexible equivariance by formulating equivariance requirements in the language of representation theory and feature ﬁelds, which has been recog-nized to be effective for many vision tasks. How-ever, deriving steerable models for 3D rotations is much more difﬁcult than that in the 2D case, due to more complicated mathematics of 3D rotations. In this work, we employ partial differential operators (PDOs) to model 3D ﬁlters, and derive general steerable 3D CNNs, which are called PDO-s3DCNNs. We prove that the equivariant ﬁlters are subject to linear constraints, which can be solved efﬁciently under various conditions. As far as we know, PDO-s3DCNNs are the most general steerable CNNs for 3D rotations, in the sense that they cover all common subgroups of SO (3) and their representations, while existing methods can only be applied to speciﬁc groups and representations. Extensive experiments show that our models can preserve equivariance well in the discrete domain, and outperform previous works on SHREC’17 retrieval and ISBI 2012 segmentation tasks with a low network complexity.
