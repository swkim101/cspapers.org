We design and implement GigaDORAM, a novel 3-server Distributed Oblivious RAM (DORAM) protocol. Oblivious RAM allows a client to read and write to memory on an untrusted server, while ensuring the server itself learns nothing about the clientâ€™s access pattern. Distributed Oblivious RAM (DORAM) distributes the role of the ORAM server. Specifically, DORAM allows a group of servers to efficiently access a secret-shared array at a secret-shared index. DORAM has two main advantages over traditional ORAM protocols: (1) it effectively outsources all the communication / computation costs to the DORAM servers, minimizing the client complexity, and (2) it allows secure multiparty computation (MPC) in the RAM model, opening a new range of potential applications. A recent generation of DORAM implementations (e.g.
