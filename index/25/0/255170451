In this study, a mechanism that realizes a novel structural form of the harmonic reducer is introduced. Conventional robots often use various mechanical reducers owing to low torque and high-speed characteristics of electric motors. Among them, harmonic reducers are frequently used because of their compact size and backlash-free precision. The plate harmonic reducer which uses the same topological geometry and reducing mechanism as the conventional harmonic reducer is a novel type of strain gear that changes its shape to a plate form for axial deformation. It has unique differences in terms of axial thickness, torsional stiffness, and efficiency due to its morphological characteristics. This study introduces and analyzes the reducing principle of the plate harmonic reducer and describes the methodological solutions for realization. Finally, the theoretical performance improvement and operating feasibility of the plate harmonic reducer are analyzed using finite element method and a 3D-printed prototype model.
