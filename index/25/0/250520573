This paper tackles the cross-modality person re-identification (re-ID) problem by suppressing the modality discrepancy. In cross-modality re-ID, the query and gallery images are in different modalities. Given a training identity, the popular deep classification baseline shares the same proxy (i.e., a weight vector in the last classification layer) for two modalities. We find that it has considerable tolerance for the modality gap, because the shared proxy acts as an intermediate relay between two modalities. In response, we propose a Memory-Augmented Unidirectional Metric (MAUM) learning method consisting of two novel designs, i.e., unidirectional metrics, and memory-based augmentation. Specifically, MAUM first learns modality-specific proxies (MS-Proxies) independently under each modality. Afterward, MAUM uses the already-learned MS-Proxies as the static references for pulling close the features in the counterpart modality. These two unidirectional metrics (IR image to RGB proxy and RGB image to IR proxy) jointly alleviate the relay effect and benefit cross-modality association. The cross-modality association is further enhanced by storing the MS-Proxies into memory banks to increase the reference diversity. Importantly, we show that MAUM improves cross-modality re-ID under the modality-balanced setting and gains extra robustness against the modality-imbalance problem. Extensive experiments on SYSU-MMOI and RegDB datasets demonstrate the superiority of MAUM over the state-of-the-art. The code will be available.
