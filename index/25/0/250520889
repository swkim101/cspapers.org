Dedicated, tightly integrated, and static packet processing pipelines in today's most widely deployed network stacks preclude them from fully exploiting capabilities of modern hardware. We present NetChannel, a disaggregated network stack architecture for μs-scale applications running atop Terabit Ethernet. NetChannel's disaggregated architecture enables independent scaling and scheduling of resources allocated to each layer in the packet processing pipeline. Using an end-to-end NetChannel realization within the Linux network stack, we demonstrate that NetChannel enables new operating points---(1) enabling a single application thread to saturate multi-hundred gigabit access link bandwidth; (2) enabling near-linear scalability for small message processing with number of cores, independent of number of application threads; and, (3) enabling isolation of latency-sensitive applications, allowing them to maintain μs-scale tail latency even when competing with throughput-bound applications operating at near-line rate.
