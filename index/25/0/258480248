Graph neural networks (GNNs) based methods have achieved impressive performance on node clustering task. However, they are designed on the homophilic assumption of graph and clustering on heterophilic graph is overlooked. Due to the lack of labels, it is impossible to first identify a graph as homophilic or heterophilic before a suitable GNN model can be found. Hence, clustering on real-world graph with various levels of homophily poses a new challenge to the graph research community. To fill this gap, we propose a novel graph clustering method, which contains three key components: graph reconstruction, a mixed filter, and dual graph clustering network. To be graph-agnostic, we empirically construct two graphs which are high homophily and heterophily from each data. The mixed filter based on the new graphs extracts both low-frequency and high-frequency information. To reduce the adverse coupling between node attribute and topological structure, we separately map them into two subspaces in dual graph clustering network. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark graphs demonstrate our promising performance. In particular, our method dominates others on heterophilic graphs.
