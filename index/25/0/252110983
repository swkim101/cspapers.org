Humans are able to negotiate downstep behaviors-both planned and unplanned-with remarkable agility and ease. The goal of this paper is to systematically study the translation of this human behavior to bipedal walking robots, even if the morphology is inherently different. Concretely, we begin with human data wherein planned and unplanned downsteps are taken. We analyze this data from the perspective of reduced-order modelling of the human, encoding the center of mass (CoM) kinematics and contact forces, which allows for the translation of these behaviors into the corresponding reduced-order model of a bipedal robot. We embed the resulting behaviors into the full-order dynamics of a bipedal robot via nonlinear optimization-based controllers. The end result is the demonstration of planned and unplanned downsteps in simulation on an underactuated walking robot.
