Most of the recent research in semi-supervised object detection follows the pseudo-labeling paradigm evolved from the semi-supervised image classification task. However, the training paradigm of the two-stage object detector inevitably makes the pseudo-label learning process for unlabeled images full of bias. Specifically, the IoU matching scheme used for selecting and labeling candidate boxes is based on the assumption that the matching source~(ground truth) is accurate enough in terms of the number of objects, object position and object category. Obviously, pseudo-labels generated for unlabeled images cannot satisfy such a strong assumption, which makes the produced training proposals extremely unreliable and thus severely spoil the follow-up training. To de-bias the training proposals generated by the pseudo-label-based IoU matching, we propose a general framework -- De-biased Teacher, which abandons both the IoU matching and pseudo labeling processes by directly generating favorable training proposals for consistency regularization between the weak/strong augmented image pairs. Moreover, a distribution-based refinement scheme is designed to eliminate the scattered class predictions of significantly low values for higher efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed De-biased Teacher consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on the MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks.
