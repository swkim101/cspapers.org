Wearable gait assistive devices have been im-proved by soft robotics in terms of safety and physical burden of the wearer. Currently, electrical sensors and computers around the wearer are bottlenecks in enhancing the wearer's activities. In this paper, we present a wearable gait assistive system using soft pneumatic system for all the actuation, sensing, and computation. Pneumatic artifical muscles (PAMs) on the thighs were used to generate assistance force, and thin PAMs on the whole legs were used for sensing the wearer's motion. All thin PAMs were connected to each other by tubes, and the pressure response in the tubes were exploited to compute the wearer's motion in manner of physical reservoir computing. The left thigh angular velocity estimated from the reservoir response was used for control the PAMs for actuation. Our experiment with the use of gait assistance showed that the system worked correctly. This paper shows that the pneumatic analog computation system for sensing soft body can help the functionality of soft wearable assistive devices.
