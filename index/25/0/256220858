The paper considers the design of air-jet engines that implement detonation combustion based on jet initialization of detonation. Conditions implementing jet initialization of detonation are considered in detail. Working processes numerical simulation in the detonation engine based on the author's software package is carried out. The numerical experiment showed that the combustion transition to detonation for the transonic flow mode can be realized at the obstacle section due to the occurrence of a system of jumps. On the basis of modeling, it is possible to draw the conclusion that at ∽40% shading factor of a cross-section of the pipe and step of obstacles, approximately equal to the diameter of the pipe, the optimum pre-detonation distances are apparently reached. Based on research work pulsating detonation engines running on automobile gasoline were designed and manufactured as prototypes for flight tests. The engine works steadily in a wide range of composition of the mixture. The draft of the best samples of engines of this size at a speed of 120 m/sec- up to 147–177 N. The engines have progressive speed performance. When detonation combustion occurs in an engine with a 100 Hz frequency, strong vibrations are observed.
