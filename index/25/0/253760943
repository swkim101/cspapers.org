This paper presents a comprehensive and quality collection of functional human brain network data for potential research in the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and graph analytics. Anatomical and functional MRI images have been used to understand the functional connectivity of the human brain and are particularly important in identifying underlying neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Autism. Recently, the study of the brain in the form of brain networks using machine learning and graph analytics has become increasingly popular, especially to predict the early onset of these conditions. A brain network, represented as a graph, retains rich structural and positional information that traditional examination methods are unable to capture. However, the lack of publicly accessible brain network data prevents researchers from data-driven explorations. One of the main difficulties lies in the complicated domain-specific preprocessing steps and the exhaustive computation required to convert the data from MRI images into brain networks. We bridge this gap by collecting a large amount of MRI images from public databases and a private source, working with domain experts to make sensible design choices, and preprocessing the MRI images to produce a collection of brain network datasets. The datasets originate from 6 different sources, cover 4 brain conditions, and consist of a total of 2,702 subjects. We test our graph datasets on 12 machine learning models to provide baselines and validate the data quality on a recent graph analysis model. To lower the barrier to entry and promote the research in this interdisciplinary field, we release our brain network data and complete preprocessing details including codes at https://doi.org/10.17608/k6.auckland.21397377 and https://github.com/brainnetuoa/data_driven_network_neuroscience.
