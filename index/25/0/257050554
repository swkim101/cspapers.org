Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide effective representations for recommendation tasks. GNN-based recommendation systems (GNN-Rs) capture the complex high-order connectivity between users and items by aggregating information from distant neighbors and can improve the performance of recommender systems. Recently, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have also been incorporated into the user-item interaction graph to provide more abundant contextual information; they are exploited to address cold-start problems and enable more explainable aggregation in GNN-Rs. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of users and items, developing an effective aggregation strategy that works across multiple GNN-Rs, such as LightGCN and KGAT, remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based message passing framework for recommender systems, which we call DPAO (Dual Policy learning framework for Aggregation Optimization). This framework adaptively determines high-order connectivity to aggregate users and items using dual policy learning. Dual policy learning leverages two Deep-Q-Network models to exploit the user- and item-aware feedback from a GNN-R and boost the performance of the target GNN-R. Our proposed framework was evaluated with both non-KG-based and KG-based GNN-R models on six real-world datasets, and their results show that our proposed framework significantly enhances the recent base model, improving nDCG and Recall by up to 63.7% and 42.9%, respectively.
