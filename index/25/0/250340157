Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation plays a critical role in many location-based applications as it provides personalized suggestions on attractive destinations for users. Since users' next movement is highly related to the historical visits, sequential methods such as recurrent neural networks are widely used in this task for modeling check-in behaviors. However, existing methods mainly focus on modeling the sequential regularity of check-in sequences but pay little attention to the intrinsic characteristics of POIs, neglecting the entanglement of the diverse influence stemming from different aspects of POIs. In this paper, we propose a novel Disentangled Representation-enhanced Attention Network (DRAN) for next POI recommendation, which leverages the disentangled representations to explicitly model different aspects and corresponding influence for representing a POI more precisely. Specifically, we first design a propagation rule to learn graph-based disentangled representations by refining two types of POI relation graphs, making full use of the distance-based and transition-based influence for representation learning. Then, we extend the attention architecture to aggregate personalized spatio-temporal information for modeling dynamic user preferences on the next timestamp, while maintaining the different components of disentangled representations independent. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model to state-of-the-art approaches. Further studies confirm the effectiveness of DRAN in representation disentanglement.
