Using a delta-manipulator for stabilisation of an end-effector to perform precise spatial positioning is a current area of interest in aerial manipulation. High speed precision movements of a manipulator can cause disturbances to the aerial platform, which hinders trajectory tracking and in some cases could be sufficient to cause a loss of control of the vehicle. In this paper, a statically balanced delta aerial manipulator is developed and evaluated. The system is balanced using three counter-masses to reduce the force imparted onto the base and thus reduce perturbations to the movement of the drone. The system is thoroughly tested following trajectories while mounted to a force sensor and while on-board an aerial vehicle. Results show that the forces transmitted to the base in all axes are reduced considerably, however improvements in overall flight accuracy are not observed in aerial settings. Design lessons to make a balanced delta-manipulator viable for practical implementation on an aerial vehicle are discussed in depth.
