Mobile internet users generate personal data on the devices all the time in this era. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel system for integrating the data of a user from different sources into a Personal Knowledge Graph, i.e., PKG. We show how a user's intention can be detected and how the personal data can be aligned and connected by the user behaviors. The constructed PKG allows the system makes reasonable and accurate recommendations for users by a "neural + symbolic'' approach across different services. Our system is shown in https://youtu.be/hWuo8KCDrto.
