The scribble-supervised semantic segmentation is an important yet challenging task in the field of computer vision. To deal with the pixel-wise sparse annotation problem, we propose a Progressive Bayesian Inference (PBI) framework to boost the performance of the scribble-supervised semantic segmentation, which can effectively infer the semantic distribution of these unlabeled pixels to guide the optimization of the segmentation network. The PBI dynamically improves the model learning from two aspects: the Bayesian inference module (i.e., semantic distribution learning) and the pixel-wise segmenter (i.e., model updating). Specifically, we effectively infer the semantic probability distribution of these unlabeled pixels with our designed Bayesian inference module, where its guidance is estimated through the Bayesian expectation maximization under the situation of partially observed data. The segmenter can be progressively improved under the joint guidance of the original scribble information and the learned semantic distribution. The segmenter optimization and semantic distribution promotion are encapsulated into a unified architecture where they could improve each other with mutual evolution in a progressive fashion. Comprehensive evaluations of several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed PBI when compared with other state-of-the-art methods applied to the scribble-supervised semantic segmentation task.
