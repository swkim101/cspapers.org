Given a dynamic graph subject to edge insertions and deletions, we show how to update an implicit representation of a proper vertex colouring, such that colours of vertices are computable upon query time. We give a deterministic algorithm that uses O(α 2) colours for a dynamic graph of arboricity α, and a randomised algorithm that uses O(min{α logα, α logloglogn}) colours in the oblivious adversary model. Our deterministic algorithm has update- and query times polynomial in α and logn, and our randomised algorithm has amortised update- and query time that with high probability is polynomial in logn with no dependency on the arboricity. Thus, we improve the number of colours exponentially compared to the state-of-the art for implicit colouring, namely from O(2α) colours, and we approach the theoretical lower bound of Ω(α) for this arboricity-parameterised approach. Simultaneously, our randomised algorithm improves the update- and query time to run in time solely polynomial in logn with no dependency on α. Our algorithms are fully adaptive to the current value of the dynamic arboricity at query or update time.
