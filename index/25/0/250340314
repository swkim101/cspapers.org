There exists the cold-start problem in the recommendation systems when observed user-item interactions are insufficient. To alleviate this problem, most existing works aim to learn globally shared prior knowledge across all items and be fast adapted to a new item with few interactions. However, such learning techniques are data demanding and work poorly on new items with no interactions. In this applied paper, we present an industrial framework recently deployed on Alipay to address the item cold-start problem in zero-shot scenarios. The proposed framework provides both efficient and high-quality recommendations for cold items with no log data. Specifically, we formulate the cold-start problem as a zero-shot learning problem and build a highly efficient infrastructure to accomplish online zero-shot recommendations used on large-scale platforms. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that the proposed framework has superior performance and recommends cold items to preferred users more effectively than other state-of-the-art methods.
