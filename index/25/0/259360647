Spatial architecture is a high-performance architecture that uses control flow graphs and data flow graphs as the computational model and producer/consumer models as the execution models. However, existing spatial architectures suffer from control flow handling challenges. Upon categorizing their PE execution models, we find that they lack autonomous, peer-to-peer, and temporally loosely-coupled control flow handling capability. This leads to limited performance in intensive control programs.A spatial architecture, Marionette, is proposed, with an explicit-designed control flow plane. The Control Flow Plane enables autonomous, peer-to-peer and temporally loosely-coupled control flow handling. The Proactive PE Configuration ensures computation-overlapped and timely configuration to improve handling Branch Divergence. The Agile PE Assignment enhance the pipeline performance of Imperfect Loops. We develop full stack of Marionette (ISA, compiler, simulator, RTL) and demonstrate that in a variety of challenging intensive control programs, compared to state-of-the-art spatial architectures, Marionette outperforms Softbrain, TIA, REVEL, and RipTide by geomean 2.88×, 3.38×, 1.55×, and 2.66×.CCS CONCEPTS• Computer systems organization→Reconfigurable computing; • Theory of computation → Models of computation.
