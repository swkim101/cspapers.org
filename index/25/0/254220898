The essential task of urban planning is to generate the optimal land-use configuration of a target area. However, traditional urban planning is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Deep generative learning gives us hope that we can automate this planning process and come up with the ideal urban plans. While remarkable achievements have been obtained, they have exhibited limitations in lacking awareness of: 1) the hierarchical dependencies between functional zones and spatial grids; 2) the peer dependencies among functional zones; and 3) human regulations to ensure the usability of generated configurations. To address these limitations, we develop a novel human-instructed deep hierarchical generative model. We rethink the urban planning generative task from a unique functionality perspective, where we summarize planning requirements into different functionality projections for better urban plan generation. To this end, we develop a three-stage generation process from a target area to zones to grids. The first stage is to label the grids of a target area with latent functionalities to discover functional zones. The second stage is to perceive the planning requirements to form urban functionality projections. We propose a novel module: functionalizer to project the embedding of human instructions and geospatial contexts to the zone-level plan to obtain such projections. Each projection includes the information of land-use portfolios and the structural dependencies across spatial grids in terms of a specific urban function. The third stage is to leverage multi-attentions to model the zone-zone peer dependencies of the functionality projections to generate grid-level land-use configurations. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.
