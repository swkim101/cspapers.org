We present a holistic grasping controller, combining free-space position control and in-contact force-control for reliable grasping given uncertain object pose estimates. Employing tactile fingertip sensors, undesired object displacement during grasping is minimized by pausing the finger closing motion for individual joints on first contact until force-closure is established. While holding an object, the controller is compliant with external forces to avoid high internal object forces and prevent object damage. Gravity as an external force is explicitly considered and compensated for, thus preventing gravity-induced object drift. We evaluate the controller in two experiments on the TIAGo robot and its parallel-jaw gripper proving the effectiveness of the approach for robust grasping and minimizing object displacement. In a series of ablation studies, we demonstrate the utility of the individual controller components.
