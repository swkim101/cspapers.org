Information extraction systems often producehundreds to thousands of strings on a specifictopic. We present a method that facilitatesbetter consumption of these strings, in an ex-ploratory setting in which a user wants to bothget a broad overview of whatâ€™s available, and achance to dive deeper on some aspects. The sys-tem works by grouping similar items together,and arranging the remaining items into a hierar-chical navigable DAG structure. We apply themethod to medical information extraction.
