Event detection (ED) is a pivotal task for information retrieval, which aims at identifying event triggers and classifying them into pre-defined event types. In real-world applications, events are usually annotated with numerous fine-grained types, which often arises long-tail type nature and co-occurrence event nature. Existing studies explore the event correlations without full utilization, which may limit the capability of event detection. This paper simultaneously incorporates both the type-level and instance-level event correlations, and proposes a novel framework, termed as CorED. Specifically, we devise an adaptive graph-based type encoder to capture instance-level correlations, learning type representations not only from their training data but also from their relevant types, thus leading to more informative type representations especially for the low-resource types. Besides, we devise an instance interactive decoder to capture instance-level correlations, which predicts event instance types conditioned on the contextual typed event instances, leveraging co-occurrence events as remarkable evidence in prediction. We conduct experiments on two public benchmarks, MAVEN and ACE-2005 dataset. Empirical results demonstrate the unity of both type-level and instance-level correlations, and the model achieves effectiveness performance on both benchmarks.
