While manipulating rigid objects is an extensively explored research topic, deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation seems significantly underdeveloped. A potential reason for this is the inherent difficulty in describing and observing the state of the DLO as its geometry changes during manipulation. This paper proposes an algorithm for fast-tracking the shape of a DLO based on the masked image. Having no prior knowledge about the tracked object, the proposed method finds a reliable representation of the shape of the tracked object within tens of milliseconds. This algorithm's main idea is to first skeletonize the DLO mask image, walk through the parts of the DLO skeleton, arrange the segments into an ordered path, and finally fit a B-spline into it. Experiments show that our solution outperforms the State-of-the-Art approaches in DLO's shape reconstruction accuracy and algorithm running time and can handle challenging scenarios such as severe occlusions, self-intersections, and multiple DLOs in a single image.
