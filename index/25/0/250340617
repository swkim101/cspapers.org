1 In this paper, we extend the remarkable M-estimator of Catoni (2012) to situations where the variance is infinite. In particular, given a sequence of i.i.d random variables { X i } n i =1 from distribution D over R with mean µ , we only assume the existence of a known upper bound υ ε > 0 on the (1 + ε ) th central moment of the random variables, namely, for ε ∈ (0 , 1] The extension is non-trivial owing to the difficulty in characterizing the roots of certain polynomials of degree smaller than 2 . The proposed estimator has the same order of magnitude and the same asymptotic constant as in Catoni (2012), but for the case of bounded moments. We further propose a version of the estimator that does not require even the knowledge of υ ε , but adapts the moment bound in a data-driven manner. Finally, to illustrate the usefulness of the derived non-asymptotic confidence bounds, we consider an application in multi-armed bandits and propose best arm identification algorithms, in the fixed confidence setting, that outperform the state of the art.
