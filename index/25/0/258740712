Existing deep learning models for hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction achieve good performance but require powerful hardwares with enormous memory and computational resources. Consequently, these methods can hardly be deployed on resource-limited mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Network (BiSRNet), for efficient and practical HSI restoration from compressed measurement in snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems. Firstly, we redesign a compact and easy-to-deploy base model to be binarized. Then we present the basic unit, Binarized Spectral-Redistribution Convolution (BiSR-Conv). BiSR-Conv can adaptively redistribute the HSI representations before binarizing activation and uses a scalable hyperbolic tangent function to closer approximate the Sign function in backpropagation. Based on our BiSR-Conv, we customize four binarized convolutional modules to address the dimension mismatch and propagate full-precision information throughout the whole network. Finally, our BiSRNet is derived by using the proposed techniques to binarize the base model. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments manifest that our proposed BiSRNet outperforms state-of-the-art binarization methods and achieves comparable performance with full-precision algorithms.
