Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) have become a research hotspot recently due to its powerful ability in capturing users' dynamic preferences. The key idea behind SRSs is to model the sequential dependencies over the user-item interactions. However, we argue that users' preferences are not only determined by their view or purchase items but also affected by the item-providers with which users have interacted. For instance, in a short-video scenario, a user may click on a video because he/she is attracted to either the video content or simply the video-providers as the vloggers are his/her idols. Motivated by the above observations, in this paper, we propose IPSRec, a novel Item-Provider co-learning framework for Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, we propose two representation learning methods (single-steam and cross-stream) to learn comprehensive item and user representations based on the user's historical item sequence and provider sequence. Then, contrastive learning is employed to further enhance the user embeddings in a self-supervised manner, which treats the representations of a specific user learned from the item side as well as the item-provider side as the positive pair and treats the representations of different users in the batch as the negative samples. Extensive experiments on three real-world SRS datasets demonstrate that IPSRec achieves substantially better results than the strong competitors.
