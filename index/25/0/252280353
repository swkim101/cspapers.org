Time series classification is an important problem in real world. Due to its non-stationary property that the distribution changes over time, it remains challenging to build models for generalization to unseen distributions. In this paper, we propose to view the time series classification problem from the distribution perspective. We argue that the temporal complexity attributes to the unknown latent distributions within. To this end, we propose DIVERSIFY to learn generalized representations for time series classification. DIVERSIFY takes an iterative process: it first obtains the worst-case distribution scenario via adversarial training, then matches the distributions of the obtained sub-domains. We also present some theoretical insights. We conduct experiments on gesture recognition, speech commands recognition, wearable stress and affect detection, and sensor-based human activity recognition with a total of seven datasets in different settings. Results demonstrate that DIVERSIFY significantly outperforms other baselines and effectively characterizes the latent distributions by qualitative and quantitative analysis.
