This paper presents a coverage based control algorithm to coordinate a group of autonomous robots. Most of the solutions presented in the literature rely on an exact Voronoi partitioning, whose computation requires complete knowledge of the environment to be covered. This can be achieved only by robots with unlimited sensing capabilities, or through communication among robots in a limited sensing scenario. To overcome these limitations, we present a distributed control strategy to cover an unknown environment with a group of robots with limited sensing capabilities and in the absence of reliable communication. The control law is based on a limited Voronoi partitioning of the sensing area, and we demonstrate that the group of robots can optimally cover the environment using only information that is locally detected (without communication). The proposed method is validated by means of simulations and experiments carried out on a group of mobile robots.
