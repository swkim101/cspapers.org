Borrowing elementary ideas from solid mechanics and differential geometry, this presentation shows that the volume swept by a regular solid undergoing a wide class of volume-preserving deformations induces a rather natural metric structure with well-defined and computable geodesics on its configuration space. This general result applies to concrete classes of articulated objects such as robot manipulators, and we demonstrate as a proof of concept the computation of geodesic paths for a free flying rod and planar robotic arms as well as their use in path planning with many obstacles.
