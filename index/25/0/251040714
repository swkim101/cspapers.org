In this work, we study the problem of community detection in the stochastic block model with adversarial node corruptions. Our main result is an efficient algorithm that can tolerate an $\epsilon$-fraction of corruptions and achieves error $O(\epsilon)+e^{-\frac{C}{2}(1\pm o(1))}$ where $C=(\sqrt{a}-\sqrt{b})^{2}$ is the signal-to-noise ratio and $a/n$ and $b/n$ are the inter-community and intra-community connection probabilities respectively. These bounds essentially match the minimax rates for the SBM without corruptions. We also give robust algorithms for $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-synchronization. At the heart of our algorithm is a new semidefinite program that uses global information to robustly boost the accuracy of a rough clustering. Moreover, we show that our algorithms are doubly-robust in the sense that they work in an even more challenging noise model that mixes adversarial corruptions with unbounded monotone changes, from the semi-random model.
