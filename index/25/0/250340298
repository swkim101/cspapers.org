Finding relevant literature is crucial for biomedical research and in the practice of evidence-based medicine, making biomedical search an important application area within the field of information retrieval. This is recognised by the broader IR community, and in particular by the organisers of Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) as early as 2003. While TREC provides crucial evaluation resources, to get started in biomedical IR one needs to tackle an important software engineering hurdle of parsing, indexing, and deploying several large document collections. Moreover, many newcomers to the field often face a steep learning curve, where theoretical concepts are tangled up with technical aspects. Finally, many of the existing baselines and systems are difficult to reproduce. We aim to alleviate all three of these bottlenecks with the launch of A2A-API. It is a RESTful API which serves as an easy-to-use and programming-language-independent interface to existing biomedical TREC collections. It builds upon A2A, our system for biomedical information retrieval benchmarking, and extends it with additional functionalities. Apart from providing programmatic access to the features of the original A2A system - focused principally on benchmarking - A2A-API supports biomedical IR researchers in development of systems featuring reranking and query reformulation components. In this demonstration, we illustrate the capabilities of A2A-API with comprehensive use cases.
