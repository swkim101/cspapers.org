In the work, information technology for providing recommendations in emergency situations was developed, which helps the dispatcher of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine when talking to a person at the scene of an emergency, and also correctly determines recommendations for further actions in an emergency, while the brigade on duty heading to the scene of an emergency. An analysis of models and methods of providing recommendations in emergency situations was carried out. The types and classes of information technologies that solve the task of providing recommendations are defined. The combined application of fuzzy logic and expert systems in the process of providing recommendations in emergency situations is proposed. The design of software tools for providing recommendations based on the methodology of analysis and design of Structured analysis and design technique (SADT) systems has been completed. Software tools have been developed to determine the necessary key parameters by which each characteristic of an emergency situation is determined. In accordance with the tasks, the structural organization of the software product is proposed, the class diagram and the scheme of the algorithm of the program are developed and described. Software for providing recommendations in emergency situations has been developed, which improves the quality of providing recommendations in emergency situations due to the integration of technologies of expert systems and fuzzy logic. Software testing and analysis of information technology for providing recommendations in emergency situations was carried out. The work was carried out in accordance with the direction of scientific research of the Department of Computer Sciences of Vinnytsia National Technical University and the plan of scientific and educational and methodological work of the department.
