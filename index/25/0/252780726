We present a novel two-stage fully sparse convolutional 3D object detection framework, named CAGroup3D. Our proposed method first generates some high-quality 3D proposals by leveraging the class-aware local group strategy on the object surface voxels with the same semantic predictions, which considers semantic consistency and diverse locality abandoned in previous bottom-up approaches. Then, to recover the features of missed voxels due to incorrect voxel-wise segmentation, we build a fully sparse convolutional RoI pooling module to directly aggregate fine-grained spatial information from backbone for further proposal refinement. It is memory-and-computation efficient and can better encode the geometry-specific features of each 3D proposal. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance with remarkable gains of +\textit{3.6\%} on ScanNet V2 and +\textit{2.6}\% on SUN RGB-D in term of mAP@0.25.
