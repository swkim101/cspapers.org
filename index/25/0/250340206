Asking clarifying questions is an interactive way to effectively clarify user intent. When a user submits a query, the search engine will return a clarifying question with several clickable items of sub-intents for clarification. According to the existing definition, the key to asking high-quality questions is to generate good descriptions for submitted queries and provided items. However, existing methods mainly based on static knowledge bases are difficult to find descriptions for many queries because of the lack of entities within these queries and their corresponding items. For such a query, it is unable to generate an informative question. To alleviate this problem, we propose leveraging top search results of the query to help generate better descriptions because we deem that the top retrieved documents contain rich and relevant contexts of the query. Specifically, we first design a rule-based algorithm to extract description candidates from search results and rank them by various human-designed features. Then, we apply an learning-to-rank model and another generative model for generalization and further improve the quality of clarifying questions. Experimental results show that our proposed methods can generate more readable and informative questions compared with existing methods. The results prove that search results can be utilized to improve users' search experience for search clarification in conversational search systems.
