The Chiplet methodology can accelerate VLSI system development and provide better flexibility. However, it is not easy to build interconnection networks across multiple chiplets and maintain high-performance deadlock-free routing in systems of various hierarchical topologies. In particular, most on-chiplet networks are based on flat topologies such as 2D-mesh, which are inflexible and insufficient for large-scale multi-chiplet systems.To take full advantage of the multi-chiplet architecture and advanced packaging, we propose an interconnection method that can flexibly establish high-radix interconnection networks from typical 2D-mesh-NoC-based chiplets. A minus-first-based deadlock-free adaptive routing algorithm and a safe/unsafe flow control policy are introduced for these multi-chiplet interconnection networks. Additionally, a general approach network interleaving is used to balance the communication bandwidth within and between chiplets.We evaluate different architectures and traffic patterns on a cycle-accurate C++ simulator. Compared with traditional adaptive routing in 2D-mesh, our methodology can significantly improve network performance in various cases. The more chiplets there are, the more effective the method is. For 64 4×4-2D-mesh-based chiplets, The maximum injection rate increase is up to 2×, and the average latency reduction is up to 45%.
