The design of online policies for stochastic matching and revenue management settings is usually bound by the Bayesian prior that the demand process is formed by a fixed-length sequence of queries with unknown types, each drawn independently. This assumption of serial independence implies that the demand of each type, i.e., the number of queries of a given type, has low variance and is approximately Poisson-distributed. Thus, matching policies are often based on "fluid" LPs that only use the expectations of these distributions.
