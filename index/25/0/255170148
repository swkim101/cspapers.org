Walking with load is a common task in daily life and disaster rescue. Long-term load carriage may cause irreversible damage to the human body. Although remarkable progress has been made in the field of wearable robots, it is still far from avoiding interference to human legs, which will lead to energy consumption. In this paper, a novel wearable robot, Centaur, for assisting load carriage has been proposed. The Centaur system consists of two rigid robotic legs of two degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) to transfer load weight to the ground. Different from exoskeletons, the robotic legs of the Centaur are placed behind the human rather than attached to human limbs, which can provide a larger support polygon and avoid additional interference to the wearer. Additionally, the Centaur can attain the locomotion stability of the quadruped while maintaining the motion agility of the biped itself. This paper also presents an interactive motion control strategy based on the human-robot interaction force. This control strategy incorporates legged robotics walking controller and real-time walking trajectory planning to realize the cooperative walking with human beings. Finally, experiments of human walking with load carriage have been conducted on flat terrain to verify the concept of the Centaur system. The result demonstrates that the Centaur system can effectively reduce 70.03% of load weight during the single stance phase, which indicates that the Centaur system provides a new solution for assisting human walking with load-carriage.
