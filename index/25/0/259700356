In this paper, circular cross-section microchannels with 3-D lattice arrangements are designed and fabricated using the Mosquito method in order to construct on-off valves. The 3-D microchannels with on-off valves consist of two types of lines: the flow lines for chemical liquid flow and the control lines to activate the valves. We confirmed that both a circular cross-section and a PDMS with low elastic modulus used as the microchannel material contribute to a valve that can be closed with a lower pressure. Then, we demonstrated liquid flow to evaluate the functionality of the valve. Fluorescein solution was flown into a flow line. We found that the fluorescence intensity decreases at the intersection between the flow and control lines when the flow line is closed by the inflation of the control line, experimentally confirming the functionality of the valve microchannels fabricated via the Mosquito method.
