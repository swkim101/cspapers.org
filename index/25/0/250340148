Limited by the statistical-based machine learning framework, a spurious correlation is likely to appear in existing knowledge-aware recommendation methods. It refers to a knowledge fact that appears causal to the user behaviors (inferred by the recommender) but is not in fact. For tackling this issue, we present a novel approach to discovering and alleviating the potential spurious correlations from a counterfactual perspective. To be specific, our approach consists of two counterfactual generators and a recommender. The counterfactual generators are designed to generate counterfactual interactions via reinforcement learning, while the recommender is implemented with two different graph neural networks to aggregate the information from KG and user-item interactions respectively. The counterfactual generators and recommender are integrated in a mutually collaborative way. With this approach, the recommender helps the counterfactual generators better identify potential spurious correlations and generate high-quality counterfactual interactions, while the counterfactual generators help the recommender weaken the influence of the potential spurious correlations simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing it with a number of competitive baselines.
