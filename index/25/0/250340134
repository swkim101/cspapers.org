Explicit feedback---user input regarding their interest in an item---is the most helpful information for recommendation as it comes directly from the user and shows their direct interest in the item. Most approaches either treat the recommendation given such feedback as a typical regression problem or regard such data as implicit and then directly adopt approaches for implicit feedback; both methods, however,tend to yield unsatisfactory performance in top-k recommendation. In this paper, we propose interaction-level preference ranking(IPR), a novel pairwise ranking embedding learning approach to better utilize explicit feedback for recommendation. Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets show that IPR yields the best results compared to six strong baselines.
