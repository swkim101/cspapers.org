Database management systems (DBMSs) are critical components of modern data-intensive applications. Developers have adopted many testing techniques to detect DBMS bugs such as crashes and assertion failures. However, most previous efforts cannot detect logical bugs that make the DBMS return incorrect results. Recent work proposed several oracles to identify incorrect results, but they rely on rule-based expression generation to synthesize queries without any guidance. In this paper, we propose to combine coverage-based guidance, validity-oriented mutations and oracles to detect logical bugs in DBMS systems. Specifically, we first design a set of general APIs to decouple the logic of fuzzers and oracles, so that developers can easily port fuzzing tools to test DBMSs and write new oracles for existing fuzzers. Then, we provide validity-oriented mutations to generate high-quality query statements in order to find more logical bugs. Our prototype, SQLRight , outperforms existing tools that only rely on oracles or code coverage. In total, SQLRight detects 18 logical bugs from two well-tested DBMSs, SQLite and MySQL . All bugs have been confirmed and 14 of them have been fixed. Abstract This artifact is to help users reproduce the results we reported in our USENIX Security 2022 paper submission. We recom-mend to run the artifact on a x86-64 computer with ≥ 20 CPU cores, ≥ 600 GB of memory and ≥ 1 . 5 TB hard drive storage, and with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS operating system. The artifact should reproduce all the Figures and Tables we reported in the paper, and thus can validate the main claims of the paper. Detailed execution steps are elaborated in the artifact README.md ﬁle.
