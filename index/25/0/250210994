Information retrieval has traditionally been framed in terms of searching and extracting information from mostly static resources. Interactive information retrieval (IIR) has widened the scope, with interactive dialogues largely playing the role of clarifying (i.e., making explicit, and/or refining) the information search space. Informed by market research practices, we seek to reframe IIR as a process of eliciting novel information from human interlocutors, with a chatbot-inspired virtual agent playing the role of an interviewer. This reframing flips conventional IIR into what we call an inverse information seeking dialogue, wherein the virtual agent recurrently extracts information from human utterances and poses questions intended to elicit related information. In this work, we introduce and provide a formal definition of an inverse information seeking agent, outline some of its unique challenges, and propose our novel framework to tackle this problem based on techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and IIR.
