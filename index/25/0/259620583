With the increase of multi-view graph data, multi-view graph clustering (MVGC) that can discover the hidden clusters without label supervision has attracted growing attention from researchers. Existing MVGC methods are often sensitive to the given graphs, especially influenced by the low quality graphs, i.e., they tend to be limited by the homophily assumption. However, the widespread real-world data hardly satisfy the homophily assumption. This gap limits the performance of existing MVGC methods on low homophilous graphs. To mitigate this limitation, our motivation is to extract high-level view-common information which is used to refine each view's graph, and reduce the influence of non-homophilous edges. To this end, we propose dual label-guided graph refinement for multi-view graph clustering (DuaLGR), to alleviate the vulnerability in facing low homophilous graphs. Specifically, DuaLGR consists of two modules named dual label-guided graph refinement module and graph encoder module. The first module is designed to extract the soft label from node features and graphs, and then learn a refinement matrix. In cooperation with the pseudo label from the second module, these graphs are refined and aggregated adaptively with different orders. Subsequently, a consensus graph can be generated in the guidance of the pseudo label. Finally, the graph encoder module encodes the consensus graph along with node features to produce the high-level pseudo label for iteratively clustering. The experimental results show the superior performance on coping with low homophilous graph data. The source code for DuaLGR is available at https://github.com/YwL-zhufeng/DuaLGR.
