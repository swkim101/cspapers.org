Depth estimation and semantic edge detection are two key tasks in computer vision, which have made great progress. To date, how to associatively predict the depth and the semantic edge is rarely explored. In this work, we first propose a flexible two-branch framework that can make the two tasks take advantage of each other, achieving a win-win situation. Specifically, for the semantic edge detection branch, an Enhanced Edge Weighting strategy (EEW) is designed, which learns weight information from the by-product of depth branch, depth edge, to enhance edge perception in features. Meanwhile, we make depth estimation benefit from semantic edge detection through introducing Depth Edge Semantic Classification module (DESC). Furthermore, a double reconstruction (D-reconstruction) approach is presented, together with semantic edge-guided disparity smoothing loss to mitigate the ambiguities of the self-supervised manner for depth estimation. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art method in depth estimation along with a significant improvement in semantic edge detection.
