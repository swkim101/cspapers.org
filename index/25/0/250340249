In few-shot relational triple extraction (FS-RTE), one seeks to extract relational triples from plain texts by utilizing only few annotated samples. Recent work first extracts all entities and then classifies their relations. Such an entity-then-relation paradigm ignores the entity discrepancy between relations. To address it, we propose a novel task decomposition strategy, Relation-then-Entity, for FS-RTE. It first detects relations occurred in a sentence and then extracts the corresponding head/tail entities of the detected relations. To instantiate this strategy, we further propose a model, RelATE, which builds a dual-level attention to aggregate relation-relevant information to detect the relation occurrence and utilizes the annotated samples of the detected relations to extract the corresponding head/tail entities. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous work by an absolute gain (18.98%, 28.85% in F1 in two few-shot settings).
