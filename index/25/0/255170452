Within the context of Robotic Minimally Invasive Surgery (R-MIS), we propose a novel linear model predictive controller formulation for the coordination of multiple autonomous robotic arms. The controller is synthesized by formulating a linear approximation of non-linear constraints, which allows the controller to be both computationally faster and better performing due to the increased prediction horizon allowed within the real-time control requirements for the proposed surgical application. The solution is validated under the expected constraints of a surgical scenario in which multiple laparoscopic tools must move and coordinate in a shared environment.
