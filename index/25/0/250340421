As an emerging paradigm, session-based recommendation is aimed at recommending the next item based on a set of anonymous sessions. Effectively representing a session that is normally a short interaction sequence renders a major technical challenge. In view of the limitations of pioneering studies that explore collaborative information from other sessions, in this paper we propose a new direction to enhance session representations by learning multi-faceted session-independent global item relations. In particular, we identify three types of advantageous global item relations, including negative relations that have not been studied before, and propose different graph construction methods to capture such relations. We then devise a novel multi-faceted global item relation (MGIR) model to encode different relations using different aggregation layers and generate enhanced session representations by fusing positive and negative relations. Our solution is flexible to accommodate new item relations and can easily integrate existing session representation learning methods to generate better representations from global relation enhanced session information. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over a large number of state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, we show that learning negative relations is critical for session-based recommendation.
