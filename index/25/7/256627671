OPORP is a variant of the count-sketch data structure by using a fixed-length binning scheme and a normalization step for the estimation. In our experience, we find engineers like the name "one permutation + one random projection" as it tells the exact steps. Consider two vectors (e.g., embeddings): u, v ? R D with p = cos(u, v). In embedding-based applications (e.g., EBR), D = 256 - 4096 are common. With OPORP, we first apply a permutation on the data vectors. A vector r ∈ R D is generated i.i.d. with E(i) = 0, E(r 2 i ) = 1, E(r 3 i ) = 0, E(r4 i ) = s, where s ≥ 1. We multiply (as Hadamard product) r with all permuted data vectors. Then we break the D columns into k equal-length bins and aggregate (i.e., sum) the values in each bin to obtain k samples from each data vector. One crucial step is to normalize the k samples to the unit l2 norm. We show that the estimation variance equals:(s - 1)A + D-k/D-1 1/k [(1-p2)2 -2A ] , A ≥ 0, s ≥ 1, which reveals several key properties of the proposed scheme: We need s = 1, otherwise the variance would have a term which does not decrease with increasing sample size k. The factor d-k/d-1 is beneficial in reducing variances, especially for short vectors which are common in embeddings. The term (1-p2)2 is a drastic variance reduction compared to (1+p 2 ) which is the variance term without normalization. Moreover, the technique in our work also substantially improves the "very sparse random projections" (VSRP) in kDD'06. Another major use of OPORP will be in differential privacy (DP).
