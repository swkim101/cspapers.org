Today, disinformation (i.e. deliberate misinformation) is omnipresent in all web communication channels. There is a developing explosion in this socially disruptive mode of web-based information. Increasingly, we have seen various countries developing advanced methods to spread their targeted disinformation. To address this flood of disinformation will require refined strategies to capture and evaluate the messages. In this paper, we present both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis of online social and information networks to better evaluate the characteristics of the disinformation campaigns. We focus on the case of Russian-generated disinformation, which has been developed to an elevated level. We demonstrate an effective approach based on a new dataset to study the Russian campaign composed of 14497 cases of dis-information and the corresponding counter-dis-information. Although this case is of high current relevance, there is very limited published evaluation. We provide a novel analysis and present a methodology to characterize this disinformation. We based our investigation on a Spherical k-means algorithm to determine the main topics of the disinformation and to discover the key trends. We employ distilBERT algorithm and achieve a high accuracy F1-score of 98.8 demonstrating good quantitative capabilities. We propose the methodology as a template for further exploration and analysis.
