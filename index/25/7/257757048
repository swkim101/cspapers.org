Unlike most previous HOI methods that focus on learning better human-object features, we propose a novel and complementary approach called category query learning. Such queries are explicitly associated to interaction categories, converted to image specific category representation via a transformer decoder, and learnt via an auxiliary image-level classification task. This idea is motivated by an earlier multi-label image classification method, but is for the first time applied for the challenging human-object interaction classification task. Our method is simple, general and effective. It is validated on three representative HOI baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks.
