 Topology optimization has been widely used for optimizing designs in the automobile industry. The primary goal of topology optimization in automotive body structures is to reduce the vehicle weight while continuing to meet strength and stiffness requirements for different type of loading cases. In designing an automotive component, the presence of styling surfaces drive the post-processing of the optimized results into manufacturable designs. However, in a more generalized case where there is a lack of such a reference model, the cleaning up, and manufacturing of, an optimized design may become challenging. Additionally, the applicability of manufacturing constraints to the topology domain may not always be possible. The only possible manufacturing constraints, in such a case, have to be applied to the whole domain instead of individual components. This paper focuses on development of a set of methods that automate the process of generating a design boundary that would assist in providing constraints to designers when converting the optimized design into a manufacturable one. Additionally, the design boundary can be processed further to divide the design into regions based on hollow or non-hollow components allowing for manufacturing the final design using multiple manufacturing processes. The methods have been described using a triangular rotor as an example.
