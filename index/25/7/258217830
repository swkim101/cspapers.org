In this paper we present LYDSPOR; a site-specific sound experience, created in Elsinore, Denmark, consisting of two physical installations and an app-based soundwalk, which together allow people to feel and sense in their bodies certain narrative fragments of the history of the city. LYDSPOR is the result of a 1,5 year-long research project which had the aim of adopting soma design methods by drawing on affective interaction design and on an understanding of bodies as always multiple, relational, and never only human. Through an analysis of the design process and its outcome, the paper contributes an in-depth understanding of how to combine somatic and affective design approaches when creating site-specific sonic augmentations for historical dissemination in public space.
