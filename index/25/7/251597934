1 WORKSHOP OBJECTIVES Due to the exponential growth in the number of scientific articles published in the biomedical domain, obtaining the most relevant articles to a topic of interest, extracting biomedical information from texts, integrating different parts of knowledge from various studies, and finding reliable and scientifically sound studies present significant challenges. While traditional term-based information analysis and machine learning techniques can be employed for literature search, information extraction, and information integration, such approaches lack an effective mechanism for analysing scientific articles based on their semantics, which is often ambiguous and contextual. Knowledge representation and Semantics-enabled techniques have already shown the potential to systematically curate, organize, retrieve and interpret content in ways that relates well to human understanding. The recent major collaborative effort for rapid and effective retrieval and analysis of literature around COVID-19 is a strong indication for the need to develop effective techniques specifically tailored for the biomedical domain. The Allen Institute for AI in collaboration with major institutes such as Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Microsoft Research, and the National Institutes of Healthâ€™s National Library of Medicine, among others, shared the COVID-19 Open shared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, known as CORD-19, which consists of more than 50,000 scientific articles about the virus known as SARS-CoV-2. One of the objectives behind the release of
