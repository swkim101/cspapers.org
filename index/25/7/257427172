In this paper, we present a simple yet effective semi-supervised 3D object detector named DDS3D. Our main contributions have two-fold. On the one hand, different from previous works using Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) or its variants for obtaining the sparse pseudo labels, we propose a dense pseudo-label generation strategy to get dense pseudo-labels, which can retain more potential supervision information for the student network. On the other hand, instead of traditional fixed thresholds, we propose a dynamic threshold manner to generate pseudo-labels, which can guarantee the quality and quantity of pseudo-labels during the whole training process. Benefiting from these two components, our DDS3D outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised 3d object detection with mAP of 3.1% on the pedestrian and 2.1% on the cyclist under the same configuration of 1% samples. Extensive ablation studies on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our DDS3D. The code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/hust-jy/DDS3D
