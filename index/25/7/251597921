In this paper, we provide an overview of financial technology (FinTech) innovation based on our experience of organizing multiple FinTech-related events since 2018, including the FinNLP workshop series, FinWeb workshop series, and FinNum shared task series. These event series aim to provide a forum for blending the research of FinTech and artificial intelligence (AI), and further accelerating the development in the FinTech domain. We hope that with the researchersâ€™ sharing in these events, the challenging problems will be identified, and the future research direction will be shaped. Both the development of the technology and the trend of the focused topics in the past four years are discussed in this paper. We also propose a research agenda with the plan of our FinTech-related events.
