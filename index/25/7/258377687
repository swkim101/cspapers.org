SocialNLP is an inter-disciplinary area of natural language processing (NLP) and social computing. SocialNLP has three directions: (1) addressing issues in social computing using NLP techniques; (2) solving NLP problems using information from social networks or social media; and (3) handling new problems related to both social computing and natural language processing. The 11th SocialNLP workshop is held at TheWebConf 2023. We accepted nine papers with acceptance ratio 56%. We sincerely thank to all authors, program committee members, and workshop chairs, for their great contributions and help in this edition of SocialNLP workshop.
