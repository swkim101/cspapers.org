Domain generalization (DG) tends to alleviate the poor generalization capability of deep neural networks by learning model with multiple source domains. A classical solution to DG is domain augmentation, the common belief of which is that diversifying source domains will be conducive to the out-of-distribution generalization. However, these claims are understood intuitively, rather than mathematically. Our explorations empirically reveal that the correlation between model generalization and the diversity of domains may be not strictly positive, which limits the effectiveness of domain augmentation. This work therefore aim to guarantee and further enhance the validity of this strand. To this end, we propose a new perspective on DG that recasts it as a convex game between domains. We first encourage each diversified domain to enhance model generalization by elaborately designing a regularization term based on supermodularity. Meanwhile, a sample filter is constructed to eliminate low-quality samples, thereby avoiding the impact of potentially harmful information. Our framework presents a new avenue for the formal analysis of DG, heuristic analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness.11Code is available at “https://github.com/BIT-DA/DCG”.
