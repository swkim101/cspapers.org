We introduce MediSage, an AI decision support assistant for medical professionals and caregivers that simplifies the way in which they interact with different modalities of electronic health records (EHRs) through a conversational interface. It provides step-by-step reasoning support to an end-user to summarize patient health, predict patient outcomes and provide comprehensive and personalized healthcare recommendations. MediSage provides these reasoning capabilities by using a knowledge graph that combines general purpose clinical knowledge resources with recent-most information from the EHR data. By combining the structured representation of knowledge with the predictive power of neural models trained over both EHR and knowledge graph data, MediSage brings explainability by construction and represents a stepping stone into the future through further integration with biomedical language models.
