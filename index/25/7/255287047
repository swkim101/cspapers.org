An indirect method for assessing the identity of power unit operating cycles is proposed. The frequency-modulated signal of the speed of rotation of the crankshaft is chosen as a source of input information. With the use of nozzles that have piezoelectric control means, the conceptual principles of software movements of hardware devices to ensure the identity of work cycles have been developed. Direct digital control and feedback control methods are used to design the hardware architecture. The torque of an individual cylinder was approximated on the basis of the Fourier transform taking into account the sequence of their work. A mechanical system with four degrees of freedom is proposed as a deterministic mathematical model of the torque circuit of the power unit. The movements of the masses of the model are described by a system of differential equations, provided that friction is taken into account. The parameters of the system are normalized and the Laplace transform under zero initial conditions is used for its solution. The information links between the torques and the measurement information signal were established using the method of determinants and the theory of signal graphs. It was found that these methods give almost identical calculation results. Algorithmic support for assessing the identity of work cycles is built on the solution of a redefined system of algebraic equations with optimization of the result based on the method of least squares. The Monte Carlo method was used as a mathematical tool for the computer simulation of random disturbances. Computer modeling of the effects of interference on the measurement information signal and on the phase delays of individual cylinders established the requirements for the metrological characteristics of the hardware
