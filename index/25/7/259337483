The on-ground validation of orbital manipulators is a challenging task because the robot is designed for a gravity-free operational environment, but it is validated under the effect of gravity. As a consequence, joint torque limits can be easily reached in certain configurations when gravity is actively compensated by the joints. Hence, the workspace for on-ground testing is restricted. In this paper, an optimal strategy is proposed for achieving gravity compensation of an orbital manipulator arm on ground. The strategy minimizes the joint torques acting on the manipulator by solving an optimization problem and it computes the necessary forces to be tracked by an external carrier. Hence, full gravity compensation is achieved for the orbital manipulator. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the method on the DLR CAESAR space robot, which uses a cable suspended system as external carrier to track the desired gravity compensation force, resulting from the proposed method.
