Voice plays a crucial role in our daily lives, enabling communication, conveying emotions, and indicating our health. As a result, tracking vocal interactions can provide valuable insights into various aspects of our lives. This poster presents our preliminary work for a novel voice tracker (VoCopilot) that effectively tracks various vocal interactions. For example, the VoCopilot tracker can help document meetings and generate notes, even when participants speak different languages. Additionally, it can serve as a life-logger, monitoring daily conversations and extracting key points to summarize their content. Central to VoCopilot's design is an energy-efficient, co-developed acoustic hardware and firmware combined with a comprehensive integration of VoCopilot tracker with advanced machine learning systems. This harmonious integration ensures precise voice transcription, summarization, and analysis. We present our early thoughts on VoCopilot hardware design and share early results of utilizing Whisper for efficient multilingual transcribing. We acknowledge VoCopilot may raise privacy issues; therefore, we provide early thoughts to address these concerns.
