Communicating ontologies to potential users is still a difficult and time-consuming task. Even for small ones, users need to invest time to determine whether to reuse them. Providing diagrams together with the ontologies facilitates the task of understanding the model from a user perspective. While some tools are available for depicting ontologies, and the code could also be inspected using ontology editorsâ€™ graphical interfaces, in many cases, the diagrams are too big or complex. The main objective of this demo is to present Devos, a system to generate ontology diagrams based on different strategies for summarizing the ontology.
