This article introduces Metadatamatic, an open-source, online, user-friendly tool for generating the description of a knowledge base. It supports the description of any RDF dataset via a user-friendly web form that does not require prior knowledge of the vocabularies begin used, and can enrich the description with automatically generated statistics if the dataset is accessible from a public SPARQL endpoint. We discuss the models and methods behind the tool, and present some initial results suggesting that Metadatamatic can help in increasing the visibility of public knowledge bases.
