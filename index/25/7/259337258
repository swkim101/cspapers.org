The 3D reconstruction of patient specific bone models plays a crucial role in orthopaedic surgery for clinical evaluation, surgical planning and precise implant design or selection. This paper considers the problem of reconstructing a patient-specific 3D tibia and fibula model from only two 2D X-ray images and one 3D general model segmented from the lower leg CT scans of one randomly selected patient. Currently, the bone 3D reconstruction mainly relies on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning-based mode segmentation which result in high radiation exposure or expensive costs. While, the proposed algorithm can accurately and efficiently deform a 3D general model to achieve a patient-specific 3D model that matches the patient's tibia and fibula projections in two 2D X-rays. The algorithm undergoes a preliminary deformation, 2D contour registration, and opti-misation based on the deformation graph that represents the shape deformation of models. Evaluations using simulations, cadaver and in-vivo experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reconstruct the patient's 3D tibia and fibula surface model with high accuracy.
