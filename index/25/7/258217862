Automatic layout optimisation allows users to arrange augmented reality content in the real-world environment without the need for tedious manual interactions. This optimisation is often based on modelling the intended content placement as constraints, defined as cost functions. Then, applying a cost minimization algorithm leads to a desirable placement. However, such an approach is limited by the lack of user control over the optimisation results. In this paper we explore the concept of user-driven constraints for augmented reality layout optimisation. With our approach users can define and set up their own constraints directly within the real-world environment. We first present a design space composed of three dimensions: the constraints, the regions of interest and the constraint parameters. Then we explore which input gestures can be employed to define the user-driven constraints of our design space through a user elicitation study. Using the results of the study, we propose a holistic system design and implementation demonstrating our user-driven constraints, which we evaluate in a final user study where participants had to create several constraints at the same time to arrange a set of virtual contents.
