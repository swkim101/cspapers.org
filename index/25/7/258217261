The HCI research community has long centered ethics in HCI research and practice. This interest has persisted as scholars highlight the need for more situated understandings and deeper integration of ethics into HCI. In parallel, HCI scholars and students have become increasingly involved in teaching computing ethics across many different university contexts, bringing in valuable perspectives informed by the connections between HCI and the socio-technical subject matter of computing ethics. Yet explicitly bringing these two threads together – examining the teaching of ethics through an HCI research lens – remains nascent. This paper integrates work in HCI and computing education to focus on the role and experience of computing ethics teaching assistants (CETAs), who are increasingly involved in ethics instruction and whose perspectives are predominantly missing in existing literature spanning HCI and computing education. Drawing on HCI theories and methods, our qualitative study of eleven CETAs at two American universities makes three contributions to the HCI literature. First, we build an understanding of who these TAs are with respect to the unique position of teaching computing ethics. Second, we characterize how CETAs’ teaching and learning is situated and shaped within different communities and institutional contexts. Finally, we suggest several implications for the design of ethics instruction within undergraduate computing programs. More broadly, our work can be viewed as a call to action, encouraging HCI scholars to play a more significant role in studying and designing the teaching and learning of computing ethics.
