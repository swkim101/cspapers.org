With most digital devices, vibrotactile feedback consists of rhythmic patterns of continuous vibration. In contrast, when interacting with physical objects, we experience many of their material properties through vibration which is not continuous, but dynamically coupled to our actions. We assume the first style of vibration to lead to hermeneutic mediation, while the second style leads to embodied mediation. What if both types of mediation could be used to design tactile symbols? To investigate this, five haptic experts designed tactile symbols using continuous and motion-coupled vibration. Experts were interviewed to understand their symbols and design approach. A thematic analysis revealed themes showing that lived experience and affective qualities shaped design choices, that experts optimized for passive or active symbols, and that they considered context as part of the design. Our study suggests that adding embodied experiences as a design resource changes how participants think of tactile symbol design, thus broadening the scope of the symbol by design for context, and expanding their affective repertoire as changing the type of vibration influences perceived valence and arousal.
