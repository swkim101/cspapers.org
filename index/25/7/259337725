Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are well-adapted to large workspaces since they replace rigid links by cables. However, they lack in positioning accuracy and new control methods are necessary to achieve profile-following tasks. This paper presents a control scheme designed for these tasks, relying on a combination of accurate boarded distance sensors and of a less accurate remote camera. The profile-following task is divided into two subtasks that are partially conflicting: maintaining a parallel orientation and a constant distance with the surface to follow, and following a trajectory between two points on the surface. The data fusion to solve the redundancy is based on the Gradient Projection Method. This control scheme is validated experimentally on a CDPR prototype and shown to provide the expected behaviour.
