We have developed a conversational assistant called the Decision Assistant (DA) to help customers make purchase decisions. To answer customer queries successfully, we use a question and answering (QnA) system that retrieves data on product pages and extracts answers. With various data sources available on the product pages, we deal with unique challenges such as different terminologies and data formats for successful answer retrieval. In this paper, we propose two different bi-encoder architectures for retrieving data from each of the two data sources considered â€“ product descriptions and specifications. The proposed architectures beat the baseline approaches while maintaining a high recall and low latency in production. We envision that the proposed approaches can be widely applicable to other e-commerce QnA systems.
