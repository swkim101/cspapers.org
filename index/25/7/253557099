Recent years have witnessed the growing demand for more wireless connectivity and services. This has posed a big challenge for antenna engineers, which is to design wide-band or multiband antennas with very small footprint. The paradox of achieving wide-band operation while retaining a compact antenna size appears difficult to resolve. This talk takes a careful look at this contradicting challenge and proposes several strategies to address the difficulty. First, we review the fundamental concepts for achieving antenna's wide-band operation. We then introduce techniques for effectively miniaturizing an antenna's size while maintaining its wide-band operation. After that, a number of practical examples are presented to demonstrate the design of compact and yet wide-band antennas.
