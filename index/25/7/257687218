Recently, Visual Information Extraction (VIE) has been becoming increasingly important in both the academia and industry, due to the wide range of real-world applications. Previously, numerous works have been proposed to tackle this problem. However, the benchmarks used to assess these methods are relatively plain, i.e., scenarios with real-world complexity are not fully represented in these benchmarks. As the first contribution of this work, we curate and release a new dataset for VIE, in which the document images are much more challenging in that they are taken from real applications, and difficulties such as blur, partial occlusion, and printing shift are quite common. All these factors may lead to failures in information extraction. Therefore, as the second contribution, we explore an alternative approach to precisely and robustly extract key information from document images under such tough conditions. Specifically, in contrast to previous methods, which usually either incorporate visual information into a multi-modal architecture or train text spotting and information extraction in an end-to-end fashion, we explicitly model entities as semantic points, i.e., center points of entities are enriched with semantic information describing the attributes and relationships of different entities, which could largely benefit entity labeling and linking. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks in this field as well as the proposed dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly enhanced performance on entity labeling and linking, compared with previous state-of-the-art models.
