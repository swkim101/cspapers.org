In recent years, the use of bicycle as a healthy and economical means of transportation has been promoted worldwide. In addition, with the increase in bicycle commuting due to the COVID-19, the use of bicycles are attracting attention as a last-mile means of transportation in Mobility as a Service(MaaS). To help ensure a safe and comfortable ride using a smartphone mounted on a bicycle, this study focuses on analyzing facial expressions while riding to determine potential comfort along the route with the surrounding environment and to provide a map that users can explicitly feedback(FB) after riding. Combining the emotions of facial expressions while riding and FB, we annotate comfort to different locations. Afterwards, we verify the relationship between locations with high level of comfort based on the acquired data and the surrounding environment of those locations using Google Street View(GSV).
