During physical human robot collaboration, it is important to be able to implement a time-varying interactive behaviour while ensuring robust stability. Admittance control and passivity theory can be exploited for achieving these objectives. Nevertheless, when the admittance dynamics is time-varying, it can happen that, for ensuring a passive and stable behaviour, some spurious dissipative effects have to be introduced in the admittance dynamics. These effects are perceived by the user and degrade the collaborative performance. In this paper we exploit the task redundancy of the manipulator in order to harvest energy in the null space and to avoid spurious dynamics on the admittance. The proposed architecture is validated by simulations and by experiments onto a collaborative robot.
