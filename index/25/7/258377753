The widespread use of social media for expressing personal thoughts and emotions makes it a valuable resource for identifying individuals at risk of suicide. Existing sequential learning-based methods have shown promising results. However, these methods may fail to capture global features. Due to its inherent ability to learn interconnected data, graph-based methods can address this gap. In this paper, we present a new graph-based hierarchical attention network (GHAN) that uses a graph convolutional neural network with an ordinal loss to improve suicide risk identification on social media. Specifically, GHAN first captures global features by constructing three graphs to capture semantic, syntactic, and sequential contextual information. Then encoded textual features are fed to attentive transformersâ€™ encoder and optimized to factor in the increasing suicide risk levels using an ordinal classification layer hierarchically for suicide risk detection. Experimental results show that the proposed GHAN outperformed state-of-the-art methods on a public Reddit dataset.
