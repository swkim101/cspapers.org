, a training method that uses the estimated value function of a policy trained from expert demonstrations to guide exploration for a second reinforcement learning agent. We have shown that this algorithm outperforms several distillation baselines that incorporate both environmental reward and expert demonstrations on a set of challenging minigrid and vizdoom environments.
