In this poster, we present the Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) that we designed, built, and tested. At first, the RIS technology is briefly discussed, subsequently, our prototype details are explained, and finally, we conclude by showing the obtained test results. Our RIS design comprises arrays of patch antennas, delay lines, and programmable radio-frequency (RF) switches that enable almost-passive 3D beamforming, i.e., without active RF components.
