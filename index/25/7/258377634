Identifying the fraud risk of applications on the web platform is a critical challenge with both requirements of effectiveness and interpretability. In these high-stakes web applications especially in financial scenarios, decision rules have been extensively used due to the rising requirements for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). In this work, we develop a rule learning framework with rule mining and rule refining modules for addressing the learning efficiency and class imbalance issues while making the decision rules more broadly and simply applicable to risk management scenarios. On four benchmark data-sets and two large-scale data-sets, the classification performance, interpretability, and scalability of the framework have been proved, achieving at least a 26.2% relative improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The system is currently being used by hundreds of millions of users and dealing with an enormous number of transactions in Ant Group, which is one of the largest mobile payment platforms in the world.
