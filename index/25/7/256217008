By means of computational fluid dynamics, studies have been made of the effect of injected decomposition products temperature on the flow rate coefficient of recessed nozzle. The analysis was carried out in accordance with calculation of injected decomposition products intensity into the main flow with a change in heat flow along the path of nozzle inlet section. The drop in the total (stagnation) parameters along the length of nozzle inlet section and change in the flow rate coefficient depending on the injected gas parameters are shown.
