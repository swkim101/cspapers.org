Speechreading is the art of using visual and contextual cues in the environment to support listening. Often used by d/Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (d/DHH) individuals, it highlights nuances of rich communication. However, lived experiences of speechreaders are underdocumented in HCI literature, and the impact of online environments and interactions of captioning with speechreading has not been explored in depth. We bridge these gaps through a three-part study consisting of formative interviews, design probes, and design sessions with 12 d/DHH individuals who speechread. Our primary contribution is to understand the lived experience of speechreading in online communication, and thus to better understand the richness and variety of techniques d/DHH individuals use to provision access. We highlight technical, environmental and sociocultural factors that impact communication accessibility, explore the design space of speechreading supports and share considerations for the design future of speechreading technology.
