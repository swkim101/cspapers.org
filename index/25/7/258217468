Many tools are designed to support users in maintaining or developing strong time management practices. Abandonment of these specialized tools is common, in favor of returning to a more general-purpose unstructured tool. How can designs leverage the familiarity of general-purpose tools and the advantages of specialized ones? We explore if applying a time-management-specific understanding of conventions and interactions within unstructured plaintext can be a successful approach to designing support for these tasks. We report the results of two field deployments (combined n=29) of “Plan” - a mobile application with a notes-application-based interface designed to support the practice of Time Management Planning. We show that modest, domain-specific modifications of general-purpose designs can facilitate users’ pre-existing workflows and nudge them towards better practices while leaving interfaces familiar and flexible. However, those with minimal planning experience desired additional structure.
