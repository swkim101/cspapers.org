Aspect-based summarization of a legal case file related to regulating bodies allows different stakeholders to consume information of interest therein efficiently. In this paper, we propose a multi-step process to achieve the same. First, we explore the semantic sentence segmentation of SEBI case files via classification. We also propose a dataset of Indian legal adjudicating orders which contain tags from carefully crafted domain-specific sentence categories with the help of legal experts. We experiment with various machine learning and deep learning methods for this multi-class classification. Then, we examine the performance of numerous summarization methods on the segmented document to generate persona-specific summaries. Finally, we develop a pipeline making use of the best methods in both sub-tasks to achieve high recall.
