The TempWeb workshop series has a long-standing tradition as a co-located event at The Web Conference. Its main objectives are to provide a venue for researchers of all domains (IE/IR, Web mining, etc.) where the temporal dimension opens an entirely new range of challenges and possibilities. For this, research published at TempWeb covers (and has covered in its previous editions) the full spectrum of longitudinal studies using web content. This ranges from “low-level” network analysis (e.g., Internet traffic) and graph analysis (e.g., in social media) up to “high-level” content and concept analysis ranging from micro-content (e.g., tweets) up to entire web archives. As such, TempWeb has become a potential object of longitudinal studies on its own. Aiming at the investigation of infrastructures, scalable methods, and innovative software for aggregating, querying, and analyzing heterogeneous data at Web scale, TempWeb has developed as a forum for a community from science and industry. Since longitudinal aspects in web content analysis is becoming more and more relevant for analysts from various domains, the studies, tools, and demonstrations are not only relevant for computer science, but also potentially interesting for sociology, marketing, environmental studies, politics, etc. Keeping up with its “tradition”, the current edition covers again the full spectrum of temporal Web analytics at various levels of granularity.
