Developing semantically-aware web services requires comprehensive and accurate ontologies. Evaluating an existing ontology or adapting it is a labor-intensive and complex task for which no automated tools exist. Nevertheless, in this paper we propose a tool that aims at making this vision come true, i.e., we present a tool for the automated evaluation of ontologies that allows one to rapidly assess an ontology’s coverage of a domain and identify specific problems in the ontology’s structure. The tool evaluates the domain coverage and correctness of parent-child relations of a given ontology based on domain information derived from a text corpus representing the domain. The tool provides both overall statistics and detailed analysis of sub-graphs of the ontology. In the demo, we show how these features can be used for the iterative improvement of an ontology.
