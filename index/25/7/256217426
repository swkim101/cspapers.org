Modern diesel fuel feed systems are developing in the promising direction of generating short-term high flow injection impulses by electrically controlled injectors, while there are limitations on the actuator response speed and the flow rate provided. An alternative to controlled multiphase injection is its uncontrolled analogue - split injection. The article presents an analysis of the directions for increasing the speed of the diesel injector for the implementation of split injection.
