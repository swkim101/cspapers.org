Quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) has just become as an emerging research topic as we experience the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era and beyond. As convolutional filters in QCNN extract intrinsic feature using quantum-based ansatz, it should use only finite number of qubits to prevent barren plateaus, and it introduces the lack of the feature information. In this paper, we propose a novel QCNN training algorithm to optimize feature extraction while using only a finite number of qubits, which is called fidelity-variation training (FV-Training).
