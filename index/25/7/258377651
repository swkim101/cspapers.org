Good scientific work requires comprehensible, transparent and reproducible research. One way to ensure this is to include all data relevant to a study or evaluation when publishing an article. This data should be at least aggregated or anonymized, at best compact and complete, but always resilient. In this paper we present ProSA, a system for calculating the minimal necessary data set, called sub-database. For this, we combine the Chase — a set of algorithms for transforming databases — with additional provenance information. We display the implementation of provenance guided by the ProSA pipeline and show its use to generate an optimized sub-database. Furhter, we demonstrate how the ProSA GUI looks like and present some applications and extensions.
