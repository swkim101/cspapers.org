On-device training is essential for neural networks (NNs) to continuously adapt to new online data, but can be time-consuming due to the device's limited computing power. To speed up on-device training, existing schemes select trainable NN portion offline or conduct unrecoverable selection at runtime, but the evolution of trainable NN portion is constrained and cannot adapt to the current need for training. Instead, runtime adaptation of on-device training should be fully elastic, i.e., every NN substructure can be freely removed from or added to the trainable NN portion at any time in training. In this paper, we present ElasticTrainer, a new technique that enforces such elasticity to achieve the required training speedup with the minimum NN accuracy loss. Experiment results show that ElasticTrainer achieves up to 3.5× more training speedup in wall-clock time and reduces energy consumption by 2×-3× more compared to the existing schemes, without noticeable accuracy loss.
