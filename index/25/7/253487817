 Most multi-fidelity schemes rely on regression surrogates, such as Gaussian Processes, to combine low- and high-fidelity data. Contrary to these approaches, we propose a classification-based multi-fidelity scheme for reliability assessment. This multi-fidelity technique leverages low- and high-fidelity model evaluations to locally construct the failure boundaries using support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. These SVMs can subsequently be used to estimate the probability of failure using Monte Carlo Simulations. At the core of this multi-fidelity scheme is an adaptive sampling routine driven by the probability of misclassification. This sampling routine explores sparsely sampled regions of inconsistency between low- and high-fidelity models to iteratively refine the SVM approximation of the failure boundaries. A lookahead check, which looks one step into the future without any model evaluations, is employed to selectively filter the adaptive samples. A novel model selection framework, which adaptively defines a neighborhood of no confidence around low fidelity model, is used in this study to determine if the adaptive samples should be evaluated with high- or low-fidelity model. The proposed multi-fidelity scheme is tested on a few analytical examples of dimensions ranging from 2 to 10, and finally applied to assess the reliability of a miniature shell and tube heat exchanger.
