Patient-generated data from commercially available self-tracking devices has the potential to enhance support for people transitioning from hospitalization to self-care. However, studies have revealed significant barriers to the routine use of such data in clinical settings. This paper explores the use of patient-generated data in the context of cardiac rehabilitation. We describe a two-stage investigation: (1) a co-design study with clinicians to design a data system that combines objective and subjective patient data; and (2) an 18-week field-study where this system was deployed as part of a hospital-based rehabilitation program. Our findings suggest the system is feasible, supported cliniciansâ€™ workflow, and helped patients to bridge the gap between supervised and self-managed care. Subjective data contextualized objective data and a structured approach data collection helped generate actionable information. The paper also provides insight on patients' attitudes towards peer data sharing and demonstrates the importance of timing when introducing self-tracking technology.
