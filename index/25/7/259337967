This paper presents a generic power wheelchair dynamic model. As a first contribution, this paper proposes to use a generic model composed of a geometric model and a lumped model in order to be compliant with a wide range of existing commercially available wheelchairs. In this model, a set of essential parameters are enough to accurately replicate the dynamic behavior of a wheelchair. As a second contribution, this paper presents an identification method of a n-wheel type power wheelchair. The presented model is restricted to the sagittal plane only, which is sufficient to study the reliability of the identification and validation methods. Moreover, a Motion Cueing Algorithm based on the proposed model controls a simulator mechanical platform. The generic model has been then validated through a user study with 18 able-bodied participants evaluating the self-motion perception with our multisensory power wheelchair driving simulator. Results show that the simplified model is sufficient to provide accurate sensations to the user with respect to their experience while driving a power wheelchair.
