An open research question in robotics is how to combine the benefits of model-free reinforcement learning (RL)—known for its strong task performance and flexibility in optimizing general reward formulations—with the robustness and online replanning capabilities of model predictive control (MPC). This paper provides an answer by introducing a new framework called Actor-Critic Model Predictive Control. The key idea is to embed a differentiable MPC within an actor-critic RL framework. The proposed approach leverages the short-term predictive optimization capabilities of MPC with the exploratory and end-to-end training properties of RL. The resulting policy effectively manages both short-term decisions through the MPC-based actor and long-term prediction via the critic network, unifying the benefits of both model-based control and end-to-end learning. We validate our method in both simulation and the real world with a quadcopter platform across various high-level tasks. We show that the proposed architecture can achieve real-time control performance, learn complex behaviors via trial and error, and retain the predictive properties of the MPC to better handle out of distribution behaviour.
