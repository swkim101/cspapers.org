Control theory is an interdisciplinary academic domain which contains sophisticated elements from various sub-domains of both mathematics and engineering. The issue of knowledge transfer thus poses a considerable challenge w.r.t. transfer between researchers focusing on different niches as well as w.r.t. transfer into potential application domains. The paper investigates the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) as medium to facilitate such knowledge transfer. In particular it investigates the current state of control theoretic knowledge represented in the ORKG and describes the process of extending that knowledge as well as the observed challenges thereby. The main results are a) a list of best practice suggestions for the ORKG contributions and b) a list of improvement suggestions for the further development of the ORKG and similar platforms. All relevant claims w.r.t. the ORKG are backed by SPARQL queries and some further evaluation code, both publicly available for the sake of reproducibility.
