Reflex-in is a sound installation that uses brain-wave streams to create music composition within the Web environment in real time. The work incorporates various state-of-the-art Web technologies, including Web Audio, WebSocket, WebAssembly, and WebGL. The music generated from the algorithm - mapping brain wave signal to musical events - aims to produce a form of furniture music that is relaxing and meditative, possibly therapeutic. This effect can be further enhanced through binaural beats or other forms of auditory stimulation, also known as “digital drugs,” which can be enabled through the user interface. The system represents a potential avenue for the development of closed-loop brain-computer interfaces by using the listener’s own brain waves as the source of musical stimuli, which can be used for therapeutic or medical purposes.
