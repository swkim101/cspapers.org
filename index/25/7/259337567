Depth estimation is one of the most important tasks in scene understanding. In the existing joint self-supervised learning approaches of depth-pose estimation, depth estimation and pose estimation networks are independent of each other. They only use the adjacent image frames for pose estimation and lack the use of the estimated geometric information. To enhance the depth-pose association, we propose a monocular multi-frame unsupervised depth estimation framework, named PLPE-Depth. There are a depth estimation network and two pose estimation networks with image input and pseudo-LiDAR input. The main idea of our approach is to use the pseudo-LiDAR reconstructed from the depth map to estimate the pose of adjacent frames. We propose depth re-estimation with a better pose between the image pose and the pseudo-LiDAR pose to improve the accuracy of estimation. Besides, we improve the reconstruction loss and design a pseudo-LiDAR pose enhancement loss to facilitate the joint learning. Our approach enhances the use of the estimated depth information and strengthens the coupling between depth estimation and pose estimation. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that our depth estimation achieves state-of-the-art performance at low resolution. Our source codes will be released on https://github.com/IRMVLabIPLPE-Depth.
