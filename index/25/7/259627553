In this paper, we investigate the benefits of self-supervised learning (SSL) to downstream tasks of satellite images. Unlike common student academic projects, this work focuses on the advantages of the SSL for deployment-driven tasks which have specific scenarios with low or high-spatial resolution images. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate the robust benefits of the SSL trained by medium-resolution (10m) images to both low-resolution (100m) scene classification case (4.25%↑) and very high-resolution (5cm) aerial image segmentation case (1.96%↑), respectively.
