The real-time processing of time series signals is a critical issue for many real-life applications. The idea of real-time processing is especially important in audio domain as the human perception of sound is sensitive to any kind of disturbance in perceived signals, especially the lag between auditory and visual modalities. The rise of deep learning (DL) models complicated the landscape of signal processing. Although they often have superior quality compared to standard DSP methods, this advantage is diminished by higher latency. In this work we propose novel method for minimization of inference time latency and memory consumption, called Short-Term Memory Convolution (STMC) and its transposed counterpart. The main advantage of STMC is the low latency comparable to long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Furthermore, the training of STMC-based models is faster and more stable as the method is based solely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this study we demonstrate an application of this solution to a U-Net model for a speech separation task and GhostNet model in acoustic scene classification (ASC) task. In case of speech separation we achieved a 5-fold reduction in inference time and a 2-fold reduction in latency without affecting the output quality. The inference time for ASC task was up to 4 times faster while preserving the original accuracy.
