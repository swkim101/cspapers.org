Simplicial complexes are higher-order combinatorial structures which have been used to represent real-world complex systems. In this paper, we concentrate on the local patterns in simplicial complexes called simplets, a generalization of graphlets. We formulate the problem of counting simplets of a given size in a given simplicial complex. For this problem, we extend a sampling algorithm based on color coding from graphs to simplicial complexes, with essential technical novelty. We theoretically analyze our proposed algorithm named SC3, showing its correctness, unbiasedness, convergence, and time/space complexity. Through the extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets, we show the superiority of SC3 in terms of accuracy, speed, and scalability, compared to the baseline methods. Finally, we use the counts given by SC3 for simplicial complex analysis, especially for characterization, which is further used for simplicial complex clustering, where SC3 shows a strong ability of characterization with domain-based similarity.
