We present EMSAssist, the first end-to-end mobile voice assistant for emergency medical services (EMS). EMSAssist allows Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) to verbally describe patients' signs and symptoms and uses EMTs' voice input to recommend top-5 EMS protocols. Through this demo, we allow the attendees to evaluate EMSAssist through a pair of Google Glass and a mobile phone. Both mobile devices can collect users' voices as input and output top-5 recommended protocols. A companion youtube video of using EMSAssist on the Google Glass is provided: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj7aQJKf4aE
