In e-commerce, images are widely used to display more intuitive information about items. Image selection significantly affects the userâ€™s click-through rate (CTR). Most existing work considers the CTR as the target to find an appropriate image. However, these methods are challenging to deploy online efficiently. Also, the selected images may not relate to the item but are profitable to CTR, resulting in the undesirable phenomenon of enticing users to click on the item. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline method with content-based recall model and CTR-based ranking model. The first is realized as a joint method based on the title-image matching model and multi-modal knowledge graph embedding learning model. The second is a CTR-based visually aware scoring model, incorporating the entity textual information and entity images. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in offline evaluations. After a month of online A/B testing on a travel platform Fliggy, the relative improvement of our method is 5% with respect to seller selection on CTCVR in the searching scenario, and our method further improves pCTR from 3.48% of human pick to 3.53% in the recommendation scenario.
