Deep learning and the Web of Things (WoT) have become powerful tools for web engineering, leading to increased investigation and publication of research related to deep learning in web engineering. Therefore, this workshop is titled "The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things" for the Web Conference 2023 (WWWâ€™23). This workshop features five research articles: (1) "Multiple-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Avatar Migration in Vehicular Metaverses", (2) "Web 3.0: Future of the Internet", (3) "Weighted Statistically Significant Pattern Mining", (4) "DSNet: Efficient Lightweight Model for Video Salient Object Detection for IoT and WoT Applications", and (5) "The Human-Centric Metaverse: A Survey".
