Formality and politeness are two of the most commonly studied stylistic dimensions of language that convey, authority, amount of shared context, and social distances among the communicators and are known to affect user behavior significantly. Formality in the text refers to the type of language used in situations when the speaker is very careful about the choice of words and sentence structure. In this paper, we propose a graph-induced transformer network (GiTN) to detect formality and politeness in text automatically. The proposed model exploits the latent linguistic features present in the text to identify the aforementioned stylistic factors. The proposed model is evaluated with multiple datasets across domains. We found that the proposed modelâ€™s performance surpasses most baseline systems.
