This paper presents results of the development of an aviation kerosene TS-1 surrogate in terms of combustion characteristics. The paper briefly shows the results of a computational and experimental study of combustion characteristics, such as Hu, DCN, MW, TSI, H/C, as well as characteristics such as pyrolysis and flame velocity for the developed surrogates and kerosene. As a result of the work, methods are proposed and criteria are formulated for creating an aviation kerosene surrogate, which will be used to simulate the combustion process. This technique makes it possible to form a surrogate that differs from aviation kerosene less than 1.5% in terms of the properties presented above.
