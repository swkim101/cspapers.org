Individuals with multiple chronic health conditions (MCC) often face an overwhelming set of self-management work, resulting in a need to set care priorities. Yet, much self-management work is invisible to healthcare providers. This study aimed to understand how to support the development and sharing of connections between personal values and self-management tasks through the facilitated use of an interactive visualization system: Conversation Canvas. We conducted a field study with 13 participants with MCC, 3 caregivers, and 7 primary care providers in Washington State. Analysis of interviews with MCC participants showed that developing visualizations of connections between personal values, self-management tasks, and health conditions helped individuals make sense of connections relevant to their health and wellbeing, recognize a road map of central issues and their impacts, feel respected and understood, share priorities with providers, and support value-aligned changes. These findings demonstrated potential for the guided process and visualization to support priorities-aligned care.
