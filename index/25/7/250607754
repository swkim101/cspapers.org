Kakutani's Fixed Point theorem is a fundamental theorem in topology with numerous applications in game theory and economics. Formally, Kakutani's theorem states that for any set-valued function mapping F, also known as correspondence, from a compact, convex set to itself in a locally convex topological vector space, if the function is upper hemicontinuous, has a closed graph, and its output at any given point is a non-empty and convex set, then there exists a fixed point x, namely a point in the domain which is mapped to itself by the function x âˆˆ F(x). Interestingly, computational formulations of Kakutani exist only in special cases and are too restrictive to be useful in reductions.
