Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has advanced the performance of many vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval, visual entailment, and visual reasoning.The pre-training mostly utilizes lexical databases and image queries in English. Previous work has demonstrated that the pre-training in English does not transfer well to other languages in a zero-shot setting. However, multilingual pre-trained language models (MPLM) have excelled at a variety of single-modal language tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient approach to adapt VLP to unseen languages using MPLM.We utilize a cross-lingual contextualised token embeddings alignment approach to train text encoders for non-English languages. Our approach does not require image input and primarily uses machine translation, eliminating the need for target language data. Our evaluation across three distinct tasks (image-text retrieval, visual entailment, and natural language visual reasoning) demonstrates that this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art multilingual vision-language models without requiring large parallel corpora.
