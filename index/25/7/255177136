This paper presents a reduction mechanism for robot actuators that can switch between two types of reduction ratio. By fixing the carrier or ring gear of the proposed actuator which is based on the 3K compound planetary drive, the actuator can shift its reduction ratio. For compact design with reduced weight of the actuator, unique pawl brake mechanism interacting with cams and micro servos for switching mechanism is designed. The resulting prototype module has a reduction ratio of 6.91 and 44.93 for ‘low-reduction’ and ‘high-reduction’ ratios, respectively. Reduction ratios can be easily adjusted by modifying the pitch diameters of gears. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed actuator could extend its operation region via two reduction modes that are interchangeable with gear shifting.
