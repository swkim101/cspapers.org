This paper aims at developing a tight schedulability analysis for real-time global gang scheduling, in which threads of each task subject to timing requirements are assigned to multiple processors in parallel (i.e., following the rigid gang task model). Focusing on the RTA (Response Time Analysis) framework known to exhibit high schedulability performance for other task models, we address two following issues: i) how to generalize the existing RTA framework to gang scheduling and utilize existing RTA components of other task models for the generalized framework, and ii) how to incorporate important characteristics of gang scheduling into the RTA framework in a systematic way to minimize the framework's pessimism in judging schedulability. By addressing the issues, our RTA framework enables to derive tight schedulability analysis for EDF, FP and potentially more scheduling algorithms for real-time global gang scheduling. Also, our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RTA framework outperforms/complements existing studies for real-time global/non-global gang scheduling, in terms of schedulability performance.
