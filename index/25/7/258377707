Link prediction between two nodes is a critical task in graph machine learning. Most approaches are based on variants of graph neural networks (GNNs) that focus on transductive link prediction and have high inference latency. However, many real-world applications require fast inference over new nodes in inductive settings where no information on connectivity is available for these nodes. Thereby, node features provide an inevitable alternative in the latter scenario. To that end, we propose Graph2Feat, which enables inductive link prediction by exploiting knowledge distillation (KD) through the Student-Teacher learning framework. In particular, Graph2Feat learns to match the representations of a lightweight student multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a more expressive teacher GNN while learning to predict missing links based on the node features, thus attaining both GNN’s expressiveness and MLP’s fast inference. Furthermore, our approach is general; it is suitable for transductive and inductive link predictions on different types of graphs regardless of them being homogeneous or heterogeneous, directed or undirected. We carry out extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets including homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. Our experiments demonstrate that Graph2Feat significantly outperforms SOTA methods in terms of AUC and average precision in homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. Finally, Graph2Feat has the minimum inference time compared to the SOTA methods, and 100x acceleration compared to GNNs. The code and datasets are available on GitHub1.
