Following biology's lead, soft robotics has emerged as a perfect candidate for actuation within complex environments. While soft actuation has been developed intensively over the last few decades, soft sensing has so far slowed to catch up. A largely unresearched area is the change of the soft material properties through prestress to achieve a degree of mechanical sensitivity tunability within soft sensors. Here, a new 3D force sensor which employs novel hydraulic filament artificial muscles capable of in-situ sensitivity tunability is introduced. Using a neural network (NN) model, the new soft 3D sensor can precisely detect external forces based on the change of the hydraulic pressures with error of $\sim 1.0, \sim 1.3$, and $\sim 0.94$ % in the $\text{x, y}$, and z-axis directions, respectively. The sensor is also able to sense large force ranges, comparable to other similar sensors available in the literature. The sensor is then integrated into a soft robotic surgical arm for monitoring the tool-tissue interaction during an ablation process.
