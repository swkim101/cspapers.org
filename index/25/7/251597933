This is the 8th edition of the workshop series labeled “AW4City – Web Applications and Smart Cities”, which started back in Florence in 2015 and kept on taking place every year in conjunction with the WWW conference series. Last year the workshop was held virtually in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The workshop series aims to investigate the Web and Web applications’ role in establishing smart city (SC) promises. The workshop series aim to investigate the role of the Web and of Web applications in SC growth. This year, the workshop focuses on the role of the web in smart environment. In the era of cities and under the UN 2030 Agenda and the European Green deal for sustainable growth, cities appear to play crucial role in securing humanity against environmental threats and generate sustainable and circular cities. In this regard, cities attempt to improve their forms (e.g., more compact, and eco-friendlier) and performance to become friendlier and able to host their increasing populations. Additionally, new types of business appear (e.g., that utilize IoT and data, manage e-waste and recycle), while the co-existence of autonomous things and people generate another challenge that cities have been started phasing. This workshop aims to demonstrate how web applications, Apps and Web Intelligence can serve smart environment in general.
