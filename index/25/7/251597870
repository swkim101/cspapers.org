In recent years, deep learning and web of things (WoT) have become hot topics. The relevant research issues in deep learning have been in increasingly investigated and published. Therefore, the title of this workshop is ”the 2nd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things (DLWoT’22)” for the Web Conference 2022 (WWW’22). This workshop solicits papers on various disciplines, which include but are not limited to: (1) deep learning for massive IoT, (2) deep learning for critical IoT, (3) deep learning for enhancing IoT security, (4) deep learning for enhancing IoT privacy, (5) preprocessing of IoT data for AI modeling, and (6) deep learning for IoT applications (e.g., smart home, smart agriculture, interactive art, and so on). DLWoT’22 includes two tracks: (1) keynote speaker and (2) workshop papers. One keynote speaker is invited to give a talk, and 8 accepted workshop papers are presented.
