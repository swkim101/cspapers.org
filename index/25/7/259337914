The integration of variable stiffness actuators (VSA) in robotic systems endows them with intrinsic flexibility and therefore robustness to unknown disturbances. However, this characteristic presents a challenge: choosing the best intrinsic stiffness setting guaranteeing the required force ap-plication capability while keeping the system as adaptable to uncertainties as possible. This paper proposes a method to set the optimal stiffness for a multi-finger VSA hand to perform a desired manipulation task. The task is generically represented as a force (with unknown magnitude) applied along a reference direction. According to the force application's direction and the hand's kinematic state, the fingers assume a certain role to split the collective force application. We employ the endpoint stiffness ellipsoid to analyze the required finger stiffness to fulfill the task. We evaluate the optimized stiffness settings in a door opening application with an iterative adaption of the stiffness behavior to handle the unknown force requirement. The results show a successful collective behavior of the fingers, where the stiffness setting considers a task-oriented force-adaptability trade-off and effective use of independent VSA fingers.
