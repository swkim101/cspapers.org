Designing provably fair decision-making algorithms is a task of growing interest and importance. In this article, I argue that preference-based notions of fairness proposed decades ago in the economics literature and subsequently explored in-depth within computer science (specifically, within the field of computational social choice) are aptly suited for a wide range of modern decision-making systems, from conference peer review to recommender systems to participatory budgeting.
