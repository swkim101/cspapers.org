Contract theory studies the interactions between a principal and an agent when the two parties transact in the presence of private information [Bolton and Dewatripont, 2004, Faure-Grimaud et al., 2001, Salani√©, 2005]. The principal would like to achieve her desired outcomes by hiring agents to work for her. The agent wishes to make money by working for the principal. They develop agreements in the form of a contract, which specifies how much the principal would pay under the different possible outcomes of the agent's work.
