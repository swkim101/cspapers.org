The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a standard widely adopted to express privacy policies. This article presents several challenges identified in the context of the European project AURORAL in which ODRL is used to express privacy policies for Smart Communities and Rural Areas. The article presents that some challenges should be addressed directly by the ODRL standardisation group to achieve the best course of action, although others exists. For others, the authors have presented a potential solution, in particular, for considering dynamic values coming from external data sources into privacy policies. Finally, the last challenge is an open research question, since it revolves around the interoperability of privacy policies that belong to different systems and that are expressed with different privacy languages.
