Time-of-flight (ToF) cameras have been increasingly adopted in mobile systems. Although an enormous amount of work focuses on the applications and augmentation of ToF cameras, the ToF cameras only provide depth measurements in mobile sensing systems. In this paper, we introduce two systems (i.e., UltraDepth and Mozart) to expose high-resolution textures from ToF cameras to enhance their performance in mobile systems. The results clearly show that the two systems can effectively reveal texture information of the scene, which can significantly improve the performance of ToF sensing and enable next-generation ToF applications.
