Recent advances in interactive segmentation (IS)

allow speeding up and simplifying image editing

and labeling greatly. The majority of modern IS

approaches accept user input in the form of clicks.

However, using clicks may require too many user

interactions, especially when selecting small ob-

jects, minor parts of an object, or a group of ob-

jects of the same type. In this paper, we consider

such a natural form of user interaction as a loose

contour, and introduce a contour-based IS method.

We evaluate the proposed method on the standard

segmentation benchmarks, our novel UserContours

dataset, and its subset UserContours-G containing

difficult segmentation cases. Through experiments,

we demonstrate that a single contour provides the

same accuracy as multiple clicks, thus reducing the

required amount of user interactions.
