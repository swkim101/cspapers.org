Notification is a core feature of mobile applications. They inform users about a variety of events happening in the communities. Users may take immediate action to visit the app or ignore the notifications depending on the timing and the relevance of a notification to the user. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of DeepPvisit, a novel probabilistic deep learning survival method for modeling interactions between a user visit and a mobile notification decision, targeting notification volume and delivery time optimization, and driving long-term user engagements. Offline evaluations and online A/B test experiments show DeepPvisit outperforms the existing survival regression model and the other baseline models and delivers better business metrics online.
