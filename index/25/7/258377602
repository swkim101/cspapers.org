Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a pervasive issue in both online and physical contexts. Social media has grown in popularity as a platform for offering awareness, support, and community for those seeking help or advice regarding CSA. One popular social media platform in which such communities has formed is Reddit. In this study, we use both LDA and a reflexive thematic analysis to understand the types of engagements users have with subreddits aimed at CSA awareness. Through the reflexive thematic analysis, we identified six themes including strong negative emotions and phrasing, seeking help, personal experiences and their impact, measurement strategies to prevent abuse, provisioning of support, and the problematic nature of the Omegle platform. This research has implications for those creating awareness materials around CSA safety as well as for child advocacy groups.
