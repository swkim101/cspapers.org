A variety of diagnostic and therapeutic protocols rely on locating in vivo target anatomical structures, which can be obtained from medical scans. However, organs move and deform as the patient changes his/her pose. In order to obtain accurate target location information, clinicians have to either conduct frequent intraoperative scans, resulting in higher exposition of patients to radiations, or adopt proxy procedures (e.g., creating and using custom molds to keep patients in the exact same pose during both preoperative organ scanning and subsequent treatment. Such custom proxy methods are typically sub-optimal, constraining the clinicians and costing precious time and money to the patients. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present a learning-based approach to estimate the patient's internal organ deformation for arbitrary human poses in order to assist with radiotherapy and similar medical protocols. The underlying method first leverages medical scans to learn a patient-specific representation that potentially encodes the organ's shape and elastic properties. During inference, given the patient's current body pose information and the organ's representation extracted from previous medical scans, our method can estimate their current organ deformation to offer guidance to clinicians. We conduct experiments on a well-sized dataset which is augmented through real clinical data using finite element modeling. Our results suggest that pose-dependent organ deformation can be learned through a point cloud autoencoder conditioned on the parametric pose input. We hope that this work can be a starting point for future research towards closing the loop between human mesh recovery and anatomical reconstruction, with applications beyond the medical domain.
