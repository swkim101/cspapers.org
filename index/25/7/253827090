Significant advancement has occurred in the detection methods of solution-based analytes. High-pressure liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and other systems used for analyses are quite expensive. Therefore, there is a need for new methods and for the visible detection of analytes. Here, we demonstrate that 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) could impact the stability, optical, and morphology of gold nanoparticles (AuNps) in a colloidal solution. These impacts can be used to create a sensitive visual detection system. The strong impact of the APTES concentration on the ultravioletâ€“visible absorption spectra of the solutions is illustrated, which displays systematic and extensive red shifts. The presence of denatured proteins within a therapeutic drug product can induce a series of adverse effects. This report describes a fast, low cost, sensitive, and user-friendly platform where the plasmonic nanoparticles create visual biosensing of denatured proteins. Artificially heat stressed ferritin, glutathione, and insulin coupled to AuNps are exposed to ATES and upon denaturation of the protein or peptide, systematic blue or red shifts are observed in the absorbance spectra of the AuNps/biomolecules, and aminosilane solution. This serves as a proof-of-concept for a fast in-solution detection method for heat-stressed proteins or peptides.
