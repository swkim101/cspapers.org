With ever-increasing attacks against learning-enabled components (LECs) in safety-critical systems, it has become more challenging to ensure robust operations. By focusing on anterior and posterior attacks on LECs, where malicious tasks need to run before and after a victim task, respectively, to launch attacks, we study in this work the victim-aware fixed-priority scheduling in single processor systems. Specifically, by exploiting the preference-oriented fixed-priority (POFP) scheduler, we devise a Victim-Aware Priority Assignment (VAPA) scheme to assign different priorities for victim tasks that are subject to anterior and posterior attacks, respectively. VAPA aims at reducing both anterior and posterior attacking occasions in the resultant schedule and thus enhancing the robust operations of the victim tasks. Online adaptation is also considered by exploiting idle time slots to further remove such attacking occasions whenever possible. The main ideas of the victim-aware scheduling are illustrated via a concrete example and future work is discussed.
