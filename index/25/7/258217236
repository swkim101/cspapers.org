Feedback is a process that is common in both acoustic and electronic musical instruments, but rare in digital musical tools or creative digital tools more generally. This paper examines the musical use of the ’no-input mixing desk’—or ’feedback mixer’, a sound mixing desk fed back on itself—to explore how and why feedback is appealing for musicians. Twenty interviews were conducted with musicians who have used no-input mixing desk in their practice. Thematic analysis is used to explore the interview data. Results highlight the enjoyment and creative fulfilment of working with systems that can’t be fully predicted or understood, a sense of gestural immediacy, sensitivity and tactility often perceived as lacking in digital instruments, and an affinity with acoustic instruments in terms of the scope for surprise and exploration.
