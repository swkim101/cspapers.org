In this work, we propose a sustainable path-finding application for grain transportation during the ongoing Russian military invasion in Ukraine. This application is to build a suite of algorithms to find possible optimal paths for transporting grain that remains in Ukraine. The application uses the KNowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology(KNARM) and the KnowWhereGraph to achieve this goal. Currently, we are working towards creating an ontology that will allow for a more effective heuristic approach by incorporating the lessons learned from the KnowWhereGraph. The aim is to enhance the path-finding process and provide more accurate and efficient results. In the future, we will continue exploring and implementing new techniques that can further improve the sustainability of the path-finding applications with a knowledge graph backend for grain transportation through hazardous and adversarial environments. The code is available upon reviewerâ€™s request. It can not be made public due to the sensitive nature of the data.
