Coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (CGRA) has become a promising candidate for data-intensive computing due to its flexibility and high energy efficiency. CGRA compilers map data flow graphs (DFGs) extracted from applications onto CGRAs, playing a fundamental role in fully exploiting hardware resources for acceleration. Yet the existing compilers are time-demanding and cannot guarantee optimal results due to the traversal search of enormous search spaces brought about by the spatio-temporal flexibility of CGRA structures and the complexity of DFGs. Inspired by the amazing progress in reinforcement learning (RL) and Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) for real-world problems, we consider constructing a compiler that can learn from past experiences and comprehensively understand the target DFG and CGRA. In this paper, we propose an architecture-aware compiler for CGRAs based on RL and MCTS, called MapZero - a framework to automatically extract the characteristics of DFG and CGRA hardware and map operations onto varied CGRA fabrics. We apply Graph Attention Network to generate an adaptive embedding for DFGs and also model the functionality and interconnection status of the CGRA, aiming at training an RL agent to perform placement and routing intelligently. Experimental results show that MapZero can generate superior-quality mappings and reduce compilation time hundreds of times compared to state-of-the-art methods. MapZero can find high-quality mappings very quickly when the feasible solution space is rather small and all other compilers fail. We also demonstrate the scalability and broad applicability of our framework.
