We propose an accurate and fast bundle adjustment (BA) solution that estimates the 6-DoF pose with an independent RS model of the camera and the geometry of the environment based on measurements from a rolling shutter (RS) camera. This tackles the challenges in the existing works, namely, relying on high frame rate video as input, restrictive assumptions on camera motion and poor efficiency. To this end, we first verify the positive influence of the image point normalization to RSBA. Then we present a novel visual residual covariance model to standardize the reprojection error during RSBA, which consequently improves the overall accuracy. Besides, we demonstrate the combination of Normalization and covariance standardization Weighting in RSBA (NW-RSBA) can avoid common planar degeneracy without the need to constrain the filming manner. Finally, we propose an acceleration strategy for NW-RSBA based on the sparsity of its Jacobian matrix and Schur complement. The extensive synthetic and real data experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution over the state-of-the-art works.
