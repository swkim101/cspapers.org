The article describes influence of finite-element mesh flow parameters in the blade passage of cooled turbine stator blades on results of film cooling efficiency factor calculation. Recommendations for value selection of these parameters to build simplified numerical models of flow in stator blade rows in Numeca Fine Turbo software package with simulation of coolant blowing out from cells on blade surfaces are offered.
