This study investigates statements of participation in an exploitative animal activity on social media website Twitter. The data include social posts (tweets) related to two exploited species - the sloth (N=32,119), and the elephant (N=15,160). Tweets for each of these case studies were examined and labeled. The initial results reveal several features of interaction with exploited species. Namely, there are a high number of tweets indicating that individuals participated in exploited species activities during vacations in destinations that double as native countries for the exploited species. The data also indicate that a large number of exploited species activities take place at fairs, carnivals, and circuses. These initial results shed light on the trends in human participation in activities with exploited species. These findings will offer insight to stakeholders seeking to bolster education programs and quantify the level of animal exploitation.
