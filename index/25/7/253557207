Optical Camera Communication (OCC) delivers data from LEDs to the camera. Artificial lighting, such as LED lights and cameras, are widely available, so OCC will benefit from these current infrastructures. The parameters of the camera that affect the OCC system's data rate will be discussed in this article. In addition, an experimental system for measuring data transmission based on distance and angle is proposed.
