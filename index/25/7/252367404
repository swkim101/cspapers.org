Numbers are essential components of text, like any other word tokens, from which natural language processing (NLP) models are built and deployed. Though numbers are typically not accounted for distinctly in most NLP tasks, there is still an underlying amount of numeracy already exhibited by NLP models. For instance, in named entity recognition (NER), numbers are not treated as an entity with distinct tags. In this work, we attempt to tap the potential of state-of-the-art language models and transfer their ability to boost performance in related downstream tasks dealing with numbers. Our proposed classification of numbers into entities helps NLP models perform well on several tasks, including a handcrafted Fill-In-The-Blank (FITB) task and on question answering, using joint embeddings, outperforming the BERT and RoBERTa baseline classification.
