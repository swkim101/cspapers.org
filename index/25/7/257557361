Naturally controllable human-scene interaction (HSI) generation has an important role in various fields, such as VR/AR content creation and human-centered AI. However, existing methods are unnatural and unintuitive in their controllability, which heavily limits their application in practice. Therefore, we focus on a challenging task of naturally and controllably generating realistic and diverse HSIs from textual descriptions. From human cognition, the ideal generative model should correctly reason about spatial relationships and interactive actions. To that end, we propose Narrator, a novel relationship reasoning-based generative approach using a conditional variation autoencoder for naturally controllable generation given a 3D scene and a textual description. Also, we model global and local spatial relationships in a 3D scene and a textual description respectively based on the scene graph, and introduce a part-level action mechanism to represent interactions as atomic body part states. In particular, benefiting from our relationship reasoning, we further propose a simple yet effective multi-human generation strategy, which is the first exploration for controllable multi-human scene interaction generation. Our extensive experiments and perceptual studies show that Narrator can controllably generate diverse interactions and significantly outperform existing works.
