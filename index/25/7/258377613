INTRODUCTION The rise of online platforms as a communication tool for individuals worldwide has brought an increase in their misuse and abuse. Social platforms have been implicated in promoting and amplifying hate speech, misinformation, extremism, harassment, cyberbullying, human trafcking, drug dealing, gender-based stereotyping, and other forms of violence. These cyber social threats are inherently multifaceted, entailing signifcant implications for both individuals and communities, which make them challenging to combat while crucial to address. We are pleased to present the proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats held on April 30, 2023, in Austin, Texas, U.S. The goal of this workshop was to bring together researchers from various disciplines to explore the complex problems that accompany digital platforms. Given the importance of accurate and reliable information in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global crises, the spotlight topic for this yearâ€™s workshop was "Information Integrity during Crises."
