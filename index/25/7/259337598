We propose a new frontier concept called the Gaussian Process Frontier (GP-Frontier) that can be used to locally navigate a robot towards a goal without building a map. The GP-Frontier is built on the uncertainty assessment of an efficient variant of sparse Gaussian Process. Based only on local ranging sensing measurement, the GP-Frontier can be used for navigation in both known and unknown environments. The proposed method is validated through intensive evaluations, and the results show that the GP-Frontier can navigate the robot in a safe and persistent way, i.e., the robot moves in the most open space (thus reducing the risk of collision) without relying on a map or a path planner. A supplementary video that demonstrates the robot navigation behavior is available at https://youtu.be/ndpqTNYqGfw.
