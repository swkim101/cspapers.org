Personalized Search(henceforth called P10d Search) focuses to deliver user-specific search results based on the previous purchases. Search engine retrieves the result based on the defined relevancy algorithm. When a user searches a keyword, search engine constructs the search query based on the defined searchable fields/attributes along with configured relevancy algorithm. Position of the item retrieved in search results is determined by the search algorithm based on the search term. The results are further refined or ranked based on different click stream signals, product features, market data to provide much relevant results. Personalisation provides the ranked the list of items for a given user based on past purchases. Personalisation is agnostic of search query and takes user id, cart additions, site taxonomy and userâ€™s shopping history as input signals. In summary, search engine queries data based on relevancy and personalisation engine retrieves based purely on purchases. Goal of personalised search is to enhance the search results by adding personalised results without affecting the search relevance.
