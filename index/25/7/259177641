Finger biometrics are widely used by smartphones as a secure and user-friendly credential for privacy protection. However, this information is difficult to measure without high-resolution images, leaving most works to treat this as an image-domain problem. We demonstrate that low-effort alternatives on smartphones are possible through the use of sound propagation in ubiquitous smartphone cases. Inexpensive and widely adopted, smartphone cases are always in contact with fingers, making them ideal for collecting finger biometrics. We thus design BioCase, an acoustic sensing system that leverages smartphone cases equipped with mini-structures to capture unique biometric-hybrid signatures (i.e., reflections influenced by the user's fingertip physiology and behavior) for smartphone privacy protection. The system generates inaudible structure-borne sound and measure the propagation through the smartphone case, mini-structures, and user finger. The design of the mini-structure controls the behavior of structure-borne sound such that unique responses are produced when different users and fingers touch the smartphone case. This enables low-cost, low-effort privacy protection, merely touching the smartphone case can authenticate users. Comprehensive experiments with 46 users over 10 weeks demonstrate BioCase can differentiate users with over 94% accuracy at a 5% false positive rate.
