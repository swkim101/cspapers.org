In a globalized marketplace, one could access products or services from almost anywhere. However, resolving which product in one language corresponds to another product in a different language remains an under-explored problem. We explore this from two perspectives. First, given two products of different languages, how to assess their similarity that could signal a potential match. Second, given products from various languages, how to arrive at a multi-partite clustering that respects cardinality constraints efficiently. We describe algorithms for each perspective and integrate them into a promising solution validated on real-world datasets.
