Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) is widely used in various machine learning scenarios for domain shifts between labeled source domains and unlabeled target domains. Conventional MSDA methods are built on a strong hypothesis that data samples from the same source belong to the same domain with the same latent distribution. However, in practice sources and their latent domains are not necessarily one-to-one correspondence. To tackle this problem, a novel Multi-source Reconstructed Domain Adaptation (MRDA) framework for MSDA is proposed. We use an Expectation-Maximization (EM) mechanism that iteratively reconstructs the source domains to recover the latent domains and performs domain adaptation on the reconstructed domains. Specifically, in the E-step, we cluster the samples from multiple sources into different latent domains, and a soft assignment strategy is proposed to avoid cluster imbalance. In the M-step, we freeze the latent domains clustered in the E-step and optimize the objective function for domain adaptation, and a global-specific feature extractor is used to capture both domain-invariant and domain-specific features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can reconstruct source domains and perform domain adaptation on the reconstructed domains effectively, thus significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines (e.g., 1% to 3.1% absolute improvement in AUC).
