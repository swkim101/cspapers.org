Obtaining a good similarity matrix is extremely important in subspace clustering. Current state-of-the-art methods learn the similarity matrix through self-expressive strategy. However, these methods directly adopt original samples as a set of basis to represent itself linearly. It is difficult to accurately describe the linear relation between samples in the real-world applications, and thus is hard to find an ideal similarity matrix. To better represent the linear relation of samples, we present a subspace clustering model, Linearity-Aware Subspace Clustering (LASC), which can consciously learn the similarity matrix by employing a linearity-aware metric. This is a new subspace clustering method that combines metric learning and subspace clustering into a joint learning framework. In our model, we first utilize the self-expressive strategy to obtain an initial subspace structure and discover a low-dimensional representation of the original data. Subsequently, we use the proposed metric to learn an intrinsic similarity matrix with linearity-aware on the obtained subspace. Based on such a learned similarity matrix, the inter-cluster distance becomes larger than the intra-cluster distances, and thus successfully obtaining a good subspace cluster result. In addition, to enrich the similarity matrix with more consistent knowledge, we adopt a collaborative learning strategy for self-expressive subspace learning and linearity-aware subspace learning. Moreover, we provide detailed mathematical analysis to show that the metric can properly characterize the linear correlation between samples.
