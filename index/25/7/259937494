Deep reinforcement learning has achieved signif-icant results in low-level controlling tasks. However, for some applications like autonomous driving and drone flying, it is difficult to control behavior stably since the agent may suddenly change its actions which often lowers the controlling sys-tem's efficiency, induces excessive mechanical wear, and causes uncontrollable, dangerous behavior to the vehicle. Recently, a method called conditioning for action policy smoothness (CAPS) was proposed to solve the problem of jerkiness in low-dimensional features for applications such as quadrotor drones. To cope with high-dimensional features, this paper proposes image-based regularization for action smoothness (1-RAS) for solving jerky control in autonomous miniature car racing. We also introduce a control based on impact ratio, an adaptive regularization weight to control the smoothness constraint, called IR control. In the experiment, an agent with 1- RAS and IR control significantly improves the success rate from 59% to 95%. In the real-world-track experiment, the agent also outperforms other methods, namely reducing the average finish lap time, while also improving the completion rate even without real world training. This is also justified by an agent based on I-RAS winning the 2022 AWS DeepRacer Final Championship Cup.
