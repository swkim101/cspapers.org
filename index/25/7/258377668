Previous research has identified phenomena such as cyberbystander intervention and various other forms of responses to aggressive or hateful behaviours online. In the online media ecosystem, some people from marginalized communities and their allies have attempted to enhance organic engagement by participating in organized activism, which is sometimes characterized as "non-complementary" or "indirect". This paper attempts to identify, recognize, and label this phenomenon, as well as provide suggestions for further research in this area.
