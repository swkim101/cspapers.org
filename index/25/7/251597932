Community-based knowledge graphs are generated following hybrid approaches, where human intelligence empowers computational methods to effectively integrate encyclopedic knowledge or provide a common understanding of a domain. Existing community-based knowledge graphs represent essential sources of knowledge for enhancing the accuracy of data mining, information retrieval, question answering, and multimodal processing. However, despite the enormous effort conducted by contributing communities, community-based knowledge graphs may be incomplete and integrate duplicated data and metadata. We tackle the problem of enhancing query answering against incomplete community-based knowledge graphs by proposing an efficient query processing approach to estimate answer completeness and increase the results. It assumes that community-based knowledge graphs comprise synonym predicates that complement knowledge graph triples required to raise query answering completeness. The aim is proposing a novel query expansion method based on synonym predicates identified using embeddings built on a knowledge graph. Our preliminary analysis shows that our approach improves query answer completeness. However, queries can be expanded with some similar predicates which do not lead to complete answers. This shows that more work is required for query expansion with the minimum synonym predicates that maximize answer completeness.
