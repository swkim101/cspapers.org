A uniform air gap was successfully formed on a superhydrophobic silicone rubber in water or NaCl aqueous solution. The main chain of Si–O bonds of a silicone rubber was photodissociated by a 193 nm ArF excimer laser to lower the molecular weight only in the laser-irradiated microareas; due to the volume expansion, the microswelling structure was periodically fabricated on a silicone rubber, showing the superhydrophobic property. A pair of metal needles were inserted in the air gap formed on the superhydrophobic silicone rubber in a NaCl aqueous solution; an electrical insulation between two metal needles in the air gap was demonstrated. Additionally, a droplet of NaCl aqueous solution was confined in the air gap, after which the pair of metal needles contacted with the droplet through the air gap. As a result, an electrolysis of the droplet of NaCl aqueous solution occurred to produce hydrogen gas on the cathode in the air gap. Moreover, when Al and Cu wires were provided across the air gap and NaCl aqueous solution on the superhydrophobic silicone rubber, approximately 0.8–0.9 V of electric voltage was successfully generated between the two wires in the air gap based on the difference in electrochemical potential as an energy harvesting device in the sea.
