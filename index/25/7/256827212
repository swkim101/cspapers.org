Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to decompose aggregated electrical usage signal into appliance-specific power consumption and it amounts to a classical example of blind source separation tasks. Leveraging recent progress on deep learning techniques, we design a new neural NILM model {\em Multi-State Dual CNN} (MSDC). Different from previous models, MSDC explicitly extracts information about the appliance's multiple states and state transitions, which in turn regulates the prediction of signals for appliances. More specifically, we employ a dual-CNN architecture: one CNN for outputting state distributions and the other for predicting the power of each state. A new technique is invented that utilizes conditional random fields (CRF) to capture state transitions. Experiments on two real-world datasets REDD and UK-DALE demonstrate that our model significantly outperform state-of-the-art models while having good generalization capacity, achieving 6%-10% MAE gain and 33%-51% SAE gain to unseen appliances.
