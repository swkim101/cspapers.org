The existing manufacturing systems based on processes involving the transportation of workpiece are unsuitable for large products such as air mobility systems. This study proposes a novel ultra-complex manufacturing system called the “Modularized-Structure and Multiple-Points Simultaneous Machining System (MS-cubic)” based on the concept of intelligent space, which simultaneously performs multiple types of machining processes without moving a workpiece. The system can simultaneously process multiple points and flexibly change its workspace by modularizing its structure. This paper presents a discussion on the requirements and constraints to generate a feasible design of the rail module and the machining unit, which are two main elements of MS-cubic. The performance of the prototype MS-cubic is evaluated, and its stiffness is observed to be sufficient to perform drilling. Furthermore, the modularized design of system enables the fluid and electric power supply for the machining process.
