This paper presents the calculation results of the properties of both individual hydrocarbons and mixtures that affect the atomization and evaporation characteristics, including density, viscosity, surface tension coefficient and saturated vapor pressure. In addition, the paper also presents the calculation of the distillation curve of multicomponent surrogates of kerosene, which is the main characteristic of evaporation. The calculation results show good agreement with experimental data - for all properties, the maximum error did not exceed 10%. Thus, a methodology has been developed for determining the properties of multicomponent fuels, which will be used to form surrogates for aviation kerosene, which also would take into account the properties that affect the atomization and evaporation characteristics.
