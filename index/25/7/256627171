Growing global demand for food, coupled with continuing labor shortages, motivate the need for automated agricultural harvesting. While some specialty crops (e.g., apples, peaches, blueberries) can be harvested via existing harvesting modalities, fruits such as blackberries and raspberries require delicate handling to mitigate fruit damage that could significantly impact marketability. This motivates the development of soft robotic solutions that enable efficient, delicate harvesting. This paper presents the design, fabrication, and feasibility testing of a tendon-driven soft gripping system focused on blackberries, which are a fragile fruit susceptible to post-harvest damage. The gripper is low-cost and small form factor, allowing for the integration of a micro-servo for tendon retraction, a near-infrared (NIR) based blackberry ripeness sensor utilizing the reflectance modality for identifying fully ripe blackberries, and an endoscopic camera for visual servoing. The gripper was used to harvest 139 berries with manual positioning in two separate field tests. Field testing found an average retention force of 2.06 N and 6.08 N for ripe and unripe blackberries, respectively. Sensor tests identified an average reflectance of 16.78 and 21.70 for ripe and unripe blackberries, respectively, indicating a clear distinction between the two ripeness levels. Finally, the soft robotic gripper was integrated onto a UR5 robot arm and successfully harvested fifteen artificial blackberries in a lab setting using visual servoing.
