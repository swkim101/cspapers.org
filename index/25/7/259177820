Digital Twin brings a new realization approach to the modeling of mobile networks. Mobile networks, as complex systems comprising multiple components, such as mobile users, base stations, and wireless environments, have intricate interactions and relationships with each other. By creating a virtual replica of each physical mobile network entity in a virtual space, we build a scalable digital twin system for mobile networks with generative AI. The system can interact with multiple optimizers to evaluate and display real-time simulation results. A companion video can be accessed using the link below. https://youtu.be/xtcBIXPzvkc
