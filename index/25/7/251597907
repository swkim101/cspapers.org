The eighth edition of the workshop on Mining Actionable Insights from Social Networks (MAISoN 2022) took place virtually on April 26th, 2022, co-located with the ACM Web Conference 2022 (WWW 2022). This year, we organized a special edition with focus on mental health and social media. The aim of this edition was to bring together researchers from different disciplines to discuss research that goes beyond descriptive analysis of social media data and instead investigate different techniques that use social media data for building diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analysis models for mental health applications. This topic attracted a lot of interest from the community especially because of all the considerations surrounding the impact of social media during the COVID-19 pandemic which has impacted on peopleâ€™s mental health issues.
