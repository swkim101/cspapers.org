Active lower-limb prostheses could enable more natural assisted locomotion by contributing net positive work through important gait events, such as ankle push-off. This paper uses multi-contact models of locomotion together with force-based nonlinear optimization-based controllers to achieve human-like kinematic behavior, including ankle push-off, on a powered transfemoral prosthesis. In particular, we leverage model-based control approaches for dynamic bipedal robotic walking to develop a systematic method to realize human-like walking on a powered prosthesis that does not require subject- specific tuning. The proposed controller is implemented on a prosthesis for 2 subjects without tuning between subjects, emulating subject-specific human kinematic trends on the prosthesis joints. These experimental results demonstrate that our force- based nonlinear control approach achieves better tracking of human-like kinematic trajectories, with an average RMSE of 0.0223 during weight-bearing, compared to 2 non-force-sensing methods with an average RMSE of 0.0411 and 0.0430.
