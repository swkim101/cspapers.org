Social media platforms provide fertile ground for investigating the processes of identity creation and communication that shape individual and public opinion. The computational methods used in social network analysis have opened the way for new approaches to be used to understand the psychological and social processes that occur when users take part in online social movements or digital activism. The research in this paper takes an interdisciplinary approach bridging social identity and deindividuation theories to show how shared, individual social identities merge into a collective identity using computational techniques. We demonstrate a novel approach to evaluating the emergence of collective identity by measuring: 1) the statistical similarity of discussion topics within online communities and 2) the strength of these communities by examining network modularity and assortative properties of the network. To accomplish this, we examined the online connective action campaign of the #stopthesteal movement that emerged during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Our dataset consisted of 838,395 tweets posted by 178,296 users collected from January 04, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The results show that the network becomes more cohesive and topic similarity increases within communities leading up to and just after the elections (event 1) and the U.S. Capitol riot (event 2). Taking this multi-method approach of measuring content and network structure over time helps researchers and social scientists understand the emergence of a collective community as it is being constructed. The use of computational methods to study collective identity formation can help researchers identify the behaviors and social dynamics emerging from this type of cyber-collective movement that often serve as catalysts for these types of events. Finally, this research offers a new way to assess the psycho-social drivers of participant behaviors in cyber collective action.
