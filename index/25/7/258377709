Algospeak refers to social media users intentionally altering or substituting words when creating or sharing online content, for example, using ‘le$bean’ for ‘lesbian’. This study discusses the characteristics of algospeak as a computer-mediated language phenomenon on TikTok with regards to users’ algorithmic literacy and their awareness of how the platform’s algorithms work. We then present results from an interview study with TikTok creators on their motivations to utilize algospeak. Our results indicate that algospeak is used to oppose TikTok’s algorithmic moderation system in order to prevent unjust content violations and shadowbanning when posting about benign yet seemingly unwanted subjects on TikTok. In this, we find that although algospeak helps to prevent consequences, it often impedes the creation of quality content. We provide an adapted definition of algospeak and new insights into user-platform interactions in the context of algorithmic systems and algorithm awareness.
