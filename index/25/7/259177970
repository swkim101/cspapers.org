This paper presents the design and implementation of Fusang, a low-barrier system that brings accurate and robust 3D object recognition to Commercial-Off-The-Shelf mmWave devices. The basic idea of Fusang is leveraging the large bandwidth of mmWave Radars to capture a unique set of fine-grained reflected responses generated by object shapes. Moreover, Fusang constructs two novel graph-structured features to robustly represent the reflected responses of the signal in the frequency domain and IQ domain, and carefully designs a neural network to accurately recognize objects even in different multipath scenarios. We have implemented a prototype of Fusang on a commodity mmWave Radar device. Our experiments with 24 different objects show that Fusang achieves a mean accuracy of 97% in different multipath environments.
