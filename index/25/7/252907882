We present a new robotic drawing system based on stroke-based rendering (SBR). Our motivation is the artistic quality of the whole performance. Not only should the generated strokes in the final drawing resemble the input image, but the stroke sequence should also exhibit a human artist's planning process. Thus, when a robot executes the drawing task, both the drawing results and the way the robot executes would look artistic. Our SBR system is based on image segmentation and depth estimation. It generates the drawing strokes in an order that allows for the intended shape to be perceived quickly and for its detailed features to be filled in and emerge gradually when observed by the human. This ordering represents a stroke plan that the drawing robot should follow to create an artistic rendering of images. We experimentally demonstrate that our SBR-based drawing makes visually pleasing artistic images, and our robotic system can replicate the result with proper sequences of stroke drawing.
