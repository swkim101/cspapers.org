Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to an abundance of online discourse: claims and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts. This constitutes a valuable source of insights for studies into mis- / disinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting. While knowledge graphs promise to provide the key to a Web of structured information, they are mainly focused on facts without keeping track of the diversity, connection or temporal evolution of online discourse. As opposed to facts, claims and viewpoints are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly depends on the context and a variety of intentional or unintended meanings, where terminology and conceptual understandings strongly diverge across communities from computational social science, to argumentation mining, fact-checking, or viewpoint/stance detection. The 2nd International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Online Discourse Analysis (BeyondFacts’22, equivalently abbreviated as KnOD’22) aims at strengthening the relations between these communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling, extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It addresses the need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and reuse, in support of studies into the analysis of societal debates.
