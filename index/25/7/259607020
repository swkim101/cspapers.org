Scribble supervised semantic segmentation has achieved great advances in pseudo label exploitation, yet suffers insufficient label exploration for the mass of unannotated regions. In this work, we propose a novel exploratory inference learning (EIL) framework, which facilitates efficient probing on unlabeled pixels and promotes selecting confident candidates for boosting the evolved segmentation. The exploration of unannotated regions is formulated as an iterative decision-making process, where a policy searcher learns to infer in the unknown space and the reward to the exploratory policy is based on a contrastive measurement of candidates. In particular, we devise the contrastive reward with the intra-class attraction and the inter-class repulsion in the feature space w.r.t the pseudo labels. The unlabeled exploration and the labeled exploitation are jointly balanced to improve the segmentation, and framed in a close-looping end-to-end network. Comprehensive evaluations on the benchmark datasets (PASCAL VOC 2012 and PASCAL Context) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed EIL when compared with other state-of-the-art methods for the scribble-supervised semantic segmentation problem.
