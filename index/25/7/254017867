Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing procedure for the subsequent HSI applications. Unfortunately, though witnessing the development of deep learning in HSI denoising area, existing convolution-based methods face the trade-off between computational efficiency and capability to model non-local characteristics of HSI. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (SST) to alleviate this problem. To fully explore intrinsic similarity characteristics in both spatial dimension and spectral dimension, we conduct non-local spatial self-attention and global spectral self-attention with Transformer architecture. The window-based spatial self-attention focuses on the spatial similarity beyond the neighboring region. While, the spectral self-attention exploits the long-range dependencies between highly correlative bands. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods in quantitative quality and visual results.
