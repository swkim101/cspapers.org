During operation, aerial manipulation systems are affected by various disturbances. Among them is a gravitational torque caused by the weight of the robotic arm. Common propeller-based actuation is ineffective against such disturbances because of possible overheating and high power consumption. To overcome this issue, in this paper we propose a winch-based actuation for the crane-stationed cable-suspended aerial manipulator. Three winch-controlled suspension rigging cables produce a desired cable tension distribution to generate a wrench that reduces the effect of gravitational torque. In order to coordinate the robotic arm and the winch-based actuation, a model-based hierarchical whole-body controller is adapted. It resolves two tasks: keeping the robotic arm end-effector at the desired pose and shifting the system center of mass in the location with zero gravitational torque. The performance of the introduced actuation system as well as control strategy is validated through experimental studies.
