1 FOREWORD Most of the recent progress in information retrieval (IR) and recommender systems has been fueled by deep learning: the success of neural networks has brought tremendous opportunities to model highly complex patterns for prediction. However, algorithmic advances on accurate predictions and improved user modeling are just a small part of designing considerations of a much larger system. IR and recommender systems difer from other machine learning domains because they are inherently part of an ecosystem – in the simplest case, a world of items and users. In these ecosystems, system designers face a broad range of decisions – e.g., how to balance popularity, which incentives should be given to which users, or what safeguards to put in place to ensure the platform thrives in the long-run. Some of the decision making problems are statistical and algorithmic in nature, such as coping with the uncertainty of data and models, while others can involve building systems for the satisfactory of multiple parties. In general, there are many complex decision-making challenges faced by real-world IR and recommender systems, but existing approaches often make oversimplifed assumptions about the environment, data, and human behavior. Ignoring those challenges or treating them simply as pattern recognition problems can cost the engagement, accessibility, fairness, inclusiveness, and ultimately the vitality of IR and recommendation systems.
