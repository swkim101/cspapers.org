Smart city platforms operate as central points of access for locally collected data. The smart city hub (SCHub) introduces a new concept that aims to homogenize data, service, human and material flows in cities. A proof of concept is based on non-typical data flows, like the ones that are collected by biotechnological activities, like Diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are responsible for 1 in 5 deaths globally. Most of the diet related NCDs are related to the gut microbiome, the microbial community that resides in our gastrointestinal tract. The imbalance or loss of microbiome diversity is one of the main factors leading to NCDs by affecting various functions, including energy metabolism, intestinal permeability, and brain function. Gut dysbiosis is reflected in altered concentrations of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), produced by the gut microbiota. A microcapsule system can play the role of a sensor that collects data from the local community and transmits it to the SCHub in order for the doctors to receive the appropriate patients information and define the appropriate treatment method; for the city to process anonymized information and measure community's health in diet terms. A prototype with a biosensor that correlates the amount of gut SCFAs with gut microbiome functional capacities is presented in this paper, together with the use-case scenario that engages the SCHub.
