Multivariate time series forecasting with hierarchical structure
is widely used in real-world applications, e.g., sales
predictions for the geographical hierarchy formed by cities,
states, and countries. The hierarchical time series (HTS) forecasting
includes two sub-tasks, i.e., forecasting and reconciliation.
In the previous works, hierarchical information is only
integrated in the reconciliation step to maintain coherency,
but not in forecasting step for accuracy improvement. In this
paper, we propose two novel tree-based feature integration
mechanisms, i.e., top-down convolution and bottom-up attention
to leverage the information of the hierarchical structure
to improve the forecasting performance. Moreover, unlike
most previous reconciliation methods which either rely
on strong assumptions or focus on coherent constraints only,
we utilize deep neural optimization networks, which not only
achieve coherency without any assumptions, but also allow
more flexible and realistic constraints to achieve task-based
targets, e.g., lower under-estimation penalty and meaningful
decision-making loss to facilitate the subsequent downstream
tasks. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that
our tree-based feature integration mechanism achieves superior
performances on hierarchical forecasting tasks compared
to the state-of-the-art methods, and our neural optimization
networks can be applied to real-world tasks effectively without
any additional effort under coherence and task-based constraints.
