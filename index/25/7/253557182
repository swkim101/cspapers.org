This paper aims to take a new look at a novel security solution for 5G-based Internet of things (IoT) networks using quantum key distribution (QKD). Quantum keys are created and sent from a key distribution server to IoT gateways thanks to radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems. More specifically, the raw key is encoded into the intensity of radio-frequency subcarrier before being sent to the gNB by optical fiber. It is then wirelessly forwarded to IoT gateways through radio frequency links. The major findings of the study reveal that the proposed system is an effective approach in order to distribute the quantum key with low quantum bit error rate and high secret key rate for 5G-based IoT networks.
