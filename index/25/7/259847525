Duan, Wu and Zhou (FOCS 2023) recently obtained the improved upper bound on the exponent of square matrix multiplication $\omega<2.3719$ by introducing a new approach to quantify and compensate the ``combination loss"in prior analyses of powers of the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor. In this paper we show how to use this new approach to improve the exponent of rectangular matrix multiplication as well. Our main technical contribution is showing how to combine this analysis of the combination loss and the analysis of the fourth power of the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor in the context of rectangular matrix multiplication developed by Le Gall and Urrutia (SODA 2018).
