We introduce inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) as an effective paradigm for training abstractive summarization models, imitating human summarization behaviors. Our IRL model estimates the reward function using a suite of important sub-rewards for summarization and concurrently optimizes the policy network. Experimental results across datasets in different domains (CNN/DailyMail and WikiHow) and various model sizes (BART-base and BART-large) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed IRL model for summarization over MLE and RL baselines. The resulting summaries exhibit greater similarity to human-crafted gold references, outperforming MLE and RL baselines on metrics such as ROUGE, coverage, novelty, compression ratio, factuality, and human evaluations.
