These days, ELMo [3], BERT [1], BART [2] and other similarly cutely-named models appear to have dramatically advanced the state of the art in basically every problem in natural language processing and information retrieval. It can leave a researcher wondering whether there is more to language processing than deploying or fine-tuning contextual word embeddings. What of formal semantics and knowledge representation? What value do these bring to text analysis, either in modelling or in task definitions? In this talk, I will try to explore these questions, from the perspective of my long-running experiences in biomedical information extraction and literature exploration. Perhaps we can shift the academic conversation from a one-model-fits-all solution for individual tasks to a more nuanced consideration of complex, multi-faceted problems in which such models certainly can play a critical role but aren’t necessarily “all you need” [4].
