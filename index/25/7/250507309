MOSAIX is a new robot swarm platform built to be used in social settings. Consisting of up to 100 individual robot Tiles, MOSAIX is a social swarm system, aimed at helping humans in social tasks such as opinion-mixing and brainstorming. MOSAIX also has the potential to be used as a platform to study human-swarm interaction and swarm expressivity. MOSAIX is intended to be used outside laboratory settings and has already been used to collect 154 opinions about climate change in a local shopping mall, used by participants to create collaborative art and used as an educational tool for schoolchildren. We also discuss future applications, such as MOSAIX acting as smart post-it notes for ideation activities.
