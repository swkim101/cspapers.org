Information extraction (IE) mainly focuses on three highly correlated subtasks, i.e., entity extraction, relation extraction and event extraction. Recently, there are studies using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) to utilize the intrinsic correlations among these three subtasks. AMR based models are capable of building the relationship of arguments. However, they are hard to deal with relations. In addition, the noises of AMR (i.e., tags unrelated to IE tasks, nodes with unconcerned conception, and edge types with complicated hierarchical structures) disturb the decoding processing of IE. As a result, the decoding processing limited by the AMR cannot be worked effectively. To overcome the shortages, we propose an Interactive Information Extraction (InterIE) model based on a novel Semantic Information Graph (SIG). SIG can guide our InterIE model to tackle the three subtasks jointly. Furthermore, the well-designed SIG without noise is capable of enriching entity and event trigger representation, and capturing the edge connection between the information types. Experimental results show that our InterIE achieves state-of-the-art performance on all IE subtasks on the benchmark dataset (i.e., ACE05-E+ and ACE05-E). More importantly, the proposed model is not sensitive to the decoding order, which goes beyond the limitations of AMR based methods.
