Partial Label Learning (PLL) aims to learn from training data where each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, among which only one is correct. In this paper, we formulate the task of PLL problem as an ``instance-label'' matching selection problem, and propose a DeepGNN-based graph matching PLL approach to solve it. Specifically, we first construct all instances and labels as graph nodes into two different graphs respectively, and then integrate them into a unified matching graph by connecting each instance to its candidate labels. Afterwards, the graph attention mechanism is adopted to aggregate and update all nodes state on the instance graph to form structural representations for each instance. Finally, each candidate label is embedded into its corresponding instance and derives a matching affinity score for each instance-label correspondence with a progressive cross-entropy loss. Extensive experiments on various data sets have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method.
