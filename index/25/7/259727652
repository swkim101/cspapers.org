Powerful domain-independent planners have been developed to solve various types of planning problems. 
These planners often require a model of the acting agent's actions, given in some planning domain description language. 
Yet obtaining such an action model is a notoriously hard task. 
This task is even more challenging in mission-critical domains, where a trial-and-error approach to learning how to act is not an option. 
In such domains, the action model used to generate plans must be safe, in the sense that plans generated with it must be applicable and achieve their goals. 
Learning safe action models for planning has been recently explored for domains in which states are sufficiently described with Boolean variables. 
In this work, we go beyond this limitation and propose the NSAM algorithm. 
NSAM runs in time that is polynomial in the number of observations and, under certain conditions, is guaranteed to return safe action models. 
We analyze its worst-case sample complexity, which may be intractable for some domains. Empirically, however, NSAM can quickly learn a safe action model that can solve most problems in the domain.
