The existing datasets are mostly composed of official documents, statements, news articles, and so forth. So far, only a little attention has been paid to the numerals in financial social comments. Therefore, this paper presents CFinNumAttr, a financial numeral attribute dataset in Chinese via annotating the stock reviews and comments collected from social networking platform. We also conduct several experiments on the CFinNumAttr dataset with state-of-the-art methods to discover the importance of the financial numeral attributes. The experimental results on the CFinNumAttr dataset show that the numeral attributes in social reviews or comments contain rich semantic information, and the numeral clue extraction and attribute classification tasks can make a great improvement in financial text understanding.
