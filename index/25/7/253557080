The aim of this paper is to investigate a security solution in the physical layer of a wireless channel. By considering secrecy outage probability, a method of maximizing the average secrecy throughput through adaptive power and transmissions rate with Artificial Noise (AN) will be presented. This system performance secrecy throughput is evaluated by the different impacts of system parameters. The results show that transmissions with AN and with adaptive optimal power control will significantly increase the secrecy throughput.
