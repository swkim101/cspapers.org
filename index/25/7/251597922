Multivariate cooperative relations exist widely in the academic society. In-depth research on multivariate relationships can effectively promote the integration of disciplines and advance scientific and technological progress. The mining and analysis of advisor-advisee relationships in the cooperative network, as a hot research issue in sociology and other disciplines, is still facing various challenges such as the lack of universal models and the difficulty in identifying multivariate relationships. The traditional advisor-advisee relationship mining methods only focus on the binary relationship, and require secondary processing of node attributes and edge attributes. Therefore, based on the attributes of the node, edge, and network, we transfered the Capsule Network to multivariate relation analysis. The experimental results proved the simplicity and reliability of this model. And we studied the effects of the network feature vectorsâ€™ dimension, routing iterations, and normalization on the performance of the Capsule Network. Considering that Capsule Network takes a long training time, we adopted Warm Restarts method to speed up the training process. In addition, we also used the model to generate a large-scale multivariate academic genealogy.
