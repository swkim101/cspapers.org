Representations of temporal networks arising from a stream of edges lie at the heart of models learned on it and its performance on downstream applications. While previous work on dynamic modeling and embedding have focused on representing a stream of timestamped edges using a time-series of graphs based on a specific time-scale τ (e.g., 1 month), we introduce the notion of an ϵ -graph time-series that uses a fixed number of edges for each graph, and show its effectiveness in capturing fundamental structural graph statistics over time. The results indicate that the ϵ -graph time-series representation effectively captures the structural properties of the graphs across time whereas the commonly used τ -graph time-series representation captures the frequency of edges and temporal patterns with respect to their arrival in the application time. These results have many important implications especially on the design of new GNN-based models for temporal networks as well as for understanding existing models and their limitations.
