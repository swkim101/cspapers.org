In this paper we present the 2nd edition of the Scientific Knowledge: Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2022) workshop. Sci-K aims to explore innovative solutions and ideas for the generation of approaches, data models, and infrastructures (e.g., knowledge graphs) for supporting, directing, monitoring and assessing the scientific knowledge and progress. This edition is also a reflection point as the community is seeking alternative solutions to the now-defunct Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG).
