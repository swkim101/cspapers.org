We study sublinear time algorithms for estimating the size of maximum matching. After a long line of research, the problem was finally settled by Behnezhad [FOCS’22], in the regime where one is willing to pay an approximation factor of 2. Very recently, Behnezhad et al. [SODA’23] improved the approximation factor to (2−1/2O(1/γ)) using n1+γ time. This improvement over the factor 2 is, however, minuscule and they asked if even 1.99-approximation is possible in n2−Ω(1) time. We give a strong affirmative answer to this open problem by showing (1.5+є)-approximation algorithms that run in n2−Θ(є2) time. Our approach is conceptually simple and diverges from all previous sublinear-time matching algorithms: we show a sublinear time algorithm for computing a variant of the edge-degree constrained subgraph (EDCS), a concept that has previously been exploited in dynamic [Bernstein Stein ICALP’15, SODA’16], distributed [Assadi et al. SODA’19] and streaming [Bernstein ICALP’20] settings, but never before in the sublinear setting.
