Improving model robustness against potential modality noise, as an essential step for adapting multimodal models to real-world applications, has received increasing attention among researchers. For Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), there is also a debate on whether multimodal models are more effective against noisy features than unimodal ones. Stressing on intuitive illustration and in-depth analysis of these concerns, we present Robust-MSA, an interactive platform that visualizes the impact of modality noise as well as simple defence methods to help researchers know better about how their models perform with imperfect real-world data.
