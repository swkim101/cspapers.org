In this tutorial, we aim to shed light on the task of recommending a set of multiple items at once. In this scenario, historical interaction data between users and items could also be in the form of a sequence of interactions with sets of items. Complex sets of items being recommended together occur in different and diverse domains, such as grocery shopping with so-called baskets and fashion set recommendation with a focus on outfits rather than individual clothing items. We describe the current landscape of research and expose our participants to real-world examples of item set recommendation. We further provide our audience with hands-on experience via a notebook session. Finally, we describe open challenges and call for further research in the area, which we hope will inspire both early stage and more experienced researchers.
