The inclusion of autistic people can be augmented by a mobile app that provides information without a human mediator making information perception more liberating for people in the spectrum. This paper is an overview of a doctoral work dedicated to the development of a web-based mobile tool for supporting the inclusion of people on the autism spectrum. The work includes UX/UI research conducted with psychiatry experts, web information retrieval study and neural question-answering research. Currently, the study results comprise several mobile app layouts, a retriever-reader model design and fine-tuned neural network for extractive question-answering.
