LiDAR-based SLAM may easily fail in adverse weathers (e.g., rain, snow, smoke, fog), while mmWave Radar remains unaffected. However, current researches are primarily focused on 2D $(x,y)$ or 3D ($x, y$, doppler) Radar and 3D LiDAR, while limited work can be found for 4D Radar ($x, y, z$, doppler). As a new entrant to the market with unique characteristics, 4D Radar outputs 3D point cloud with added elevation information, rather than 2D point cloud; compared with 3D LiDAR, 4D Radar has noisier and sparser point cloud, making it more challenging to extract geometric features (edge and plane). In this paper, we propose a full system for 4D Radar SLAM consisting of three modules: 1) Front-end module performs scan-to-scan matching to calculate the odometry based on GICP, considering the probability distribution of each point; 2) Loop detection utilizes multiple rule-based loop pre-filtering steps, followed by an intensity scan context step to identify loop candidates, and odometry check to reject false loop; 3) Back-end builds a pose graph using front-end odometry, loop closure, and optional GPS data. Optimal pose is achieved through $\mathrm{g}2\mathrm{o}$. We conducted real experiments on two platforms and five datasets (ranging from 240m to 4.8km) and will make the code open-source to promote further research at: https://github.com/zhuge2333/4DRadarSLAM
