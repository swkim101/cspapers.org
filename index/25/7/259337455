Soft, wearable systems hold promise for a wide variety of new or enhanced applications in the realm of human-computer interaction, physiological monitoring, wear-able robotics, and a host of other human-centric devices. Soft sensor systems have been developed concurrently in order to allow these wearable systems to respond intelligently with their surroundings. A recently reported sensing mechanism based on the strain-mediated contact in anisotropically resistive structures (SCARS) is an attractive solution due to its high sensing resolution, low-profile nature, and high mechanical resilience. Furthermore, the resistance-based output provides a simple electronic readout, facilitating its use in a wide variety of applications. However, previous iterations of the sensing mech-anism have exhibited stress relaxation and hysteretic behaviors that limit the scope of its use. Here, we report an iteration of the SCARS mechanism that uses silicone-based materials with low mechanical loss in order to improve the sensor signal stability and bandwidth. A new fabrication approach is developed which permits the incorporation of a liquid elastomer adhesive layer while also preserving the SCARS sensing functionality. The silicone-based SCARS sensors exhibited fast stress relaxation response (< 1 s) and reduced cyclic drift properties by more than half that of previously reported designs. A physiological monitoring demonstration is presented, validating that the new sensor design is mechanically resilient to such applications and has potential for use in real-world wearable use cases.
