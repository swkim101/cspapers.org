We present a novel method for 3D shape representation learning using multi-scale wavelet decomposition. Previous works often decompose 3D shapes into complementary components in spatial domain at a single scale. In this work, we study to decompose 3D shapes into sub-bands components in frequency domain at multiple scales, resulting in a hierarchical decomposition tree in a principled manner rooted in multi-resolution wavelet analysis . Specifically, we propose Adaptive Wavelet Transformer Network (AWT-Net) that firstly generates approximation or detail wavelet coefficients per point, classifying each point into high or low sub-bands components, using lifting scheme at multiple scales recursively and hierarchically. Then, AWT-Net exploits Transformer to enhance the original shape features by querying and fusing features from different but integrated sub-bands. The wavelet coefficients can be learned without direct supervision on coefficients, and AWT-Net is fully differentiable and can be learned in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AWT-Net achieves competitive performance on 3D shape classification and segmentation benchmarks.
