This poster presents a multi-access network testbed designed to serve as an essential tool for research on Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) in 4G and 5G networks. By integrating Non-3GPP Inter-Working Function (N3IWF) and 5G core from different open-source projects, our testbed enables multiaccess sessions in 4G-LTE, 5G NSA, and 5G SA. Furthermore, our testbed incorporates a transport converter into the 5G core network, allowing User Equipment (UE) to utilize multi-access networks, even in the absence of multi-path TCP (MPTCP) support from external servers. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our testbed by utilizing ATSSS for detecting cybersecurity attacks, marking the first instance of employing ATSSS capabilities to improve cybersecurity in 4G/5G networks.
