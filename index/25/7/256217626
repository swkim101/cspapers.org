In this article we have investigated the wrinkling formation at the first stage of a blank forming process while drawing it in a die with a tapered conical clamp. We have presented a method for determining the axisymmetric blank edge tension in a cylindrical coordinates system. We have determined the optimal size of the blank for a stable flow of the first stage of the process. The studies were carried out using the results of ANSYS/LS-DYNA simulation.
