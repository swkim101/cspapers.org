Wikidata Atlas is an online system that allows users to explore Wikidata items on an interactive global map; for example, users can explore the global distribution of all lighthouses described by Wikidata. Designing such a system poses challenges in terms of scalability, where some classes have hundreds of thousands of instances; efficiency, where visualisations are generated live; freshness, where we want changes on Wikidata to be reflected as they happen in the system; and usability, where we aim for the system to be accessible for a broad audience. Herein we describe the design and implementation of the system in light of these challenges.
