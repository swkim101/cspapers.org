Paper circuitry has been extensively explored by HCI researchers as a means of creating interactive objects. However, these approaches focus on creating desktop or handheld objects, and paper as a wearable material remains under-explored. We present SkinPaper, a fabrication approach using silicone-treated washi paper to weave lightweight and easy-to-fabricate on-skin interactions. We adopt techniques from paper weaving and basketry weaving practices to create paper-woven structures that can conform to the body. Our approach uses off-the-shelf materials to facilitate a highly customizable fabrication process. We showcase eight case studies to illustrate our approachâ€™s two to three-dimensional forms. To understand the expressiveness of the design space, we conducted a workshop study in which weavers created paper-woven on-skin interactions. We draw insights from the studies to understand the opportunities for paper-woven on-skin interactions.
