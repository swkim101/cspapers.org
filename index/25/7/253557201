This paper proposes a beamformer based on the null synthesis technique for uniform rectangular arrays of half-wavelength dipoles. This beamformer uses complex weight control to produce adaptive patterns with small distortions in sidelobes while preserving the main lobe and imposing nulls in the directions of interfering signals. The beamformer does not require any optimization algorithm to obtain nulled patterns; therefore, it is a potential solution to adaptive antenna systems with high performance. To demonstrate the pattern nulling ability, the proposed beamformer is evaluated through various scenarios and compared to a beamformer based on binary particle swarm optimization.
