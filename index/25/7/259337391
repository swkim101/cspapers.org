HOI detection is essential for human-computer interaction, especially in behavior detection and robot manipulation. Existing mainstream transformer methods of HOI detection are focused on single-stream detection only, e.g., $image \rightarrow HOI(\mathcal{P}_{1})$, or $image \rightarrow HO\rightarrow I(\mathcal{P}_{2})$. Both paths have their own characteristics of concern, so we propose a novel method, using the Secondary path $(\mathcal{P}_{2})$ Guides the Primary path $(\mathcal{P}_{1})$ in Transformers (SGPT). SGPT contains two core modules: the Dual-Path Consistency (DPC) module and the Instance Interaction Attention (IIA) module. DPC keeps human, object and interaction consistent on the dual-path and lets $\mathcal{P}_{2}$ guide $\mathcal{P}_{1}$ to learn more meaningful features. IIA fuses human and object to enhance interaction in $\mathcal{P}_{2}$, which allows instance to constrain interaction. Our proposed dual-path are employed during training, and only the $\mathcal{P}_{1}$ path is used for inference. Hence, SGPT improves generalization without increasing model capacity in HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets compared to the state-of-the-arts.
