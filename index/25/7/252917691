We show that approximate graph colouring is not solved by any level of the affine integer programming (AIP) hierarchy. To establish the result, we translate the problem of exhibiting a graph fooling a level of the AIP hierarchy into the problem of constructing a highly symmetric crystal tensor. In order to prove the existence of crystals in arbitrary dimension, we provide a combinatorial characterisation for realisable systems of tensors; i.e., sets of low-dimensional tensors that can be realised as the projections of a single high-dimensional tensor.
