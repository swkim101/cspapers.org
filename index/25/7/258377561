Existing recommendation methods based on multi-interest frameworks effectively model users from multiple aspects to represent complex user interests. However, more research still needs to be done on the behavior of users shopping for others. We propose a Multi-Demander Recommendation (MDR) model to learn different peopleâ€™s interests from a sequence of actions. We first decouple the feature embeddings of items to learn the static preferences of different demanders. Next, a weighted directed global graph is constructed to model the associations among item categories. We partition short sequences by time intervals and look up category embeddings from the graph to capture dynamic intents. Finally, preferences and intentions are combined with learning the interests of different demanders. The conducted experiments demonstrate that our model improves the accuracy of recommendations.
