Generating and maintaining API documentation with integrity and consistency can be time-consuming and expensive for evolving APIs. To solve this problem, several approaches have been proposed to automatically generate high-quality API documentation based on a combination of knowledge from different web sources. However, current researches are weak in handling unpopular APIs and cannot generate structured API documentation. Hence, in this poster, we propose a hybrid technique(namely gDoc) for the automatic generation of structured API documentation. We first present a fine-grained search-based strategy to generate the description for partial API parameters via computing the relevance between various APIs, ensuring the consistency of API documentation. Then, we employ the cross-modal pretraining Seq2Seq model M6 to generate a structured API document for each API, which treats the document generation problem as a translation problem. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithm to extract practical parameter examples from API request logs. The experiments evaluated on the online system show that this workâ€™s approach significantly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of API document generation.
