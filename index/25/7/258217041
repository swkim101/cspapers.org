The creativity support tools can enhance the hands-on multidisciplinary learning experience by drawing interest in the process of creating the outcome. We present AutomataStage, an AR-mediated creativity support tool for hands-on multidisciplinary learning. AutomataStage utilizes a video see-through interface to support the creation of Interactive Automata. The combination of building blocks and low-cost materials increases the expressiveness. The generative design method and one-to-one guide support the idea development process. It also provides a hardware see-through feature with which inside parts and circuits can be seen and an operational see-through feature that shows the operation in real-time. The visual programming method with a state transition diagram supports the iterative process during the creation process. A user study shows that AutomataStage enabled the students to create diverse Interactive Automata within 40-minute sessions. By creating Interactive Automata, the participants could learn the basic concepts of components. See-through features allowed active exploration with interest while integrating the components. We discuss the implications of hands-on tools with interactive and kinetic content beyond multidisciplinary learning.
