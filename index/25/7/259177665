Video downscaling is an important component of adaptive video streaming, which tailors streaming to screen resolutions of different devices and optimizes picture quality under varying network conditions. With video downscaling, a high-resolution input video is downscaled into multiple lower-resolution videos. This is typically done by a conventional resampling filter like Lanczos. In this work, we describe how we improved Netflix video quality by developing neural networks for video downscaling and deploying them at scale.
