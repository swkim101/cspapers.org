As a popular way of representing holographic video or volumetric video, point cloud video can provide users with a highly immersive viewing experience of 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF) and is expected to become the mainstream video format of the future. However, the real-time transmission of point cloud video faces many challenges due to the huge amount of data and the large search space of the optimization problem with constraints. To this end, we propose Horizon, a novel Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) based real-time point cloud video streaming system, which aims to maximize the user's viewing experience by predicting the next several steps through a rolling framework and uses a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based algorithm to achieve a real-time solution to the rolling optimization problem. We have prototyped this system and demonstrated its performance on a state-of-the-art wireless network.
