Quantum computers can theoretically have significant acceleration over classical computers; but, the near-future era of quantum computing is limited due to small number of qubits that are also error prone. QUILT is a framework for performing multi-class classification task designed to work effectively on current error-prone quantum computers. QUILT is evaluated with real quantum machines as well as with projected noise levels as quantum machines become more noise free. QUILT demonstrates up to 85% multi-class classification accuracy with the MNIST dataset on a five-qubit system.
