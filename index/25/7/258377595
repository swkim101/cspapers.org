Vehicular Metaverses are widely considered as the next Internet revolution to build a 3D virtual world with immersive virtual-real interaction for passengers and drivers. In vehicular Metaverse applications, avatars are digital representations of on-board users to obtain and manage immersive vehicular services (i.e., avatar tasks) in Metaverses and the data they generate. However, traditional Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data management solutions have serious data security risks and privacy protection. Fortunately, blockchain-based Web 3.0 enables avatars to have an ownership identity to securely manage the data owned by users in a decentralized and transparent manner. To ensure usersâ€™ immersive experiences and securely manage their data, avatar tasks often require significant computing resources. Therefore, it is impractical for the vehicles to process avatar tasks locally, massive computation resources are needed to support the avatar tasks. To this end, offloading avatar tasks to nearby RoadSide Units (RSUs) is a promising solution to avoid computation overload. To ensure real-time and continuous Metaverse services, the avatar tasks should be migrated among the RSUs when the vehicle navigation. It is challenging for the vehicles to independently decide whether migrate or not according to current and future avatar states. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new avatar task migration framework for vehicular Metaverses. We then formulate the avatar task migration problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and apply a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) algorithm to dynamically make migration decisions for avatar tasks. Numerous results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing baselines for avatar task migration and enables immersive vehicular Metaverse services.
