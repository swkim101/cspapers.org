Robotic explorers are essential tools for gathering information about regions that are inaccessible to humans. For applications like planetary exploration or search and rescue, robots use prior knowledge about the area to guide their search. Ergodic search methods find trajectories that effectively balance exploring unknown regions and exploiting prior information. In many search based problems, the robot must take into account multiple factors such as scientific information gain, risk, and energy, and update its belief about these dynamic objectives as they evolve over time. However, existing ergodic search methods either consider multiple static objectives or consider a single dynamic objective, but not multiple dynamic objectives. We address this gap in existing methods by presenting an algorithm called Dynamic Multi-Objective Ergodic Search (D-MO-ES) that efficiently plans an ergodic trajectory on multiple changing objectives. Our experiments show that our method requires up to nine times less compute time than a na√Øve approach with comparable coverage of each objective.
