Open-source software (OSS) plays a vital role in the modern software ecosystem. However, the maintenance and sustainability of OSS projects can be challenging. In this paper, we present the CrOSSD project, which aims to build a database of OSS projects and measure their current project “health” status. In the project, we will use both quantitative and qualitative metrics to evaluate the health of OSS projects. The quantitative metrics will be gathered through automated crawling of meta information such as the number of contributors, commits and lines of code. Qualitative metrics will be gathered for selected “critical” projects through manual analysis and automated tools, including aspects such as sustainability, funding, community engagement and adherence to security policies. The results of the analysis will be presented on a user-friendly web platform, which will allow users to view the health of individual OSS projects as well as the overall health of the OSS ecosystem. With this approach, the CrOSSD project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date view of the health of OSS projects, making it easier for developers, maintainers and other stakeholders to understand the health of OSS projects and make informed decisions about their use and maintenance.
