The paper presents an algorithm for the automated selection of the optimal gate position of injection molding parts, including engine brackets from short fibers reinforced polymers. The goal of the optimization is to minimize the weighted sum of the maximum value of the equivalent stress and average stress in the weld line. The calculation of the objective function is achieved accounting the interaction between the structural analysis and injection molding simulation. A developed metaheuristic algorithm for the optimization of the gate position is presented. The design variable is the number of the node on the selected surfaces of the mesh used for the injection molding simulation. As a case study a typical aerospace bracket is studied.
