Reflection is underexplored in Creativity Support Tool (CST) research, partly due to its ambiguous nature. We suggest that researchers could benefit from a measure of a CST’s capacity to support reflection. To this end, we detail the first stages of development of the Reflection in Creative Experience Questionnaire (RiCE) – a lightweight questionnaire for differentiating between creative user experiences which exhibit more or less moments of reflection. We develop RiCE through i) an expert review of questionnaire items (n=10) and ii) an exploratory factor analysis (n=300) of the reviewed items. We also present a user study testing RiCE (n=58) across two time points (one week apart) with novel interfaces designed for creative writing and music making. Although we do not confirm validity, we identify four factors for RiCE which we suggest are interpretable in a conceptually meaningful way. Our formative studies contribute towards supporting future explorations on reflection with CSTs.
