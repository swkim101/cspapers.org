Our research aims to reduce the cost of pressure sensor calibration through machine learning. Pressure sensor calibration is a standard process whereby freshly manufactured pressure sensors are subjected to various controlled temperature and pressure setpoints to compute a mapping between the sensor's output and true pressure. Traditionally this mapping is calculated by fitting a polynomial with calibration data. Obtaining this data is costly since a large spectrum of temperature and pressure setpoints are required to model the sensor's behavior.
 
 We present a machine learning approach to predict a pre-defined calibration polynomial's parameters while requiring only one-third of the calibration data. Our method learns a pattern from past calibration sessions to predict the calibration polynomial's parameters from partial calibration setpoints for any newly manufactured sensor. We design a novel polynomial hypernetwork coupled with Fourier features and a weighted loss to solve this problem. We perform extensive evaluations and show that the current industry-standard method fails under similar conditions. In contrast, our approach saves two-thirds of the calibration time and cost. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablations to study the effect of Fourier mapping and weighted loss. Code and a novel calibration dataset validated by calibration engineers are also made public.
