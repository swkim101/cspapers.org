Games can be powerful vehicles for gender identity exploration and self-reflection but are often subject to designers' biases including gender representation, limiting such opportunities. Using a game jam as a research-through-design method, alongside qualitative interviews with the creators, this paper explores how the process of creating games and the games themselves can facilitate exploration of and reflection on gender identity. We highlight aspects of identity people want to explore; how different game elements can support processes of exploring these, and what aspects are missing in games. Further, the process of creating and playing helped participants reflect on and reframe their understanding of gender regardless of their identity/experience. Finally, we reflect on the process of designing an inclusive jam around the topic of gender identity, which can be sensitive and divisive. Our work results in implications for the design of games and other potential tools for gender exploration.
