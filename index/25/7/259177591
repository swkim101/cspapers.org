With the continuous expansion of the DNN accelerator scale, inter-layer scheduling, which studies the allocation of computing resources to each layer and the computing order of all layers in a DNN, plays an increasingly important role in maintaining a high utilization rate and energy efficiency of DNN inference accelerators. However, current inter-layer scheduling is mainly conducted based on some heuristic patterns. The space of inter-layer scheduling has not been clearly defined, resulting in significantly limited optimization opportunities and a lack of understanding on different inter-layer scheduling choices and their consequences. To bridge the gaps, we first propose a uniform and systematic notation, the Resource Allocation Tree (RA Tree), to represent different inter-layer scheduling schemes and depict the overall space of inter-layer scheduling. Based on the notation, we then thoroughly analyze how different inter-layer scheduling choices influence the performance and energy efficiency of an accelerator step by step. Moreover, we show how to represent existing patterns in our notation and analyze their features. To thoroughly explore the space of the inter-layer scheduling for diverse tiled accelerators and workloads, we develop an end-to-end and highly-portable scheduling framework, SET. Compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source Tangram framework, SET can, on average, achieves 1.78Ã— performance improvement and 13.2% energy cost reduction simultaneously. Moreover, the SET framework will be open-sourced.
