The Web has grown considerably since its inception and opened up a multitude of opportunities for people all around the world for work, leisure, and learning. These opportunities were limited to western audiences earlier on, but globalization has now put almost the entire world online. While there is a growing social understanding and acknowledgment of various gender and ethnic groups in society, we still have a long way to go toward achieving equity in gender and ethnic representations, especially in the workplace. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the diversity and evenness in terms of gender and ethnicity of The WebConference participants over its 30 year history. The choice is motivated by the monumental contribution of this conference to the evolution of the web. In particular, we study the gender and ethnicity of program committee members, authors and other speakers at the conference between 1994-2022. We also generate the co-speaker network over the three decades to study how closely the speakers work with each other. Our findings show that we still have a long way to go before achieving fair representation at The WebConference, especially for female participants and individuals from non-White, non-Asian ethnicities.
