Laser-cutting is a promising fabrication method that empowers makers, including blind or visually-impaired (BVI) creators, to create technologies that fit their needs. Existing work on laser-cut accessibility has facilitated easier assembly as a workaround for existing models. However, laser-cut models are still not designed to accommodate the needs of BVI users. Integrating BVI needs can enrich the greater maker community by enabling cross-group discourse on laser-cut making. To investigate how laser-cut model design can be more accessible overall, we study laser-cut assembly as a process deeply intertwined with the fundamental design of laser-cut models. We present a study with seven sighted and seven BVI participants to compare their usage of laser-cut model affordances during assembly. Data for the BVI participants in this study originate from a previous work [13]. We identify assembly cues common or unique to sighted and BVI users, and discuss implications to improve general accessibility in laser-cut design.
