The 31st edition of the ACM Web Conference (Lyon, 2022 online) hosted the Third Data Literacy workshop. This series of Data Literacy workshops responds to the increasing relevance of data literacy in the field of education as well as to the need for a data literate workforce in our current data-driven economy and society. This half-day workshop included three presentations of the accepted and published papers, a keynote by a leading researcher in the field Ellen Mandinach, and a round table with principal investigators in European Data Literacy projects. In line with its two previous editions, this workshop aims to bring together a diverse community of practice and research from different fields with a common interest: equipping society with the necessary competencies to make sense of the sheer amounts of data to which we come across in our daily lives.
