Radar odometry may provide valuable input for surface vessels in several marine applications. The vulnerability of global positioning satellite systems to jamming and spoofing motivates the search for alternatives. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of W-band frequency modulated continuous wave radars in marine settings for odometry. A method to model radar resolution is presented and is further extend to include multiple radar frames. Numerical implementation relies on concepts from Lie theory. The proposed methods were evaluated on datasets collected from a ferry in a harbour area, where the average relative translation error was reduced to 3.07% compared to 14.2% of a baseline method.
