This paper studies a team coordination problem in a graph environment. Specifically, we incorporate “support” action which an agent can take to reduce the cost for its teammate to traverse some high cost edges. Due to this added feature, the graph traversal is no longer a standard multi-agent path planning problem. To solve this new problem, we propose a novel formulation that poses it as a planning problem in a joint state space: the joint state graph (JSG). Since the edges of JSG implicitly incorporate the support actions taken by the agents, we are able to now optimize the joint actions by solving a standard single-agent path planning problem in JSG. One main drawback of this approach is the curse of dimensionality in both the number of agents and the size of the graph. To improve scalability in graph size, we further propose a hierarchical decomposition method to perform path planning in two levels. We provide both theoretical and empirical complexity analyses to demonstrate the efficiency of our two algorithms.
