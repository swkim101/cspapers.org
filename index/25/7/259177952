This demo presents a working prototype of a live video surveillance IoT system that provides multi-class privacy preservation. The system can use a Raspberry Pi or a laptop to perform real-time face detection, compression and encryption on live video feeds. We design and implement novel methods to accelerate face detection and reduce miss detection for fast moving subjects. The implemented prototype demonstrates the feasibility to provide multi-class privacy-preserving feature and fine-grained access control of video content for real-time IoT applications.
