The waterdrops on windshields during driving can cause severe visual obstructions, which may lead to car accidents. Meanwhile, the waterdrops can also degrade the performance of a computer vision system in autonomous driving. To address these issues, we propose an attention-based framework that fuses the spatio-temporal representations from multiple frames to restore visual information occluded by waterdrops. Due to the lack of training data for video waterdrop removal, we propose a large-scale synthetic dataset with simulated waterdrops in complex driving scenes on rainy days. To improve the generality of our proposed method, we adopt a cross-modality training strategy that combines synthetic videos and real-world images. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method can generalize well and achieve the best waterdrop removal performance in complex real-world driving scenes.
