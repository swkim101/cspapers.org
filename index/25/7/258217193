This work studies the experiences of people who stutter (PWS) with videoconferencing (VC) and VC technologies. Our interview study with 13 adults who stutter uncovers extra challenges introduced by current VC platforms to people who stutter. While some of the challenges are a direct result of the characteristics of stuttering (e.g. people/systems mistaking pauses as end of turn), a bigger yet less visible challenge comes with the significant amount of emotional and cognitive effort required to manage one’s speech and identity over VC, in which people’s existing communication strategies - such as body language and eye contact - are under-supported and their biggest discomfort - such as seeing oneself stutter - are exacerbated by preset features like self view. Overall, our work sheds light on the structural barriers and the opportunities for PWS to engage and enjoy virtual communications via VC technologies.
