Tangent Model Composition (TMC) is a method to combine component models independently fine-tuned around a pre-trained point. Component models are tangent vectors to the pre-trained model that can be added, scaled, or subtracted to support incremental learning, ensembling, or unlearning. Component models are composed at inference time via scalar combination, reducing the cost of ensembling to that of a single model. TMC improves accuracy by 4.2% compared to ensembling non-linearly fine-tuned models at a 2.5× to 10× reduction of inference cost, growing linearly with the number of component models. Each component model can be forgotten at zero cost, with no residual effect on the resulting inference. When used for continual fine-tuning, TMC is not constrained by sequential bias and can be executed in parallel on federated data. TMC outperforms recently published continual fine-tuning methods almost uniformly on each setting – task-incremental, class-incremental, and data-incremental – on a total of 13 experiments across 3 benchmark datasets, despite not using any replay buffer. TMC is designed for composing models that are local to a pre-trained embedding, but could be extended to more general settings.
