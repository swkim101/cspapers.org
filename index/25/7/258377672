The current era is dominated by intelligent Question Answering (QA) systems that can instantly answer almost all their questions, saving users search time and increasing the throughput and precision in the applied domain. A vast amount of work is being carried out in QA systems to deliver better content satisfying users’ information needs [2]. Since QA systems are ascending the cycle of emerging technologies, there are potential research gaps that can be explored. QA systems form a significant part of Conversational Artificial Intelligent systems giving rise to a new research pathway, i.e., Conversational Question Answering (CQA) systems [32]. We propose to design and develop a CQA system leveraging Hypergraph-based techniques. The approach focuses on the multi-turn conversation and multi-context to gauge users’ exact information needs and deliver better answers. We further aim to address "supporting evidence-based retrieval" for fact-based responsible answer generation. Since the QA system requires a large amount of data and processing, we also intend to investigate hardware performance for effective system utilization.
