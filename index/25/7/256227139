The purpose of this paper is to analyze the CFD of a pulsed tube motor. Parametric studies are carried out at different ratios of the pulse tube length to the diameter. to investigate the effect of using different L/1 ratios for the length of the pulse tube to the length of the regenerator in order to identify the design parameters of the engine with the highest power output.
