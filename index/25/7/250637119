Knowledge distillation aims to transfer the information by minimizing the cross-entropy between the probabilistic outputs of the teacher and student network.

In this work, we propose an alternative distillation objective by maximizing the scoring rule, which quantitatively measures the agreement of a distribution to the reference distribution. 

We demonstrate that the proper and homogeneous scoring rule exhibits more preferable properties for distillation than the original cross entropy based approach. 

To that end, we present an efficient implementation of the distillation objective based on a pseudo-spherical scoring rule, which is a family of proper and homogeneous scoring rules. We refer to it as pseudo-spherical knowledge distillation. 

Through experiments on various model compression tasks, we validate the effectiveness of our method by showing its superiority over the original knowledge distillation. 

Moreover, together with structural distillation methods such as contrastive representation distillation, we achieve state of the art results in CIFAR100 benchmarks.
