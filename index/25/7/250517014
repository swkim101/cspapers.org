This paper introduces a design method for an efficient and agile quadruped robot. A mixed-integer optimization formulation including the number of gear teeth is derived to obtain the optimal gear ratio that minimizes cost for a running-trot with the target speed of 3 m/s. With the inclusion of integer constraints related to the number of gear teeth, detailed design considerations of gear trains can be included in the optimization process. Thermal dissipation of the motor controller is also taken into account in the optimization to consider heat generation during high-speed running. KAIST Hound, a 45 kg robot, designed with the obtained design parameters has successfully demonstrated a 3 m/s running-trot using a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC). Furthermore, the robot has proved its robustness by the demonstration of additional experiments such as 22Â° slope climbing, 3.2 km walking, and traversing a 35 cm obstacle.
