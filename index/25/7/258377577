Social networks are platforms where content creators and consumers share and consume content. The edge recommendation system, which determines who a member should connect with, significantly impacts the reach and engagement of the audience on such networks. This paper emphasizes improving the experience of inactive members (IMs) who do not have a large connection network by recommending better connections. To that end, we propose a multi-objective linear optimization framework and solve it using accelerated gradient descent. We report our findings regarding key business metrics related to user engagement on LinkedIn, a professional network with over 850 million members.
