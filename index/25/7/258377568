The utility of a search system for its users can be further enhanced by providing personalized results and recommendations within the search context. However, the research discussions around these aspects of search remain fragmented across different conferences and workshops. Hence, this workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from industry and academia to engage in the discussions of algorithmic and system challenges in search personalization and effectively recommending within search context.
