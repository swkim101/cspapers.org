Generally, image acquisition and storage requires a considerable amount of energy. To address this issue, we present an innovative approach towards developing a battery-free WiFi camera. Our system uses FRAM and DMA to cache images quickly, select appropriate color modes, and make some optimizations to the code, allowing for the acquisition and storage of a grayscale image of 144 Ã— 176 pixels using only 6mJ of energy in 96ms. Our proposed system provides a promising step towards the realization of a battery-free WiFi camera, enabling energy-efficient image acquisition and storage in applications such as environmental monitoring, surveillance, and IoT.
