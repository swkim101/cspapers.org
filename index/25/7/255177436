This study aims to construct a running simulator based on a motion generation and control system that enables the description of motion strategies using the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model. The problems of stability and robustness encountered in the running simulation with the SLIP model are elucidated, and stable running is achieved by controlling the stiffness and the attitude angle dynamically at touchdown, as well as human energy adjustment that is introduced to consider the active motion strategy. As a result, passive and active control by humans can be expressed, and a framework that can express the changes in running due to motion strategies is constructed. Finally, we discuss the possibility of describing and elucidating the motion strategies.
