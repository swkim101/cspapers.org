Prevailing methods for relation prediction in heterogeneous graphs including knowledge graphs aim at learning the latent representations (i.e., embeddings) of observed nodes and relations, and are thus limited to the transductive setting where the relation types must be known during training. In this paper, we propose ANalogy SubGraph Embedding Learning (GraphANGEL), a novel relation prediction framework that predicts relations between each node pair by checking whether the subgraphs containing the pair are similar to other subgraphs containing the considered relation. Each graph pattern explicitly represents a specific logical rule, which contributes to an inductive bias that facilitates generalization to unseen relation types and leads to more explainable predictive models. Our model consistently outperforms existing models in terms of heterogeneous graph based recommendation as well as knowledge graph completion. We also empirically demonstrate the capability of our model in generalizing to new relation types while producing explainable heat maps of attention scores across the discovered logics.
