SocialNLP is a new inter-disciplinary area of natural language processing (NLP) and social computing. We consider three plausible directions of SocialNLP: (1) addressing issues in social computing using NLP techniques; (2) solving NLP problems using information from social networks or social media; and (3) handling new problems related to both social computing and natural language processing. The 10th SocialNLP workshop is held at TheWebConf 2022 and NAACL 2022. For SocialNLP @ TheWebConf 2022, eventually we accepted six papers, including five research papers and one data paper. Each submission is reviewed by at least two reviewers. The acceptance ratio is 60%. We will also have a special event to celebrate the success of SocialNLP over the past ten years. Last, we sincerely thank to all authors, program committee members, and workshop chairs, for their great contributions and help in this edition of SocialNLP workshop.
