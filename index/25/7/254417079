Private information retrieval (PIR) is a cryptographic protocol that enables a wide range of privacy-preserving applications. Despite being extensively studied for decades, it is still not efficient enough to be used in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel PIR protocol named PIRANA, based on the recent advances in constant-weight codes. It is up to 188.6× faster than the original constant-weight PIR (presented in Usenix SEC ’22). Most importantly, PIRANA naturally supports multi-query. It allows a client to retrieve a batch of elements from the server with a very small extra-cost compared to retrieving a single element, which results in up to an 14.4× speedup over the state-of-the-art multi-query PIR (presented in Oakland ’23). We also discuss a way to extend PIRANA to labeled private set intersection (LPSI). Compared with existing LPSI protocols, PIRANA is more friendly to the scenarios where the database updates frequently.
