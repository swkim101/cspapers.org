Despite the physical advance of an existing single-cell battery system, mobile users are still suffering from low battery anxiety. With a careful analysis of users' battery usage behavior collected for 19,855 hours, we propose a heterogeneous battery system, MixMax, consisting of three complementary battery types tailored to minimizing the low battery time. While composing a heterogeneous battery system opens up a chance to simultaneously improve the capacity and the charging speed, one must face non-trivial challenges to determine the ratio of enclosed batteries and charge/discharge policies during the run-time. They are highly dependent on each other, which entails almost infinite candidates for the choice. MixMax gracefully unwinds the dependencies as it formulates the decision-making problem into an optimization problem and decomposes it into multiple sub-problems instead. To evaluate MixMax, we fabricate coin-cell batteries and experiment with them to model an accurate battery emulator which sophisticatedly reproduces the dynamics of battery systems. Our experimental results demonstrate that MixMax can reduce the low battery time by up to 24.6% without compromising capacity, volume, weight, and more importantly, users' battery usage behavior. In addition, we prototype MixMax on a smartphone, presenting the practicality of MixMax on mobile systems.
