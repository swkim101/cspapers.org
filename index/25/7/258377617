Provenance has been studied extensively to explain existing and missing results for many applications while focusing on scalability and usability challenges. Recently, techniques that efficiently compute a compact representation of provenance have been introduced. In this work, we introduce a practical solution that computes a sample of provenance for existing results without computing full provenance. Our technique computes a sample of provenance based on the distribution of provenance wrt the query result that is estimated from the distribution of input data while considering the correlation among the data. The preliminary evaluation demonstrates that comparing to the naive approach our method efficiently computes a sample of (large size of) provenance with low errors.
