When a customer sees a movie recommendation, she may buy the ticket right away, which is the immediate feedback that helps improve the recommender system. Alternatively, she may choose to come back later and this long-term feedback is also modeled to promote user retention. However, the long-term feedback comes with non-trivial challenges in understanding user retention: the complicated correlation between current demands and follow-up demands, coupled with the periodicity of services. For instance, before the movie, the customer buys popcorn through the App, which temporally correlates with the initial movie recommendation. Days later, she checks the App for new movies, as a weekly routine. To address this complexity in a more fine-grained revisit modeling, we propose Time Aware Service Sequential Recommendation (TASSR) for user retention, which is equipped with a multi-task design and an In-category TimeSeqBlock module. Large-scale online and offline experiments demonstrate its significant advantages over competitive baselines.
