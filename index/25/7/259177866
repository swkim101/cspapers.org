Codeword translation is well-known for translating excitation signals into other codewords to provide productive ZigBee backscatter. But the limited throughput of conventional systems using info-rich codewords to transmit a single bit challenge their effectiveness to perform sensor-data transmission. In this paper, we introduce ChipScatter, a novel high-throughput modulation technology that translates excitation codewords into more controllable codewords through fine-grained chip-level modulation. The more controllable categories available, the more bits can be transmitted simultaneously. Evaluation results show that ChipScatter can increase the throughput of productive ZigBee backscatter by up to 8Ã—.
