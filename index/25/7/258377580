Capturing, visualizing and analyzing provenance data to better understand and support analytic reasoning processes is a rapidly growing research field named analytic provenance. Provenance data includes the state of a visualization within a tool as well as the userâ€™s interactions performed while interacting with the tool. Research in this field has produced in many new approaches that generate data for specific tools and use cases. However, since a variety of tools are used and analytic tasks are performed in real analysis use cases there is a problem in building an interoperable baseline data corpus for investigation of the transferability of different approaches. In this paper, we present a visionary data space architecture for integrating and processing analytic provenance data in a unified way using semantic modeling. We discuss emerging challenges and research opportunities to realize such a vision using semantic models in data spaces to enable analytic provenance data interoperability.
