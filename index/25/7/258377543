The International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge: Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023) is now running its third edition. The Sci-K workshop is a venue that brings together researchers and practitioners from different disciplines (including, but not limited to, Digital Libraries, Information Extraction, Machine Learning, Semantic Web, Knowledge Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Scholarly Communication, Science of Science, Scientometrics and Bibliometrics), as well as professionals from the industry, to explore innovative solutions and ideas for the production and consumption of Scientific Knowledge Graphs and assessing the research impact. The workshop has called for high-quality submissions around the three main themes of research, related to scientific knowledge: representation, discovery, and assessment. In response to the call for papers, the workshop has received outstanding submissions from researchers in 15 different countries: United States of America, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Canada, India, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Denmark, Ethiopia, and Norway. Each paper was reviewed at least by three members of the programme committee. Given the quality and the interesting topics covered by the submissions, we accepted 10 papers. Sci-K 2023 builds on two previous successful editions and keeps attracting a combined pool of attendees. The first edition (Sci-K 2021), was held on 13 April 2021 in conjunction with The Web Conference 2021. Its program consisted of two keynote talks, and the presentation of 11 research papers. The second edition (Sci-K 2022) took place on the 26 April 2022 at The Web Conference 2022. The program included the presentation of 5 long papers, 4 short papers, 2 vision papers, 2 keynote speeches and a panel on “What’s next after Microsoft Academic Graph?”.
