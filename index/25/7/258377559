With the advent and pervasiveness of the Internet of Things (IoT), big data and cloud computing technologies, digitalization in enterprises and factories has rapidly increased in the last few years. Digital platforms have emerged as an effective mechanism for enabling the management and sharing of data from various companies. To enable sharing of data beyond the platform boundaries, definition of new platform federation approaches is on the rise. This makes enabling the federation of digital platforms a key requirement for large-scale dataspaces. Therefore, the identification of platform federation requirements and building blocks for such dataspaces needs to be systematically addressed. In this paper, we try to systematically explore the high-level requirements for enabling a federation of digital platforms in the manufacturing domain and identify a set of building blocks. We integrate the requirements and building blocks into the notion of dataspaces. The identified requirements and building blocks act as a blueprint for designing and instantiating new dataspaces, thereby speeding up the development process and reducing costs. We present a case study to illustrate how the use of common building blocks can act as common guiding principles and result in more complete and interoperable implementations.
