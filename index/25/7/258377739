While the concept of “data spaces” is no longer new, its specific application to individuals and personal data management is still undeveloped. This short paper presents a vision for “personal data spaces” in the shape of a work-in-progress description of them and some of the conceptual and implementation features envisioned. It is offered for discussion, debate, and improvement by professionals, policymakers, and researchers operating in the intersection of data spaces and personal data management.
