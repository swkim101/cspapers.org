Cybergrooming is a serious cybercrime that primarily targets youths through online platforms. Although reactive predator detection methods have been studied, proactive victim protection and crime prevention can also be achieved through vulnerability analysis of potential youth victims. Despite its significance, vulnerability analysis has not been thoroughly studied in the data science literature, while several social science studies used survey-based methods. To address this gap, we investigate humans’ social-psychological traits and quantify key vulnerability factors to cybergrooming by analyzing text features in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Through pairwise correlation studies, we demonstrate the degrees of key vulnerability dimensions to cybergrooming from youths’ conversational features. Our findings reveal that victims have negative correlations with family and community traits, contrasting with previous social survey studies that indicated family relationships or social support as key vulnerability factors. We discuss the current limitations of text mining analysis and suggest cross-validation methods to increase the validity of research findings. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into understanding the vulnerability factors to cybergrooming and highlights the importance of adopting multidisciplinary approaches.
