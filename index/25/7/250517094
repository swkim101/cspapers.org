The humanoid robot that can transform itself into a form according to its purpose requires whole-body motions with complex contact state transitions such as recovery from a fall and transition to the target form. To make the robot behavior in simulations closer to that in the real world for planning complex target trajectories, we need a platform that can measure the body stiffness during the motion and verify its application without being damaged by repeated motions that are prone to tipping over. In this study, we propose a small, inexpensive, and robust humanoid-vehicle transformer platform with redundant sensors and a low rigidity multi degree-of-freedom body and observe the effects of body deflection and internal forces during whole-body posture transition. By comparing the results obtained from experiments in several environments with different friction and from the simulator using a rigid body model, we were able to verify the influence of body flexibility on whole-body motion and the relationship between deflection and wrench observed by redundant sensors and movement failure.
