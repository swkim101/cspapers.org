In an emerging scam on social media platforms, cyber-miscreants are luring users into sending them a direct-message (DM) and are subsequently exploiting the messaging channel. We term this attack approach as the DM-Me scam. We report on a survey of 214 MTurk participants, in which we make the first effort to systematically study the susceptibility of users in falling victim to DM-Me scams. We find that most participants chose to send a direct message to at least one scammer, and made such choices more than half the time. This susceptibility can be attributed to the misplaced trust in scammers and the lack of negative consequences foreseen by participants in messaging accounts that they do not fully trust. Interestingly, our results also suggest that women mostly from the 31-40 age-group and who predominantly use Instagram a few times a week are less susceptible than men to financial DM-Me scams as they appear to face more discomfort in initiating a conversation with unfamiliar accounts for such services. We conclude with future research directions in mitigating the risks posed by DM-Me scammers, specifically by developing reliable indicators to aid users in assessing the trustworthiness of an account.
