This paper shows an analysis and controller design of independent two degrees of freedom (2DOF) PID controllers for unmanned aerial vehicles. The transfer functions of system dynamics are separated into two sections: lateral and longitudinal. A transient examination of the temporal response for the lateral and longitudinal control blocks is also included in this paper when a reference input is utilized as a pilot instruction. This research also provides a robustness analysis as well as an integral square error analysis to evaluate the performance of the suggested control technique. The fundamental contribution of this research is that independent control for unmanned aerial vehicles is limited, as described in the literature. A major contribution is made because disturbances are handled. The results show that in all simulations, a suitable settling time and overshoot are reached.
