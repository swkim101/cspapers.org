Building automatic extraction models for vi- 001 sually rich documents like invoices, receipts, 002 bills, tax forms, etc. has received signiﬁcant at- 003 tention lately. A key bottleneck in developing 004 extraction models for new document types is 005 the cost of acquiring the several thousand high- 006 quality labeled documents that are needed to 007 train a model with acceptable accuracy. In this 008 paper, we propose selective labeling as a so- 009 lution to this problem. The key insight is to 010 simplify the labeling task to provide “yes/no” 011 labels for candidate extractions predicted by a 012 model trained on partially-labeled documents. 013 We combine this with a custom active learning 014 strategy to ﬁnd the predictions that the model 015 is most uncertain about. We show through ex- 016 periments on document types drawn from 3 017 different domains that selective labeling can re- 018 duce the cost of acquiring labeled data by 10 × 019 while achieving negligible loss in accuracy. 020
