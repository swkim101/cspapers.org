Background subtraction is an important topic in computer vision and video analysis. It is challenging to robustly segment foreground and background in complex scenarios. In the literature there are efforts to address some of the main challenges such as illumination change, dynamic backgrounds, hard shadows, and intermittent object motion. However, most of the research has focused on applying advanced mathematical and machine learning models rather than on improving performance in real-time applications. In this paper, we devise a method named EGMM to efficiently handle the illumination change problem and also operate at a real-time execution speed on commodity PC hardware. EGMM is an ensemble algorithm that fuses multiple Gaussian Mixture Models operating on gradient, texture and color features. Detection and removal of shadows is done using a chromaticity-based approach, and spatio-temporal history of foreground blobs is used to handle intermittent object motion. We benchmarked EGMM by creating datasets for two light change scenarios. The results demonstrate that EGMM achieves robust performance in complex illumination change cases, outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms, and runs at 100 fps (GPU) at $1280\times720$ resolution. Moreover, experiments using the 2012 CDnet dataset show that EGMM achieves generally good performance in varying scenes with overall results better than conventional methods and runs at 1000 fps (GPU) at $320\times 240$ resolution.
