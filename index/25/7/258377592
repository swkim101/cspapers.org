Causal effect estimation has been increasingly emphasized in the past few years. To handle this problem, tree-based causal methods have been widely used due to their robustness and explainability. However, most of the existing methods are limited to running on a single machine, making it difficult to scale up to hundreds of millions of data in typical industrial scenarios. This paper proposes DGBCT, a Distributed Gradient Boosting Causal Tree to tackle such problem, and the contribution of this paper is three folds. First, we extend the original GBCT method to a multi-treatment setting and take the monotonic constraints into consideration, so that more typical industrial necessities can be resolved with our framework. Moreover, we implement DGBCT based on the ‘Controller-Coordinator-Worker’ framework, in which dual failover mechanism is achieved, and commendable flexibility is ensured. In addition, empirical results show that DGBCT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art causal trees, and has a near-linear speedup as the number of workers grows. The system is currently deployed in Alipay1 to support the daily business tasks that involve hundreds of millions of users.
