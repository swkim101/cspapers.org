WORKSHOP SCOPE Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to the production of an abundance of online discourse data, such as claims and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts (events, entities). This data constitutes a valuable source of insights for studies into misand dis-information spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers, or political agenda setting. While knowledge graphs (KGs) promise to provide the key to a Web of structured information, they are mainly focused on facts without keeping track of the diversity, connection or temporal evolution of online discourse. As opposed to facts, claims are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly depends on the context and a variety of intentional or unintended meanings, where terminology and conceptual understanding strongly diverge across communities from computational social science and journalism, to argumentation mining, stance detection, or computational fact-checking. This workshop aims at strengthening the relations between these communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling, extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It will address the need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse data in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and reuse, in support of scientifc or journalistic studies into the analysis of societal debates on the Web. Beyond research into information and knowledge extraction, data consolidation and modeling for KG building, the workshop
