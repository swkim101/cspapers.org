The past two decades have witnessed rapid technological advances in biological data collection and acquisition. These advances in biotechnology enabled interrogation of cellular systems at various levels, leading to generation and collection of large-scale biological data (mostly in public databases) at an exponential rate. The explosion of biological data is leading to a paradigm shift in research methods in life sciences; from hypothesis-driven research to data driven research. In the last decade, sophisticated algorithms for knowledge discovery and data mining have demonstrated great promise in extracting novel biological information from complex, heterogeneous, and very high-dimensional biological datasets. 
 
The International Workshop on Data Mining in Bioinformatics (BIOKDD) has successfully established a tradition in providing a platform for the presentation and discussion of advances in data mining techniques that primarily target biological data in the last ten years. This year's BIOKDD continued the tradition of bringing together data mining researchers and life scientists, emphasizing novel problems with various types of biological data, emerging types of biological data (e.g., next generation sequencing, RNA-seq, electronic medical records), integration of heterogenous biological datasets, and emerging applications in the new era of life and medical sciences (e.g., systems biology, genome-wide association studies, translational science, personalized genomics).
