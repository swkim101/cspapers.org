Path planning is an essential task for the navigation of Autonomous Mobile Robot. This is one of the basic problems in robotics. Path planning algorithms are classified as global or local, depending on the knowledge of surrounding environment. In local path planning, the environment is unknown to the robot, and sensors are used to detect the obstacles and to avoid collision. Bug algorithms are one of the frequently used path planning algorithms where a mobile robot moves to the target by detecting the nearest obstacle and avoiding it with limited information about the environment. This proposed Critical-PointBug algorithm, is a new Bug algorithm for path planning of mobile robots. This algorithm tries to minimize traversal of obstacle border by searching few important points on the boundary of obstacle area as a rotation point to goal and end with a complete path from source to goal.
