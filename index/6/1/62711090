University human resources management is an important part of school management. To summarize, teachers can be managed through a set of scientific and effective method to strengthen the school connotation of the construction of the strategic target. For numerous schools, facing more challenge and competition, in the "survival of the fittest", the "fittest" under the natural law of survival and development, to learn the advanced management experience and management technology, has become urgent and important task of school. In the center of the "people-oriented", "humanistic management" of today, human resource management has become an important factor of success of the school connotation development. Evaluation model is widely used in our common life, which can undertake assessment of a decision and personnel factors, and assessment or evaluation algorithm types are also abundant, including the factor method, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation [, the analytic hierarchy process (ahp), and some algorithm based on artificial intelligence (ai), all these algorithms are effective to solve part of the problem domain. The evaluation of teachers' professional ability involve more factors, including some subjective factors, such as personal moral, lifestyle, ambition, etc., and some objective factors such as working length of service users, specialty, education, scientific research, honors won, etc. If we only use the grade staff to do so, the measurement result of a grade may be affected because of personal emotions, and if we simply evaluate from the objective factors, which may lead to stylized, strengthening the results, lighting the evaluation of the masses .So for teachers' evaluation, we do from these two aspects at the same time, setting subjective and objective factors according to each assessment scheme. For subjective factors, we invite the marker personnel to score by our measurement system based on the subjective factors of scores, and for the objective factors, automatic gradings of staff are done according to the set of weights of objective factors, score, and accumulative number of grading in the scheme of the measurement. We adjust the proportion according to the previous results, as well as the evaluation scheme, to get the sorting and evaluating list of the measured personnel.
