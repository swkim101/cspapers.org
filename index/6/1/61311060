It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2nd ACM Workshop on Secure Web Services - SWS'05. This year's workshop comes at an interesting stage of development of Web service security research. While the basic building blocks, such as XML Security, the WS-* series of proposals, SAML, and XACML are now firmly in place, a number of challenges are still to be met for Web services and GRID nodes to be fully secured and trusted, providing for secure communications between cross-platform and cross-language Web services. Also, the current trend toward representing Web services orchestration and choreography via advanced business process metadata is fostering a further evolution of security models and languages, whose key issues include setting and managing security policies, inter-organizational (trusted partner) security issues and the implementation of high level business policies in a Web services environment.The mission of the SWS workshop is exploring these challenges, ranging from the advancement and best practices of building block technologies such as XML access control models and Web services security protocols to higher level issues such as advanced metadata, general security policies, trust establishment, risk management, and service assurance. SWS'05 is aimed at identifying new directions for future research and development, giving researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of Web Services security.Our call for papers attracted 22 submissions from Asia, Australia, Europe and the United States. The program committee accepted 10 papers that cover a variety of topics, ranging from theoretical foundations of Web services security models and algorithms to architectural and system-related issues. We are very happy with the quality of the accepted papers and hope that SWS'05 proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers working on Web services.
