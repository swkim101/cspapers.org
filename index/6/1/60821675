A 3-axis acceleration data logger was designed for non-wired sensing and recording of small diameter laterals where wire or wireless communication with ground/surface is impractical or not feasible. This is accomplished by measuring 3-axis acceleration, storing the data on the data logger, offloading data to an onsite laptop computer, and then back-calculating the path with developed software.
