We are concerned with controlling dynamical systems, such as self-driving cars and smart buildings, in a manner that guarantees that they satisfy complex task specifications. Mixed integer linear programming has recently proven to be a powerful tool for such problems, enabling the computation of optimal plans that satisfy complex temporal constraints for high-dimensional, dynamical systems. These optimization-based approaches find solutions quickly for challenging (and previously unsolvable) planning problems. Framing temporal logic planning as constrained optimization also presents exciting new areas of research.
