Cloud computing has clearly established itself as a crucial element in the information-technology landscape of today. This means that people are affected not only by the features and benefits of this new computing model, but also by any problems. Concerns about cloud computing security exist due to its new untested deployment models, novel trust and adversarial relations, and new vulnerabilities. The Cloud Computing Security Workshop (CCSW) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working in all security aspects of cloud-centric and outsourced computing. Now in its 3rd instance, and co-located with the 18th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), CCSW has established itself as the premier scientific forum for research in cloud computing security. 
 
In response to the call for papers, the international program committee received 45 contributions of high quality. Given the constraints of a one-day workshop, the program committee decided to accept 13 contributions, among them eight long research papers, three short research papers, and two position papers. 
 
The program of the workshop was complemented by three keynote lectures from renowned security experts: Tim Brown, SVP Chief Security Architect & Distinguished Engineer (CA Technologies, Security Business); Charlie Kaufman, Security Architect, Windows Azure (Microsoft); and John Manferdelli, Senior Principal Engineer and co-lead of the Intel Science and Technology Center for Secure Computing (Intel).
