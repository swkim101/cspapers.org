As today enterprises have to face a competitive, complex and ever-changing business context, so business processes have to respond to the context changes in a fast and economic manner. This purpose implies that processes should be continuously maintained through a flexible modeling. This paper addresses this problem and provides an approach able to govern the high variability of the environment where the process performs. This approach is based on the well-known formalism of decision tables to link context parameters to process activities, so that it allows a fast process re-modeling when context parameters change. We have tested this approach in real contexts: results are encouraging and drive further investigations in such a way.
