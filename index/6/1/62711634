Ontology mapping is the technological foundation of semantic integration, ontology merging and ontology alignment. In this paper, we propose approaches of ontological property mapping based on multi-strategy. First we use different strategies to deal with data type property and object type property. Then the optimal property mapping results of multi strategies are chosen. Finally, we present experimental results with high accuracy and point out future possible research directions.
