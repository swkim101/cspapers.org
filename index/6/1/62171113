Ontology matching is a core task to enable interoperability between ontologies. In this paper, we propose a method for large scale ontology partitioning and block matching based on improved ROCK clustering. At first, two ontologies are partitioned based on improved ROCK clustering. Then we adopt block matching strategies based on taxonomy and anchors, and obtain matching results. Finally, we present experimental results with high matching quality and point out future possible research directions.
