The paper deals with the influence of air humidity in the refrigerated store on the dehydration of stored fruits. Analyses of total costs, including operation, investment and product costs have been performed for refrigeration systems with direct expansion as well as for indirect brine systems. It has been found that the most suitable system is a direct expansion system with oversized evaporators. Optimal thickness of thermal insulation has been evaluated using the results of system behaviour simulation.
