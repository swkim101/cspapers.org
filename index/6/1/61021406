In order to confirm geometrical modeling of input file of the McCARD (Monte Carlo Code for Advanced Reactor Design and analysis) code, a 2D visualization program with a 3D modeling has been developed. It requires lots of mathematical operations and advanced technologies for design graphical program of complicated geometries. The software is coded with the visual C++ language and run under the Windows PC environment.
