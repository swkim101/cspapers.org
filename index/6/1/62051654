Digital paradigms became a reality and now all pay attention on how the world around us is changing and react accordingly. In particular, the increasing importance of computational thinking continues to reframe the dialogue appropriate and effective instruction. Literature instructors are also today being forced to think about 'how to teach', rather than 'what to teach'. Aware of the issues, this paper proposes a new instructional model using big data suitable to be used to teach literary history and provides learners, who had grown up surrounded with an excess of technology and media use in everyday life, opportunities to make literary studies more attractive and easier to understand. Through this, it attempts to explore theoretically educational methodology of studying literary history in order to encourage learners' meaningful participation in classroom.
