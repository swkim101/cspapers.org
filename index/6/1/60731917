ADDS (Ada Dialogue Development System) incorporates a design method, software tools and a library of user interface components, to facilitate the development of interactive Ada systems. Although the ADDS method is potentially applicable to a wide range of projects, it has been designed particularly for use in developing interactive real-time embedded systems. This has meant addressing the following problems: (1) how to give the user sufficient timely information to make critical decisions, and (2) how to obtain timely input from the user, while ensuring that user errors are not propagated into the embedded system. It is essential that the reliability of the system is not compromised by its interaction with a human operator. >
