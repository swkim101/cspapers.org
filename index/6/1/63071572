We discuss the student project that accompanies the machine learning course in the Biosciences and Technology Department at the K.H.Kempen University College during the academic year 2011-2012. The goal of this project is to perform gait and gestures analysis on accelerometer data that is recorded by the students themselves using a standard Wii-remote.
