This paper outlines the rationale for, and plans to, conduct a study addressing the paradoxical nature of IT-use in relation to everyday activities. While the area of User Experience Design (UXD) focus on immediate use of an IT-artifact, the focus of the proposed empirical study is how individuals use, or restrict their use, of these artifacts to enhance and avoid inhibiting an experience. We expect the outcome to be an improved understanding of individual strategies for ITuse for enhancing the experience of everyday activities as well as the rationale behind them.
