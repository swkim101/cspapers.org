We consider a cloud system that has to save lots of files and has to use hundreds of computers. The existing cloud storage designs are not scalable enough to support such a huge number of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud storage system containing thousands of virtual file servers on hundreds of computers. We group these virtual servers into clusters. This system is perfectly scalable because the system load is divided among the clusters. Our simulation experiments show that our cloud storage system achieves smaller file read/write latency and traffic/processing overhead than the existing systems.
