In the vigorous developing period of the cloud application, it is necessary to identify the application services, cloud computing platform and the relationship with the energy efficiency. Application service is the foundation, the cloud architecture is the platform, and the energy efficiency of the combination of them is the key to the success of the cloud services. The cloud computing architecture is not necessarily to solve the problem of application performance, and expanding the application of cloud computing platform service in the manner of inefficient and out-of-order can only cause the huge waste of social resources, including electric power, network and repeated investment. The viewpoint of this article is that cloud application should be based on application service, and only the green and efficient integration of the cloud platform can build a good ecological environment for the cloud application Keywords-component; application service; cloud computing, application performance; electric power resource; network
