In Traffic surveillance, Tracking of the number plate from the vehicle is an important task, which demands intelligent solution. In this document, extraction and Recognization of number plate from vehicles image has been done using Matlab. It is assumed that images of the vehicle have been captured from Digital Camera. Alphanumeric Characters on plate has been Extracted and recognized using template images of alphanumeric characters. This paper presents a new algorithm in MATLAB which has been used to extract the number plate from the vehicle in various luminance conditions. Extracted image of the number plate can be seen in a text file for verification purpose. Number plate identification is helpful in finding stolen cars, car parking management system and identification of vehicle in traffic.
