Respiratory motion may cause the change of some organs and tissues, such as lung and liver tumors in radiation therapy, which may influence the treatment effect and increase the damage to normal tissues and organs. Hence, it is an essential work to estimate the real-time movement of target in radiation therapy. BP-NN has been widely used in respiratory motion prediction due to its superior non-linear fitting capability. However, BP-NN is easy to fall into local minimum. In this study anovel method using PSO to optimize the BP-NN was proposed to avoid its drawbacks and improve prediction accuracy. The preliminaryresultsof 6 patients demonstrate that the proposed method (PSO-NN) has the ability of improving the prediction accuracy of BP-NN method.
