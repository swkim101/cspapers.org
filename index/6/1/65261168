We are delighted to welcome you to the first workshop on Hot Topics in Software Defined Networks (HotSDN). 
 
Software Defined Networking (SDN) refactors the relationship between network devices and thesoftware that controls them. Open interfaces to network switches enable more flexible and predictable network control, and they make it easier to extend network function. Many research and industry groups worldwide are pursuing different aspects of software defined networking, and experimental and production deployments exist. The workshop program covers many of the open research challenges with SDN, including: how to design switches and APIs; how to design a software platform for the control and management of software defined networks; how to design new applications that capitalize on the programmability of the network; how to lower the barrier to creating, testing, and evaluating new applications; and many others. 
 
The Call For Papers attracted 71 submissions from a wide range of universities and companies. The Program Committee accepted 22 papers during the program committee meeting, leading to an exciting program covering the breadth and depth of this young field. In addition, the program ends with a panel designed to foster discussion about future directions in SDN.
