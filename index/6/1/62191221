As an essential part of design, the conceptual design needs computer assistance from its initial design stage of product development. However computer-aided conceptual design is limited by the current function-to-form mapping approaches. A new growth design process model is proposed in this paper in which geometrical solutions grow gradually from scratch to their complete configurations. Two theoretical design principles, Decomposition & Reconstitution (D&R) principle and Cell Division principle, are briefly introduced to provide better understanding of Growth Design model. The concept of Conceptual Structure is used to support the transition process from conceptual design to detailed design in the growth design process. Finally, an application case is introduced to show the effects of the growth design model.Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME
