Response surface methods or metamodels are commonly used to approximate large computationally expensive engineering systems. Five response surface methods are studied: Stepwise Regression, Moving Least Square, Kriging, Multiquadric, and Adaptive and Interactive Modeling System. A real-world frontal impact design problem is used as an example, which is a complex, highly nonlinear, transient, dynamic, large deformation finite element model. To study the accuracy of the metamodel, the optimal Latin Hypercube Sampling method is used to distribute the sampling points uniformly over the entire design space. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used as the error indicator. Convergence rate, widely used in the arena of the finite element method for evaluating new elementâ€™s performance, was exploited in this vehicle impact example.
