It is difficult for an instructor to grasp instantly how much learners understand learning content in class under the current education environment. In case of the class, which consists of students of varous levels and more than a couple of dozens that are not a small scale, the understanding degree and learning achievement of the learners have a broad spectrum, depending on the learning content. Therefore, it is almost impossible for an instructor to let all of learners reach a learning objective. In this paper, we propose an approach that enables the arbitrary rate of learners, who reach a learning goal, set by an instructor. We describe an instructional support system combined with instant response app, dynamic formative evaluation, and confidence level. We expect that our approach can make an instructor set the ratio of learners, who reach the learning objective, and eventually bring an effective instruction.
