The increased of the use of computer & communications system by IT industries has increased the risk of theft of proprietary information. Cryptographic control (Encryption) is a primary method of protecting system resources. Control is inversely proportional to the Risk ( C=K/R) & mean while control is directly proportional to the quality of standard( S ). Control will be optimize the risk as well as improve the IS standard. Control is directly proportional to mitigation & mitigation is directly proportional to standard. Encryption Key length (E) is inversely proportional to the Risk. This paper contributes to the development of an optimization model that aims to determine the optimal cost to be invested into security model & mechanisms deciding on the measure component of operating system resources (i.e. Processor, Memory and Encryption). Furthermore, the model & mechanism optimize the cost, time & resources is supposed to reduce the system risks.
