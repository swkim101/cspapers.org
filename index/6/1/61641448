Bin Packing Problem (BPP) is a Combinatorial Optimization problem, which is used to find the optimal object from a finite set of objects. The purpose of BPP is to pack the items with different weight into finite number of bins without exceeding its capacity. The main objective of this problem is to minimize the number of bins used and pack the items efficiently. This paper reviews a general idea of BPP and various algorithms which are used to solve the BPP. In this work, two heuristic algorithms First-Fit algorithm and Best-Fit algorithm are implemented and tested with wellknown benchmark instances. This paper also discusses the algorithms which are inspired by Biology, such as Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (ACO), Cuckoo search and Genetic algorithm and their applications to Combinatorial Optimization problems.
