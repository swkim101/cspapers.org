Welcome to the 2013 edition of the Internet Measurement Conference. The 42 papers you will hear presented over the next three days represent some of the year's best work in network measurement and we hope you enjoy their contributions! 
 
This year the conference received 178 submissions of which 92 were long papers and 86 were short papers. During an initial round of reviewing, each paper received 3 reviews. After assessing these reviews, 100 papers (63 long and 37 short) proceeded to a second round of additional reviewing. From these 100 papers, 72 papers (45 long, 27 short) were selected for discussion at the program committee meeting. The typical PC member reviewed between 20 and 22 papers and read several more. 
 
The program committee met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on July 10th. Almost the entire program committee was present. We are grateful for the effort they made (in some cases taking international and red-eye flights) to attend and for their insightful discussion. 
 
Reviewing was single blind. The reviewers knew who the authors were, but the authors will not know who the reviewers are. We were careful to ensure reviewers did not review papers for which they were conflicted. We did catch a couple of cases where conflicts were inappropriately claimed to try to exclude a reviewer, a practice we resisted.
