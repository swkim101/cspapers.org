Landslides are one of the events that are difficult to predict accurately. Morphology region, type, structure and texture of the soil, rainfall, vegetation density, as well as the behavior of the population in the use of land are a number of dynamic factors that could affect the occurrence of landslides. This research was conducted in Sagalaherang district, Subang. The district of Sagalaherang is physically located in areas of potential landslides. The awareness and readiness of local communities to deal with landslides is necessary to study. This study aims to determine the level of community preparedness in the face of landslides using index analysis the level of preparedness of UNESCO. The primary data obtained through observation and questionnaire as well as interviews with the community. The secondary data were obtained from a review of various documents and relevant literature. The samples of society were determined by proportional random sampling. Sagalaherang is one of the districts in Subang included in the prone category to landslides in the medium to high level. It has an average annual rainfall of over 2,700 mm/year. The geological conditions of Sagalaherang are volcanic materials from the eruption of the mount of Tangkuban Parahu and Sunda manifold breccia rocks. It has morphology hilly region, while for class slope is dominated by a class II to V. Based on the results, the level of community preparedness in the face of a landslide in the district Sagalaherang was categorized into a status of almost prepared. The society has to have knowledge and some steps to do when experiencing occurrences of landslides. However, the mobilization of resources for disaster management is still lacking. It is recommended to increase public knowledge and to conduct training activities for resource mobilization to face landslides, so that people come to in the prepared category.
