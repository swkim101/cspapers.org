It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2nd ACM Workshop on AISec -- AISec 2009. The mission of this new workshop is to stimulate increased collaboration between the Security and AI communities. It is our strong belief that such collaboration is the best route towards fully realizing the security and privacy benefits of today's ubiquitous information. 
 
The call for papers attracted 24 submissions from Asia, Europe and the United States. The program committee accepted 10 papers covering a variety of topics, including privacy in social networking sites, malware and network attack defense, and reputation systems.
