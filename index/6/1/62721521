Recently, higher education has seen an increasing emphasis on the prominent role of computational thinking in computer fundamental education. Computational thinking is taken for the fundamental skills for everyone, not just computer scientist, to learn and use. How to develop students capacity for computational thinking during the teaching process is one of the basic goals of computer fundamental education. Using Excel VBA course teaching as example, in this paper, we discuss how to understand the essence of computational thinking and how cultivate the computational thinking ability of students.
