It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 1st International Workshop on the Quality of Service-Oriented Software System -- QUASOSS'09 -- affiliated with the 7th joint meeting of the European Software Engineering Conference (ESEC) and the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) -- ESEC/FSE'09. 
 
Our workshop provides a forum for both researchers and practitioners to discuss the open issues and emerging trends in the area of quality engineering for service-oriented software systems. Service-oriented software systems have recently emerged from component-based software engineering. They support a new paradigm, which is more aligned with business concepts and allows for dynamic composition of software architectures. Service-oriented software systems started as distributed or web-based applications, but are now spreading also into other domains (e.g., software-intensive systems). The paradigm of cloud computing with software-as-a-service applications is a recent representative of a new wave of service-oriented software systems. While concepts for service design, composition, provisioning, and management are currently maturing, a systematic engineering approach to service-oriented software with predictable quality-of-service (QoS) is still missing. 
 
The program committee accepted 7 papers that cover a variety of topics, including performance modelling, performance measurements, trade-off analyses between quality attributes, modelling event-driven systems, and managing and monitoring service-oriented system at runtime. In addition the program includes a panel on the future of quality engineering for service-oriented systems and a keynote speech by Antonia Bertolino. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers.
