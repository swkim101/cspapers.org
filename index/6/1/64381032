In order to seal up the hydrosoluble saline and chlorine ion in soda residue to assure the safety when soda residue is used as filler in bituminous mixture,the surface of soda residue is modified into hydrophobe by mechanically chemical modification with calcium stearte as modifier.We appraise the modification effect with distribution ratio and activation index as guidelines.Finally, we estimate the content of hydrosoluble saline and chlorine ion in bituminous mixture with activated soda residue as filler.The result shows that the activation index increases along with the rising content of calcium stearte.In the contrast,the distribution ratio diminishes remarkably.The dense-graded bituminous mixture rather than open-graded bituminous mixture can seal up the chlorine ion in bituminous mixture.
