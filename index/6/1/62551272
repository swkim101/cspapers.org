The advanced technologies used by the evolved 3G wireless communication systems, such as 3GPP2 UMB, IEEE MBWA, and 3GPP LTE, allow for improved spectral efficiency and making use of new spectrum. In the presentation we overview these new technologies including interference management, power control, intra- and inter-carrier handoffs, multi-antenna techniques, and system acquisition for flexible deployment.
