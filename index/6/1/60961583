Recently, there has been a tremendous growth in real-time collaboration products and services. Real-time collaborative technology enables synchronous communication for a variety of purposes, including whiteboards, chat, Internet phone, video and audio conferencing, desktop-to-desktop videoconferencing, group management, for&casting, polling, voting and application sharing. Most synchronous collaboration product suites are highly complex and their protocols are relatively new, which typically raises a “red flag” for those who have been around the security block a few times.
