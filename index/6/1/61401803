Data center operators face extreme challenges in simultaneously providing low latency for short flows, high throughput for long flows, and high burst tolerance. We propose a buffer management strategy that addresses these challenges by isolating short and long flows into separate buffers, sizing these buffers based on flow requirements, and scheduling packets to meet different flow-level objectives. Our design provides new opportunities for performance improvements that complement transport layer optimisations.
