To deal with uncertain dynamic interferences occurred in the workshop, and meet the competition requirements of jobs submitted by different customers, a dynamic job-shop scheduling model based on game theory is presented. In order to find the Nash equilibrium point of the model effectively, dynamic rescheduling judgment based on event-driven policy is adopted, and a hybrid genetic algorithm is designed. The case study is carried out to demonstrate the validity of above dynamic job-shop scheduling methods.
