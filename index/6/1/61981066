Data communications is rapidly becoming a subject with which many students are familiar (through their contact with computer networks such as the Internet), but about which few have grasped the basic concepts. Although introductory courses in data communications are intended to expose students to the fundamentals, many present material in a manner that does not build upon the students' existing knowledge; for example, the 7-layer ISO OSI Reference Model [2] introduces the physical properties of communication channel before discussing what is sent across the channel.
