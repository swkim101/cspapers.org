Introduction Machine learning and data mining algorithms have penetrated our everyday lives and play a central role in many application domains, including social networks, healthcare, location-based systems, and advertising. At the same time, 90\% of today's data have been produced in the last two years! These data come from social networking sites, mobile phone applications, electronic medical record systems, ecommerce sites, and open data portals. The analysis of this wealth of data can lead to valuable insights that will benefit data recipients and the society at large, but may also lead to serious privacy breaches, unless privacy-enhancing technologies are in place.
