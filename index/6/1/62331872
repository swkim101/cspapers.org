It is common practice to use linear plant models and linear controllers in the control systems design. Such approach has simple explanation applying to plants with insignificant nonlinearity or to those, functioning closely to a working point. But linear controllers, indeed with some modification, are used even for plants with significant non-linearities. Because of several reasons the non-linear controllers have not broad application. First, the linear control theory is well developed; while the non-linear control methods are clear for few engineers in practice. Second, there are some technological and economical difficulties to get high quality study of the process to be controlled in order to build detailed (more precise) non-linear plant model. Third, new ideas in the field of the control theory are continuously realized, which expand the span of the linear control systems applications as an alternative to utilizing complicated models at the expense of troubles of theoretical and practical nature.
