We present a database-centric approach to web site development in which both application and web content data are managed by a database. The development process is based on three main stages of information modelling, document content design and presentation specification. A Java framework based on the OMS object-oriented data management system has been developed to support the development life cycle from rapid prototyping through to operation. We describe how the framework supports access from heterogeneous clients and how it has been extended to include a web content manager.
