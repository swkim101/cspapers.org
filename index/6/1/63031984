This thesis shows how to detect boundaries on the basis of motion information alone. The detection is performed in two stages: (i) the local estimation of motion discontinuities and of the visual flow field; (ii) the extraction of complete boundaries belonging to differently moving objects. For the first stage, three new methods are presented: the ``Bimodality Tests,'''' the ``Bi-distribution Test,'''' and the ``Dynamic Occlusion Method.'''' The second stage consists of applying the ``Structural Saliency Method,'''' by Sha''ashua and Ullman to extract complete and unique boundaries from the output of the first stage. The developed methods can successfully segment complex motion sequences.
