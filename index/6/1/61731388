In vehicle, there are many ECU (Electronic Control Unit)s, and ECUs are connected to networks such as CAN(Controller Area Network), LIN(Local Interconnect Network), FlexRay, and so on. The CAN is the most used technology in automotive network. If the 3GPP technology is used for the purpose of V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) in automotive network, it would need an Inter-connection of CAN network and 3GPP to deliver messages. In this paper, we propose the software architecture and functions of CAN over 3GPP gateway to transfer an In-vehicle logging message, automotive diagnostic status or safety-related information, etc to user or server in the internet.
