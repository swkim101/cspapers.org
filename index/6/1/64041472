Cloud Computing is development fast, with its data centers evolving at an extraordinary rate. However, this has come with worries over privacy, efficiency at the expense of flexibility, and environmental sustainability, because of the dependence on Cloud vendors such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Our answer is an alternative model for the Cloud conceptualization, providing a model for Clouds in the community, utilizing networked personal computers for liberation from the centralized vendor model. Community Cloud Computing (C3) offers an alternative architecture, created by combing the Cloud with models from Grid Computing, principles from Digital Ecosystems, and sustainability from Green Computing, while remaining true to the original vision of the Internet. It is more technically challenging than Cloud Computing, having to deal with distributed computing issues, including varied nodes, varying quality of service, and additional security constraints. However, these are not incredible challenges, and with the need to recall control over our digital lives and the potential environmental significances, it is a challenge we must follow.
