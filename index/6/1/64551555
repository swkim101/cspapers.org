It is our pleasure to welcome you to The 1st ACM Workshop on Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (BCC'17) held in conjunction with The 12th ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security (AsiaCCS'17) during April 2-6, at Abu Dhabi, UAE. Blockchain is an emerging technology currently being used for a variety of applications such as cryptocurrencies and other financial transactions, smart properties, credential management, Internet-of-Things, supply chain management and many more. The theme of this workshop is to understand the foundations of blockchain technology and the design of new blockchain applications using smart contracts.
