This research aimed at describing the implementation of value clarification technique combined with problem based learning and project based learning in basic chemistry course for organic chemistry topics. The subjects of this study were all students of Preservice chemistry teacher from Chemistry Education Study Program of Teacher Training and Education Faculty of Universitas Syiah Kuala in Indonesia. They were at even semester in 2014-2015. They learned by problem and project based learning and implemented values by choosing, prizing and acting topics of organic in daily life. To collect data used field notes, documentation, questionnaires and a portfolio report. To analysis data used qualitative method as collection, reduction, presentation data and conclusion. The research conclusions were, learning organic chemistry by integrating project based learning and problem based learning strategies with value clarification technique could be applied in chemistry learning. Students become able to clarify the human value in nature with regard to most of the topics they have studied in organic chemistry. Based on the findings, this study recommended that the innovative learning strategies such as project based learning, problem based learning combining with value clarification technique, could be adopted in chemistry education courses to increase environmental awareness of pre-service chemistry teacher.
