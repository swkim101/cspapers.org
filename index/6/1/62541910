Unlike other networks based on wireless sensor networks, such as the characteristics of Ad hoc network design algorithm to reduce the energy consumption of wireless sensor networks. The main study of wireless sensor networks in a variety of energy-saving protocols and algorithms, analyze the impact of these agreements on energy saving in different environments, MAC protocol for wireless sensor network design energy efficient use of its improvement, based on the maximum advantage disjoint approximate area set covering algorithm. Energy efficient or superior energy savings in the paper can prolong survival time of the network to provide scientific reference.
