Critical Parameter Management (CPM) is an emerging area in engineering design owing to the motivation from Design for Six Sigma. Introduced in this paper is the exploration of CPM to support rapid redesign of evolutionary products in the context of mass customization. Along this line, a model-based CPM method that utilizes and leverages matrix patterns to support rapid redesign is presented, discussed and illustrated through the use of a redesign example as a case study. In particular, proposed in this paper is the pattern-centric CPM approach to rapid redesign based on “case → scenario → pattern → strategy → roadmap” reasoning mechanism. The results show that the proposed method enables one to rapidly reconfigure or customize the existing design of a given model as well as the promising future of this emerging research. This work represents an extended effort to complement our ongoing research on developing decomposition-enabled techniques to support model-based rapid redesign.Copyright © 2006 by ASME
