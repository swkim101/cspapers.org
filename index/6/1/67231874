Four path planning and data exchange algorithms for cooperative search and coverage robotic missions are proposed and modified. The introduced methods are simulated using C++ programming environment and the results are discussed in detail for environments with static obstacles. It has been shown that using the "nearest zero-point" algorithm can greatly optimise the mission duration and also overlapping of the search trajectories. Finally, the results are compared with several existing algorithms.
