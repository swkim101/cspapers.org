The formation of modules is an important step in establishing a product’s architecture. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm that creates functionally cohesive and loosely coupled modules in a product’s architecture. The algorithm seeks to group together product elements to form functionally similar and loosely-coupled modules. The algorithm also has the advantage of not requiring any user-defined starting parameters that are necessary in some other clustering algorithms. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated on a laser printer and the results are compared to the results from an existing algorithm.Copyright © 2012 by ASME
