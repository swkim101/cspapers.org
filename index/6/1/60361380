Grid environments and software applications based on Grid Services are currently receiving a strong consideration. In a Grid context, service providers are strategically interested to manage the level of performance that can be offered to service consumers. This paper introduces a model-driven approach for predicting, at design time, and managing, at execution time, the performance characteristics of applications based on Grid Services. The approach is based on the automatic generation and evaluation of performance models from design models of UML type. An example application is illustrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
