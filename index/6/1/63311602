This paper explores the use of micro-computers in the teaching of Mathematics, a practice which is very common. To this end, An expert teaching system applied in the calculus studies was develop in this work, the study area is numerical series.. An expert system is a computer program that emulates the behavior of a human expert in a well-defined, narrow domain of knowledge. An expert system for teaching numerical series was devised in this study. Tests and criteria to determine divergence and convergence are applied to numerical series. The system is capable of providing specific conclusions regarding the character of a given numerical series. The consultation sessions are very complete , allowing the student to learn the theory and the practice of numerical series. The expert system can encapsulate some of the expertise used teachers in Mathematics classes. The model was implemented on an expert system shell called KAPPA level 2, which runs on any standard IBM-PC micro-computer or compatible hardware.
