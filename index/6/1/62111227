One of the main goals of the current trend to store and share outputs of experimental research (cf. the OSTP memo, the NIH B2DK project, and the NSF Research Data sharing policy) is to encourage the reuse of that data. Therefore, it is important that usage is taken into account when designing systems that store and create data. Conversely, the many parties interested in data science [Press, 2013] should care about how, and that that research data gets stored in a way to be optimally usable downstream. Alignment of the ten aspects listed below could support optimal data reuse and lead to the development of better systems. There is an intended hierarchy to these aspects, akin to the Maslow hierarchy of human needs: each builds on and requires the aspects preceding them. 1. Preserved: existing is some format At this moment, the majority of data in labs all around the world is not saved. The Data Rescue Award showcased several attempts in the Earth Sciences to rescue ‘dark data’. 2. Archived: existing in a long-term durable format Data needs to be preserved in a format-independent manner or risk being lost forever. The Olive Executable Archive brings a number of arcane operating systems back to life as Virtual Machines. 3. Accessible: available to others than the researcher
