In this paper, IoT based pier collision monitoring system that is possible to respond rapidly by notifying automatically the relevant institutions and administrators in the event of an accident is suggested. This system in also possible to detect collision and to measure the state of the facility by sensor. Measured data is sent to gateway and server then stored, administrated. In this paper, an optimal collision detection and communication modules for pier collision monitoring system is developed. Pier collision monitoring system notifies automatically the accident of the relevant authorities and administrators, aslo checks temperature, impulse and the battery voltage in real time using a Web/App. With respect to the development of the above, data reception and reliability are tested by establishing a test-bed at the pier.
