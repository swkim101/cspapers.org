A joint scheduling and admission control algorithm is presented for Asynchronous Time-Sharing (ATS)-based switching nodes carrying real-time traffic. Systems based on ATS guarantee quality of service, at both the levels of cells and calls, for three well-defined traffic classes. A mechanism is outlined by which an admission control strategy can be tailored to a particular mix of traffic classes. A mechanism is outlined by which an admission control strategy can be tailored to a particular mix of traffic by making use of high-level information from the scheduler. This mechanism is based on a principle of separation between scheduling and admission control. A linear programming formulation is used to find the admission control policy which will maximize the expected system utility while maintaining the guaranteed quality of service. The admissible load region is introduced as a means of quantifying the capacity of a switch under the QOS constraints at the cell and call levels. Numerical calculations for a single MAGNET II switching node carrying two classes of real-time traffic are used to illustrate the effects of different scheduling and admisssion control policies on both the expected utility and the admissible load region.
