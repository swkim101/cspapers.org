In these notes we develop explicit examples to help understanding the role of uniformity in Ludics. This is the key notion that underlies the move from behaviours to bihaviours. Uniformity arises in relation with full completeness for Linear Logic (more preciselyMALL2). Indeed, internal completeness of behaviours is not enough. Our aim is to show explicitly where uniformity is necessary. We also underline that uniformity is not explicitly necessary to prove that the Fax is the only \good" inhabitant of A ` A.
