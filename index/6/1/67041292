Meta-models in software engineering are used to 
define properties of models. Therefore the evolution of the metamodels 
influences the evolution of the models and the software 
instantiated from them. The evolution of the meta-models is 
particularly problematic if the software has to instantiate two 
versions of the same meta-model - a situation common for longterm 
software development projects such as car development 
projects. In this paper, we present a case study of the evolution 
of the standardized meta-model used in the development of 
the automotive software systems – the AUTOSAR meta-model 
– at Volvo Car Corporation. The objective of this study is to 
assist the automotive software designers in planning long term 
development projects based on multiple AUTOSAR meta-model 
versions. We achieve this by visualizing the size and complexity 
increase between different versions of the AUTOSAR meta-model 
and by calculating the number of changes which need to be 
implemented in order to adopt a newer AUTOSAR meta-model 
version. The analysis is done for each major role in the automotive 
development process affected by the changes.
