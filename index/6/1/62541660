The Galileo program, an initiative of the European Union, aims at providing navigation services to end users worldwide. Initial services are provided with the EGNOS System (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System). The presentation will address the context of the decision of member states to implement an autonomous European Navigation System, independent from GPS (Global Positioning System) but interoperable with it. The main characteristics of this space system and of the services it will provide, the applications which are expected and the corresponding markets. The recent decisions taken by the European Commission to reprofile the program will be introduced, the role of the different actors in particular the European GNSS supervisory authority as well as the status of development including the launch of the first experimental spacecraft by ESA, the European Space Agency. The international dimension of this emblematic European program will be described and the potential of third countries to participate in and benefit from its development underlined.
