We are very excited about this year’s program. Our outstanding invited speakers cover a range of cutting edge topics from a number of disciplinary areas including the latest findings on sleep and the brain, psychobiological reactivity to stress, education inequality, interpersonal risk and depression, and peer victimization among sexual minority youth. Invited panels also cover important topics related to neurocognition, intersectionality and health, positive youth development, the risks and opportunities of social media and transgender and gender non-conforming youth. Also included on the program are an invited roundtable where you can get practical tips on conducting international research, an invited panel to consider the future of developmental science, an invited workshop where you will learn strategies for writing for nonacademic audiences, and a new format – a “data blitz” to offer rapid presentations on adolescents and social media use. Finally, on Thursday night we will have a special screening of the documentary, “Screenagers” with a moderated discussion after the film (and popcorn and cash bar during!). We hope this will be a more informal and fun opportunity to engage in conversation and share ideas. Please join us for these invited sessions as they take place in the morning and throughout each day of the conference.
