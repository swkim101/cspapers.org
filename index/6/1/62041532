In this paper, an alternate passive leg structure is proposed for Tricept machine tool to form a modified Tricept machine tool. The global stiffness of the modified Tricept is derived and compared with that of the Tricept machine tool. First, the configurations of the Tricept and modified Tricept are introduced respectively. Then, the global velocity equations are derived and the stiffness models of the two configurations are presented and analyzed. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the two types of passive leg structure are analyzed and concluded and stiffness simulations are conducted.Copyright Â© 2004 by ASME
