The main intent of this paper is to highlight the design and development of a web based centralised software asset management system. It is used for archiving and maintaining in-house developed and open source domain-specific software assets. This system will aid in effective organisational software asset management and software reusability that will in turn improve the software development time, reduce the duplication in efforts for building similar assets, reduce the overall development cost and improve the software quality and productivity.
