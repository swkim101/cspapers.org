Today most mobile operating systems provide users with an application portal where they can search for applications published by third-party developers. In this paper we present opportunities with AppAware, a mobile platform that allows developers, companies and researchers to bootstrap their applications by letting users to discover new mobile apps with the help of each other. AppAware captures and shares installations, updates, and removals of Android programs in real time and allows its users to see what applications are being installed right now, thus increasing the visibility of third-party programs as well as researchersâ€™ applications.
