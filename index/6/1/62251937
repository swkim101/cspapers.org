Logica Space and Communications Ltd., as sub-contractors to ICL Data Finland are implementing the SCP and SMS part of intelligent network services for Telecom Finland. The IN system will comprise new generation Nokia DX200 digital exchanges, from Nokia Telecommunications, acting as SSP, together with Tandem service control points (SCPs) and service management system (SMS). The architecture used is in accordance with the Bellcore advanced intelligent network, (AIN) release 1 architecture. The system for Telecom Finland is believed to be the first of its kind in the world (using the AIN release 1 architecture), and is expected to be operational by the end of 1992. In the course of the design and implementation, a number of architectural issues have been identified. From his experience in using the new AIN architecture, the author describes some key issues and the solutions that have been adopted. These are: feature interaction rules to cater for when more than one IN feature is invoked for the same call; IN features which continue for an extended period; provision of mechanisms to allow the caller to interrupt the progress of a call-recall facility; and database integrity over multiple SCPs when updates are made directly at an SCP such as for a 'follow-me' service.
