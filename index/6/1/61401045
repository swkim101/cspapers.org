In this research paper, comparison of edge detection methods is presented in leaf shape analysis for plant classification. Leaf is a very significant component of plant species that identify and classify the plants. Plant classification is the task performed by trained botanists and taxonomists. This task includes performing a set of operations. Because of this the task of classification of plants manually is time consuming. There are many biometric features of the leaves of the plants for classification. In this paper, Sobel and Canny edge detection methods are compared for their performance in leaf shape analysis operation for plant classification.
