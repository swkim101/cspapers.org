We describe a set of techniques for Arabic cross-document coreference resolution. We compare a baseline system of exact mention string-matching to ones that include local mention context information as well as information from an existing machine translation system. It turns out that the machine translation-based technique outperforms the baseline, but local entity context similarity does not. This helps to point the way for future cross-document coreference work in languages with few existing resources for the task.
