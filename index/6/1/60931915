A Software companies are often challenged with providing QA and testing of their software in an effective and efficient manner. What a QA staff and project management must do to make software quality more certain? They must have adequate software project management and test management infrastructure such is Optimal Software Quality Management (OptimalSQM) Framework. OptimalSQM Framework consists of a Business Intelligent Simulation Architecture with integrated Software expert tools (Profit eXpert, Planner eXpert, Risk Management eXpert, Quality eXpert, Maintenance eXpert, People Performance eXpert and Process Dynamics Control eXpert) in order to find optimal development activity combination at the beginning for every SDLC model. OptimalSQM solution is an faster, better and cheaper solution which enable software designers to achieve a higher quality for their design, a better insight into quality predictions for their design choices, test plans improvement using Simulated Defect Removal Cost Savings model as we described in this paper. In this paper we described OptimalSQM Framework Architecture, proposed a set of components which enables to minimize the cost of switching between test plan alternatives, when the current choice cannot fulfill the quality constraints.
