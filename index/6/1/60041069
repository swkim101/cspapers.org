Shared Virtual Environments Seamless collaboration has long been a research goal of shared virtual environments (SVEs). The particular characteristics of SVEs that differ from VEs are the multiple users, real time interaction, and combination of social and technical interaction that occurs in the environment during the time the users use it. In the SVEs the users are allowed to communicate, and cooperate instrumentally in a process of shared creation of results. In these environments the focus is on the kind of collaboration at a given moment; the users (co-located or distributed) can be present and have access to the same simulated environment.
