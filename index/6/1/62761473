The divergent tree method was adopted in this paper, and an illustrative example of tool storage design in the machining center was given to describe the divergent thinking in the conceptual design process of mechanical products. Firstly general divergent tree method was applied to get various schemes of storage, then the primary schemes were achieved by using the measure of known characteristics, finally the excellent degree appraisal approach was applied to find out the optimum one. In addition, an intelligent computer aided conceptual design system of tool storage based on the divergent tree method and excellent degree appraisal approach was demonstrated in this paper.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
