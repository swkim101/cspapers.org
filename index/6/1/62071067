Welcome to the 1st Workshop on Virtual Machine Security (VMSec)! 
 
In these proceedings, you will find the 7 papers presented at VMSec Workshop, held on October 31st at George Mason University in conjunction with the ACM Conference on Computer & Communications Security. This workshop aims to bring together leading researchers and practitioners in the fields of virtualization and security to present the latest work on these topics. This year we had 20 submissions and we decided to accept six (6) full papers and one (1) short paper. A program committee of 11 experts reviewed and discussed the papers. Each paper received at least 3 reviews from the PC members with most of the papers having 4 reviews in total. Some of the papers were very controversial and were discussed in detail by the PC members after the end of the review process. The final decisions were made based on those discussions. 
 
VMSec is the first workshop to deal exclusively with virtual machine security. Virtualization has seen an explosion in growth in deployment, implementations, and applications. In addition, it seems that virtualization holds unique properties that make it attractive for security including isolation, compartmentalization, live state capture, and replay. In the past, virtualization has been used to study malicious software as well as to prevent malicious software infection. We believe that the large-scale use of virtualization offers new opportunities and challenges regarding security. We hope that this workshop will provoke fruitful discussions for researchers and practitioners, from both industry and academia.
