With the development of robotics and artificial intelligence field unceasingly thorough, path planning as an important field of robot calculation has been widespread concern. This paper analyzes the current development of robot and path planning algorithm and focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional intelligent path planning as well as the path planning. The problem of mobile robot path planning is studied by using ant colony algorithm, and it also provides some solving methods.
