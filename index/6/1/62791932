We revisit the all-pairs-shortest-paths problem for an unweighted undirected graph with <i>n</i> vertices and <i>m</i> edges. We present new algorithms with the following running times:[EQUATION]These represent the best time bounds known for the problem for all <i>m</i> â‰ª <i>n</i><sup>1.376</sup>. We also obtain a similar type of result for the diameter problem for unweighted directed graphs.
