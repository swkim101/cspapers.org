This paper addresses how can we build an effective and profitable E- learning application for language learners. Most of applications in this kind has been developed authors; viewpoint. They frequently neglect what users really want. To be an application effective, users are interesting to access it. This naturally induces that applications should provide what users want according to their preferences. But existing applications are not capable of satisfying each user's preferences. For an alternative, this paper suggests on-line type applications that can provide unlimited number of contents on demand of users. It is believed that this makes applications sustainable at marketing viewpoint. In previous model, consumption is taken place just one time at the point of purchasing an application. But in this new model, consumption is taken place continuously whenever users consume contents provided by the applications.
