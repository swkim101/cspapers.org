This paper presents an overview of TRIPOLI-4®, the fourth generation of the 3D continuous-energy Monte Carlo code developed by the Service d’Etudes des Reacteurs et de Mathematiques Appliquees (SERMA) at CEA Saclay. The paper surveys the generic features: programming language, parallel operation, tracked particles, nuclear data, geometry, simulation modes, standard variance reduction techniques, sources, tracking and collision algorithms, tallies, sensitivity studies. Moreover, specific and recent features are also detailed: Doppler broadening of the elastic scattering kernel, neutron and photon material irradiation, advanced variance reduction techniques, Green’s functions, cycle correlation correction, nuclear data management and depletion capabilities. The productivity tools (T4G, SALOME TRIPOLI, T4RootTools), the Verification & Validation process and the distribution and licensing policy are finally presented.
