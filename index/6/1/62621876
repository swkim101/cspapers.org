This paper presents a useful measuring method for rapidly verifying geometric errors using a double-readheads planar encoder system (DRPES). With the calculated model and the various specified test paths, the proposed measuring method provide the rapid performance, simplicity of setup, low cost and pre-process verification of CNC machine tools. Complete setups and procedures for geometric error verification are clearly presented. Experimental results showed that more information on analyzing the types of errors can be obtained and the performance of verification can be further improved. The proposed system completes the geometric verification of a CNC machine tool within one hour.Copyright Â© 2003 by ASME
