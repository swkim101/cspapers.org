A steadily increasing fraction of human activities involves interacting with machines, and this interaction will become more sophisticated as more and more machines in our environment are controlled by computers. As the degree of sophistication of this interaction increases, its quality becomes more important. This is particularly true in computer-based education where a student is expected to learn something by interacting with a machine for an extended period of time.
 Quality of interaction has various aspects. The most obvious is the physical properties of the man-machine interface: to what extent does the machine allow the human senses of sight, sound, touch to come into play? Early teaching machines were at best suitable for rote training tasks in restricted applications. Only recently have computer terminals been developed whose physical properties make this interface suitable for computer-based education in a wide variety of subject areas. All indications are that rapid progress will continue, particularly in the important aspect of reduced costs.
