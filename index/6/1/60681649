This paper provides an overview of the impetus towards open access to scholarly outputs in institutional repositories. It contrasts this with two major research assessment initiatives: Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) and Research Quality Framework (Australia), which focus on creating repositories restricted to assessors / expert panels for viewing purposes. The paper examines how these latter activities could be leveraged to increase content in eprint repositories. In addition the traditional self-archiving approach for populating eprint repositories is contrasted with a model based on mediated submission.
