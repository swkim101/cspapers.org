A deterministic, nearly linear-time, approximation algorithm FastInterlaceGreedy is developed, for the maximization of non-monotone submodular functions under cardinality constraint. The approximation ratio of $1/4 - \varepsilon$ is an improvement over the next fastest deterministic algorithm for this problem, which requires quadratic time to achieve ratio $1/6 - \varepsilon$. The algorithm FastInterlaceGreedy is a novel interlacing of multiple greedy procedures and is validated in the context of two applications, on which FastInterlaceGreedy outperforms the fastest deterministic and randomized algorithms in prior literature.
