Small Portable Hoist (SPH) is needed in many special occasions; the load-capacity (LC) is one of the most important metrics. There are few researches direct related on SPH and the LC is calculated by Euler’s formula in most published related literatures. Because of the SPH’s unique, experimental research is carried out on the LC, an optimization of Euler’s formula is got by analyzing the effects of wrap angle φ, end tension FB, and relative size of r and R. This optimization is more accurate and it deepens the understanding of the friction between wheel and the bending rope.Small Portable Hoist (SPH) is needed in many special occasions; the load-capacity (LC) is one of the most important metrics.
