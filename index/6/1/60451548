This paper proposes a dynamic model supporting multimodal state space probability distributions and presents the application of the model in dealing with visual occlusions when tracking multiple objects jointly. For a set of hypotheses, multiple measurements are acquired at each time instant. The model switches among a set of hypothesized measurements during the propagation. Two computationally efficient filtering algorithms are derived for online joint tracking. Both the occlusion relationship and state of the objects are recursively estimated from the history of measurement data. The switching hypothesized measurements (SHM) model is generally applicable to describe various dynamic processes with multiple alternative measurement methods.
