The multi-agent system paradigm is becoming an important design and development tool for complex distributed systems. The paradigm, however, presents a number of challengers, such as openness and interoperability. In this paper we present a tool design based on application of two different formal specification techniques which allows designer to interactively construct verifiably correct and interoperable agent specifications. The design method underlying the tool is based on a combination of a process algebra and state-based specification.
