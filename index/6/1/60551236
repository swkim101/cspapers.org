We focus on problems with robotics applications, where we are faced with some additional constraints: •nonlinear forward model that needs to be learned from data •parameters, controls and observations are continuous •decisions have to be taken quickly, sometimes in real-time • controls and observations are typically high-dimensional Under these constraints, solving these types of problems is often analytically intractable, and sampling methods quickly become untenable.
