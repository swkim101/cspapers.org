The advances in technology to support complex communication services, such as the pervasiveness of mobile devices and the convergence of multimedia communication over digital networks, has resulted in a need for a new approach to model and realize communication services. The stovepipe approach used to develop today's communication applications is no longer effective since it results in a lengthy and costly development cycle. In this paper we present an approach that allows a user (end-user or domain expert) to model and realize communication services using a model-driven approach. We describe a semi-formal communication logic which is the meta-model for creating instances of user communication services. To show the applicability of our approach we demonstrate how models are created and realized using our prototype and a scenario from the healthcare domain.
