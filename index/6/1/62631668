The paper presents a HPC calculation of a conjugate heat transfer simulation in fuel assembly as those found in liquid metal coolant fast reactors. The wire spacers, helically wound along each pin axis, generate a strong secondary flow pattern in opposition to smooth pins. Assemblies with a range of pins going from 7 to 271 have been simulated, 271 pins corresponding to the industrial case. Both the fluid domain, as well as the solid part, are detailed leading to large meshes. The fluid is handled by the CFD code Code_Saturne using 98 million cells, while the solid domain is taken care of thanks to the thermal code SYRTHES on meshes up to 240 million cells. Both codes are fully parallel and run on cluster with hundreds of processors. Simulations allow access to the temperature field in nominal conditions and degraded situations.
