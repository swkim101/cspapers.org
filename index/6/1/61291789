Many database applications in the real world are no longer built on top of a stand-alone database system. Rather, generic (standard) application systems are employed in which the database system is one integrated component. SAP is the market leader for integrated business administration systems, and its SAP R/3 product is a comprehensive software system which integrates modules for finance, material management, sales and distribution, etc. From an architectural point of view, SAP R/3 is a client/server application system with a relational database system as back-end. SAP supports a choice between a variety of commercial relational database products.
