Construction companies in Australia's Northern Territory not only face the challenges common to all other competitors in the construction business, they must also operate in an environment that is geographically, socially and culturally isolated. This has a considerable impact on the performance of these companies, including their ability to successfully adopt innovative information and communication technologies (ICT). In this case study of a remotely located construction company, an action research based approach - Soft Systems Methodology - is used to investigate the capability of the company to acquire and manage the knowledge required to successfully adopt innovative ICT. The transformation into a learning organisation is a key process of successful knowledge management that this study will seek to identify and understand. Indentifying how organisational culture can be adapted to ensure that it does not become a barrier to learning and other knowledge management processes is a key outcome of this study.
