Welcome to the 8th Annual ACM International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications and Services -- MobiSys'10 -- in beautiful San Francisco. MobiSys provides a highly-selective forum for cutting-edge research that takes a broad systems perspective of mobile computing. Papers appearing in this year's conference cover a range of topics: from smartphones and energy-efficient localization to collaborative sensing and automotive applications. Notably, there is an increasing emphasis on smartphones, which reflects their growing momentum as powerful, programmable mobile systems. 
 
Continuing the tradition of past conferences, this year's conference is preceded by a day of workshops and a PhD forum. Prof. Rosalind W. Picard and Prof. Deborah Estrin are delivering the keynote speeches this year, discussing their research in affective computing and participatory sensing. The demonstration and poster chair, Romit Roy Choudhary, has put together an exciting session that exhibits the best of the current work in our field. 
 
MobiSys'10 received 126 submissions, which is roughly the same as the last three years. The papers were reviewed in two rounds. Each paper received at least three reviews during the first round. Based on these reviews, 86 papers were selected to be reviewed in the second round, with each paper receiving up to two additional reviews. All papers discussed at the PC meeting received at least five reviews, almost all of them from PC members. In addition, every review was read and vetted for quality by the PC chairs. All told, our diligent reviewers produced 527 reviews. 
 
We discussed 59 papers at an all-day PC meeting, which followed the HotMobile workshop in Annapolis, MD. At the meeting, 25 papers were accepted to appear in the conference program. All accepted papers were shepherded by a PC member.
