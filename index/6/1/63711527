Urban lighting and urban display systems shape the image of cities at night. However, they are strictly separate realms of urban design and technology development. Even though many cities regulate the use of large-scale digital displays in public spaces cities are becoming increasingly illuminated. What interaction design and urban design opportunities arise if we eliminate the distinction between urban lighting and display technology? On the one hand, programmable pixels would enable ad-hoc reshaping of urban form throughout the evening because light outlines the image of the city at night. On the other hand, responsive systems would facilitate interactions among urban residents. Together reshaping urban form and enhancing interactions could increase the de-light-ful character of cities at night without increasing overall light levels.
