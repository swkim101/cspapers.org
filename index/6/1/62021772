International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) is developing draft recommendations on a data oriented human-machine interface specification technique. Draft recommendation text exists on the following topics: approach; reference model; method; data design; formalism; documentation; example documentation; handling of time; explanation and usage of the formalism; requirements of the formalism; and relationships between the HMI and TMN reference models. Also, early attempts have been made to apply the specification technique to the following application areas: alarm surveillance; traffic administration; and access control administration. This paper puts the proposed specification technique into a theoretical perspective for application designers and developers of specification techniques. >
