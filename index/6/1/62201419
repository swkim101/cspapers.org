The meshless method is a new kind numerical method which does not require the division of the grid. In this paper, a meshless method based on collocation method with radial basis functions is developed for the farmland drainage problems. The method is applied to solve the one-dimensional unstable flow equations that under uniform intensity of infiltration. The numerical solutions are got through iteration to the equations. A comparison of the new method with the finite element method through practical calculation examples shows that the new method can be used very well on solving the farmland drainage problems. It has high precision, good convergence and strong practicability. Keywords-Infiltration; Drainage; Groundwater; Radial basis; Meshless
