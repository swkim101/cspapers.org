The hardware which supports these design applications must offer very high performance. VLSI design requires fast graphics performance for rapid creation, manipulation, and modification of layout and schematics. Specialized graphics hardware, optimized for displaying geometric layout structures, cart dramatically improve performance. Design rule checking and, in the case of symbolic layout, circuit compaction, are compute intensive applications
