The most recent upgrades of the electromagnetic (EM) physics "standard" and "low energy" sub-libraries of the general purpose Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit are described. These upgrades are relevant to different application domains including high energy physics, medical physics and space science. Validation results are presented and discussed.
