Welcome to ACM VANET 2011, the Eighth ACM International Workshop on Vehicular Inter-Networking! Following the previous VANET workshops since 2003, 2011 is another great year to continue this exciting workshop. 
 
Based on short- and medium-range communication like DSRC or WiFi as well as on long-range cellular systems, vehicular networking will enable vehicular safety applications (including collision avoidance and safety warnings), efficiency applications (e.g. real-time traffic congestion and routing information) and other commercial or public authority applications (high-speed tolling, mobile infotainment, and many others). 
 
The great potential of this technology has been acknowledged with the establishment of ambitious research programs on vehicular communication systems worldwide, such as the current InteractIVe and eCoMOVE projects within the European eSafety framework, various US projects derived from the US DOT Connected Vehicle program, and the Japanese Smartway and Advanced Safety Vehicle programs. Furthermore, vehicular communication and networking also present a very active field of standardization activities worldwide. Examples include ISO TC204, IEEE (802.11p and 1609.x) and SAE DSRC TC in the US, ETSI TC ITS and CEN WG278 in Europe and ARIB T-75 in Japan, as well as field trials like the large-scale Safety Pilot Model Deployment in the US, simTD in Germany and SCORE-F in France. 
 
The Technical Program Committee has prepared an exciting program of technical presentations focusing on many interesting aspects of the vehicular communication area. We have published 9 papers, out of a total of 25 submissions, which will be presented orally. Additionally, 8 of the submissions have been accepted as posters. The papers cover the full range of wireless communications in a vehicular environment, from protocol and algorithm design to application and system development, and to experiment analysis.
