An application of Artificial Intelligence is discussed: an automatic programming system that generates Information retrieval programs and data base structure designs for highly structured or network data bases. It is claimed that these applications are unusual in that they have more practical value than is usually the case, being of Immediate utility to commercial data base management. The paper concludes with a short reflection on the problems associated with the representation and acquisition of knowledge for problem solving programs. In particular, representation of knowledge is Important for efficiency of the programs, yet an efficient representation may not be "natural". It was difficult to separate representation from content, and successful application required that the expert providing the knowledge also know how the program uses that knowledge.
