This paper presents a heterogeneous sensor networks to improve query processing mechanism. Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of centralized query processing algorithm is proposed based on the spatial distance distributed query processing algorithm based on semantic similarity and distributed query processing algorithms for query execution processes described. Use simulation to choose better coverage and semantic similarity by half, and centralized query processing algorithm, based on the spatial distance distributed algorithms, distributed algorithms and performance-based semantic distributed hybrid algorithm were compared.
