We present an example of the use of multi-attribute utility analysis in the design of a robot system. Multi-attribute utility analysis is a tool used by systems engineers to aid in deciding amongst numerous alternatives. Its strength lies in the fact that very different metrics can be compared, and that it takes unto account human preferences and risk attitudes. As a design tool, multi-attribute utility analysis is performed off line, during the system design phase, to choose among possible designs, components, gains, etc. We offer a demonstration of multi-attribute utility analysis in designing a hybrid switched-system visual servo system. We have previously introduced such a system, and here use multi-attribute utility analysis to select a switching algorithm that best suits the needs of a specific user.
