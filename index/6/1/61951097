It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2015 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Ph.D. Symposium. This year's symposium continues its tradition, which is intended to bring together Ph.D. students working on topics related to the SIGMOD and PODS conference. The workshop will offer Ph.D. students the opportunity to present, discuss, and receive feedback on their research in a constructive and international atmosphere. The workshop will be accompanied by prominent professors, researchers and practitioners in the fields of database technology. These accompanying professors will participate actively and contribute to the discussions. The call for papers attracted 11 submissions from different parts of the world. The program committee accepted 9 proposals that cover a variety of topics, including stream and large scale data processing, query languages and query processing. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech given by Prof. Tova Milo, from the School of Computer Science of Tel Aviv University. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for Ph.D. students.
