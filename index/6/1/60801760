A theory of Q/A has been proposed from the perspective of natural language processing that relieson ideas in conceptual information processing and theories of human memory organization. This theory of Q/A has been implemented in a computer program, QUALM. QUALM is currently used by two story understanding systems (SAM and PAM) to complete a natural language processing system that reads stories and answers questions about what was read.
