A new nuclear de-excitation model, intended for accurate simulation of isomeric transition of excited nuclei, was incorporated into PHITS and applied to various situations to clarify the impact of the model. The case studies show that precise treatment of gamma de-excitation and consideration for isomer production are important for various applications such as detector performance prediction, radiation shielding calculations and the estimation of radioactive inventory including isomers.
