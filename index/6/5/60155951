There is no shortage of clustering algorithms, and recently a new wave of excitement has spread across the machine learning community mainly because of the important development of spectral methods. At the same time, there is also growing interest around fundamental questions pertaining to the very nature of the clustering problem (see, e.g., [17, 1, 28]). Yet, despite the tremendous progress in the field, the clustering problem remains elusive and a satisfactory answer even to the most basic questions is still to come.
