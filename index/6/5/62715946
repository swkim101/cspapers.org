In accordance with the product families, process platforms have been recognized as a promising tool for companies to configure optimal, yet similar, production processes for producing different products. This paper tackles process platform formation from large volumes of production data available in companies’ production systems. A data mining methodology based on text mining and tree matching is developed for the formation of process platforms. A case study of high variety production of vibration motors for mobile phones is reported to prove the feasibility and potential of forming process platforms using text mining and tree matching.Copyright © 2007 by ASME
