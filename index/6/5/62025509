The circuit correction rule-based expert system (CIRCOR) for the repair oriented diagnosis of NMOS and CMOS digital circuits is presented. Its objective is, in spite of testing, to reduce or eliminate the need for human analysis of tester-generated failure messages. The program can handle all types of physical failures that can occur in integrated circuits, that is: shorts, opens, extra transistors, missing transistors terminals within the range of primitive building blocks specified by the user. In the verification systems described by Lob (1985), Apfelbaum (1986) or Papaspyridis (1988) the transistor level description of the circuit is checked against its specification, which was entered for example textually in a language. CIRCOR offers the possibility to diagnose circuits only on the basis of extracted transistor level description. >
