In IMS overlay network, real-time media multipath transmission constructed based on application layer relay, is a kind of upgrading method of IMS media transmission technology. In the session establishment process, the merits of path QoS evaluation are needed. The paper presents a suitable path QoS estimation algorithm for this network model, and realizes effective measurement of delay and available bandwidth between relay nodes. And corresponding message interaction process is designed. Finally, the simulation results show that the new mechanism could measure path QoS quickly and accurately through comparison and analysis.
