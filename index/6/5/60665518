A comprehensive non-real time aircraft ground handling model is being investigated at Brighton Polytechnic; the model simulates the response of the aircraft to steering, control surface deflections, braking and gust inputs. Tyre deformities, shock strut non-linearities and the axis transformation between the ground and the aircraft axis sets are also included. The objective of the work is to determine the level of complexity required to provide a high fidelity simulation of ground handling characteristics. The work is intended to be a step towards providing better simulator pilot training for on the ground emergencies.
