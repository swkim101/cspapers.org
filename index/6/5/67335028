In this paper, a 4×4 dual-band Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna which operates at 28 and 38 GHz bands for future fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology is proposed. Based on RT5880 with height of 0.79mm, the total size of MIMO antenna is 19.25 × 26 × 0.79 mm3. With structure of 1×2 phased array single antenna, the MIMO antenna gets wide-bands of 14.3% and 5.26% at 28 GHz and 38 GHz, respectively. Besides, the MIMO antenna achieves low mutual coupling for all operating bands with close distance of 0.7mm thanks to using novel round patch Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) cell. The design of dual-band MIMO antenna is optimized and validated by simulation using CST-MW Studio as well as by measurement.
