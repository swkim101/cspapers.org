It is our pleasure to welcome you to the 2010 Workshop on the Analysis and Programming Languages for Web Applications and Cloud Applications (APLWACA, pronounced "apple-whacka"). 
 
APLWACA is a new forum that aims to bring together programming language researchers working in the area of web and cloud applications. The deployment and use of web and cloud applications has increased dramatically in recent years; we felt that this important and growing area is under-examined by programming language researchers. This workshop seeks to publicize and popularize web and cloud application research in the programming language community. The focus of the workshop is primarily on reliability, security, and performance of web and cloud applications. The call for papers encouraged proposals of new, speculative ideas, evaluations of new or known techniques in practical settings;,and discussions of important existing and emerging problems. 
 
The call for papers attracted 9 submissions: 3 full-length papers, and 6 short papers. Each submission received at least three reviews. All reviews were made available to all program committee members, and the !nal decision on which papers to accept was made during an on-line program committee meeting. Two long papers and four short ones will appear in the proceedings and be presented at the Workshop.
