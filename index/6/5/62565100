In this work, safety of motorcycle helmet design is investigated by using standard oblique impact test method. First, testing procedure is explained and test rig mechanism is introduced. Next, standard impact tests are performed on helmets. Data are collected using a tri-axial linear accelerometer embedded inside the headform and a high speed camera for measuring rotational acceleration. Then, results are studied and compared to injurious limit for human head injury. It is shown that during an oblique impact rotational acceleration can easily surpass the safe limit while the linear acceleration is well below the safe limit.Â© 2012 ASME
