This paper proposes a method for power system fault diagnosis and location which employs machine learning of a fuzzy rule base. The fuzzy rule base is learned off-line employing data sets obtained from simulations using the Power Systems Computer Aided Design (PSCAD) package. These simulations are performed with diverse combinations of faults at various locations in order to generate extensive data sets from which fuzzy rules and membership functions can be extracted.
