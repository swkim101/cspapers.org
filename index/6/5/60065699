This paper describes the radar management and real time control systems designed and developed for the demonstration of advanced radar techniques (DART) radar. The radar management computer controls the distributed radar sub-systems by a sophisticated Ethernet control network aided by real time control signals. This paper outlines the radar management, Ethernet and control hardware and describes the real-time and Ethernet control software. >
