Inverse simulation is an inverse process of a direct simulation. During the process, the simulation input variables are identified for a given set of simulation output variables. Uncertainties such as random parameters may exist in engineering applications of inverse simulation. A reliability method is developed in this work to estimate the probability distributions of unknown simulation input. The First Order Reliability Method is employed and modified so that the inverse simulation is embedded within the reliability analysis algorithm. This treatment avoids the separate executions of reliability analysis and inverse simulation and consequently maintains high efficiency. In addition, the means and standard deviations of unknown input variables can also be obtained. A particle impact problem is presented to demonstrate the proposed method for inverse simulation under uncertainty.Copyright Â© 2012 by ASME
