The paper describes research into the design of real-time synchronisation and control software for a high-speed packaging machine utilising independent drives. The machine is of a novel modular design which exploits the flexibility that is introduced by the use of software controlled independent drives. It is intended for use in flexible manufacturing applications. The software is used to coordinate, synchronise and control the machine function and to implement rapid software-controlled machine reconfiguration. The research led to a method of fast prototyping a design using the concurrent programming language Occam. The design can then be verified and implemented using a transputer-based controller. The work has been applied to a demonstrator project which is described in detail. This new approach to machine design shows significant improvements over the traditional approach and has now been adopted in industry. This research has been conducted as part of the SERC Specially Promoted Programme on High Speed Machinery. >
