Information of topology is significant for network planning and management in the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). In this paper we propose a topology identification algorithm based on data fusion system in WSN. Firstly, the algorithm got the collections of approximate ancestors of each node according to the information of packet delay and/or packet loss. Secondly, it identifies parent-child relationship of the nodes by calculating the Hamming distance between the current node and approximate ancestors nodes; and infers the topology of the network layer by layer. It use end-to-end measurements and does not incur any additional burden on the network. NS2 simulation results show the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
