Calculation of fatigue damage and fatigue life of a mixing tee considering uncertainty on loading and strength parameters has been achieved by conducting Monte Carlo simulations with the aim of clarifying the effect of the uncertainties on the prediction of fatigue damage and quantifying the level of safety of mixing tee designs.
