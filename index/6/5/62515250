At some time in their lives 60-80 percent of the population will experience one episode of low-back pain (LBP), of whom 90 percent will get better within six to eight weeks without need for treatment or investigation. The remaining ten percent incur 70-90 percent of the medical costs arising from low-back pain and represent a challenge to health practitioners in providing an accurate diagnosis and successful management. The aim of this chapter is to discover the key inputs which a low-back pain multilayer perceptron network uses to classify selected training-case examples using a knowledge discovery method and to show how a rule can then be directly induced from each training example. Preliminary results are presented of the top-ranked key inputs which the LBP MLP uses to classify all training cases for each diagnostic class. It is shown how the validation of the top-ranked key inputs by the domain experts can lead to the validation of the LBP MLP network during both training and testing.
