The structural, elastic, electronic, phonon and thermodynamic properties of uranium nitride (UN) have been systematically studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The calculated electronic band structure shows that UN is a metallic phase. The ground state structural and elastic properties predicted by DFT agree well with experiments. The thermodynamic properties of UN are studied by quasiharmonic approximation by including both lattice vibrational and thermal electronic contributions to free energies. The calculated enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs energy and heat capacity show an excellent agreement with experimental results. The thermal electronic contribution due to 5f electrons of U is found to be critical to describe the free energy of UN due to its metallic character.
