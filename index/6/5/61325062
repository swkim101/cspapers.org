Typically, abstract machines may be nested, providing different services and levels of abstraction to different sets of users. Thus, the expectations of object-oriented programmers may differ markedly from those of C programmers, even though both may be targetting real-time applications. At a lower level, however, the abstract machines to support objects and C may be implemented in turn by a common abstract machine. The price to be paid for this kind of support is run-time performance. This paper describes CTDNet2, an abstract machine, for parallel computer architectures aimed at the requirements of real-time. >
