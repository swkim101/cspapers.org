This paper deals with the geometric issues that arise in designing a system for measuring the orientation of an object in three dimensional space using a new class of wireless angular position sensors. The wireless sensors are waveguides that receive and record the electromagnetic energy emitted by a polarized RF source. The angular position of the waveguide relative to the source is indicated by the energy level. A system equipped with multiple waveguides is used as a 3D orientation sensor. This paper explores the geometry for orientation measurement using the system and provides the guidelines for sensor design.Copyright Â© 2003 by ASME
