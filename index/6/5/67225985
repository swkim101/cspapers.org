It is our great pleasure to welcome you to The Second ACM Annual International Workshop on Mission-Oriented Wireless Sensor Networking -- ACM MiSeNet'13. The second edition of this year's workshop is the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of mission-oriented wireless sensor networks, including models, systems, applications, and theory. The mission of the workshop is to understand the major technical and application challenges as well as exchange and discuss scientific and engineering ideas related to architecture, protocols, algorithms, and application design in mission-oriented wireless sensor networks, and identify new directions for future research and development. ACM MiSeNet gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of mission-oriented wireless sensor networking. 
 
The call for papers attracted 12 submissions from Africa, Asia, Canada, Europe, and the United States. The program committee accepted 8 papers that cover a variety of topics, including data delivery in vehicular networking, data aggregation, quality of event assessment, human-machine interactions, graph-based modeling, reachability verification, indoor location fingerprints, and queuing modeling for delay analysis in missionoriented sensor networks. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech by Prof. Jie Wu on the trajectory optimization for mobile chargers in wireless sensor networks. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers in the area of mission-oriented wireless sensor networking.
