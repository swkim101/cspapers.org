One of the wide applications for automation in the area of solar energy is sun-tracking system in which control theory is employed to drive the solar collector or concentrator towards the sun in all times. Sun-tracking system can allow the solar collector to harness maximum solar irradiance due to the nature of apparent motion of the sun relative to the earth during the day. The critical issue of installing sun-tracker to any solar collector is more towards investment and return. How much improvement in energy gain in term of kilowatt hour versus the cost of tracker is the main consideration in this issue?
