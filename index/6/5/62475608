With the diversification of Bluetooth4.0, location based information service shows a bright future. More and more indoor scenes need efficient localization algorithm. In order to eliminate the error caused by multipath effect in indoor environment, fingerprint locating algorithm has gradually become main solution for indoor localization. However, traditional fingerprint locating algorithm uses Gauss distribution as exclusive probability model. It neglects the influence of human, time and other factors on indoor localization. In order to improve locating accuracy, this paper proposes EPLA, an efficient fingerprint locaitng algorithm for Bluetooth4.0. EPLA provide a probability model select algorithm which use different probability model to improve locating accuracy and stability. Simulation results show that EPLA has 30% error distance less than 0:5m. When the error distance is 2.5m, the difference between maximum and minimum offset is only 2%.
