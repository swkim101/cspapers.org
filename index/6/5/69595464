Traditionally, most of the existing attribute learning methods are trained based on the consensus of annotations aggregated from a limited number of annotators. However, the consensus might fail in settings, especially when a wide spectrum of annotators with different interests and comprehension about the attribute words are involved. In this paper, we develop a novel multi-task method to understand and predict personalized attribute annotations. Regarding the attribute preference learning for each annotator as a specific task, we first propose a multi-level task parameter decomposition to capture the evolution from a highly popular opinion of the mass to highly personalized choices that are special for each person. Meanwhile, for personalized learning methods, ranking prediction is much more important than accurate classification. This motivates us to employ an Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) based loss function to improve our model. On top of the AUC-based loss, we propose an efficient method to evaluate the loss and gradients. Theoretically, we propose a novel closed-form solution for one of our non-convex subproblem, which leads to provable convergence behaviors. Furthermore, we also provide a generalization bound to guarantee a reasonable performance. Finally, empirical analysis consistently speaks to the efficacy of our proposed method.
