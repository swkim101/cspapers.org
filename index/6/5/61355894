This paper deals with the automatic translation of route descriptions into graphic sketches. We discuss some general problems implied by such inter-mode transcription. We propose a model for an automatic text-to-image translator with a two-stage intermediate representation in which the linguistic representation of a route description precedes the creation of its conceptual representation.
