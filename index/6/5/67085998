As the salient existence of the flow-induced vibration phenomenon, the well operation of the three-stage multi-nozzle ejector can not be guaranteed. To reduce the vibrating level, the ejector structure needs to be improved. The hammering modal test on ejector was done using multi-input single-output analysis method; The suitable boundary conditions of supports were confirmed and the finite element model was proved accurate through the comparative analysis of modal test and relevant simulation. The optimization of the form of supports were done, which significantly improved the first three modal frequencies of the ejector as the result of modal analysis shown. So, the low frequency resonance could be avoided greatly.
