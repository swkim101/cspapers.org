The construction of the semantic representation for a natural language sentence or a piece of discourse cannot be covered by the so-called "compositional semantics" alone. In the general case, the non-compositional construction steps of generating quantifier scoping and of anaphora resolution have to be included. In order to filter out unnecessary information as soon as possible it is desirable to merge these three phases into one processing step. We describe how the rules for "extended compositional semantics" as presented in ([Pereira, 1990]) can be integrated into a parser for categorial grammar. The inspection of the data flow shows where concurrency can come into play.
