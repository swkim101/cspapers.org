Welcome to the Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Joint International Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp 2016), held in Heidelberg, Germany from Sep. 12-16, co-located with the International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) 2016. This is the forth instance of the conference after the merger of the previous "Pervasive" and "Ubiquitous Computing" conferences, representing the 28th conference to bear either of those names, and 17 years since this community was formalized. As in previous years, UbiComp 2016 is co-located with ISWC 2016---the premier forum to present cutting-edge research results in the fields of wearable computing and on-body mobile technologies. This year, the two conferences feature two independent technical programs, but operate as a single event, i.e., attendees are free to attend events from both conferences interchangeably.
