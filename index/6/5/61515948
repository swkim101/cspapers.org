Data archeology is a theoreticallyinformed approach to make sense of the digital artifacts left behind by a prior learning “civilization.” Critical elements include use of theoretical learning models to construct analytic metrics, attention to temporality as a means to reconstruct individual and collective trajectories, and consideration of the pedagogical and technological structures framing activity. Examples of the approach using discussion forum trace data will be presented.
