The introduction of intelligent networks will cause a dramatic increase in the number of new features demanded by the telecom market. In order to fulfil these demands, the current software design cycle must be shortened. Simultaneously the software engineering community is trying to handle the software crisis by introducing IPSEs (Integrated Project Support Environments) as the glue for the application tools. FINE (Feature INteractive Environment) is a prototype system, to support the design of feature programs, based on the IPSE architecture. A feature program (e.g. some subscriber service) is implemented as an addition to POTS. The architecture is composed of three main subsystems-UIMS (User Interface Management System), a set of tools and a database. >
