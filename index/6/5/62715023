Digital Rights Management (DRM) is an interdisciplinary area that includes diverse fields. Among these fields are: Mathematics and Cryptography, Legal and Social Aaspects, Signal Processing and Watermarking, Game Theory, Information Theory, Software and Systems Design, Multimedia Architectures and Business Analysis. The ACM Workshop on Digital Rights Management is an international forum that serves as an interdisciplinary bridge across these areas. Its purpose is to bring together researchers from the above fields for a full day of formal talks and informal discussions, covering new results that will spur new investigations regarding the foundations and practices of DRM.This year's workshop, the sixth in the series, continued this tradition. The workshop was sponsored by ACM SIGSAC and was held in conjunction with the 13th ACM Conference in Computer and Communications Security (CCS). This volume contains the proceedings of the workshop and is a good representation of the diversity of disciplines that contribute to the complexity of DRM. The workshop received 33 submissions, out of which 11 were accepted for presentation after a rigorous refereeing process.The invited talk at the workshop entitled "On Interoperability of DRM" was given by Ton Kalker from HP.
