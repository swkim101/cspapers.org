One of the ways of achieving precision control at high speeds for mechanical manipulators is the identification of the parameters of the system and the use of these parameters in a controller such as model based. Viscous friction is one of the parameters whose relatively accurate estimation will lead to significant improvements in a control system. Many authors are currently researching control systems for robots. These control systems are examples of real time software systems. The work reported in the paper concerns the estimation of Coulomb and viscous friction in data from a simulation and from experiments. The requirement for low-pass digital filtering of experimental data is discussed.
