The combined interference matrix and the combined contact matrix of product components with connection matrices, special connection relations, the disassembly sequence matrix, instability of sub-assemblies, changes of sub-assembly disassembly direction or tools, platform and the effect of gravity are investigated to obtain the optimum disassembly process. This methodology improves Huang and Huang’s method. Software is generated and two products were used as examples. Results of optimum disassembly processes were same as those obtained from other researchers. Therefore, the methodology is feasible for study of disassembly processes of products, and software can reduce the computer memory and time.Copyright © 2004 by ASME
