A stereo vision system that is required to support high-level object based tasks in a tele-operated environment is described. Stereo vision is computationally expensive, due to having to find corresponding pixels. Correlation is a fast, standard way to solve the correspondence problem. This paper analyses the behaviour of correlation based stereo to find ways to improve its quality while maintaining its realtime suitability. Three methods are suggested. Two of them aim to improve the disparity image especially at depth discontinuities, while one targets the identification of possible errors in general. Results are given on real stereo images with ground truth. A comparison with five standard correlation methods shows that improvements of simple stereo correlation are possible in real-time on current computer hardware.
