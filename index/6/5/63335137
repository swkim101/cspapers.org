The first photograph below shows such an activity from Computer Science Unplugged (csunplugged.org), where students follow a parallel sorting network marked on the pavement with chalk, so sort 6 numbers into order. The sorting network activity involves comparing numbers with people who are encountered in the process of moving through the network marked on the ground. The students choose their path based on a simple rule, and come out the other end with their numbers sorted into order. In the process they have encountered concepts like comparison, ordering, and especially parallel processing. This activity has been used in many contexts, and in invariably engaging for students.
