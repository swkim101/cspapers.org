Due to the increasing complexity of the modern industrial context in an evolutionary environment, several changes (e.g. new technology, new system, human errors, etc.) may affect road safety. Analyzing the change impact on design requirements is a complex task especially when it deals with complex systems such as Vehicle Safety Systems (VSS). To handle a change impact analysis in road safety field, VSS designers require a specific knowledge stemmed from accidentology. In this paper, we develop a multi-view model of the road accident, which is crucial to extract the required knowledge. Indeed, this multi-view model allows the analysis of the impact of a given change on the Driver-Vehicle-Environment system from different viewpoints and on different grain of size. This allows an efficient approach to detect exhaustively the perturbations due to the change and thereby to anticipate and handle their effects. We use a Knowledge Engineering approach to implement the multi-view model in a Knowledge-Based System providing accidentologists and VSS designers with an efficient tool to carry out an analysis of change impact on analysis design requirements.Copyright Â© 2004 by ASME
