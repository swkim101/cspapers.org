A wireless ad hoc network represents a system of wireless mobile nodes, which can freely and dynamically self-organize into arbitrary and temporary network topologies allowing people and devices to connect in the area without any pre-existing communication infrastructure. Devices in wireless ad hoc network should be able to detect the presence of other devices and perform necessary setup to facilitate communication and sharing of data and service. This paper presents consistency of routing protocols AODV and DSR by incorporating changes in performance parameters of the network design. The performance has been validated using QualNet 5.2 simulation software and results are analysed according to the performance requirements of the network.
