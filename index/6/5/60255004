The field of Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) focuses on simulating social issue to shed some significant light on one specific problem. The model has been built on the assumption that low marriage rate is a shadow behind the falling number of children. In this model, KEKKON (marriage) model, ABM is used to simulate the way how Japanese people get married via bottom-up approach. By changing policies, the flow of population can be observed.
