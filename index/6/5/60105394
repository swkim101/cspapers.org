Imagery Systems are intended to enhance crew performance and productivity and improve habitability on the International Space Station (ISS). The success of the mission will be dependent on crew performance and maintenance of productivity, against a background of confinement in a largely unchangeable environment. Psychological well being on long duration missions has been identified as an issue that has implications for crew performance, productivity, and ultimately mission success. A potential solution to the concern of the psychological well-being of the crew is the implementation of an Imagery System. This Imagery System could display desired information or images (work or entertainment) such as pictures, movies, assembly procedures like a “Magic Window”. A magic window for exercise such as a VR display could show a moving scene that changes as you advance on a treadmill. Because this kind of integrated Imagery System is a relatively new concept for use in human space flight, functional and technical requirements needed to be defined before implementation. Over a three-year period, the goal of this project is to report on the functional and technical requirements of imagery display systems, to perform usability testing of the systems identified that meet the requirements, and to develop a training manual for use.
