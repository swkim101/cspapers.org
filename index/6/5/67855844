We study the problem of fair allocation of m indivisible items among n agents with additive valuations using the popular notion of maximin share (MMS) as our measure of fairness. An MMS allocation provides each agent a bundle worth at least her maximin share. While it is known that such an allocation need not exist [5, 7], a series of remarkable work [1-3, 6, 7] provided 2/3 approximation algorithms in which each agent receives a bundle worth at least 2/3 times her maximin share. More recently, [4] showed the existence of 3/4 MMS allocations and a PTAS to find a 3/4 - Îµ MMS allocation. Most of the previous works utilize intricate algorithms and require agents' approximate MMS values, which are computationally expensive to obtain.
