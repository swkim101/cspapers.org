In this paper, we proposed to build a temporary testing system with virtual machine (VM) technology for studying the performance issues (e.g., number of sessions, load-sharing mechanism) and the availability of a newly built hybrid SSL-VPN system before rolling out the service. Moreover, we had designed testing cases to help locate the configuration bugs and/or improper settings, and use them as guidelines for re-adjusting the system configuration to meet the design considerations. As shown in the paper, using the VM technology helps make both the deployment and the test of the SSL-VPN service to become more effective (e.g., easier to reconfigure the system, more scalable).
