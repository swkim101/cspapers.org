In multi-scale materials modeling, it is desirable that different levels of details can be specified in different regions of interest without the separation of scales so that the geometric and physical properties of materials can be designed and characterized. Existing materials modeling approaches focus on the representation of the distributions of material compositions captured from images. In this paper, a multi-scale materials modeling method is proposed to support interactive specification and visualization of material microstructures at multiple levels of details, where designer’s intent at multiple scales is captured. This method provides a feature-based modeling approach based on a recently developed surfacelet basis. It has the capability to support seamless zoom-in and zoom-out. The modeling, operation, and elucidation of materials are realized in both the surfacelet space and the image space.Copyright © 2014 by ASME
