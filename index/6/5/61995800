It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Second ACM Computer Security Architecture Workshop (CSAW'08). We continue our exploration of how to achieve security goals through the design of flexible and expressive security architectures. 
 
This year's program includes papers on a variety of key issues in defining large-scale security. We begin with papers that examine how trust and personal access control requirements are managed in large systems. We have a panel discussion regarding an emerging challenge, the security issues created by cellular phone systems and how such systems will be integrated into distributed systems securely. The afternoon sessions focus on security archiectures for host and network policies, respectively, addressing issues ranging from side channel attacks to managing administration to distributed denial of service and more.
