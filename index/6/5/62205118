With the experimental data of positioning precision of high-speed precision NC machine tool, a linear mathematical model of positioning error is established. Based on gray model and Cauchy problem formula, a nonlinear mathematical model is also established. The two models are evaluated by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to find the optimal prediction model. Compensated with a selection of positioning error compensation model, the confidence interval of 0.95 of positioning error is less than 3Î¼m, meets the design requirements of the machine tool.
