Wireless Sensor Networks, emerged as a promising technology, offering unique benefits and supporting diverse applications, in terms of sensing. The challenging issue in these networks is optimal utilization of energy of its node, which maximizes its lifetime. In this proposed algorithm, energy efficient strategies are focused to optimize the energy consumption of the node. The cross layer approach provides a generic solution to increase the performance and energy efficiency of the wireless sensor networks. The different techniques in energy efficient strategies are energy efficient routing, scheduling the node's sleeping state and reducing the volume of information transferred. Special protocols are proposed for each technique. Multi path routes with multiHop of the data transmission to the destination node with less node failures. We show that extensive simulation is done by shortest path flat routing technique using Network simulator2 and Java. The best energy efficiency will be obtained by combining and following all these techniques. Using an active node set the node participating in several sets may improve network lifetime. (5 pages)
