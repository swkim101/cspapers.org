Recently we have entered an era of intense government and industrial interest in AI systems. In the development of robust AI systems, the role of the knowledge base Is extremely important. A significant investment in knowledge base development will be made over the next few years. Consequently the adequacy of current techniques for the development and maintenance of large knowledge bases must be given critical review. Like database development in the early sixties, knowledge base development issues are likely to dominate AI system development. These issues are likely to drive the development of practical techniques as well as the refinement theoretical approaches.
