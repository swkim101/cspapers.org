Deep Taylor Decomposition is a method used to explain neural network decisions. When applying this method to non-dominant classifications, the resulting explanation does not reflect important features for the chosen classification. We propose that this is caused by the dense layers and propose a method to alleviate the effect by applying regularization. We assess the result by measuring the quality of the resulting explanations objectively and subjectively.
