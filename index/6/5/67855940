World-class human players have been outperformed in a number of complex two person games such as Go by Deep Reinforcement Learning systems GO. However, several drawbacks can be identified for these systems: 1) The data efficiency is unclear given they appear to require far more training games to achieve such performance than any human player might experience in a lifetime. 2) These systems are not easily interpretable as they provide limited explanation about how decisions are made. 3) These systems do not provide transferability of the learned strategies to other games. We study in this work how an explicit logical representation can overcome these limitations and introduce a new logical system called MIGO designed for learning two player game optimal strategies. It benefits from a strong inductive bias which provides the capability to learn efficiently from a few examples of games played. Additionally, MIGO's learned rules are relatively easy to comprehend, and are demonstrated to achieve significant transfer learning.
