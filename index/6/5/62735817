Radio frequency identification (RFID) as a new automatic identification technology has relatively obvious technical advantage. In recent years, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology development in the domestic and foreign is very soon. RFID products are many types, such as TI, Motorola, Philips, Microchip and the other world famous manufacturer production RFID products have different features and become the series. RFID has been widely used in industrial automation, commercial automation, transportation control management and many other fields such as car or train traffic monitoring system, the highway to be automatic charge system, item management, production line automation, entrance guard system, financial transactions, storage management, livestock management, vehicle anti-theft, etc. As the costs decrease and standardization using in the truth, RFID technology popularization and the universal application will be irreversible certain tendency.This article, firstly, introduces the background and principle of RFID technology, second, study the RFID reader circuit, then, design the ISO14443A 13.56 MHz passive RFID reader antenna matching circuit based on the MFRC500 by software, finally, attend the validation with the simulation.
