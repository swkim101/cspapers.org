On behalf of the Program Committee, it is our great pleasure to welcome you to the First ACM Workshop on Text Mining in Bioinformatics. This workshop is held in conjunction with the ACM Fifteenth Conference on Information and Knowledge Management in Arlington, VA, USA. The co-location of this workshop will provide an excellent opportunity for the workshop participants to exchange ideas with experts in Text Mining and Bioinformatics.The call for papers attracted 21 submissions from all over the world. The selection process was highly competitive. Each paper went through a rigorous peer review by at least 2 members of the Program Committee. Based on the referee reports, the papers have been ranked according to their original contribution, and the program committee accepted 8 papers that cover a variety of topics, including novel information extraction techniques, ontologies, and application to large biomedical data. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech by Doheon Lee on Information Fusion Platform for Bio-Network Inference and Analysis. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers who are interested in applying Text Mining to Bioinformatic.
