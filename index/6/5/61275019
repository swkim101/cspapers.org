It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 9th annual ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society -- WPES 2010. The purpose of this workshop is to discuss problems of privacy in the global interconnected societies and to propose solutions to these problems. This year WPES continues to be a workshop at the ACM CCS conference. 
 
The call for papers attracted 48 submissions from Asia, Europe, and North America. The program committee accepted 10 full papers and 5 short papers that cover a variety of topics, including social network privacy, cloud privacy, privacy policies, anonymity systems, privacy preferences, privacy in voting, and location privacy. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for privacy researchers and developers.
