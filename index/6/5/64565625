The broad goal of a conference is to move the field forward. I was fortunate that recent PC chairs of ASPLOS led very successful conferences, and I mostly followed in their footsteps. Nevertheless I identified two narrower goals for additional efforts: (1) to continue to enhance the image of ASPLOS as a broad, multidisciplinary conference, and (2) to continue to raise the bar for quality and fairness in our review process. This document describes the processes I used, summarizes the program, and acknowledges those who made this program possible.
