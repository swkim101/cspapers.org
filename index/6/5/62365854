This paper introduces the concept of a novel architecture, SMTVLIW: Simultaneous Multithreading VLIW Machine, which incorporates real-time task scheduling at the microarchitecture level of VLIW-like processors. This architecture permits to simultaneously run an arbitrary number of threads, building very long instruction words on-the-fly, orchestrated by an RTOS for dynamic load balancing and fine-grain power control of the system. The SSMTVLIW (Static SMTVLIW) and DSMTVLIW (Dynamic SMTVLIW) machines are also introduced.
