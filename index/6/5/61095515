November 2004. In today's Internet core, routers store forwarding state proportional to the number of edge networks. As the Internet grows and core line rates increase, routers require memories that are increasingly fast and large--and are correspondingly increasingly expensive and difficult to engineer. In this paper, we present Reduced-State Routing (RSR), in which core routers require state only concerning the network topology within a two-hop radius, and thus of a size independent of the total number of Internet edge networks. RSR achieves this feat by routing geographically using two sets of node addresses: virtual coordinates, that are assigned to reflect the link costs within an autonomous system; and geographic coordinates, that correspond to nodes' physical locations. RSR routes greedily on virtual coordinates, and falls back to face routing on geographic coordinates when greedy progress is impossible on virtual coordinates. Unlike previous geographic routing schemes, RSR works on Internet-like graphs (rather than only on wireless-like graphs), and supports policy routing. By simulating RSR on real tier-1 ISP topologies, we demonstrate that RSR achieves low path stretch, comparable to that caused by policy routing in today's Internet.
