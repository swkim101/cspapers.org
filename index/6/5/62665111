Should a BB or net access provider be liable for copyright infringement when a user posts infringing material on user newsgroup or forum? Several recent court decisions have addressed the liability of bulletin board operators and related organizations for copyright infringement as a result of user postings of copyrighted material. The most recent decision (Nov. 1995) is the first to address the copyright liability of on-line service providers, at all. It is also the first to address in depth the liability of bulletin board operators who gain Internet access via such online service providers.
