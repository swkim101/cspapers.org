The models used in traditional model-theoretic semantics provide a complete and static representation of knowledge about the world, llowever, this is not the environment in which language is used. Language is used in a dynamic environment the participants have incomplete knowledge of the world and the understanding of a sentence can add to the knowledge of the listener. A formalism which allows models to contain incomplete knowledge and to which knowledge can be added has been developed [2, 3, 12].
