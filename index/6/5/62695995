Conceptual design is important but complex. Its success heavily depends on a designer’s individual experience and intuition. Design support tools are in need to assist designers to improve design quality and efficiency. However, to date there are few computational tools that are mature enough to provide effective assistance for design concept generation. One of the major reasons is that design information is inherently incomplete and subjective at the early stage of design. No effective evaluation methods have been devised to assess the connectivity between means (i.e., sub-solutions or function carriers) although it has an impact effect on system performance. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy reference model for conceptual design evaluation as part of our hierarchical co-evolutionary design concept generation based on function-means connectivity. An example of designing a simple mechanical transporter is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach.Copyright © 2006 by ASME
