We introduce a procedure for recognizing and locating planar landmarks for mobile robot navigation, based in the detection and recognition of a set of interest points. We use RANSAC for fitting a homography and locating the land mark. Our main contribution is the introduction of a geometrical constraint that reduces the number of RANSAC iterations by discarding minimal subsets. In the experiments conducted we conclude that this constraint increases RANSAC performance by reducing in about 35% and 75%the number of iterations for affine and projective cameras, respectively.
