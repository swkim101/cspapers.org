The fragmentation reactions of relativistic-energy nucleus-nucleus and proton-nucleus collisions were simulated using the Statistical Multi-fragmentation Model (SMM) incorporated with the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS). The comparisons of calculated cross-sections with literature data showed that PHITS-SMM predicts the fragmentation cross-sections of heavy nuclei up to two orders of magnitude more accurately than PHITS for heavy-ion-induced reactions. For proton-induced reactions, noticeable improvements are observed for interactions of the heavy target with protons at an energy greater than 1 GeV. Therefore, consideration for multi-fragmentation reactions is necessary for the accurate simulation of energetic fragmentation reactions of heavy nuclei.
