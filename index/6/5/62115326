In this article, we present worldsens, a fast and accurate development framework for sensor network applications. In order to deploy such applications, we design and implement worldsens, an integrated platform for the design, development, performance evaluation and profiling of embedded sensor network applications. It relies on two softwares: WSNet and WSim, which are used throughout the application design and implementation, from the high level design choices to the implementation validation. WSNet is a modular event-driven wireless network simulator that can be used for high-level or low-level design while WSim is a full platform hardware simulator which takes the target binary code as input and uses instruction cycles as time reference. WSNet and WSim can be used in conjunction to offer a sensor network distributed simulation with instruction and radio byte accuracy.
