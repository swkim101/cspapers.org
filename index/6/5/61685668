In the Close-Enough Traveling Salesman Problem (CETSP), if a salesman is within a specified distance of a node, then the node has been visited. This paper presents a method for solving the CETSP that is based on Steiner zones. We generate test problems and conduct extensive computational experiments comparing our method to other heuristics. Overall, our method is very fast and improves upon heuristics from the literature.
