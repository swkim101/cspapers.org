The problem of program specification, design and verification is the problem of complexity: too many states are involved and too complicated are the transitions induced by statements execution. A deliberately chosen simplification of the set of states and transitions which still retains some characteristic properties of the computation, can help. It is proposed to develop general means for implementation of such additional semantics. While finite automata are the most important tools for definition of such semantics, the suggested approach seems to be considerably more general.
