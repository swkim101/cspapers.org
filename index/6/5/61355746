The complexity of chemical instrumentation is such that automation of certain instrument functions by conventional algorithmic means is either very difficult or completely unsuitable. This paper details work in progress on the application of knowledge based systems technology to the tuning of a complex analytical instrument, a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TQMS). The knowledge representation schemes and interface design between the expert system and the TQMS instrument are discussed. Preliminary results of optimizing the TQMS on chemical standards are presented.
