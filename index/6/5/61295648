Welcome to CMSBSE 2013, the First International Workshop on Combining Modelling and Search-Based Software Engineering, held 20 May 2013 in San Francisco, USA, and co-located with the 2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2013). 
 
CMSBSE was founded by active researchers in the modeling and search-based software engineering (SBSE) communities, after observing at a number of recent events the growing interest in combining research ideas from these two fields. We decided to organize the workshop as a community-building event, and actively solicited different kinds of contributions from researchers in both the SBSE and Modeling communities. We are pleased to report that we had a significant response to our calls for submissions, from across the Software Engineering research community. We ended up receiving 17 submissions (plus two invited papers) of different types: full research papers (6 pages), work-in-progress papers (4 pages) and challenge statements or position papers (2 pages). We think this is a great result for a first-time workshop, and the fact that the submissions were from researchers across software engineering is particularly heartening.
