In nuclear engineering studies, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of simulation computer codes can be faced to the complexity of the input and/or the output variables. If these variables represent a transient or a spatial phenomenon, the difficulty is to provide tool adapted to their functional nature. In this paper, we describe useful visualization tools in the context of uncertainty analysis of model transient outputs. Our application involves thermal-hydraulic computations for safety studies of nuclear pressurized water reactors.
