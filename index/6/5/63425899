In LPG accidents, human is damages directly because most cause is careless handling and inadequate safety equipment. So, safety management should be considered more carefully because those facilities have been operated by various kinds of materials. This paper aims to perform the conformance test for gas domain with intelligent analysis method and improve intelligent algorithm that can find abnormal status and risk status in order to analyze simultaneously many different data. As a result, these methods are able to use in gas domain for enhancing safety of facilities.
