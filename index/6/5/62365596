Welcome to San Jose, California for the 33rd ICCAD, held from November 2nd to 6th, 2014. Like its 32 predecessors, ICCAD 2014 provides a premier forum to explore emerging challenges, present cutting-edge R&D solutions, record theoretical and empirical advances, and identify future roadmaps for design automation. Furthermore, ICCAD 2014 is colocated with the Phil Kaufman Award ceremony, IEEE CEDA CAD Contests, ACM CADathlon Contest and Student Research Competition, the Sunday full-day workshop on TCAD simulation, and five Thursday full-day workshops on design automation for analog and mixed-signal circuits, EDA research in the dark silicon era, variability modeling and characterization, process design kit automation, and heterogeneous computing, an attempt to collaborate with related organizations for higher impact on our community.
