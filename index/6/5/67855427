Classic supervised learning makes the closed-world assumption that the classes seen in testing must have appeared in training. However, this assumption is often violated in real-world applications. For example, in a social media site, new topics emerge constantly and in e-commerce, new categories of products appear daily. A model that cannot detect new/unseen topics or products is hard to function well in such open environments. A desirable model working in such environments must be able to (1) reject examples from unseen classes (not appeared in training) and (2) incrementally learn the new/unseen classes to expand the existing model. This is called open-world learning (OWL). This paper proposes a new OWL method based on meta-learning. The key novelty is that the model maintains only a dynamic set of seen classes that allows new classes to be added or deleted with no need for model re-training. Each class is represented by a small set of training examples. In testing, the meta-classifier only uses the examples of the maintained seen classes (including the newly added classes) on-the-fly for classification and rejection. Experimental results with e-commerce product classification show that the proposed method is highly effective1.
