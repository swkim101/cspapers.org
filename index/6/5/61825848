A switching system program is a large, real-time, long-lived and frequently modified system. The following features are required: good maintainability; rapid introduction of new services; adaptability to enhanced services; and flexibility to increase capacity. A well-structured program is a key factor in meeting these requirements. A new program structure based on the concurrent object oriented model where objects run concurrently, which produces well-structured switching programs is proposed.
