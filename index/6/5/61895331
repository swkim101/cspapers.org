We describe three experiments using meta-language and meta-reasoning to solve problems involving belief, heuristics, and points of view. These experiments use the knowledge representation system SPHERE, built at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories and based on the ideas of FOL [20]. A key idea underlying our research is the segmentation of knowledge into contexts and the meta-linguistic treatment of these contexts as objects.
