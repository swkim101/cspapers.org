The cognitive radio technology will allow a group of potential users to identify and access available spectrum resources provided that the interference to users for whom the band has been licensed is kept below a prescribed level. This research area is at an early stage because various research challenges have to be addressed and solved. In this talk we present an overview of some research issues for cognitive radio networks. Specifically, we present research and developments in cognitive radio networks with focus on: (i) spectrum sensing, (ii) link adaptation, (iii) advanced transceiver design, and (iv) admission control. We discuss research problems related to these specific topics that need to be addressed before deployment of cognitive radio systems.
