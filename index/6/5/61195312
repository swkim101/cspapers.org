The aim of the study is to investigate whether individuals report the places they are attached to in location-based services, and whether there is a relationship between the attachment scores of these places and their corresponding check-in frequency information. A survey is conducted to measure the degree of place attachment of individuals based on self-reported locations. Then their Foursquare log data is collected which includes their check-in and venue information. Our results show that the majority of the participants check in to locations that they are attached to. Attachment score is shown to be related to the check-in frequency. The tips left for venues include terms and phrases, suggesting place attachment.
