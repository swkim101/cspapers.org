It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the second Workshop on Optimizing Stencil Computations (WOSC). We are happy to report that the overall quality of this year's submissions was high, and that the resulting papers span a spectrum of issues and ideas for stencil optimization. 
 
In addition to the paper submissions, this year we have four invited talks from the perspective of applications that use stencil computations, spanning image processing, scientific computing, and physical simulation. These talks, along with the panel discussion, help bridge the gap between those optimizing stencils and those using them. 
 
Above and beyond the formal program, we hope that this year's workshop will further serve as a venue to exchange ideas, to start collaborations, and to bring the various communities working to optimize stencil computations together for interesting discussions and new ideas.
