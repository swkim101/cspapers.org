Deep neural networks (DNNs) and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are the two main tools for statistical modeling. While DNNs provide the ability to model rich and complex relationships between input and independent output variables, PGMs provide the ability to encode dependencies among the output variables themselves. End-to-end training of models with structured graphical dependencies on top of independent neural predictions have recently emerged as principled ways of combining these two paradigms. While these types of models have proven to be powerful in discriminative settings with discrete outputs, extensions to structured and continuous spaces, as well as performing efficient inference in these spaces, are lacking. We propose non-parametric neural networks (N3s), a modular approach that cleanly separates a non-parametric, structured posterior representation from a discriminative inference scheme but allows end-to-end training of both these components. Our experiments evaluate the ability of N3s to capture structured posterior densities (modeling) and compute complex statistics of those densities (inference). We compare our model to a number of baselines, including popular variational and sampling-based inference schemes, in terms of accuracy and speed.
