The paper introduced part of an investigation which attempts to assess the link between applied technical knowledge and non-cognitive traits. The link between non-cognitive variables and applied technical knowledge was assessed by applying correlation, factor and regression analyses. Tests of applied technical knowledge, and questionnaires on behavior in engineering and interest in natural science were adopted for the investigation. Pupils from comprehensive, vocational schools, as well as students from universities and colleges, participated in the research conducted. The levels of the boys' results for applied technical knowledge correspond with the results of the factors: "Ability, skills, know-how in private life", "Interest in biology" and "Evolution of one's own desires and perceptions, admiring people working with appliances and equipment". It was found that the factor "Behavior with toys" is significant for girls. The influence of noncognitive characteristics is different in respect of gender.
