In attempting to build a COTS integrated system, we can use several methods that typically pay attention to specify search criteria and goals to be met. Yet these methods often overlook some elements in the process such as fact-based decisions and teamwork, which might drive the process helping to increase the probability of success. In this position paper, we identify some features that we have found useful in our research, and which we believe need further discussion before setting a process for COTS component measurement and selection.
