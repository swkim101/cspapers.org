An increasing number of applications are now being developed in a distributed setting. The main focus of this half-day tutorial is on OMG/CORBA, a widely recognised middleware standard for heterogeneous and distributed application integration. The tutorial discusses CORBA's object model and its representation in the OMG interface definition language (IDL). Programming language bindings to IDL are discussed; static and dynamic invocations are distinguished and CORBA services and facilities are sketched. The tutorial closes with an indication of recent standardisation efforts undertaken by the OMG.
