The area of Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a unique blend of many diverse subareas. These subareas include Mathematics and Cryptography, Legal and Social aspects, Signal Processing, Game Theory, Information Theory, Software and Systems Design and Business Analysis. The ACM Workshop on Digital Rights Management is an international forum that serves as an interdisciplinary bridge across these areas. Its purpose is to bring together researchers from the above fields for a full day of formal talks and informal discussions, covering new results that will spur new investigations regarding the foundations and practices of DRM. 
 
This year's workshop, the fourth in the series, continued this tradition. As in the previous years it was sponsored by ACM SIGSAC and was held in conjunction with the 11th ACM Conference in Computer and Communications Security (CCS). This volume contains the proceedings of the workshop and is a good representation of the diversity of disciplines that contribute to the complexity of DRM. The workshop received 27 submissions (from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North America) out of which 10 were accepted for presentation after a rigorous refereeing process. 
 
There were two invited talks at the workshop that covered different ends of the spectrum of Digital Rights Management. The first talk, given by Jean-Jacques Quisquater and Francois-Xavier Standaert, presented a new system for digital cinema applications that was developed by a team of researchers from Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. The second invited talk, delivered by Reinaneh Safavi-Naini of the University of Wollongong, Australia, surveyed the cryptographic area of Traitor Tracing --- a basic primitive for DRM technology.
