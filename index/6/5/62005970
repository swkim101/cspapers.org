It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2013 ACM International Workshop on Energy Efficient High Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing - EEHPDC'1). This workshop aims to provide a timely forum for presenting novel ideas and latest findings as well as to discuss research directions and challenges related to Energy Efficient for High Performance Computing Parallel and Distributed Computing. EEHPDC'13 gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of the design, implementation, evaluation, and the use of parallel and distributed systems for high-end computing with the focus on energy efficiency. 
 
The program comprises a keynote speech by Laurent Lefevre on the impact of application and service knowledge for energy efficiency in HPC, a technical session with technical papers on energy efficient communications, cloud computing systems, task scheduling, and multi-core and heterogeneous architectures, and an industry session. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for energy efficiency researchers and developers.
