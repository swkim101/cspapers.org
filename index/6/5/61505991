Welcome to San Jose, to ACM's Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC), and to SIGMETRICS 2011! We are proud to carry on the SIGMETRICS tradition of presenting highquality, innovative research on the measurement and modeling of computer systems. The program includes papers on a wide variety of topics, including resource allocation, multicore processing, network protocols, failure analysis, power management and network characterization, using a wide variety of techniques, including mathematical analysis, simulation, emulation, prototype experimentation, observation of real systems, and combinations thereof. 
 
SIGMETRICS 2011 received 177 submissions, from which 26 papers were accepted, for an acceptance rate of 15%. Additionally, 20 submissions were selected to appear as posters, leading to a combined paper and poster acceptance rate of 26%. Each paper received at least three reviews from PC members. Over 90% of papers received four or more reviews. Overall, program committee and external reviewers provided a total of 756 reviews. 
 
The review process was conducted online using the HotCRP conference management software over a period of two months. The program committee meeting, held at Columbia University in New York, NY, in January 2011, was attended in person by 36 of the 57 PC members, and "virtually" by another four members. During the review, deliberation, and decision process, we emphasized novelty and excitement: papers that took risks and were controversial were viewed more favorably than solid papers that provided limited new insights and took limited risks. As a result, we expect the program to generate active discussion.
