Regardless of its fundamental role, value cultivation or development has been neglected in the education system. This phenomenon is even more profound in inclusive schools, where it is actually much more needed. The research ultimately attempts to seek answers to the question of how core values are implemented in inclusive school development program at SDN Purtaco Indah, Bandung City. It adopted qualitative approach employing the methods of descriptive analysis, case study, grounded theory, social hermeneutics, and thematic study of Al-Quran Al-Qarafi. Data were obtained through observation, interview, questionnaire, and documentary analysis. The results show that: 1) The implementation of inclusive education is based on the religious, psychological, and pedagogic foundations of ta`āwun value development as the core value in inclusive education; 2) Hierarchically, ta`āwun value is elaborated into basic, instrumental, and practical values; 3) Ta`āwun as the core value in inclusive education is implemented in the relationship: among teachers, between teachers and students’ parents, between students and their parents, among students’ parents (those of the regular and special needs students), and among students (regular and special needs); 4) The program of ta`āwun value development has the following advantages: (a) Easier acceptance of special needs children in inclusive schools, (b) evoking the optimism of special needs children’s parents, (c) creating comfort and pleasant feelings among the parents because their children can study inclusively with regular students, (d) giving opportunities for parents of special needs children who are economically disadvantaged to socialize regardless of their status; Meanwhile, the disadvantages of this program are: (a) Regular students are relatively hindered in their learning process, as teachers have to divide their attention to the special needs children with cognitive limitation, and (b) it is really difficult to convince parents of regular students to accept special needs children in the same class as their children.
