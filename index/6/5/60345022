The cost of a selected feature subset Hπ(x) is CHπ(x). The budget-sensitive loss LB presents a hard budget constraint by only accepting answers with CH ≤ B. Additionally, LB can be cost-sensitive: answers given with less cost are more valuable than costlier answers. The motivation for the latter property is Anytime performance; we should be able to stop our algorithm’s execution at any time and have the best possible answer
