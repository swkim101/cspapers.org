A real-time image data acquisition and processing system based on SOPC in intelligent cart with automatic tracking function was designed. In this paper, the basic design theory and the system structure was analyzed. The Quartus II and Nios II software was used to make the system with real-time image acquisition function. And the data in SDRAM of two CMOS cameras based on SOPC was read. The design was tested with the system, and results showed that this module had the characters of design flexibility, fast image processing and expansibility.
