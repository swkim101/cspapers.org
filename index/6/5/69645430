Summary form only given, as follows. Artificial general lighting sources are currently evolving through the traditional fluorescent and incandescent sources to the modern energy saving light bulbs and now white light emitting diodes (LEDs). This trend has been spurred on through global awareness of the necessity for reducing the size of our carbon footprint. The introduction of solid state LED lighting has attracted the attention of communications engineerâ€™s worldwide, enabling the achievement of the dual functionality of room illumination whilst simultaneously transmitting wireless data via visible light communication (VLC), or Light Fidelity (LiFi), in optical spectrum regime. Although the existing wireless networks are primely dominated by radio-based technology, the emerging VLC will play increasingly important role in future wireless telecommunications landscape. It is anticipated that both spectrum regimes, radio and optical, will eventually contribute equally for the next network generation, especially in nanocell and picocell network structures. This talk will outline the growth of optical wireless communications including VLC, and present the challenges and roadmap of the technology for the future generation of wireless networks.
