A collaborative software engineering approach for the life-critical systems is proposed in this paper. Life-critical systems are systems, where any fault can produce a danger for humans or can be extremely expensive. The life-critical systems' development is well known as expensive and slow one. Mostly it is because of its nature--fault-free development. The approach to be proposed includes two main elements: an effective feedback between neighbour steps of the development work cycle and a collaborative work team either global for the entire project or within neighbour steps. In the result, a development team can increase their productivity keeping products on the same quality level by eliminating certain extra-time spent on local verification by using next phases to support such evaluation.
