Computer models have been used for many years in the manufacturing industry for plant design, process improvement, de-bottlenecking, etc. This has inevitably led to the development of computer packages so that the process or production engineer can develop the appropriate models without having to write codes. There are many packages available that tend to be either functionally based or industry based. There exists a need for a new type of package, or software environment, which allows the user to construct production process models which are quick and easy to configure whilst providing the necessary level of detail and accuracy. Such a package should contain a library of process unit models and allow for the addition of user supplied models. The model framework should provide for real-time modelling, what-happens-if studies, and real-time optimisation. It is to fill this need that MOD-EDIT has been developed. The current version works on the DEC VAX series of computers using graphics and non-graphics terminals.
