It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the ACM SIGPLAN Eighth Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security -- PLAS'13. As in previous years, our workshop continues to provide a unique forum for exploring and evaluating ideas on the use of programming language and program analysis techniques to improve the security of software systems. 
 
The call for papers attracted 14 submissions from Asia, Europe, and North America. The program committee accepted 8 papers that cover a variety of topics, including 6 full papers and 2 position papers. We are also very happy to have two invited speakers: Philippa Gardner and David Sands. We hope that these proceedings will make for a vibrant workshop.
