The phase diagram is a integrated graphic which represents the relationship among the state of material phase, temperature and composition. It can help the researchers to get the information about the change of material composition phase species at different temperature, the relative amount of each phase may occur and the changes when the temperature changes. So the phase diagram is known as the material design guide book, map of the metallurgical workers, and the source of thermodynamics data. In this paper, the main work is that the analysis of the characteristic of the graphic and the internal correlation of the data through the investigation and analysis of the existing methods of drawing phase diagram, combined with the phase diagram image and data, and then propose a method to represent the binary phase diagram based on Bezier curve which achieved a simple, efficient and accurate way to represent and store phase diagram.
