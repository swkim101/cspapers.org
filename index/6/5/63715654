Decentralized monitors can have robustness and security risks. Among robustness risks are attacks on the monitor's infrastructure in or- der to disable parts of its functionality. Among security risks are attacks that try to extract information from the monitor, and thereby possibly leak sensitive information. Formal methods to analyze these issues given a monitor design can help to make better designs and/or identify crit- ical parts in a monitor. In this paper we specify a model for analyzing robustness and security risks for monitors where a network of runtime local monitors forms a collaborative monitor.
