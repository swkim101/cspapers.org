In this paper, parts from Ford GT were machined based on tool path created using Curvature Matched Machining and three other popular CAD systems. Five-axis flat end mill methods are used as the baseline of comparison. The performance of these CAD packages was compared using the benchmark of tool path density, surface finish, and post-machining finishing time. Results show that CM2 has advantage over today’s leading CAM capability in terms of both machining efficiency and tool path computation time.Copyright © 2004 by ASME
