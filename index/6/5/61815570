This paper shows how iterative hardware/software partitioning in heterogeneous DSP/FPGA based embedded systems can be utilized to achieve real-time deadlines of modern 3GPP wireless equalization workloads. By utilizing a well defined set of application partitioning criteria in tandem with SOC simulation tools, we are able to show a greater than six fold improvement in application performance and ultimately meet, and even exceed real-time data processing deadlines.
