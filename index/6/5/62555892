It is a big problem how to finish intraoperative functional localization precisely, rapidly and no-invasively during neurosurgery operations. Previous researchs shown that the SCP (slow cortical potential) is a specific ECoG (electrocorticography) rhythm in the cortical motor areas. A real limb movement induced ERP(event-related potential) of SCP in the motor cortex. In this study, based on ERP of SCP phenomenon, wavelet analysis and SVM (support vector machine) were used to extract and classify the ERP of SCP feature, an algorithms for classification of the ERP in the motor regions utilizing experimental data was designed and verified. Then the results of classification were used to mapping the boundary curve of motor cortex functional areas. Results demonstrated that the accuracy of localization detection was 93.75% , the degree of accuracy was less than 5 mm, with an operation time of 2 minutes, avoiding the problems of cerebral cortex injury and epilepsy onset. The cerebral motor cortex functional localization based on SCP in ECoG detecting technique is accurate, safe and rapid.
