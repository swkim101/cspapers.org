The wireless channel model, which was suitable with the complex environment of battlefield, was built by analyzing the digital image of wireless transmission channel, the transmission characteristics and the fading type. The error correction of coding for the compressed code stream of image was carried out specifically with Turbo code, and the Simulink simulation model was designed. The system simulation analysis was carried out for the performance parameters that affect the Turbo code and the BER performance of as-built wireless channel model. The results showed that the Turbo code is a kind of error correction one, which is anti-fading and strong interference among codes. It can not only reach higher peak signal to noise ratio, but also transmit more steadily and more reliably in the changeable channel environment under noise interference. Furthermore, the turbo can be applied for code correction and controlling.
