Designers are continuously challenged to manage complexity in embodiment design processes (EDPs), in the context of integrated product and materials design. In order to manage complexity in design processes, a systematic strategy to embodiment design process generation and selection is presented in this paper. The strategy is based on a value-of-information-based Process Performance Indicator (PPI). The approach is particularly well-suited for integrated product and materials design, and all other scenarios where knowledge of a truthful, i.e., perfect, design process and bounds of error are not available in the entire design space. The proposed strategy is applied to designing embodiment design processes for photonic crystal waveguides in the context of a next-generation optoelectronic communication system. In this paper, it is shown that the proposed strategy based on the Process Performance Indicator is useful for evaluating the performance of embodiment design processes particularly when accuracy of the prediction or the associated error bounds are not known.Copyright Â© 2008 by ASME
