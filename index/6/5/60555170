The sequencing specification defines an interoperable method for representing the intended behavior of an authored learning experience such that any Learning Management System (LMS) will sequence discrete learning activities in a consistent way. At present, in the sequencing specifications, the intended Sequencing Strategies is encoded one by one in the XML file, causing the redundancy of sequence data. This paper presents an innovative function mechanism to design learning sequencing. This mechanism adds two categories, a function element and a function-call element, into the IMS Content Package Information Model. The function element is used to design a reusable sequencing component with an interface of parameters, while the function-call element is used to repeatedly call the function element by transferring various actual parameters. This method improves the design environment of the learning sequencing and effectively reduces the redundancy of the learning sequencing in a content package.
