. Learning from multiple unbounded time-series has received less at-tention despite the key applications (such as video analysis) generating this data. Inspired by never-ending approaches, this paper presents an algorithm to continuously learn from multiple un-regulated time-series, in a framework based on ensembles of GMM-UBM (Universal Background Models). The Minimum Description Length (MDL) method, as a powerful inductive inference, is exploited to predict the quality of current knowledge on arrival observations in an unsupervised manner in order to control the complexity of the framework in such evolving environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework in terms of accuracy and complexity over several baseline approaches on multiple datasets.
