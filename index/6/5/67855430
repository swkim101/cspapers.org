We present WebProtégé, a tool to develop ontologies represented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). WebProtégé is a cloud-based application that allows users to collaboratively edit OWL ontologies, and it is available for use at https://webprotege.stanford.edu. WebProtégé currently hosts more than 68,000 OWL ontology projects and has over 50,000 user accounts. In this paper, we detail the main new features of the latest version of WebProtégé.
