We present a preliminary study of the joint application of network and software metrics to the analysis of subprojects of a large software system. Aim of this paper is to provide new tools for the analysis of software systems subprojects by using very recent results obtained in the new research field of software networks. We present an empirical and exploratory analysis of the evolution of software subprojects in time, as well as a comparison among subprojects with similar or different aims and functionalities. Our preliminary results show how the joint application of traditional and network software metrics may be used to identify subprojects developed with similar functionalities and scopes.
