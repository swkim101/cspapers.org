Research conducted over the past decade has resulted in a suite of methods for robust design which can be applied during different design stages. These methods focus on reducing the sensitivity of the design to variation without removing its causes. In this research we are investigating an additional and very powerful means for achieving robustness that complements the other methods developed to date. We have dubbed this area “smart assemblies.” A smart assembly has features, not otherwise required by the function of the design, which allow the design to absorb or cancel out the effects of variation. In this paper we report our results to date. We discuss the close connection between smart assembly design and exactly constrained design. We present the beginnings of a smart feature classification system, a preliminary methodology for smart assembly design, and a case study.Copyright © 2002 by ASME
