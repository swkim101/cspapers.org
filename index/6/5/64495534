In order to optimize the recognition accuracy of maize kernels breakage detection and improve the detection efficiency of maize kernels breakage, this paper using computer vision technology and detecting of the maize kernels breakage based on K-means clustering algorithm. First, the collected RGB images are converted into Lab images, then the original images clarity evaluation are evaluated by the energy function of Sobel 8 gradient. Finally, the detection of maize kernels breakage using different pixel acquisition equipments and different shooting angles. In this paper, the broken maize kernels are identified by the color difference between integrity kernels and broken kernels. The original images clarity evaluation and different shooting angles are taken to verify that the clarity and shooting angles of the images have a direct influence on the feature extraction. The results show that K-means clustering algorithm can distinguish the broken maize kernels effectively.
