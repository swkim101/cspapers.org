In this paper we would like to describe a methodology of thinking - Architecture. 
 
Today there are several concepts about the perception of the space. All sensorial experiences are, now, present in the way of see and interpreted the space. What we see is something that creates fillings and sensorial values, according an independent way of life; it is like walking with the eyes. 
 
Architecture and Art are in the same line of understanding the meaning, but there are something that it is different; the border between the concept of the pass and the history of the buildings. 
 
Architects are now using a different methodology to conceiving projects. They work between what they have in reality and the final form. Doing something that it is more than only "Architecture". They want to create atmospheres and emotions. 
 
The public make part of the scenario, and some unusual ideas, like the sensation of sublime, cold, hot, water, ice, storms, etc., are now present in the identity of the final project. 
 
The recognition of the space is turned to be spacio-temporal, and movement it is not only an optical phenomenon.
