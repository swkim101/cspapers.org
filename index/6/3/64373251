It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the First International Workshop on Security in Embedded Systems and Smartphones -- SESP'13. This workshop aims to bring together the research efforts from both the academia and industry in all security and privacy aspects related to embedded systems and smart phones. We encourage submissions on all theoretical and practical aspects, as well as experimental studies of deployed systems. 
 
Due to the conflict with the Lunar New Year, the call for papers attracted 6 submissions from Asia, Europe, and the United States. From them, the program committee accepted 3 papers that cover a variety of topics, including risk visualization, detection of permission abuse, and Android apps analysis into the workshop program. The program is also featured by a keynote speech by Dr. Hao Chen from University of California at Davis. We hope that this first step will help bootstrap the research on secure and privacy preserving mobile devices in Asia.
