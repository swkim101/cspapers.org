Planning the evolution of a large telecommunication networks is a difficult task. Using a software tools approach to improve the network and service planning process, the authors have realized the benefits of performance planning through the application of graphics and object-oriented database technology to manipulate network data and facilitate decision making. A software toolkit has been built to allow a user to interact with a comprehensive model of the AT&T telecommunications network to evaluate network performance from an individual service or customer perspective. This toolkit includes powerful and flexible network querying capability to map from physical network components to logical services, customized network graphics, traditional software productivity tools (spreadsheets, SQL queries), and a plug-in interface to numerical analysis modules. Using this toolkit, the network manager can quickly identify potential trouble areas in the network, quantify the impact of network failures in terms of individual service and customer performance, formulate strategies to improve the performance, and evaluate the end results of implementing various plans.
