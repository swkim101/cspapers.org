To take advantage of the computational power of GPUs, algorithms that work well on CPUs must be modified to conform to the GPU execution model. In this study, typical task-parallel Monte Carlo algorithms have been reformulated in a data-parallel way, and the benefits of doing so are examined. In-progress 3D ray tracing work is also touched upon as a milestone in developing a full-featured neutron transport code. Possible solutions to problems are examined.
