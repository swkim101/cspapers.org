The topic of my paper is on the emerging problem of academic scams that prey upon the unsuspecting public. My research grows out of my experience as a tenure track academic librarian at Governors State University where I serve as chair of the Library personnel committee, (thatâ€™s our library faculty tenure review committee), and my service on the University Personnel Committee, where I served as Chair in the 2011-12 academic year. I have also taught workshops on the scholarly publishing process at the university, and assist faculty in locating publishing venues for their manuscripts.
