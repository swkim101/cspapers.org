It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2011 ACM Workshop on Ubiquitous Affective Awareness and Intelligent Interaction -- UAAII'11. This workshop aims to build a forum for researchers from academy and industry to investigate challenging and innovative research issues in the subject, which combines Affective Interaction within ubiquitous environment and to explore creative concepts, theories, innovative technologies and intelligent solutions. Potential participants may come from communities of ubiquitous computing, intelligent computing, brain computer interaction, affective computing, neuroergonomics, cognitive neuroscience etc. 
 
The call for papers attracted 24 submissions from Asia and Europe. The program committee accepted 5 papers that cover three topics, including Recognition & Synthesis of Human Affect in Ubiquitous Environment, Affective & Behavioral Interfaces in Ubiquitous Environment, and Affective and Multimodal Intelligent Systems. In addition, the program includes a discuss panel on a subject related to the Workshop Venue. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for Affective Computing and Intelligence Interaction researchers and developers.
