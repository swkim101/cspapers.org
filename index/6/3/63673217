People's violations on social order regulations are have become a common phenomenon. As illustrations, traffic rules are violated every day, roads and sidewalks are shifted into a street vendor's booth or a parking lot. As can be seen from the foregoing violations of the public order, Indonesian society has a low public awareness. Then, how to increase the public awareness on this matters? The author along with students of the Communications Department have conducted a social experiment. What is meant by social experiment here is not a form of research method but it is a type of learning model. This social experiment was intended to raise public awareness in maintaining social order. There were three social experiments conducted with the following themes: Smoking Kid, Honey Bear, and U Turn. First, Smoking Kid is a social experiment using the help of children actors to give warnings to adults who smoke in public places. Secondly, Honey Bear is a social experiment intended for a zoo visitor who keep feeding animals in spite of the prohibition. The final experiment is U-Turn social experiment. It is conducted in order to raise bikers or driver's awareness on obeying U-turn sign. The results of the social experiments show that: a) peoples were heedless of the distinct prohibitive signs and other visibel regulations. b). The violators are generally aware about the regulations, but they set the law at defiance. c). Time and distance efficiency have become the main motives for the violators. d). The absence of guilt or shame when they made mistakes. e). No social sanctions to cope with the ongoing violations. f). Police enforcements could not make the offenders learn their lesson. The society members tend to abide by the rules only if the authorities were on the spot and keep an eye on them.
