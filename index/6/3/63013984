The Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) pioneered by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University has shown great promise in ensuring that a software system's most important non functional requirements can be realized given the system's architecture. ATAM has been applied in several published case studies to evaluate the architecture of existing software systems and create architectures to meet critical non-functional requirements. This paper presents the ATAM Assistant which semi-automates several tasks involved in this process. ATAM Assistant's goal is to be a single application to manage, visualize, and report on all of the process artifacts generated during this process.
