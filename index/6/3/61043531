This volume contains the papers presented at the CCS Workshop on Visualization and Data Mining for Computer Security. VizSec/DMSec 2004 was held on October 29th, 2004 at George Mason University in conjunction with the Eleventh ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security. 
 
Information about security on large and complex computer networks is high volume, heterogeneous, distributed, and dynamic over time. This workshop brought together researchers from two complementary approaches for processing high-dimensional data into knowledge: visualization and data mining. Visualization represents high-dimension security data in 2D/3D graphics and animations intended to facilitate quick inferences for situational awareness and focusing of attention on potential security events. Data mining focuses on algorithms to accurately detect patterns in high-dimension security data representing unauthorized system access or computer network attacks. The workshop received 36 paper submissions, from which the 13 long and 6 short papers that appear here were selected by the program committee.
