Welcome to Paris and the 14th Annual ACM SIGCSE conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE 2009) at Universite Pierre et Marie Curie -- Paris 6 (UPMC). 
 
We are pleased to present the proceedings of the conference. It includes papers, panels, posters, keynote talks, tips, techniques and courseware that reflect the broad array of interests of computer science educators. We received a record number of 317 academic submissions this year. We accepted 66 of 205 papers, an acceptance rate of 32%. Each paper received at least four reviews, with many receiving five or six reviews. We accepted 14 of 38 tips, techniques, and courseware proposals and three panels; all submissions likewise received at least 4 reviews. The program includes 52 posters. We saw a significant increase in working group submissions and accepted 6 of the 14 submitted. All working group proposals and posters received careful review as well. 
 
The program features three distinguished invited speakers. Dr. Claus Brabrand, of IT University of Copenhagen, speaks on "Analyzing the Competences of (Computer) Science via the SOLO Taxonomy". Ms Sally Fincher, of University of Kent, speaks on Useful Sharing. "The Bologna Process" is title of the talk by Dr. Patrick Porcheron of UPMC. 
 
In addition to the technical sessions, the symposium features several vendors and vendor sessions. We thank our exhibitors and supporters for their generosity. As you enjoy the presentations and discussions, we also hope that you will take advantage of what the area has to offer. The conference venue is in the heart of historic and artistic Paris and is an ideal place to discover Paris. UPMC is located in the Latin Quarter on the left bank of the River Seine and is within walking distance to several attractions including the Notre Dame Cathedral, the Pantheon, and the Louvre.
