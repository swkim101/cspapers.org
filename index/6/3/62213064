E-mail has become one of the most important applications on the Internet. At the same time, computer crimes involving e-mail increases rapidly. To prevent these phenomena from happening, the authorship identification methods for Chinese e-mail documents were described in this paper, which could provide evidence for the purpose of computer forensic. E-mail form features to classify authorship were extracted. To classify the author of Chinese e-mail, the SVM(support vector machine) algorithm was adopted to learn the authors features. Experiments gained satisfactory results on limited dataset. The accuracy of dataset for four authors was 92.56%. The satisfactory results showed that it was feasible to apply to computer forensic.
