This paper describes a solution for the SPLASH 2016 Language Workbench Challenge (LWC) workshop, using the JetBrains Meta Programming System (MPS) language workbench. As the main focus of the LWC is on implementation and not on writing a paper, we used the mbeddr documentation language to describe the solutions to the challenges posed in the LWC. In this way, the showcasing of a solution is co-located with its implementation, making it easier for the reader to try out the solutions and to better understand them. Therefore we would encourage you to actually open the solution implementation (see README.md for setting it up) and try it out. JetBrains MPS has evolved into a powerful and flexible tool that can be used to address most of the language engineering challenges in the LWC. The feature-richness, and the scale of practical applicability of Jetbrains MPS increases even more when using the mbeddr platform extensions and other plugins developed by the MPS community.
