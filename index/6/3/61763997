Stepwise refinement method can be formalised algebraically, using specification morphism. Algebraic schemes also offer a natural way, like that we have adopted, to modularise speci- fications in the shape of distinct sort sets. Our definition of stepwise refinement with modularity is a faithful rendition of system development processes, as is shown by the example of designing an editor. We propose a concrete environment implementing our approach, based on OBJ2.
