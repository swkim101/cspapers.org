Situations let people act accordingly to it. Smartphones and other current devices can detect and react on such contextual data, because they have multiple sensors and enough processing performance to analyse that. Such behavior is called context-aware and a key to make devices faster and more efficient in everyday life. This paper describes what context and context-aware is and how applications can be differentiated by their possibilities. Single roles and steps from provisioning to dissemination are mentioned. The modeling and quality of contextual data and services are displayed and subdivided, due to their importance for context-awareness. Some current researches and services are mentioned to provide an insight into the status quo. Crucial questions about context-sensitive applications and their implementation will be discussed and illustrated.
