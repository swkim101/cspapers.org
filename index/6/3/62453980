It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 1th ACM Workshop on Mobile Internet through Cellular Networks - Operations Challenges and Solutions (MICNET)--MICNET'09. Our workshop brings together the wireless mobility research community as well as the vendor and operator community to share the recent advances in wireless cellular technology and their views on the future mobile Internet. The mission of the workshop is to identify new issues from the operational realities of cellular networks, and to formulate and present new problems to the research community. MICNET offers researchers, vendors, and operators a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of mobile Internet. 
 
The call for papers attracted 15 submissions from Australia, China, Iran, Korea and USA. The program committee accepted 10 papers that cover a variety of topics, including mobility and monitoring, protocol and algorithm, performance-enhancing techniques for mobile Internet. In addition, the program includes two panels and a keynote speech. We hope that this workshop will offer a valuable venue for researchers and developers of mobile Internet.
