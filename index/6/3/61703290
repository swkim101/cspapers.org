Moving object information management, which is based on the model of moving object, is necessary in many applications. Lots of models of moving object are proposed. Each of them works well in certain scenario. In order to fulfill the needs of most application, General Motion Model (GMM) is studied. And based on this model, Extended GMM (EGMM) is proposed to make motion functions be able to be registered in real time so as to not ask the motion functions to be predefined and introduce access control to each motion function. Besides, it also changes the model structure to optimize the performance of GMM.
