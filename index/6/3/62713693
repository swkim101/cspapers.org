We have designed a representation scheme, which is based on the discrete representation of a document ranking function, which is capable of reproducing and enhancing the properties of such popular ranking functions as tf.idf, BM25 or those based on language models. Our tests have demonstrated the capability of our approach to achieve the performance of the best known scoring functions solely through training, without using any known heuristic or analytic formulas.
