V-SSTF is a new algorithm which may be turned to FCFS or SSTF by an adjustable parameter that permits the algorithm to be dynamically adapted to changing system conditions. V-SSTF and common strategies including FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and N-step SCAN are simulated for evaluation purposes. This simulation is programmed using C language and has been implemented on NCR tower machine under Unix. It is used for disk scheduling.
