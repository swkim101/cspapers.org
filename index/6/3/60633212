This article theorizes the development of a hybrid literate identity—one of both reader and writer. That is, prior to the emergence of social and digital media, the act of meaning-making in models of audience and writing developed in or emerging from the social turn in composition were more heavily dependent on the writer. Based on analysis of wiki talk pages, I describe a model of writing that accounts for “readers-as-writers.” Consequently, this article builds upon audience scholarship to develop a “hypersocial-interactive model of writing” to help us to better understand possible reader and writer roles in digital writing environments.
