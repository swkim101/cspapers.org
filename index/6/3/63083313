This article introduces the integration of the Timing Description Language (TDL) and the modeling tool Simulink. The main goal of this integration is to establish a development process, which significantly simplifies the design and implementation of deterministic software on distributed, embedded systems. To accomplish this goal, a visual-interactive representation of TDL's textual syntax is used by the TDL editor suite, a tool, which is integrated into Simulink. Thus, an easier access to TDL applications is provided. A case study illustrates the specific development steps from the programmer's point of view. In addition, generation of Simulink models is supported. These models simulate the timing and the functional behavior of TDL applications defined by the TDL editor suite. The principles of TDL guarantee that timing and communication behavior is identical, no matter, which platform is used.
