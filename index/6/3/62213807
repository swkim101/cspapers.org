Currently, the study of virtual machine migration in cloud computing platform which usually did not consider the trustworthiness of target physical machine. For this, the paper proposes a trusted virtual machine migration with performance constraints algorithm (TVM2PC). The trustworthiness of target physical machine includes direct trustworthiness and indirect trustworthiness. By this method, a virtual machine will be migrated to a trusted physical machine. A large of experiment shows that the proposed method can give a better result than the existing method in load balancing and trustworthiness.
