This paper focuses on software intelligent deployment which can adjust the software deployment process according to a different environment. First, it analyses the existing software deployment tools,proposes the model of software intelligent deployment and the standardized description of software intelligent deployment. Then it introduces and analyses the method of conflict detection and automatic adjustment in software deployment process. On this basis, it proposes the intelligent deployment software algorithm, which can automatically adjust the software process according to different environments. Finally it compares and analyses the actual effect of software intelligent deployment.
