Using a new method published by the author (M.I. Vaughn, 1996) the paper shows how to extract the knowledge base from a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and explain the network outputs on a case by case basis for a network that is trained to classify applicants for whole life assurance into standard and non standard classes. Examples of the data relationships learned by the network are presented and explanations (M.I. Vaughn, 1995) of the output neuron activation levels are given for both a standard case and a nonstandard case. (5 pages)
