As its price per bit drops, SSD is increasingly becoming the default storage medium for hot data in cloud application databases. Even though SSD’s price per bit is more than 10× lower, and it provides sufficient performance (when accessed over a network) compared to DRAM, the durability of flash has limited its adoption in write-heavy use cases, such as key-value caching. This is because key-value caches need to frequently insert, update and evict small objects. This causes excessive writes and erasures on flash storage, which significantly shortens the lifetime of flash. We present Flashield, a hybrid key-value cache that uses DRAM as a “filter” to control and limit writes to SSD. Flashield performs lightweight machine learning admission control to predict which objects are likely to be read frequently without getting updated; these objects, which are prime candidates to be stored on SSD, are written to SSD in large chunks sequentially. In order to efficiently utilize the cache’s available memory, we design a novel in-memory index for the variable-sized objects stored on flash that requires only 4 bytes per object in DRAM. We describe Flashield’s design and implementation, and evaluate it on real-world traces from a widely used caching service, Memcachier. Compared to state-ofthe-art systems that suffer a write amplification of 2.5× or more, Flashield maintains a median write amplification of 0.5× (since many filtered objects are never written to flash at all), without any loss of hit rate or throughput.
