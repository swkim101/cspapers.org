This paper describes a methodology for establishing a clear requirements baseline at the outset of the development lifecycle using the general approach of procedure SQA01. It was originally applied to software development for a military HF communication system, and has since been applied to two further projects in the civil sector concerning private mobile radio and message switching. The methodology provides forward and reverse traceability between this baseline and the design, so giving assurance that the delivered product meets its requirements whilst not being over-engineered. The methodology helps engineers perform formal integration and acceptance testing such as described in procedures SQA08 and SQA09 by documenting tests and providing traceability to the requirements baseline.
