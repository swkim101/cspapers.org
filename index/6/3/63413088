Today's learning is focused on preparing students with characters and skills needed to pursuit their career and to succeed in their future. Beyond those skills, there are various supporting proficiencies that are significant in preparing for the "wild" world out there. Among those new proficiencies is social media literacy, a set of skills that one's should have in order to communicate appropriately, responsibly, and to evaluate conversations critically within the realm of socially- based technologies. Regarding this, the paper described of how media and social media education can be designed as a method to prepare and engage undergraduate students to be agents of social media literacy. This paper focuses on a media literacy course that teaches how media users receive and interact with various types of media. The students of this course learned various topics for the first h alf of the even semester of 2015, then by the second half of the semester the course sent them to conduct a community service learning. The students were placed into teams and sent to share what they have already learned on campus to students in middle and high schools programs in rural areas. A participant action research (PAR) is used to evaluate, upgrade and finally improve the course for future reference.
