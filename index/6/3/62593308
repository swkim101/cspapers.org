In this paper, a new method that is based on the transmission contribution degree is proposed, which can effictively imprve on-line verification of relay protection setting.Actually, all protection devices of a line are treated as a whole in this method. Furthermore, the network maximum flow and complex network theory are both applied in this method, which is on the view of the structural point of the grid. The importance index of protection device in a line is determined by the transmission contribution degree. As a result, on-line verification of relay protection setting is according to the descending order of the indexes. IEEE 39-bus system is used to simulate, on the whole, the simulation and analysis of the calculation results to verify the reasonableness and correctness of the method.
