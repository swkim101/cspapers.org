In this proposal we introduce the Lights Track, a thought experiment on a novel exertion game that requires no screens. Using learn-through-design, we would like to collaborate to build an initial prototype which explores the overlap between "exertion games and sports science" in particular participants agility. We aim to explore and expand on this overlap. The findings will be used to inform other designers of some of the opportunities and challenges to create more meaningful and richer exertion games.
