Software clones are identical or similar pieces of code or design. Clones are known to be closely related to various issues on software engineering, such as software quality, complexity, architecture, refactoring, evolution, licensing, plagiarism, and so on. Various characteristics of software systems can be uncovered through clone analysis, and system restructuring can be performed by merging clones. 
 
Moreover, a clear understanding of real use cases in clone management is a fundamental prerequisite for categorizing, evaluating and directing future research in this area. For this reason, this IWSC will emphasize clone management in practice, that is, use cases and experiences with clones and clone management in the software life-cycle. 
 
The purpose of this workshop is to continue to solidify and give shape to this research/application area and community. More specifically, the goals are to bring together academic and industrial researchers and practitioners from around the world to evaluate the current state of research and applications, discuss common problems, discover new opportunities for collaboration, exchange ideas, and envision new areas of research and applications.We are very pleased that we are succeeding in this attempt. This workshop is the seventh issue, and for the fourth time, we are colocating with ICSE. This co-location helps us to reach new researchers and practitioners in related fields. I am particularly glad that we again managed to attract practitioners, given the special focus theme of this IWSC: clone management in practice, that is, use cases and experiences with clones and clone management in the software lifecycle.
