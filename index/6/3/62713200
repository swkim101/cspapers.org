These proceedings contain the papers selected for presentation at The Second ACM International Workshop on Multimedia Databases (Arlington, VA, USA, November 13, 2004). Its aim is to bring together university researchers, scientists, industry professionals, software engineers and graduate students who need to become acquainted with new theories and technologies in multimedia databases, and to all those who wish to gain a detailed technical understanding of what multimedia databases involve. We hope these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for the multimedia database research community. 
 
We received thirty-one submissions. Each of them was reviewed by at least three referees. The program committee, which was constituted of researchers and practitioners from the multimedia database research areas, selected twelve papers to be presented at the workshop. The authors were asked to address each and every comment made by the referees to improve the quality of the papers. These papers reflect current trends in the multimedia database research areas with topics such as Content-Based Retrieval for Multimedia Databases, Multimedia Database Query Processing and Retrieval, Multimedia Data Indexing, and Multimedia Data Mining.
