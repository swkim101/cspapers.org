This paper presents a test framework which interlaces the test process with the development process in the domain of embedded control systems. The framework shows the following characteristics: • Strong integration of test and development process by solving test management issues inside development tools instead of specialized test management tools • Test in very early development stages by assuming a model-based development process where executable models are available • Reuse of test sequences at different abstraction levels and tool flexibility by tool-coupling The paper demonstrates concept and realisation of the test framework, which offers a manual but comfortable test suite derivation where test cases can be archived in the requirements database and interlinked with the requirement specification modules. Once the test sequences are defined, an automatic test instrumentation, execution and evaluation can be done. The test instrumentation is flexible, such that the system under test can be either a model or the realized hardware/software
