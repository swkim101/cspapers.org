We propose the use of attribute grammars in specifying valid test cases for intra-class testing in object-oriented systems. Attribute grammars, unlike regular expressions, allow us to specify more complex test cases that need to ‘memorize’ previous events and/or involve parameters. The testing process can be semi-automated by generating a parser for the grammar using a parser generator.
