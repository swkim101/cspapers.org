Proposes a new parallel language, ACLAN (Array C LANguage), that allows the programming of any array processor. In particular, ACLAN allows the programming of a hypercube computer as a synchronous system. This language is specially designed for numeric applications where the processing time and/or the occupied memory are critical factors to optimize, because it allows the direct manipulation of the structural elements of the nodes of the system. Applications such as that include pattern recognition, image processing and matrix algebra. The authors describe the basic ACLAN features and present, as an example of programming of a particular hypercube computer, the implementation of ACLAN on the NCube/10 system. Finally, they include an example of an ACLAN program for this computer. >
