Automation or control systems, such as Distributed Control Systems (DCSs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are commonly used in industries to help operators monitor and control the situation of the process. In order to detect abnormal situations and notify operators promptly, alarms are configured in the system to reflect faulty states of specific variables. Alarm management has attracted a lot of attention in industries because there are often too many poorly configured alarms that distract operators, leading to low efficiency of alarm systems. Special techniques are needed to optimize the alarm settings, namely, smart alarm management.
