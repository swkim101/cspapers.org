This chapter describes two major themes: partial values and database background knowledge. First, we show that the partial-value data model is a useful extension to the relational-database model. As well as increasing the expressivity of the data model, partial values allow the data miner to deal with concept hierarchies rigorously. We show how an iterative procedure allows us to calculate aggregate proportions for a database table. The use of this iterative procedure is well founded in statistical theory, being a maximum-likelihood estimator. It is possible that the Newton-Raphson procedure described by J.M. Jamshidian and R.I. Jennrich (1997) will provide a means of speeding up the solution of the maximum-likelihood equations. Secondly, we demonstrate how it is possible to use background knowledge about the database. We have indicated how to reengineer the database using logic programming and integrity constraints. The aggregation algorithms were extended to the multiattribute case and we have shown how they are computed in the case where integrity constraints limit the allowed combinations of attribute values.
