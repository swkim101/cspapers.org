Hardware that affects the design of software for real time control systems arises from the use of switched memory address decoding., This is a technique by which some of the memory address decoding circuits in a computer system can be switched under the programmed control of the central processor and can be used to alter in a controlled fashion the position of a number of data sets in the memory map of the system. This type of operation is described and a consideration of the implementation of switched memory addressed decoding hardware is made.
