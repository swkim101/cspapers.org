This paper addresses the perpendicular and parallel parking problems of car-like vehicles for both forward and reverse maneuvers in one trial by improving the work presented in [1] using a multi sensor based controller with a weighted control scheme. The perception problem is discussed briefly considering a Velodyne VLP-16 and a SICK LMS151 as the sensors providing the required exteroceptive information. The results obtained from simulations and real experimentation for different parking scenarios show the validity and potential of the proposed approach.
