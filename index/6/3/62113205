The evolution of the most of today's computing environments towards heterogeneous distributed systems introduces specific challenges to the area of software maintenance and testing. This paper presents Remote Maintenance Shell (RMS), a framework for software management in large distributed systems we have developed. RMS enables centralized software deployment, execution control (starting and stopping), maintenance (upgrading with new versions) and testing on the actual target system. RMS is based on remote operations performed by mobile agents, which are organised into multi-agent teams. The emphasis of the paper is on the testing features, so a detailed description of the RMS software testing model is given. Interaction between software and RMS is explained, and the two available testing modes are described.
