It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 7th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Types in Language Design and Implementation -- TLDI'11. The TLDI workshops are a continuation of the Types in Compilation -- TIC workshops, the first of which was held in 1997. Initially biennial, TLDI is now an annual workshop. 
 
The role of types in all aspects of language design, compiler construction, and software development has expanded greatly in recent years. Type systems, type-based analyses, and typebased reasoning frameworks have led to new concepts in compilation techniques for modern programming languages, verification of safety and security properties of programs, program transformation and optimization, and many other areas. The mission of the TLDI series of workshops is to bring together researchers in all these areas to share novel ideas and stimulate interaction and discussion on the ever-expanding use of types. 
 
The call for papers this year attracted 14 submissions from Asia, Australia, Europe, and the United States. All submissions received at least 3 reviews, with most receiving between 4 and 6 reviews. In addition, every submission received at least one expert review or, failing that, multiple highconfidence reviews. After a weeklong electronic meeting conducted via the Easychair conference management system, the program committee decided to accept 6 papers for presentation at the workshop. The accepted papers concern the application of types to a range of problems, including information-flow security and access control, deadlock avoidance, and the taming of mutable state.
