The craftsmen who maintain the Bell System communications network rely on the availability of high quality documentation. A computer based documentation system - MAGIC - was brought on line in North Carolina in 1976 to facilitate the rapid preparation and editing of technical documentation with high cost-effectiveness over traditional manual publication methods. The North Carolina MAGIC system consists of refresh interactive display terminals for creation and editing of documentation data pages, a data-base management computer, and an electronic phototypesetter. Other system configurations are in operation elsewhere in the Bell System.
