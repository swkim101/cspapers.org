In this study, an e-learning approach would be applied to an electronic communication course aimed at sophomore students in department of technology education. The goals are to enrich the students' understanding on basic topics such as filter circuit concepts, electronic components, and circuit theory, as well as to provide remote support, course materials and simulation tools. In the course, students can study filter circuit concepts through e-learning platform, simulation tool and practice activities. By using e-learning platform, students can download materials, experimental manual and online discussion without time and environment limit, the simulation tools will help students to pre-experimental and verification of electronic circuit theory. Finally, students use hard-wired circuits and electronic components to implement experiment activities. The purpose of this study is tries to adopt of new technologies to enrich the students' understanding in filter circle theory of electronic communication and hope students can to assimilate the new technologies as a part of their learning experience.
