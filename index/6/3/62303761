This paper presents an automated algorithm for design of vehicle structures for crashworthiness, based on the analyses of the structural crash mode. The crash mode (CM) is the history of the deformation of the different zones of the vehicle structure during a crash event. The algorithm emulates a process called crash mode matching where structural crashworthiness is improved by manually modifying the design until its crash mode matches the one the designers deem as optimal. Given an initial design and a desired crash mode, the algorithm iteratively finds new designs that have better crashworthiness performance via stochastic sampling of the design space. A new design is chosen per iteration as the best among the normally distributed samples near the current design. The mean and standard deviation of the normal distributions are adjusted in each iteration by examining the crash mode of the current design and applying a set of fuzzy logic rules that encapsulate elementary knowledge of the crash mode matching practice. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The case studies examine a front half vehicle model, as well as a fully detailed vehicle model.Â© 2009 ASME
