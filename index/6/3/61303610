This book addresses the integration of new devices (such as the iPhone), new technologies (such as cloud computing and green computing), and new software systems in pervasive and ubiquitous computing from the point of view of security, trust, and privacy (STP). It provides an overview of recent progress in ubiquitous and pervasive computing, examining current practices, trends, and challenges. The book covers theoretical approaches, mathematical models, empirical research, practical implementations, and diverse application areas, along with a rich and useful presentation of strategies for security issues in different computing areas.
