A new type of compliant approximate dwell mechanism design is introduced. This new compliant mechanism includes an initially straight flexible beam and a flexible arc. Approximate dwell motion is obtained by incorporating the snap-through buckling motion of the flexible arc. Load-deflection curves of flexible mechanism components are modeled by fitting polynomials to the analytical nonlinear large deflection response. The kinematic synthesis of the compliant mechanism is done quasi-statically using loop closure theory and large deflection relations of flexible parts.Copyright Â© 2003 by ASME
