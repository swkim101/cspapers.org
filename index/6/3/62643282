In the context of the Usage Context Based Design (UCBD) of a product-service, a taxonomy of variables is suggested to setup the link between the design parameters of a product-service and the part of a set of expected usages that may be covered. This paper implements a physics-based model to provide a performance prediction for each usage context that also depends on the user skill. The physics describing the behavior and consequently the performances of a jigsaw are established. Simulating numerically the usage coverage is non trivial for two reasons: the presence of circular references in physical relations and the need to efficiently propagate value sets or domains instead of accurate values. For these two reasons, we modeled the usage coverage issue as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem and we result in the expected service performances and a value of a covered usage indicator.Copyright Â© 2010 by ASME
