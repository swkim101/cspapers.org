The technique of refactoring, restructuring the source code of an object-oriented program without changing it external behavior, has been embraced by many objectoriented software developers as a way to accommodate changing requirements. It is expected that such refactoring operations or software transformations improve the maintainability of software. Unfortunately, it in unclear how specific quality factors are affected by applying such refactorings operations or software transformations. This position paper addresses the issue of developing a restructuring methodology and its associated architecture for migrating an object-oriented legacy system to a new target system. The methodology allows for specific design and quality requirements of the target migrant system to be considered during the restructuring process that is applied on iterative and incremental steps.
