This research concerns the packing problem frequently encountered in engineering design, where the volume and weight of a number of structural components such as valves and plumbing lines need to be minimized. Since in real applications the constraints are usually complex, the formulation of computationally tractable optimization becomes challenging. In this research, we propose a novel multiobjective simulated annealing (MOSA) approach towards the design optimization, i.e., optimizing the placement of valves under prescribed constraints to minimize the volume occupied, and the estimated plumbing line length. The objectives and constraints are described by analytical expressions. Our case study indicates that the new MOSA algorithm has relatively better performance towards 3D packing with strong constraints and the design can indeed be automated. The outcome of this research may benefit both existing manufacturing practice and future additive manufacturing.Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME
