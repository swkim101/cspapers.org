The Domain Name System (DNS) is the primary infrastructure component of the Internet as it translates easy-to-remember Internet destination (web pages, mail servers) addresses (called URLs) into actual network addresses (IP addresses). Being the foundational technology for the Global economy, the DNS needs protection using state of practice security measures. A set of security specifications called DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) specification has been proposed by IETF and has been demonstrated to provide the needed protection. However ubiquitous DNSSEC deployment throughout the DNS infrastructure calls for certain critical security operations. There are some unresolved issues with respect to the rollout of these operations in terms of specification gaps, consensus security procedures and operational challenges. This article discusses those issues and provides some directions for resolving them.
