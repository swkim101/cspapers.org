The novel snowshoe (400) includes at least one tail extender (404) to provide variable flotation characteristics and traction bars (412) that provide improved side slip protection such as when traversing steep terrain. The snowshoe (400) is thereby especially advantageous for use in back country mountaineering. A three (or more) point attachment mechanism is disclosed for coupling the tail extender (404) to the flotation plate (416) of snowshoe (400) so as to reduce stress on the coupling elements and provide a more secure interface.
