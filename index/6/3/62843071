It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2nd Workshop on Assurable & Usable Security Configuration -- SafeConfig-09. Configuration is the "glue" for logically integrating infrastructure components to satisfy end-to-end requirements. It is well-documented that configuration errors account for 50%-80% of infrastructure vulnerabilities and downtime. Thus, it is critical to develop technology for eliminating such errors, such as for requirement specification, configuration error diagnosis, configuration repair, configuration synthesis, configuration visualization and reconfiguration planning. The challenge of developing such technology is compounded by the inherent tension between usability and security. The former is about enabling good things whereas the latter is about preventing bad things. This workshop brings together some of the latest ideas for addressing these challenges. 
 
The call for papers attracted 21 submissions from Africa, Asia, Europe and USA. The program committee accepted 6 regular papers and 5 position/short papers. In addition, the program includes a panel to discuss the report from last year's SafeConfig-08 workshop supported by NSF. We hope that these proceedings will help to shape a new research agenda and a framework to improve infrastructure planning.
