The CHI Papers and Notes program is continuing to grow along with many of our sister conferences. We are pleased that CHI is still the leading venue for research in human-computer interaction. 
 
CHI 2013 continued the use of subcommittees to manage the review process. Authors selected the subcommittee they believed was best qualified to review their work: For clarity, we retained the same committee identifiers as last year. Due to the continuing growth in submissions, we split several subcommittees into more manageable sizes. We are pleased with the subcommittee process: By dividing the work, each paper received much more careful discussion than would otherwise have been possible. 
 
This year we had 1963 total submissions, including 1347 papers and 617 notes, representing a 24% growth over last year. We accepted 392 submissions (20%): 316 papers and 76 notes. 
 
The CHI review process demands a tremendous amount of work from all areas of the human-computer interaction community. As co-chairs of the process, we are amazed at the ability of the community to organize itself to accomplish this task. We would like to thank the 2680 individual reviewers for their careful consideration of these papers. We also deeply appreciate the huge amount of time donated to this process by the 211-member program committee, who paid their own way to attend the face-to-face program committee meeting, an event larger than the average ACM conference. 
 
We are proud of the work of the CHI 2013 program committee and hope that you enjoy these papers and notes, which represent the best research in human-computer interaction.
