This research explores how context sensing and ubiquitous communication media can support remote family members with new ways of caringfor each other using awareness systems. An important design dimension in awareness systems is reflected by the concepts of symmetry andsocial translucence. We explore the effect of ensuring symmetry versus ensuring social translucence upon the social connectedness and the privacy satisfaction that people experience through the use of anawareness system. We built the SoPresenT prototype which uses audioand video technologies to support these concepts. We are currently investigating these through controlled experiments.
