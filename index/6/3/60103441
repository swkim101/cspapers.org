Artificial intelligence as well as neurophysiological studies of recent decades suggest a unitary view of language, in which natural language constitutes only part of the total language of the organism; the latter is a single but complex structure containing also the symbol-systems and their transformations responsible for mental processes. Following Sloman, the dogma that communication is the main function of language is opposed, and implications of the unitary thesis in respect of a number of linguistic and psychological questions are briefly discussed.
