Typical Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, which are increasingly used in many areas, consume too much energy due to heavy processing in a long time. This makes them not useful and sometimes even impractical for applications with high mobility or operating in obstructed regions where the GPS signal is present in short time. To address the problem, we propose a new design for a fast GPS receiver which is able to achieve the result with several milliseconds of logged GNSS data. Thanks to the open policy of GPS navigation messages, the logged data can be post-processed to achieve a good estimate of position. Compared with traditional commercial receivers, the power-consumption of our proposed design is about 23% of a typical GPS receiver.
