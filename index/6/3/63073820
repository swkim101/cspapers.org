It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the ACM MobiSys 2016 PhD Forum workshop in Singapore. For the past several years, the PhD Forum has been a regular event of the ACM MobiSys conference. 
 
The forum provides a highly interactive, supportive and friendly environment for PhD students to present and discuss their research with other students and experienced researchers from both academia and industry. In addition to providing feedback and advice, this forum also provides an excellent opportunity for students to build their professional network. This forum is best suited to students who are far enough to their PhD so that we can have constructive and effective discussions on their thesis in terms of the key challenges to solve, research approaches and strategies, as well as the methodologies suited for the research. 
 
This year, the workshop program has been designed with two technical sessions, namely Mobile Applications, Sensing, and Users and Mobile Systems and Platform. The opening keynote will be "Managing Risk in an Academic Career: a Personal Perspective" by Professor Ben Y. Zhao.
