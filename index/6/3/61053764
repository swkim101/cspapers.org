The papers in this volume were presented at the 39th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), held June 11-13, 2007 in San Diego, California, as part of the Federated Computer Research Conference (FCRC). STOC was sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT).This volume also contains an abstract for an invited talk delivered by the recipient of the 8th Knuth Prize, Nancy Lynch from MIT. 
 
The papers accepted to the conference were selected from a record number of 312 submissions. The program committee conducted initial electronic discussions, and these were followed by a physical meeting in Atlanta, Georgia. One quarter of the submissions were selected for presentation, and following a merge of two papers the final number of accepted papers stands at 77. Though all papers received careful consideration, they were not refereed in a formal sense, and the authors are encouraged to submit full versions of their papers for publication in journals. 
 
From the many outstanding candidates, the STOC program committee selected the following two papers as recipients of the Best Paper Award: "Faster Integer Multiplication", by Martin Furer, and "Towards 3-Query Locally Decodable Codes of Subexponential Length" by Sergey Yekhanin. The latter of these two papers is also ther ecipient of the Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award.
