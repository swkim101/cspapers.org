This paper presents a framework for integrated plan recognition, goal reasoning, and planning, to produce cooperative behaviour for one agent to help another agent. By observing an “initiator” agent performing a task, the plan recogniser hypothe-sises how a “supporter” agent could proactively help the initiator by proposing a set of subgoals to be achieved. A lightweight goal reasoning and negotiation process mediates between the two agents to produce a mutually agreeable set of goals for the supporter. The goals are passed to a planner which builds plans to satisfy the goals. The approach is demonstrated in a series of experimental scenarios.
