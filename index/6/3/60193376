This paper describes the development of an explicit FE code as a simulation tool for the thermoforming process in long fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites. Emphasis is on the forming process itself, where both interply sliding and intraply deformations may occur, the latter being important in double curvature geometry. Each prepreg ply is modelled by a shell finite element and an interface viscous friction law is imposed to govern interply and ply/tool sliding. Rheological constitutive equations are presented for the thermo-viscoelastic prepreg plies with unidirectional and fabric reinforcements. The paper presents thermoforming simulations carried out to validate the code on idealised components and prototype aircraft components in carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastics.
