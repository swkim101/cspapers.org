Describes how the quality of product requirements specifications can be improved through the use of a structured method combined with a well-defined and structured notation. The Controlled Requirements Expression (CORE) method is effective in guiding the analysts through the information capture process; SDL provides a powerful notation for expressing these functional requirements. SDL notation can be used consistently for subsequent design. The contextual modelling approach of CORE enables validation of the specification to be carried out. CORE encourages design constraints to be identified and their effect analysed. The overall match CORE and SDL is extremely good; so good that a hybrid technique which takes advantage of the strengths of CORE and SDL seems a most natural development.
