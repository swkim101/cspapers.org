Migration is a technique where a virtual machine moved from one host to another host instantly. Memory migration and storage migration are two important features in this process, especially processor state, memory, storage and network connections are transferred from one host to another host. This process involve three techniques for its efficiency, those are fault tolerant migration technique, load balancing migration technique, energy efficient migration technique. Migration time and down time are two important factors for improving the performance of the service in case of virtual machine migration process. Our aim is to maintain the migration time and downtime properly by using Raid5 controller for fast progress of migration process of virtual machine.
