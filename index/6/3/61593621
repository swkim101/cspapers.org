Knowledge discovery from multi-databases requires support for handling heterogeneous schema integration and heterogeneous knowledge integration. The issue of heterogeneous schema integration using knowledge discovery has been addressed by [Dao95], [Hay90], [Kin96], and [Li94], among others. In this paper we address the area of heterogeneous knowledge integration, which hasnâ€™t been dealt with thoroughly. We propose a framework for discovering knowledge from distributed and heterogeneous data sources. A methodology is introduced that allows the induction of association rules from horizontally, as well as vertically distributed data sources. We also present the architectural extensions to the developed Mining Kernel System ([Ana96b]) to support such discovery.
