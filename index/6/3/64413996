The papers in this volume were presented at the Forty-Sixth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2014), held in New York, New York, June 1-3, 2014. The Symposium was sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT). On May 31, the day before STOC, there was a program of workshops organized by Kunal Talwar and Chris Umans; the workshops were on Recent Advances on the "Lovasz Local Lemma", "Efficient Distribution Estimation", and "Coping with Intractability in Unsupervised Learning". The conference was also the site for the Turing Award Lectures of Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali.
