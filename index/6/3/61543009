Welcome to Programming Languages meet Program Verification 2009! This is now the 3rd workshop in the PLPV series: PLPV '06 took place in Seattle (colocated with IJCAR) and PLPV '07 in Freiburg (colocated with ICFP). This time we are pleased to be colocated with POPL'09 in Savannah, Georgia. 
 
PLPV's focus is to explore language-based approaches to program verification. In these approaches, the programming language provides mechanisms that allow the programmer to express, in some way, her knowledge of why her code meets its specification. PLPV topics include type systems that support the creation of statically verified software, the integration of theorem proving environments with programming languages, and lightweight approaches to program correctness. 
 
We were very pleased to receive 13 high quality submissions in different categories: 1 submission for a challenge problem, 9 submissions for regular research papers, and 3 work-in-progress papers. Each paper was reviewed by at least 3 reviewers, which included both PC members and additional external reviewers. We held a PC meeting over email over a number of days and decided to accept 8 submissions: 1 challenge problem and 7 regular research papers. The accepted papers cover a variety of topics of interest to the PLPV community: dependent types, their implementation and their interaction with effects; domain-specific type systems; contract types; and a challenge proposal on verification of refactorings. 
 
We are happy that Manuel Fahndrich from Microsoft Research accepted our invitation to speak about his recent work on language-agnostic program verification. We are looking forward to his presentation.
