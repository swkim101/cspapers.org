Welcome to the proceedings of the system demonstration session. This volume contains the papers of the system demonstrations presented at the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, held in Uppsala, Sweden, on July 13 2010. The system demonstrations program offers the presentation of early research prototypes as well as interesting mature systems. The system demonstration chair and the members of the program committee received 65 submissions, 14 of which were selected for inclusion in the program after review by two members of the program committee.
