Requirements completeness and correctness are perhaps the most difficult yet vital issues to identify during validation. If they are not properly identified and resolved early on, they become a serious threat to quality and cost, especially for large software development ventures. Conventional techniques for validation are generally inadequate for such issues. This paper reports an inspection technique named Traceability-based Requirements Inspection that helps identify and resolve these issues by addressing the pre-tracebility of requirements in the documented domain knowledge. The technique is supplemented with appropriate metrics, procedures and a tool named Pensieve to facilitate identification, reporting and resolution of completeness and correctness issues. The viability of the technique has been assessed through a case study, the results of which are also reported and discussed.
