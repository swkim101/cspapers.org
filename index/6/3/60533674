A knowledge-based requirements management tool is being developed for the automotive industry to aid in the specification of modular systems whose development is contracted out to the supply chain. The aim of this tool is to allow the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and their system suppliers to have a shared conceptualization of the product requirements. This paper highlights some of the issues with the current paper-based specifications and the use of natural language to represent the requirements. The framework of the knowledge-based tool in order to address these issues through the application of ontology is described. A ‘product’ ontology for the specification of the seating assembly for a car is presented. The ontology encapsulates the required functionalities, design parameters, performance criteria, structure and geometry. This is the result of the consensual convergence in the vocabulary, definitions and attributes that describe the product requirements.Copyright © 2004 by ASME
