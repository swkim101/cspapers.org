In this paper, we describe the D-SCRIBE process used to build ontologies that are expected to have significant domain expansion after their initial introduction and whose coverage of concepts needs to be validated for a series of related applications. This process has been used to build SCRIBE, a very modular, ambitious ontology for the information about events triggered by both humans or nature, response activities by agencies that provide public services in cities by using resources and assets (land parcels, buildings, vehicles, equipment) and their communication (requests, work orders, sensor reports). SCRIBE reuses concepts from previously existing ontologies and data exchange standards, and D-SCRIBE retains traceability to these source influences.
