The purpose of this study is to combine Java and OpenSceneGraph(OSG) for the development of 3D scene graph, and to play their individual advantages. This paper introduced the scene management, rendering process and other relevant theoretical knowledge about OSG, and elaborated the method about using OSG in java environment through java's JNI technology. According to this method, the constructing, rendering and dynamic roam of a simple 3D scene graph about one frontage road were realized, and the concrete realization processes of the application introduced in this essay. The results show java can be combined with OSG for the development of 3D scene graph friendly.
