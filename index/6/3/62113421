It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Second International Workshop on Ubiquitous Crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing, a successful mechanism to harvest knowledge from the masses in domains ranging from healthcare, software development to managing disaster relief effort, offers endless opportunities to engage the networked crowds. With the adoption of mobile, digital and social media the crowds are increasingly reporting and acting upon events in smart environments; and sharing their data and experiences. Building upon First International Workshop on Ubiqitous Crowdsourcing, in this edition we challenge researchers and practitioners to identify requirements for a platform for crowd computing, arising from experiences in deployment crowdsourcing applications, which engage crowd members as sensors, controllers and actuators in smart cities and environments. The call for papers attracted over 10 submissions from Asia, Europe, and the United States. The program committee accepted 9 papers that cover a variety of topics, including crowdsourcing systems that leverage sensing capabilities of crowds.
