With the development of the society and the changes of the traffic information on the urban road, Optimal path is no longer simply the shortest distance on the geographical location, but also taking into account the real-time traffic information. Meanwhile, with the development of the computer technology, communication technology and geographical information technology, intelligent navigation brings more benefits to people. It can save the travel time and reduce energy consumption. On the other hand, using intelligent navigation, people can avoid roadblock, traffic jams, traffic accidents etc. Intelligent navigation can provide a safer and more reassuring environment. Combining with the Internet of Things, this paper proposes an improved routing algorithm for dynamic traffic navigation based on the Internet of Things platform. GPS will download the real-time traffic information by accessing the built Internet of Things platform, calculate the optimal path precisely, and then provide real-time and more intelligent navigation service for people.
