A spatial 3-DOF translational parallel mechanism is analyzed. Its inverse kinematic model is established. The section view of the workspace of the parallel mechanism is presented via boundary search method under the defined constraints. Considering the workspace volume as the optimization object, the relationship between structural parameters and workspace volume is obtained and the structural parameters to be optimized are determined. Finally, the optimization configuration of the mechanism is obtained. The results show that the volume of the workspace increases 1.55 times as much as the original volume, which lay the foundation for the architecture design.
