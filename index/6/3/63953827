By using orthogonal experimental approach, a new restrainer DY-1 is developed. As its rate of corrosion inhibiion is as high as 98.4%, excellen inhibition can be achieved to A3 steel in hydrochloric acid below a temperature of 50â„ƒ by adding only a small amount of it. Electrochemical properties such as the rate of corrosion inhibition, polarization resistance and alternating current impedance, etc. as well as its mechanism of corrosion inhibiting are studied. The results suggest that Dy-1 works by adsorbing onto metal surface in form of physical adsorption.
