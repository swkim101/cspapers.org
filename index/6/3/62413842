All software requires maintenance, either for error correction or for implementing updates. However, maintenance is often complex and expensive, and one of the main problems in the high cost of maintenance is the difficulty of understanding the source code of other authors. Thus, this research presents TaggingSense, a method based on sensemaking that aims to reduce object-oriented source code comprehension time on systems maintenance. Through experimentation, it was possible to observe knowledge extracted from the source code, processing, and sharing, to be positively assisted in the source code maintenance and comprehension process, thus bringing benefits such as reduction time spent, quality, and greater security in the changes made.
