There is increasing interest in building systems that can automatically interpret hand-drawn sketches. However, many challenges remain in terms of recognition accuracy, robustness to different drawing styles, and ability to generalize across multiple domains. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach to sketched symbol recognition that focuses on the visual appearance of the symbols. This allows us to better handle the range of visual and stroke-level variations found in freehand drawings. We also present a new symbol classifier that is computationally efficient and invariant to rotation and local deformations. We show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art performance on all three domains we evaluated, including handwritten digits, PowerPoint shapes, and electrical circuit symbols.
