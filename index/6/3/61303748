The goal of this Conference is to bring to the attention of the international database community and of the members of ACM's Special Interest Groups on Business Data Processing (SIGBDP), Information Retrieval (SIGIR), and Management of Data (SIGMOD), the two new activities which will impact them for years to come. The first new activity is the initiation of a technical journal by ACM known as the ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS) which will have its first issue in the Spring of 1976. The second new activity is the emerging emphasis on very large database research and development which is prompted by Advance Research Projects Agency's programs on intelligent terminals, advanced memory concepts and very large database systems. In order to meet the goal, we formed a Program Committee of international standing. The Committee decided to have an open call-for-papers, to organize panel discussions on very large database users, on very large storage devices and on future storage architectures, and to arrange the Conference meeting in the Greater Boston area which had the support and sponsorship of ACM's SIGBDP, SIGIR, and SIGMOD and The Rand Corporation. 
 
The response to the call-for-papers was overwhelming. Over one hundred and forty people indicated their desire to submit papers. Despite a delay of notice and an earlier deadline for paper submission, we received ninety-eight complete papers. Each paper was refereed by three reviewers. Twenty-nine papers were recommended by the Committee for their publication in the Conference Proceedings. Six of the twenty-nine papers will be included in the first issue of the TODS. Because some of the remaining papers were of good quality and of interest to database practitioners, the Committee further recommended the inclusion of abstracts of another twenty-seven papers in the Proceedings.
