Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a multifaceted area that includes diverse disciplines such as Mathematics and Cryptography, Legal and Social aspects, Signal Processing, Game Theory, Information Theory, Software and Systems Design and Business Analysis. The ACM Workshop on Digital Rights Management is an international forum that serves as an interdisciplinary bridge across these areas. Its purpose is to bring together researchers from the above fields for a full day of formal talks and informal discussions, covering new results that will spur new investigations regarding the foundations and practices of DRM.This year's workshop, the fifth in the series, continued this tradition. The workshop was sponsored by ACM SIGSAC and was held in conjunction with the 12th ACM Conference in Computer and Communications Security (CCS). This volume contains the proceedings of the workshop and is a good representation of the diversity of disciplines that contribute to the complexity of DRM. The workshop received 33 submissions (from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North America) out of which 13 were accepted for presentation after a rigorous refereeing process.The invited talk at the workshop was given by Andrew Moss from Microsoft, who spoke on "Digital Evolution - Survival of the Adaptable."
