In the last two decades, color image enhancement has been researched actively. The digital camera suffers from both color filtering and low spatial resolution. To alleviate this issue, we study color image super resolution method. The Bayer pattern CFA is one of widely used CFA patterns in digital camera. Alternatively, the Fujifilm proposed X-Trans CFA pattern. In this paper, we conduct simulation on X-Trans CFA pattern and assess its performance. Simulation results show that the proposed method gives satisfactory results.
