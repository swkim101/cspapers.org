3D ocean wave simulation has long been hot issues in the field of computer graphics and real-time simulation and has practical significance in many areas of society. Complexity and randomness of the waves led to large areas of ocean wave simulation calculation exists for compute-intensive, low efficiency, memory requirements and other limitations. In response to the phenomenon of a decline in real-time with the fidelity lifting, this paper proposes a parallel simulation method, in which the wave data is calculated by each DSP and the results will be stitched as large ocean area. Experimental results show that the multi-DSP parallel processing method can satisfy the feeling of reality and real-time requirements of the waves at the same time, which will improve the system real-time performance without loss the wave details.
