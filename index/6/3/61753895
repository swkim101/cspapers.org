Most web content exists in a few dozen languages. Hundreds of other languages - the `low-density languages' - are only represented in scarce quantities on the web. How can we locate, store and describe these low-density resources? In particular, how can we identify linguistically interesting resources, such as translation sets and multilingual documents? In this paper we describe ongoing research in which we integrate a number of discrete systems (language data crawler, automated metadata generation tools, language data repositories and federated search services) to address the identification, retrieval, description, storage and access issues for low-density language materials from the web.
