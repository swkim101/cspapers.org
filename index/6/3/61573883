The papers in this volume were presented at the 41st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2009), held in Bethesda, Maryland, May 31 -- June 2, 2009. The Symposium was sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT). This volume also contains a short essay related to the Les Valiant celebration day held on May 30 before the conference to honor the work and career of Les Valiant. 
 
The submitted papers in many cases represent reports of continuing research. It is expected that most of them will appear in a more polished and complete form in scientific journals. 
 
In response to the Call for Papers, a record 329 submissions were received by the November 17, 2008 deadline, of which 8 were eventually withdrawn. Although the submissions were not formally refereed, each received careful consideration. The committee held a series of on-line discussions, as well as a physical meeting January 29-30, in Cambridge, MA, attended by 23 of the 24 program committee members. A total of 77 papers were selected for inclusion in the program. Of these, the committee chose two recipients for the Best Paper Award: "A Constructive Proof of the Lovasz Local Lemma" by Robin Moser, and "Public-Key Cryptosystems from the Worst-Case Shortest Vector Problem" by Chris Peikert. The committee also awarded the Danny Lewin Best Student Paper award to the former paper by Moser.
