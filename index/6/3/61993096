Some recent artificial intelligence programs whose task is to simulate the processes of scientific discovery can be taken as models of the history and processes of discovery within the Al discipline Itself. Consistently with these models, AI research relies basically on the methods of heuristic best-first search. Because of Its necessarily vague end open goals, it works forward inductively (rather than backward In menea-ends fashion), guided by a crude evaluation function that tests running programs to identify promising directions. 
 
AI reseerch Is empirical and pragmatic, typically working with examples rather than theorems, and exemplfyin the heuristic of learning by doing. In Its essential reliance on weak methods and experiment Insteed Of proof, it is edepted to the exploration of poorly structured task domains, showing considerable contrest In the respect to operetione reseerch or numerical analysis, which thrive best In domains possessing strong formal structure.
