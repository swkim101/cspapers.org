Many systems development methodologies have been proposed and used for developing systems and there is a need to integrate these methodologies. The authors identify an approach in which the data dictionary system can form the basis for co-existence of different methodologies. Although this approach is only one of several possible, it is a realistic one and can contribute greatly to methodologies integration. The data dictionary consists of five levels: external, conceptual, logical, architectural and physical, which are described. The support of the data model for eight methodologies is analysed: ODSS, EDM, JSD, ISAC, Multiview, NIAM, SASD and SSADM. Future work will concentrate on extending this dictionary data model to support formal methodologies such as VDM and on implementing a prototype in order to evaluate its functionality.
