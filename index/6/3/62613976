A trap for capturing animals comprising a main box, step boards, doors and anchoring members. The step boards are pivotally held to the main box, and the anchoring members attached to the step boards are designed so as to keep the doors open by anchoring them. When the step boards are pressed down by the weight of an animal passing through the main box, the doors are released from the engagement with the anchoring members and caused to close the entrances to confine the animal in the main box. Since the animal trap of the invention needs no bait for capturing an animal, it may be set up without any difficulty on the running route of the animals.
