In this paper, an innovative method is presented which uses the properties of atomic theory to solve design modularization problems for product design. With the developed method, products can be modularized based upon different given constraints, e.g., material compatibility, part recyclability, and part disassemblability. The developed method can help engineers effectively create modular designs in the initial design stage, based upon different design requirements. With design considerations incorporated into new modules, a new design can be created which improves upon an original design, with respect to design requirements.Copyright Â© 2009 by ASME
