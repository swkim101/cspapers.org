Porous materials / structures have wide applications in industry, since the sizes, shapes and positions of their pores can be adjusted on various demands. However, the precise control and performance oriented design of porous structures are still urgent and challenging, especially when the manufacturing technology is well developed due to 3D printing. In this study, the control and design of anisotropic porous structures are studied with more degrees of freedom than isotropic structures, and can achieve more complex mechanical goals. The proposed approach introduces Super Formula to represent the structural cells, maps the design problem to an optimal problem using PGD, and solves the optimal problem using MMA to obtain the structure with desired performance. The proposed approach is also tested on the performance of the expansion of design space, the capture of the physical orientation and so on.
