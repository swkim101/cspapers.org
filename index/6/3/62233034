CEA-LIST develops CIVA software for non-destructive testing simulation. Radiography Monte Carlo simulation for the scattered beam can be quite long (several hours) even on a multi-thread CPU implementation. In order to reduce this computation time, we have modified and adapted for CIVA a GPU open source code named MCGPU. This paper presents our work and the results of cross comparison between CIVA and the modified MCGPU code in a NDT context.
