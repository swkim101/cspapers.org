This paper introduces a new initiative of web-based games that encourages students to experiment with JavaScript instructions in order to play a series of games. This approach to involving students in early stages of programming uses principles of bricolage [2] to appeal to learning styles that traditional computer science curricula often do not appeal to. The fundamental goal is to build confidence and motivation through early programming successes. This initiative can be used in a CS0 course, to remediate programming skills for targeted students, or as a means to interest high school students in programming.
