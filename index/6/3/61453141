Purpose: The aim of the present study is to analyze the progress of the students from the learning of Software Engineering at the University Jaume I (UJI), Spain. And from this teaching experience, to get to know the best way to improve the teaching of Software Engineering. Results: The new schedule of courses in computer science has been applied during four years at the University Jaume I. From the teaching experience of the subjects forming the thematic area of Software Engineering at the UJI, we have observe that the progress of the students has been decreasing since the first year. These unsatisfactory results have made us consider a change in our teaching practice. Conclusions: According to the obtained statistic results, we deem it necessary to think of improving our actual teaching techniques and to incorporate new Software Engineering tools, in order to support students in the understanding of Software Engineering courses.
