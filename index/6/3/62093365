Component Based Software Engineering has one main sole motive of making the development process of software systems as easy as possible and to achieve this objective work needs to be done in previous systems to identify the concerns and limitations which can be overcome using this software engineering based approach. In this paper to support concept of component based system a domain is chosen that covers the GIS systems. GIS (Geographic Information Systems) are commonly used for development of map based applications these systems are widely used across the web and in various organizations. With the development and deepening of GIS, traditional GIS systems showed the challenges on isolation, sealing, interoperability and the limitations, thereby hindering further development and application of GIS technology. In this paper framework for component based GIS system is proposed. This framework is having rich graphical interface and user data can be easily retrieved from the connected database and displayed in the browser.
