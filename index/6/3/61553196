The energy consumption and environmental impact of networking and communications equipment is of increasing importance to researchers, commercial entities and society at large. The First ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Green Networking is aimed at creating a dynamic forum discussing green networking issues, and presenting promising research ideas toward the goal of designing green infrastructures in both the computing and non-computing domains. 
 
This year's call for papers attracted 29 submissions on a range of topics from energy conservation in data centers to energy efficient protocols to characterization studies on energy consumption. The 15 member Technical Program Committee along with a selected group of external experts carefully considered all of the submissions. The TPC meeting to select the final program was held via teleconference in early May, 2010. At the conclusion of the meeting, the committee had assembled a strong program composed of 12 that will be presented during the workshop.
