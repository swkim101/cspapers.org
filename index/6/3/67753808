Over the past 3 decades, the wheeled mobile robots have been an interesting and active area of automous system research, development and deployment. Related research is done by Majmudar et al. [1] which design about vision system for door sensing based mobile robots. Other research is done by Nicolas et al. [2] which develop mobile robot systems for following and people tracking purpose with big size. Then Sharifi et al. [3] design mobile robot which dedicated for indoor localization based visible light. There are a lot of researches about mobile robot for various applications. Pipe as the main medium of gas transportation has various forms of applications [4]. Inspection become a regular activities performed by chemical industries that aim to prevent several things which out of control, e.g. gas leakage (due to pipes corrosion or other things beyond estimates). There are three common technologies which can be applied. Basically those three devices should be held by chemical industries in order to cover the dangers and complement technology each other. First is inspection from in-pipe using autonomous robot. This tool commonly called in-pipe mobile robot [5-10]. The advantages point, the inspector can determine condition of pipe by real-time which grounded even in under of sea. But it requires a good device to able to work in harsh environment. Second is inspection from out-pipe with tracking method at the pipe to know whether any cracks. This activity can be covered by human (trace the stretch pipe with a specific tool) or by mobile robot which patch on the pipe (e.g. climbing robot [11-12]). Third is a mobile robot which specific task of detecting leakage gas only [13-14]. We are know that the risk of leakage suddenly although just little have a significant effect on living things including human who work in the venue.
