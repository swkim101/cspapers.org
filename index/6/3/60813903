Temporal queries combine textual and temporal constraints
and are used for searching temporal collections like web
archives. Indexing these collections might result in huge index
files which can reduce the performance of query processing.
Static index pruning can be used to increase efficiency.
It remains unclear whether these methods are adapted for
temporal queries. More specifically, we hypothesize that
pruning should preserve the temporal diversity of the collection.
In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of four
static index pruning methods for temporal collections and
show the relation between temporal diversification and retrieval
effectiveness. Evaluations are conducted using the
Wikipedia collection.
