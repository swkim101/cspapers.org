A fault injection method based on SCADE was designed in this paper, which can simulate hardware failure in the form of software fault. Injecting faults into SCADE models brings forward fault tolerance testing to development phase avoiding the cost of changing fault-tolerant design by modifying the code. Development and fault injection test are in the same environment, which improves the efficiency of the project management. Speed and location measuring subsystem of ATP was selected as the target model in this paper and faults were injected into it in SCADE. The effect on the system of the injected fault can be observed in the simulation process. The weakness of the fault-tolerant design of the system can be found with this method.
