It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the proceedings of the DSM'14 workshop held as part of SPLASH 2014! The 14th Workshop on Domain-Specific Modeling continues the tradition of combining papers and presentations on both practical and theoretical level. 
 
Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) provides a modern solution to demands for higher productivity by constricting the gap between problem and solution modeling. In the past, productivity gains have been sought from new programming languages. Domain-specific modeling languages provide a viable solution for continuing to raise the level of abstraction beyond coding, making development faster and easier. 
 
This year's workshop continues the tradition to share experiences and demonstrate the DSM solutions that have been developed by both researchers and practitioners, identify research questions and continuing to build the community. The program contains paper presentations and discussions as well as group work on selected topics. 
 
This year we received 15 submissions from 36 authors from 11 countries. Paper review was done by the members of program committee and each paper had at least 3 reviews. Out of 15 submissions 8 were accepted (53%). We hope that you will enjoy this record of the workshop and find the information within the proceedings valuable toward your understanding of the current state-of-the-art in Domain-Specific Modeling.
