The low voltage switch has widely application especially in the hostile environment such as large vibration and shock conditions. In order to ensure the validity of the switch in the hostile environment, it is necessary to predict its mechanical characteristic. In traditional method, the complex and expensive testing system is build up to verify its validity. This paper presented a method based on finite element analysis to predict the dynamic mechanical characteristic of the switch by using ANSYS software. This simulation could provide the basis for the design and optimization of the switch to shorten the design process to improve the product efficiency.
