A comparison of the formal description technique LOTOS and the programming language Occam 2 is given in the paper. It is shown that under certain restrictions there exists a natural and straightforward possibility of implementing LOTOS specifications into Occam programs. Special emphasis is given to modelling and implementation of communications software, especially protocols and services. >
