This paper presents an industry case study investigating change propagation due to requirement changes. This paper makes use of a change propagation prediction tool, ΔDSM, to identify if the propagated changes could have been identified and predicted. The study used an automation firm’s client project as the study subject. The project entailed 160 requirements, changing over the span of 15 month. Engineering change notifications were developed for each change and documented under the firm’s data management system. This study makes use of the change notifications to identify if any of the change were as a result of a previous change. The findings of this paper indicated the changes that occurred could have been predicted as the ΔDSM was able to predict affected requirements. This was identified by finding subsequent requirements in the engineering change notification documentation that the ΔDSM indicated might change.Copyright © 2010 by ASME
