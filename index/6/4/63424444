There are many software tools designed to support research activities such as data analysis and in silico experiments in the biotechnology field. This paper presents an adaptation of BioVel portal called "Laboratorio Virtual de Biotecnologia" (LVB), that can be used to introduce students to scientific workflows. The paper reports the preliminary results of a usability case study carried out on the Spanish version of this academic resource. This case study has three main stages: introduction, thinking aloud and closing. The paper suggests a set of services and functional requirements for the deployment of LVB in order to provide relevant services for biotechnology students.
