Who are the precursors in digital journalism research in Brazil? How many thesis and dissertations were already defended about this topic? What is the profile of these publications? These are some of the questions that we intend to answer in this article which proposes to outline a preliminary survey of the studies carried out during the first decade of development in this journalistic modality in the country. Our assumption is that there are four research clusters located in the Northeast, Center-west, Southeast and South regions of the country.
