It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Fourth ACM Workshop on Digital Identity Management -- DIM 2008. This year's symposium continues its tradition for being an important forum for exploring opportunities of, and issues with, digital identity. The aim of this year's workshop is to discuss issues and solutions concerning the use of identity and identity management systems in the context of services. As the competitive edge of the global economy is shifting to services delivered over the Internet, we need a way of making identity available on-demand to the services in an open, scalable, and secure manner. Identity for services is a holistic concern that must satisfy technology, regulatory and business needs for existing and emerging markets, such as Software as a Service (SaaS) and Service Oriented Architectures (SOA). Identity services should introduce consistency, efficiency and scalability in IT infrastructures built on the Internet to form the new "identity layer". Also, it should be easy for developers to incorporate identity services as part of distributed application logic. 
 
The call for papers attracted 20 submissions from Asia, Europe, and North America. The program committee accepted 12 papers that cover areas crossing over identity privacy and federation in the context of services as well as novel identity services. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners and facilitate further research and development in digital identity management.
