This year's workshop has received 15 high-quality submissions from a wide variety of contributors. Together with the program committee, we have selected a strong program of 9 papers that we believe will be of great interest to both researchers and practitioners. The accepted papers span a range of topics related to database testing, from new methods for synthetic data generation, to tools for system testing, to methodologies for measuring and improving the robustness of database engines and their test suites. We see the quality and variety of the submitted papers as continuing evidence that testing remains a crucial component in the development of modern data management systems.
