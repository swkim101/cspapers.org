The paradigm of cloud computing is currently revolutionizing our way of communicating and computing. It impacts and redefines how we store, retrieve, process, and share information in business and private settings. The fact that increasingly many systems and services rely on this paradigm increases our dependence on the security, privacy, availability, and robustness of the involved operations, components, and systems. 
 
The CCSW workshop aims to provide insights into the latest research and development activities on this topic. Its goal is to enable the sharing of information and knowledge on the latest advances in secure cloud and utility computing, outsourced computations, trusted computing and virtualization, among many other topics. 
 
In response to the call for papers, the program committee received a total of fifty-two high quality submissions. Due to the constraints of a one-day workshop, only thirteen out of the fifty-two were accepted. 
 
In addition to the technical program, the workshop featured keynotes by leading experts on cloud security: Burt Kaliski, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at Verisign; Kristin Lauter, Principal Researcher and Head of the Cryptography Group at Microsoft Research; and Howard Shrobe, Program Manager at DARPA.
