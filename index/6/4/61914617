It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2nd ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Online Social Networks -- WOSN'09. This year's workshop follows a successful start in 2008 by including 11 papers selected from 30 submissions by a wide ranging PC (with assistence from additional reviewers). We sought to expand the scope of last year's event to include a wider definition of the "social" part of social networks, as well as a deeper set of empirical work as the area becomes more mature. Last year's themes were money, applications, trust and mobility. This year's sessions are about privacy, structure, evolution and middleware, reflecting many of the users' and developers concerns as wider deployment of OSNs occurs.
