It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 4th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Wireless, focused on disruptive wireless technologies and systems that can enable orders of magnitude improvements in performance and novel wireless applications. Our goal is to provide a launching pad for bold and visionary ideas, and bring together experts in hardware, physical layer, networks, and systems to address core technical challenges in these emerging wireless technologies. HotWireless will provide a venue for debating future research agendas, technology trends, and application domains of wireless technology, and for presenting innovative and/or risky ideas that have potential for significant impact. 
 
The call for papers attracted submissions from Asia, Europe, and the United States. The program committee reviewed 16 submissions and accepted 10 technical papers to appear in the program. We also encourage attendees to attend the keynote and invited talk presentations. These valuable and insightful talks can and will guide us to a better understanding of the future:
