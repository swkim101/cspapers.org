For the purpose of obtaining the characteristic parameters of the asphalt mixture aggregate particles, a viable method using two-dimensional image was put forward in this paper. The automatic detection system of asphalt mixture aggregate characteristic parameters is developed based on VC++. A series of processing are done on the collected aggregate images, including image edge detection, image segmentation, morphological processing, region-labeling, contouring and so on .The region-labeling algorithm is improved ending with low complexity, high robustness. Database technology is used to deal with the storage, query of the results and several other operations. The whole system is characterized with perfect function, user-friendly interface and stable performance, which provides a practical and accurate method for the characteristic detection of asphalt mixture aggregate particles.
