Contemporary agent architectures combine deliberative and reactive components in a tiered structure. The reasoning behind this is that reactive systems provide good response time, while deliberative systems provide long-term planning, and more importantly, generativity. In this talk, I will argue that the reactive/deliberative distinction is a false dichotomy, and that, consequently, the rigidity of tiered architectures is actually counter-productive. I will then try to outline a space of alternative architectures, and give examples from working systems.
