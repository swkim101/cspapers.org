The theory of flow is prominent in game design. However, designing the user interface that will satisfy all players and preserve their state of flow is impossible for complex, multi-class oriented games such as World of Warcraft. Based on how players re-arrange the interface according to their own level of expertise, I propose an extension to the flow model by correlating interface complexity with both user experience and user expertise.
