In the context of reactor physics, one is often called to relate the physical properties of a medium to the statistics of the random trajectories of the neutrons flowing through it. For instance, Cauchyâ€™s formula establishes a link between the average length of the neutron paths (which is proportional to the medium opacity) and the volume-to-surface ratio of the traversed medium. In this work, we consider some extensions of such results for neutrons undergoing scattering, absorption and branching. A validation of the proposed formulas via Monte Carlo simulations is discussed.
