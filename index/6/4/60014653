There are three well known types of wire lines for transmitting electrical energy or information. The first type is ordinary two wires line (below A-Line). The second type is so-called single-wire line, where ground is in the role of the second wire. Polyphase systems belong to the third type; three phase system is the most popular among them. This article presents a new electric transmission system named B-Line which uses one line only and does not use ground.
