Welcome to ACM SIGCOMM 2013! 
 
This year's conference continues the SIGCOMM tradition of being the premier forum for the presentation of research on networking and communications. The technical program this year features a set of outstanding papers that cover a wide variety of areas including software defined networks, data center networks, wireless networks, content delivery, routing, congestion management, quality of service, security, privacy, measurement and analysis. 
 
This year's call for papers attracted 246 submissions from all over the world. The 35 member Technical Program Committee along with a selected group of external experts carefully considered all of the submissions over two rounds or reviewing -- including an author feedback period - with a total of 898 detailed reviews completed. The TPC meeting to select the final program was held on the campus of the University of Wisconsin - Madison in late April, 2013. At the conclusion of the meeting, the committee had assembled a wonderful program composed of 38 papers, to be presented over three days at the conference. The quality of submissions was extremely high as reflected in the final technical program. 
 
Following the TPC meeting, a subcommittee had the pleasure of selecting the best paper award winners. Five outstanding paper were considered as candidates for the award. After careful consideration, the paper entitled "Ambient Backscatter: Wireless Communication Out of Thin Air" by Vincent Liu, Aaron Parks, Vamsi Talla, Shyamnath Gollakota, David Wetherall and Joshua Smith received the Best Paper Award. Please join us in congratulating the authors!
