Introduces a novel operation and maintenance network capable of handling administration tasks pertaining to centralized operation and data management for ISDN exchanges. A particular aspect of the approach is the use of standardized communication protocols based on the OSI remote operation functions and application contexts including application layer protocol conversion facilities (gateways). Three heterogeneous ISDN exchange types in Switzerland (AXE, EWSD, System 12) will be supported. One single protocol type i.e. OSI remote operations covers all communication needs for all systems including bulk data transfer and remote interactive services, this in contrast to the traditional separation of various operation and maintenance protocol types. The protocols and gateways are now fully specified and the implementation of the first application for the billing data collection is in progress. From the beginning on, the underlying bearer network relies on the SWISSNET ISDN circuit switched services.
