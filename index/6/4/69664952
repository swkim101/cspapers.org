Multi-view clustering has received much attention recently. Most of the existing multi-view clustering methods only focus on one-sided clustering. As the co-occurring data elements involve the counts of sample-feature co-occurrences, it is more efficient to conduct two-sided clustering along the samples and features simultaneously. To take advantage of two-sided clustering for the co-occurrences in the scene of multi-view clustering, a two-sided multi-view clustering method is proposed, i.e., multi-view information-theoretic co-clustering (MV-ITCC). The proposed method realizes two-sided clustering for co-occurring multi-view data under the formulation of information theory. More specifically, it exploits the agreement and disagreement among views by sharing a common clustering results along the sample dimension and keeping the clustering results of each view specific along the feature dimension. In addition, the mechanism of maximum entropy is also adopted to control the importance of different views, which can give a right balance in leveraging the agreement and disagreement. Extensive experiments are conducted on text and image multiview datasets. The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.
