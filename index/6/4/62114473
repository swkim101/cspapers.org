A new collision source method has been developed to solve the Linear Boltzmann Equation (LBE) more efficiently by adaptation of the angular quadrature order. The angular adaptation method is unique in that the flux from each scattering source iteration is obtained separately, with potentially a different quadrature order. This allows for an optimal use of processing power, by using a high order quadrature for the first few iterations that need it, before shifting to lower order quadratures for the remaining iterations. This is essentially an extension of the first collision source method, and we call it the adaptive collision source method (ACS). The ACS methodolog y has been implemented in the TITAN discrete ordinates code, and has shown a speedup of 2-3 on a test problem, with very little loss of accuracy (within a provided adaptive tolerance). Further, the code has been extended to work in parallel environments by angular decomposition. Although the method requires increased parallel communication, tests have shown excellent scalability, with parallel fractions of up to 99%.
