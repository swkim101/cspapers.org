The arrival of modern and more complex processors (e.g., use of caches, multi-and many-core processors) increases the timing variability of tasks, i.e., the worst case execution time (WCET) is becoming significantly larger, while the probability of appearance of a worst case execution time is extremely low. Approaches taking into account this probability have been the topic of last years research by defining the probabilistic worst case execution time of a task as a probabilistic bound on all execution time scenarios. Existing measurement-based approaches consider the execution of the tasks in isolation and our contribution provides hints for accounting OS costs.
