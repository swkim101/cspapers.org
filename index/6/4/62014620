It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 2012 ACM Workshop on Medical Communication Systems -- MedCOMM 2012. This goal of MedCOMM is to introduce SIGCOMM researchers to challenging open research problems in medical communication systems and to spark ideas for wireless communication, software radios, and networking. 
 
There is an increasing trend toward the convergence of wireless communication, Internet connectivity, and medicine. Devices with advanced computer communication range from bodyworn health monitors to implantable medical devices to remote robotic medical devices in the battlefield. A growing list of such devices includes artificial vision, brain-computer interfaces for prosthetics, cardiac monitors, defibrillators, digital mammography, glucose monitors, infusion pumps, insulin pumps, neurostimulators, pacemakers, radiological electronic picture archiving and communication systems, and smart stents. All these systems depend on the safe, effective, reliable, and secure communication and computer networking. Advanced research on medical communication systems will help innovators of next-generation medical technologies that aim to improve public health in the digital age. 
 
The program includes eight invited talks and two workshop papers. Our distinguished speakers are leaders in their respective fields ranging from electromagnetic interference to biomedical engineering.
