A discussion is given on some optimization strategies and performance evaluations of the two-phase commit protocol, which insures, even in case of failures, the atomicity of updates executed on different sites by a distributed transaction. The performance evaluations have been realized by simulation runs using the queueing network tool QNAP2 from INRIA/Simulog and compared with theoretical costs. This study has been performed in the context of INRIA involvement in ISO WG5 work on OSI-TP. >
