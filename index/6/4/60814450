It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2nd International Workshop on Ultra-Large-Scale Software-Intensive Systems -- ULSSIS'08. This year's workshop continues to provide a forum for the software engineering research community to come together to discuss emerging ideas in the area of Ultra-Large-Scale (ULS) Systems. The primary goal of this workshop is to make progress toward a research agenda and a set of promising research directions for ULS systems, and to build an international research community in this area.
