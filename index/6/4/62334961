Understanding human error is an important part of making good choices about interaction design. In this paper we report an innovative approach to the teaching of human error. Errordiary is an online repository of the funny, frustrating and sometimes fatal human errors that happen on a daily basis. Students engage with these real-life cases of human error and are challenged to classify them. This raises awareness of everyday human error, teaches students about the psychology of human error, and gives students the experience of dealing with the difficulties of applying classification schemes to real world data.
