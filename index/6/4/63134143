In 2007 we presented a paper that described the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translation (MT) for the automated translation of process build instructions from English to other languages to support Ford's assembly plants in non-English speaking countries. This project has continued to evolve with the addition of new languages and improvements to the translation process. However, we discovered that there was a large demand for automated language translation across all of Ford Motor Company and we decided to expand the scope of our project to address these requirements. This paper will describe our efforts to meet all of Ford's internal translation requirements with AI and MT technology and focus on the challenges and lessons that we learned from applying advanced technology across an entire corporation.
