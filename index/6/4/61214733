Welcome to ACM SIGMETRICS 2010! And to the city so nice, they named it twice. 
 
This year's conference continues the rich SIGMETRICS tradition of being the premier forum for the presentation of research on the measurement and modeling of computer systems. The technical program for 2010 features a set of outstanding papers that covers both theory and applications from a wide variety of areas, including dynamics and control, load balancing, measurement, network traffic, optimization, performance modeling and analysis, resource allocation, scheduling, sensor and wireless networks, and systems, among others. 
 
This year's call for papers attracted 184 submissions from all over the world (and a few beyond). The 90 member Technical Program Committee along with a selected group of external experts carefully considered all of the submissions with a total of 716 detailed reviews completed. The TPC meeting to select the final program was held on the campus of Columbia University in mid January, 2010. At the conclusion of the meeting, the committee had assembled a wonderful program composed of 29 papers and 20 posters, to be presented over three days at the conference. The quality of submissions was extremely high as reflected in the final technical program. 
 
Following the TPC meeting, a subcommittee had the pleasure (yet very difficult task) of selecting the best paper award winners. The paper entitled "Load Balancing via Randomized Local Search in Closed and Open Systems" by A. Ganesh, S. Lilienthal, D. Manjunath, A. Proutiere and F. Simatos received the Best Paper Award. The paper entitled "Distributed Sensor Network Localization from Local Connectivity: Performance Analysis for the HOP-TERRAIN Algorithm" by A. Karbasi and S. Oh received the Kenneth C. Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Award. Please join us in congratulating the authors!
