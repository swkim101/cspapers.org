An intelligent system has been developed and applied to the design of mechanical transmissions. Within the system, knowledge and expertise about the application has been encapsulated in several forms, including artificial neural networks. The applications to which the artificial neural networks are applied and the knowledge contained are described, together with an automated training approach incorporating a genetic algorithm.
