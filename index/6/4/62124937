The paper describes how we designed and prototyped HandJive, a haptic device for interpersonal entertainment. Handlive is notable because it relies entirely on haptic input and output. The design process included typical steps such as analyzing user needs and performing iterative prototyping 2nd testing. However, developing a haptic interface like HandJive also presented special challenges, such as creating rapid physical prototypes that could withstand abuse, developing a preliminary system of haptic interaction, and testing haptic interfaces through low-tech prototypes.
