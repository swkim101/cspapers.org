This paper presents a semantic approach for human-robot interaction in ambient intelligence environments (AmI). This approach is intended to provide a natural way for multimodal interactions between human and artificial agents embodied in cognitive companion robots or in any AmI smart device. It is applied for building cognitive assistance services based on the semantic observation and communication. The main contribution of this paper concerns the proposition of a semantic module, that allows, on the one hand, converting natural language dialogues to formal n-ary ontology knowledge, and on the other hand, making semantic inference on this knowledge to drive the dialogues and trigger actions. The target ontology language is NKRL (Narrative Knowledge Representation Language). This latter provides a semantic formal basis allowing narrative representation and reasoning on complex contexts by building spatio-temporal relationships between events. A scenario dedicated to the monitoring and assistance at home of elderly people is presented to validate the proposed approach.
