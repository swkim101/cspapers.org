Deduced the formula for calculating the circular frequency and its applicable conditions and validated by the data. The method of calculating the frequency of the spring mass and the mass m/M of the vibrator is deduced accurately and the method of approximation is solved in other literatures. The matlab program is used to analyze the vibrations of the spring vibrator in multi-order harmonic motion.
