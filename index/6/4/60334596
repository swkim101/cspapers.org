Mixed-initiative discussion requires that a tutorial program have the means to manage its share of the dialogue. Dialogue management includes operations ranging from record keeping and context focusing to heuristics for directing the dialogue economically according to the needs of the student. This paper illustrates how knowledge for generating remarks in a tutorial dialogue about rule-based domain knowledge can be represented conceptually as a network consisting of transitions between dialogue situations in which the links are various kinds of management heuristics. The chief finding is that a network of procedures is a useful representation for organizing heuristics for carrying on a structured dialogue.
