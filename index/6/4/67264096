Welcome to ACM SIGCOMM 2014! 
 
This year's conference continues the SIGCOMM tradition of being the premier forum for the presentation of research on networking and communications. The technical program this year features a set of outstanding papers that cover a wide variety of areas including network architecture, software defined networks, data center networks, wireless networks, network services, congestion management, security, privacy, measurement and analysis. 
 
This year's call for papers attracted 242 submissions from all over the world. The 54 member Technical Program Committee along with a selected group of external experts carefully considered all of the submissions over two rounds of reviewing including an author feedback period - with a total of 968 detailed reviews completed. The TPC meeting to select the final program was held at ICSI, Berkeley, in late April 2014. At the conclusion of the meeting, the committee had assembled a wonderful program composed of 45 papers, to be presented over three days at the conference. The quality of submissions was extremely high as reflected in the final technical program.
