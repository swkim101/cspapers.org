Based upon a nine-node transputer network consisting of T414-15 modules interconnected in a pipeline, the authors have developed real-time software in Occam which can be configured to a number of topologies like ring, mesh etc. with the help of a static switch. The authors describe a verification methodology of an embedded message based distributed real-time software that has some unique characteristics of its own. In order to verify that the real-time concurrent software is free from errors like Ivelock, deadlock etc. and to test each module for its desired performance, the authors have chosen a version of petrinets called Occamnet as their design and verification tool. An analysis based on a type of net which corresponds to various constructs of Occam is used, and the structure of the total system kernel is arrived at in a hierarchical manner.
