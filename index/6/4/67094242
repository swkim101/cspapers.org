With inter-floor noise dispute at the apartment houses or the multiplex houses emerging rapidly as a serious social issue, the number of civil suits is also increasing. The core idea of digital forensics is to digitize the evidential materials or data and use them intelligently. Communications technology, analyses of power equipments, and analysis tools are systematically combined here to collect evidences to allow police and prosecutors to analyze the evidences conveniently. However, one of the major problems which the researchers of inter-floor noises and the judicial officers are facing at the moment is that these evidence-collecting tools are expensive and the residents have to vacate their rooms while evidences are being collected. Since so many elements are complexly involved in the problem of inter-floor noises, it is quite difficult to conduct analysis directly at the site or build an analytical model so that in many cases evidences collections are outsourced to the expert-led private enterprises, ending up with a large bill. Thus, a design of the system with which the clients can check the noises by themselves in a simple and easier way and utilize it just like a vehicle black box is introduced in this study. The system includes the UML implemented with Java Android and a patent will be filed for the design, and at the same time, commercialization is considered. In addition to designing and implementing a scalable digital forensics system for inter-floor noise measuring, the Java Android models have been implemented for respective elements as well. The systemâ€™s performance was evaluated prior to the actual application and the results confirmed that it worked flexibly in an experimental circumstance
