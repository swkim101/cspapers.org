This present work deliberately abandons the purpose of capturing the global resemblance between languages and the ambition of giving a rational foundation to probability of changes in linguistics, to focus instead on cladistic approach, which was applied to different dialects and data (gallo-romance, southern italo-romance) through an original coding of philological derivations. Results show good congruence with linguistic classification and provide new insight on how tackle various dialectological problems as borrowings.
