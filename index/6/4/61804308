The picture quality of an underwater image affected by several factors, e.g. light absorption, turbidity, structure less environment and scattering effects etc. The quality enhancements of underwater images were previously performed by using contrast and filtering method separately. In this paper, stretching and filtering both techniques are applied to improve the quality of underwater images. This approach significantly improved the quality of underwater images and the results of subjective and objective predefined parameters of test images are compared with proposed and other available methods.
