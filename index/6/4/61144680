In order to reduce the response time when simulating large reactors in detail, we have developed a parallel version of the thermal-hydraulic subchannel code COBRA-TF, with standard message passing technology (MPI). The parallelization is oriented to reactor cells, so it is best suited for models consisting of many cells. The generation of the Jacobian is parallelized, in such a way that each processor is in charge of generating the data associated to a subset of cells. Also, the solution of the linear system of equations is done in parallel, using the PETSc toolkit.
