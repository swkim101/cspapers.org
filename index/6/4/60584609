In 1978, Merkle and Hellman introduced a knapsack-based public-key cryptosystem, which received widespread attention. The two major open problems concerning this cryptosystem are: (i) Security: How difficult are the Merkle-Hellman knapsacks? (ii) Efficiency: Can the huge key size be reduced? In this paper we analyze the cryptographic security of knapsack problems with small keys, develop a new (non-enumerative)type of algorithm for solving them, and use the algorithm to show that under certain assumptions it is as difficult to find the hidden trapdoors in Merkle-Hellman knapsacks as it is to solve general knapsack problems.
