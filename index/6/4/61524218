We present an automated method to aid a Decision Maker (DM) in selecting the ‘most preferred’ from a set of design alternatives. The method assumes that the DM’s preferences reflect an implicit value function that is quasi-concave. The method is iterative, using three approaches in sequence to eliminate lower-value alternatives at each trial design. The method is interactive, with the DM stating preferences in the form of attribute tradeoffs at each trial design. We present an approach for finding a new trial design at each iteration. We provide an example, the design selection for a cordless electric drill, to demonstrate the method.Copyright © 2002 by ASME
