It is our great pleasure to welcome you all to the 3rd Workshop on Information Credibility on the Web (WICOW'09) organized in conjunction with the 18th World Wide Web Conference in Madrid, Spain. The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum for discussion on various issues related to information credibility criteria and the process of its evaluation. 
 
The web has started to play an important role for many people in delivering information related to their personal and professional lives. However, the quality control of web content is inadequate. This calls for methodologies that would facilitate judging the trustworthiness of content on the web. Evaluating and improving information credibility requires combination of different technologies and backgrounds. Through the series of WICOW workshops we hope to exchange novel ideas and findings as well as promote discussions on various aspects of information credibility on the Web. We believe that the potential benefits of successful research outcomes should become valuable for the society. 
 
This year we have received 19 submissions from 10 countries: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands and USA. After a careful review process, with at least three reviews for each paper the Program Committee has selected 9 full papers covering a variety of topics related to information credibility. The accepted papers were thematically grouped into 4 sessions: "Evaluating Credibility of Digital Resources", "Quality of Web 2.0 Content", "Information Aggregation and Comparison" and "Vendor and Product Reputation". We are also pleased to invite Ricardo Baeza-Yates from Yahoo! Research for giving a keynote talk entitled: "User Generated Content: How Good it is?"
