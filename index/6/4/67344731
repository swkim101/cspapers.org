Several mega trends are converging giving rise to the reality of the wide spread commercialization of location based Travel/Tourism systems. Tourism is both a leading revenue generator worldwide and an umbrella industry that enhances regional, SME, cultural, sports and many other industry sectors. It is in essence an information-based industry that is emerging from a sluggish 2002. Location Based Tourism Systems (LBTS) are computerized systems that depend on the automated detection of the location of a target (e.g. a tourist on the move, a tour vehicle) to either deliver or collect information. Currently mobile phones are seen as the obvious (but not the only) means of information delivery/collection for LBTS applications and this technology has considerable potential for the Australian tourism industry. This paper aims to assess the state of knowledge regarding LBTS applications, present a range of applications from around the globe, classify the applications into a schema and then explore potential LBTS applications. Findings show that three types of applications are emerging into the market space, consumer revenue generation applications, supplier applications and information provision portal type applications. It is apparent much innovation is taking place with LBTS development and the emergent LBTS application market is seeking to create revenue from the convergence of the Internet access, cell phone ubiquity and tourism. ,
