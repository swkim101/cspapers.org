In this paper, we introduced an effective time delay model for SRAM compiler, which represents an important performance of SRAM. Our method divide the delay time into several periods, including decoder delay, word line delay, bit line delay and SA delay. The theory is useful in predicting the delay time when the SRAM size is changed. Simulations by Hsim in 65nm CMOS process proves a high accuracy.
