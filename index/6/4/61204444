Development of products that thoroughly integrate lifecycle design factors requires the simultaneous clarification and evaluation of numerous design elements. When such product development problems are treated as design optimization problems, these elements are expressed by decision variables, constraint functions and objective functions. The existence of complex relationships among such design elements increases the difficulty of formulating the problem model and conducting straightforward searches for optimal solutions. This study presents a method for representing design alternatives that have subordinate relationships, using hierarchical genotypes. Constraint relationships of alternatives are clarified using constraint matrices which are also transformed to hierarchical genotypes. Furthermore, the efficiency of different genotype structures is compared using numerical experimentations. Based on the experimental results, a procedure for constructing optimal hierarchical genotypes is proposed.Â© 2002 ASME
