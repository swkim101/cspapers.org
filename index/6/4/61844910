Energy represents fifteen per cent of the production costs associated with paper manufacture. In 1989 UK Paper's New Thames Mill, the UK's largest producer of high quality printing/photocopying paper, undertook a number of energy related studies using Brighton Polytechnic's Control and Dynamics Research Department for technical support. The authors detail work carried out to ascertain the extent to which a number of quality and process parameters affect steam consumption in the dryer section of the paper machine (J. Grant et al., 1978). A number of energy reduction strategies are then proposed and discussed.
