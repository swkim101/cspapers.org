This paper describes the postgraduate course in Computer Management Studies given to students from developing countries at University College London. A brief historical introduction is followed by a discussion of the objectives and philosophy of the course; our experiences of the problems encountered by the students on the course, both before they arrive in London and while resident in London, are described. Our proposals for an improved, but probably shorter, course are followed by syllabuses and statistics relating to participants.
