This position paper presents a model-driven generative approach for composing concrete syntax. Concrete syntax is generated from information contained in a business model (represented with UML class diagrams) and from textual templates (represented in a composition model). The approach was originally implemented in the context of Web engineering (generation of HTML text) and was latter applied to paper catalogue generation (generation of QuarkXpress textual serialization format). Our contribution to the workshop would be to discuss how our approach could be applied to model generative programming, to gather feedback and to foster the discussion.
