The Sequences either Protein or DNA contain precious Biological Information of certain species for finding/knowing various characteristics of living organisms [5]. If a pair of sequence is not properly aligned, we cannot get exact information to study about these species. It is important to find the degree of similarity and no. of gaps in sequences. Sequences not properly aligned with or without consideration of gaps cannot provide a true picture of what information they owe and what characteristics they have [1, 2]. 
 
A recursive approach is being proposed in this paper that would not only find the Global Alignment for a pair of protein/DNA sequence but also provides means for consideration of gaps between them. The algorithm will calculate the degree of similarity and bounds/extends of gaps to bring sophisticated results. The input variables (e.g. Strains) of program are user dependent and internal calculations are being performed in recursive fashion to make the input Strains smart enough [4].
