A scenario is envisaged in which agents have tasks to perform and are in a position to exchange tasks to improve their performance, and thus perhaps affect the overall performance of the system. Our model uses two computing machines with their usual resources, and with random initial jobs to be processed. Their performance is dependent not only on absolute total load but also on how much of each machine's resources are in demand, thus giving scope for the beneficial exchange of jobs. This paper describes the development of a negotiation mechanism and a greedy method is used as a heuristic for job exchange between machines and measurement of system performance. The concept may be extended to multiple machines that act as agents exchanging resources and tasks.
