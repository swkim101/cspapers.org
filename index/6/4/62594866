An information system that works in one application and environment may not work in another. Successful adoption of information systems requires that the organization evaluate candidates to ensure that they satisfy intended goals and consider the backgrounds and capabilities of the users. This paper describes an approach for evaluating and implementing information systems that satisfy technical requirements and organizational goals. Integral to this approach is the use of an assessment instrument consisting of objective-driven rubrics that are redundant to ensure consistency. This approach is applied in an NSF-supported CI-TEAM project to evaluate candidate systems to support an online cyber-collaboratory to enhance product dissection and reverse engineering activities in the classroom and to suggest improvements for the next generation system.Copyright Â© 2009 by ASME
