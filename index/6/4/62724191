This paper presents a study on the sensitivity of the dynamics of parallel kinematic mechanisms (PKMs) and their effects on the system identification of inertial parameters. Comparing the sensitivity of the individual terms in the equations of motion, a delineation of areas prone to convergence errors in the presence of measurement noise and design parameter variations can be characterized. The design parameter variations evaluated were the strut masses, platform mass, joint location errors and friction. Comparative observations are made using sample trajectory based characterizations. Detailed results are presented for the University of Florida Special 6-6 PKM.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
