Today, smart cards are widely ingrained in human life and its use in various applications for authentication, Storage and processing of sensitive information is inevitable. One of the most important parts in the design of smart cards is their operating system, in more precisely their file management system. In this paper, Design and implementation of a secure and dynamic file management system, that we call SDFS, for Java cards will be evaluated. The SDFS has high compatibility with international standards ISO/IEC 7816 that enable it to use in different operating systems that designed for java cards. To enhance system performance in different uses and future developments, SDFS is completely designed modular. Modular design provides easy configuration for developers in different situations. SDFS by using secure cryptographic protocols provides security of storing and processing of information for users. Implementation results in NetBeans IDE 7.2 show high efficiency and security of new file system in practical usage.
