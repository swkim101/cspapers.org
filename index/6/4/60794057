This paper outlines the need and describes the design of a modular software library and configurable and extensible framework built to support research into developing design automation techniques and methods for use during the early stages of design. Simple examples are provided to illustrate the extensibility and configurability of the complete system and a brief comparison of features is made with other existing systems. Lastly, a few preliminary results are provided to demonstrate the early potential of the system.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
