It is commonplace to build facilities into operating systems to handle faults which occur in user-level programs. These facilities are often inadequate for their task; some faults or incidents are regarded as so bad that the user cannot be allowed to act on them and this makes it difficult or impossible to write subsystems which give proper diagnostics in all cases, or which are adequately secure, or which are adequately robust. This paper looks into why there is a need for very complete facilities and why there is a problem about providing them, and proposes an outline structure which could be used.
