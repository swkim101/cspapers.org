For the test problem of command and control mode for the attack of time-sensitive targets, this paper proposed a test method for command and control modes for the attack of time-sensitive targets based on Agent, then in the attack of time-sensitive targets as the background, established decider, sensor and shooter of three agents, and combined with three different command and control model, established the operation rules of different Agents. On the basis, constructed simulation test platform, carried out multiple sets of tests, and analyzed the test data.
