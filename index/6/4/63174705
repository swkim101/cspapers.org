In this paper, we present a method of a synthesis of adaptive schedulers for real-time embedded systems. We assume that the system is implemented using a multi-core embedded processor with low-power processing capabilities. First, the developmental genetic programming is used to generate the scheduler and the initial schedule. Then during the system execution, the scheduler modifies the schedule whenever the execution time of the recently finished task has been shorter or longer than expected. The goal of rescheduling is to minimize the power consumption while all time constraints will be satisfied. We present a real-life example as well as some experimental results showing the advantages of the method.
