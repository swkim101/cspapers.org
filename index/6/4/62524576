The use of an existing simulation in this way is not itself novel. Existing work on the same lines (Tveldt and Collofello 1995; Haberlein, 2003) use Abdel-Hamid and Madnickâ€™s model (1991) as a base. However, they are examining the effect on a single development project as against the longer-term effect over many years and many releases considered here. In addition, the latter is a complex model, with many variables and a considerable number of inputs to calibrate. The base model presented here is intended to be as simple as possible whilst allowing the crucial variables to be manipulated. The simplicity has a number of advantages:
