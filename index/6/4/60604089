It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 3rd ACM Workshop on Security of Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks (SASN'05), held in conjunction with the 12th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS'05), November 7, 2005, in Alexandria, Virginia.This year we received a total of 39 submissions on various aspects of ad-hoc and sensor network security. The program committee selected 6 as regular papers that cover a variety of topics, including trust establishment in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs), security of vehicular ad-hoc networks, secure group communication, key pre-distribution for sensor networks, jamming attacks against sensor network MAC protocols, and defense against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. This year we continue the tradition of SASN'03 and SASN'04 to encourage the presentation and discussion of work-in-progress on ad-hoc and sensor network security. Among the 39 submissions, the program committee selected 7 papers to present in work-in-progress sessions, covering topics on anonymous routing for MANETs, key distribution for inter-group multicast in ad-hoc networks, improved topology assumptions for threshold cryptography in MANETs, RFID security, tracing in mobile wireless sensor networks, time synchronization attacks in sensor networks, and coordinated deployment for improving secure communications and sensing coverage in wireless sensor networks. In addition, the program includes a panel on Advances in Sensor and Ad-hoc Network Security and an invited keynote talk by Radha Poovandran (University of Washington) on Information Assurance in MANETs and Wireless Sensor Networks. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for security researchers and developers.
