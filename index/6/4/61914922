In many areas of human enterprise, private as well as professional, individuals shape their actions and choices based on lessons learned from their past experiences. Reflection has a particular significance for individuals with chronic diseases, such diabetes. Due to the high individual differences between cases, each affected individual must find the optimal combination of lifestyle alterations and medication through reflective analysis of personal diseases history. Computing technologies, specifically ubiquitous and pervasive computing, strive to assist individuals in this daunting task by helping them to record relevant experiences and analyze the captured records for trends and correlations. However, these applications often minimize individuals’ involvement with data capture. Instead, they rely on sensor networks, biosensors, and other automated capture mechanisms. In this dissertation I argue that excluding individuals from the monitoring process often leads to their disengagement from learning. In contrast, engaging individuals in proactive capture of relevant data helps them adopt a proactive attitude towards learning and enrich their understanding of their disease. I propose that computing for reflection should promote individuals’ engagement in reflection by exploiting breakdowns in individuals’ routines or understanding, support continuity in thinking that leads to a systematic refinement of ideas, and support articulation of thoughts and understanding that helps to transform insights into knowledge. I support my claims with the empirical evidence gathered during the design and deployment of three ubiquitous computing applications that support reflection in diabetes management.
