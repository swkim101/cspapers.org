A reactive gaseous mixture which reacts in a localized heating zone to form a glass deposit on the inner wall of a tube is made to flow along the tube, and in the heating zone it is channelled around a cylindrical element which occupies much of the bore of the tube. The glass deposit is used for making glass fibres for telecommunications.
