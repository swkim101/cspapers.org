A real time control system was established for controlling the process of glutamic acid fermentation. A set of dynamics models was used to predict the concentrations of cell mass, sugar and product in culture, which are impossible of measurement online at present. An intelligent logical control algorithm was proposed to control pH and dissolved oxygen. The setting points of some manipulated variables in this system were determined online based on prediction and operators' experienced criteria. This system was verified on steadily yield by 28l fermentor of the laboratory. >
