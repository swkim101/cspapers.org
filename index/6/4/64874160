Many important and critical applications such as surveillance or healthcare require some form of (human) activity recognition. Activities are usually represented by a series of actions driven and triggered by events. Recognition systems have to be real time, reactive, correct, complete, and dependable. These stringent requirements justify the use of formal methods to describe, analyze, verify, and generate effective recognition systems. Due to the large number of possible application domains, the researchers aim at building a generic recognition system. They choose the synchronous approach because it has a well-founded semantics and it ensures determinism and safe parallel composition. They propose a new language to represent activities as synchronous automata and they supply it with two complementary formal semantics. First a behavioral semantics gives a reference definition of program behavior using rewriting rules. Second, an equational semantics describes the behavior in a constructive way and can be directly implemented. This paper focuses on the description of these two semantics and their relation.
