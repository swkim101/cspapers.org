In language education, little attention has been paid to the importance of variations of a language. However, knowing standard forms is not sufficient for understanding the target language in real situations. That is why when we learn a target language; we have to pay attention to its linguistic variations. It is believed that e-learning is the most appropriate means of teaching and learning those dialects, because it can offer multiple speaking contexts in the same time and space. This paper gives a brief idea of building e-learning applications that are capable of teaching and learning not only standard, but also variations of a language.
