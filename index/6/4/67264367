Welcome to the first workshop on Interactions of NVM/Flash with Operating Systems and Workloads, INFLOW2013. The motivation behind INFLOW was to bring together researchers and practitioners working in systems across the hardware/software stack, who are interested in the cross-cutting issues of NVM/Flash technologies, operating systems, and emerging workloads.
