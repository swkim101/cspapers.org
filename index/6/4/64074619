A system that can generate biological brain information processing mechanism more precisely may have several abilities such as exact cognition, situation decision, learning and inference and prediction. In this paper, in order to implement high level information processing and thinking ability in a complex system, the information processing layer based on the biological brain is introduced. The biological brain information processing mechanism, which is analyzed in this paper, provides fundamental information about intelligent engineering system, and the design of the layer that can mimic the functions of a brain through engineering definitions can efficiently introduce an intelligent information processing method having a consistent flow in various engineering systems. The applications proposed in this paper are expected to take several roles as a unified model that generates information process in various areas, such as engineering and medical field, with a dream of implementing humanoid artificial intelligent system.
