A new AutoCAD/VisualLISP based method to substitute the 3D tool radius compensation in Z axis for CNC milling processes is here described. Specific features of VisualLISP programming language combined with AutoCAD facilities are used to gather the data about the part to be machined and then to compute the points the tool should be driven to in order to perform an accurate cutting process. A sample that proves the rightness of the method is finally provided.
