Graffiti is not an unusual object in Communication studies. However, there is a certain naturalization of the debate on the subject. In the majority of the works that, since the 1980s, have been dedicated to the subject, graffiti is understood as a typical communicational form of the city environment. In other cases, less numerous, graffiti is generically equalized to some media forms (such as cartoons and music videos, for example). Anyway, in both perspectives, we donâ€™t have the perception that a communicational other, in a much more specific sense, is probably being engendered in the history of graffiti.
