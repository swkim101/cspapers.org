In order to grasp the related information and parameters needed by the tree growth, and management, establish the authentic decision-making model of tree growth management using the effective resource information, the resource information of tree growth management are investigated from the perspective of ontology and knowledge base technology. The paper introduces the ontology and knowledge base technology, adopts the knowledge organizing pattern based on ontology, studies the structure and technique of knowledge of tree growth management, the ontology is regarded as the knowledge organizing pattern to establish the open knowledge base of tree growth management, and constructs the management model of tree growth. Practice has proved that the research and application of ontology in the resource information of tree growth management has important value for the model construction of tree growth management, achieves the sharing of resource information of tree growth management.
