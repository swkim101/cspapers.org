In gaming industry, Cloud Gaming is a new form of gaming service on trend trying to serve millions of players around the world with novel gaming experience. It aims to provide high-quality gaming service at any device, including thin clients which are incapable of handling high-definition gaming softwares. Players are only required to use any device that can connect to cloud servers for receiving streaming data through network and display game contents. Ideally Cloud Gaming is a promising service of providing novel gaming experience but in reality, various technological barriers make Cloud Gaming not comprehensively feasible for every type of game, such as first person shooting game which requires fast responsiveness. In addition, most existing cloud service, which streams encoded video sequence back to the client, is difficult to catch up with the rising demands for graphic quality. In this thesis, the proposed hybrid game contents streaming method aims at improving graphic quality delivered from Cloud Gaming. Game contents streamed from cloud server are split into two parts, as one part is streamed as video sequence. Another part, which is streamed as graphic commands, is for rendering job to be performed at the client side. The locally rendered game contents are then displayed accordingly together with the contents streamed as video sequence. By taking the advantage of distributing rendering operation, the combined computing power is expected to produce better graphic quality. ∗Master’s Thesis, Department of Information Systems, Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, NAIST-IS-MT1351203, February 5, 2015.
