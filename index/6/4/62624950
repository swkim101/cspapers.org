In this paper, a kind of particle transport random walk system under the emission point as a sampling station is built. Then, an adaptive sampling scheme which aims to get better solution with the achieved information is derived. The numerical results show that the adaptive scheme could overcome the difficulty of underestimation to the result in some degree, and the adaptive importance sampling method gets satisfactory results as well.
