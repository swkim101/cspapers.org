We investigate how FEC (Forward Error Correction) can be combined with ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) to achieve scalable reliable multicast transmission. We consider the two scenarios where FEC is introduced as a transparent layer underneath a reliable multicast layer that uses ARQ, and where FEC and ARQ are both integrated into a single layer that uses the retransmission of parity data to recover from the loss of original data packets.To evaluate the performance improvements due to FEC, we consider different types of loss behaviors (spatially or temporally correlated loss, homogeneous or heterogeneous loss) and loss rates for up to 106 receivers. Our results show that introducing FEC as a layer below ARQ can improve multicast transmission efficiency and scalability and that there are substantial additional improvements when the two are integrated.
