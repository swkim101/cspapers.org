It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Workshop on Information Retrieval in Peer-to-Peer Networks -- P2PIR 2006. This year's workshop is a team effort which continues the tradition of past workshops, the Workshop on Information Retrieval in Peer-to-Peer Networks which was collocated with SIGIR in 2004 and with CIKM in 2005, and the Workshop on Heterogeneous Distributed Information Retrieval collocated with SIGIR in 2005. The mission of the workshop is to excite and promote research in the area of information retrieval in distributed and decentralized environments in order to design solutions for next-generation search engines that will have to deal with huge amounts of heterogeneous and continuously changing data.The call for papers attracted 13 submissions from Asia, Europe, and the United States. The program committee accepted 7 scientific papers that cover a variety of topics related to distributed and peer-to-peer information retrieval. The papers present original and novel solutions for resource selection and query routing, indexing techniques in decentralized environments, and architectures and implementations of truly-distributed retrieval engines.
