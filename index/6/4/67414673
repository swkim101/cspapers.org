This paper presents combined haptic and visual system for teleoperation over Internet. An example of force feedback in haptic interface is given. The system enables operator to have independent haptic and visual sensing and also their synergy. Due to un-predictive nature of the Internet it is not possible to generalize and compare time delay. Special attention is given to robot vision part of the system. Wavelet motion field is introduced and method for interpolation of wavelet coefficient is presented. Some aspects of robot control over Internet are discussed.
