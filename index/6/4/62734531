End hosts in today's Internet have the best knowledge of the type of traffic they should receive, but they play no active role in traffic engineering. Traffic engineering is conducted by ISPs, which unfortunately are blind to specific user needs. End hosts are therefore subject to unwanted traffic, particularly from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This research proposes a new system called DrawBridge to address this traffic engineering dilemma. By realizing the potential of software-defined networking (SDN), in this research we investigate a solution that enables end hosts to use their knowledge of desired traffic to improve traffic engineering during DDoS attacks.
