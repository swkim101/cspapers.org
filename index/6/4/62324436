It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the First International Workshop on Information Hiding and its Criteria for evaluation---IWIHC2014. Copyright protection has become an important issue due to the growing amount of illegal content being distributed all over the world. Digital watermarking is a significant technology in order to prevent dissemination of illegal content. However, there has not been any establishment for evaluation criteria for digital watermarking. Many of the existing proposals for digital watermarking are impractical, and the required performance level of digital watermarking in order to attain practical use targets are not widely known. The IHC (Information Hiding Criteria) Committee is working to improve this situation through the use of watermark technologies. In particular, it aims to support the development of standard evaluation criteria, sponsoring watermark competitions based on these criteria in order to promote the development of protection measures for the content industry. This workshop aims not only for clarifying the performance of digital watermarking, but also creating higher level of technology through international competition. 
 
This is the first IHC international workshop, though we have already held two local workshops in Japan. Every year, the evaluation criteria for digital watermarking become stricter; this is reflected in the workshop and competition guidelines. Next year, the competition standards will be even more rigorous.
