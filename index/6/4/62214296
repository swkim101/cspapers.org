A challenging research issue in high speed networking is how to control the transmission rate of statistical data flows. This paper describes a new algorithm, VirtualClock, for data traffic control in high-speed networks. VirtualClock maintains the statistical multiplexing flexibility of pocket switching while ensuring each data flow its reserved average throughput rate at the same time. The algorithm has been tested through simulation.
