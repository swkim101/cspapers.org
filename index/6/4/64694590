The prediction of the power load is a complicated, nonlinear and affected by many factors question. In this article, the author uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to filter specific numbers principal components at first. After that, BP neural network is applied to forecast short term power load by the principal components. The results finally show the method is accurate and reliable.
