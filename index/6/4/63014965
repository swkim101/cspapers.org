This paper describes an initial experiment that investigates the use of multimodal metaphors (text, graphic and speech) in e-learning application. The aim of this experiment is to compare the efficiency of these metaphors regard to task accomplishment time and the number of errors that occurred during the experiment. In order to carry out this comparative investigation, two experimental interfaces were built. The experiment was divided into two independent groups, each group consisted 22 participants. The first interface, a combination of multimodal metaphors (text, graphic and speech) was used and tested by the experimental group of users and the second interface used text only metaphors and evaluated by the control group of users. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two groups and each of the participants individually had to accomplish a number of tasks. The experiment time was recorded for each task and for the overall experiment too. The number of questions and errors was recorded for all tasks. The results obtained from the experiment showed that the experimental interfaces were more usable in comparison with the textual interface.
