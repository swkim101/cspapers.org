We are pleased to welcome you to the fifth ACM Workshop on Mobile Cloud Computing and Services, co-located with ACM MobiSys 2014. 
 
The workshop had an open call for papers; the TPC Co-chairs and TPC members also reached out to their colleagues for potential invited papers. In the end, all authors opted for the open call and all submissions underwent the standard peer review process by the TPC. We received nine submissions. The reviews were double-blind but we allowed the authors to disclose their identities if they so preferred. Each submission received at least four reviews in a single round; most submissions received five. This was followed by on-line and email discussion by the reviewers to reach a consensus. One of the submissions was co-authored by a TPC Co-chair and was therefore handled by the other Co-chair out of the band. The reviewers were instructed that the submission should not be accepted if it was borderline. 
 
We ended up accepting six submissions with half of them being Vision papers. We are very pleased by the quality of the accepted papers. The papers cover a wide range of technological problems about using cloud for mobile services, from networking to novel applications in home automation. The workshop program also includes one keynote and three invited talks that feature speakers from academia, industry, and non-profit organization.
