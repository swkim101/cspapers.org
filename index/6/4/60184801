DistriNet is a research lab with 65 researchers. The general domain of expertise and innovation of DistriNet is the development of advanced open and distributed software [1]. The research is application driven and is conducted in close collaboration with industry. One particular class of applications we target are multiagent systems. A multiagent system consists of “a loosely coupled network of problem solvers (agents) that interact to solve problems that are beyond the individual capabilities or knowledge of each problem solver” [2]. In a joint RD the detailed design and implementation is object-oriented. For a detailed discussion of the technical aspects of the application we refer to [4,5]. Here we reflect on our experiences with transferring research into practice.
