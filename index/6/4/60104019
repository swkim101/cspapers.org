Designing temporally predictable software has become a vital issue, especially in real-time industrial applications. This paper focuses on the temporal modelling problem, and discusses a method which can form the foundation of a tool which gives true temporal representation of systems. The proposed method utilizes the power of a concurrent object-oriented programming language-STRAND-using a modelling methodology based on a modified Quirk Model.
