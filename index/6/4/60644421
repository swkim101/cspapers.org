To be competitive in today’s market, firms need to offer a variety of products that appeal to a diverse set of customer needs. Product line optimization provides a simple method to design for this challenge. Using a heterogeneous customer preference model allows the optimization to better explore the diversity in the market. The optimization should also consider aesthetic, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing constraints to ensure the feasibility of the final solution. However, as more constraints are added the difficulty of the optimization increases. There is an opportunity to reduce the difficulty of the optimization by allowing the heterogeneous customer preference model to handle a subset of these constraints termed design prohibitions. Design prohibitions include component incompatibility and dependency. This paper investigates whether design prohibitions should be handled solely in the heterogeneous customer preference model, solely in the optimization formulation, or in both. The effects of including design prohibitions in the creation of a hierarchical Bayes mixed logit model and a genetic algorithm based product line optimization are explored using a bicycle case study.Copyright © 2014 by ASME
