The MORET code is a simulation tool that solves the transport equation for neutrons using the Monte Carlo method. It allows users to model complex three-dimensional geometrical configurations, describe the materials, define their own tallies in order to analyse the results. The MORET code has been initially designed to perform calculations for criticality safety assessments. New features has been introduced in the MORET 5 code to expand its use for reactor applications. This paper presents an overview of the MORET 5 code capabilities, going through the description of materials, the geometry modelling, the transport simulation and the definition of the outputs.
