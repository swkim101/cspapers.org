In this paper, an online working condition monitoring system is designed to early warn environmental quality in manufacturing industry. It is very crucial to provide real time and accurate data for staffs, stakeholders and control center to monitor factory air quality at working place. By uploading the all collected data on internet, the environmental condition can be monitored in real time by users. A feedback system is realized to detect sensor's status. An event filler is designed to process and extract only the useful data to manage the huge amount of transmitted data by a large number of sensors in system. By doing so, we can save up to 48% data sent to coordinator on average and save up to 30% energy saving for a sensor node. An advanced MD5 Hash algorithm is used to encrypt data before uploading secured data to server.
