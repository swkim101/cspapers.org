In recent years, the topics addressed by SNOW have become very popular among diverse scientific communities. Data-mining researchers have studied how information spreads and diffuses in social networks. Journalists, social scientists, economists, are typical users who can improve their respective fields by adopting technologies of interest to SNOW. The workshop aims to provide a new forum to foster communication between these communities. In particular, for its first edition, the workshop has attracted a small number of high-quality submissions on the relationships between online news and social media.
