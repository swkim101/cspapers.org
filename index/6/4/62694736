In wireless sensor networks, the wireless sensor networks node’s energy is limited, so how to make the node’s energy used with high effective has become the research focus of the routing algorithm. The paper proposes LEACH-EB algorithm that is belongs to clustering algorithm. In the selecting cluster head process that not only takes node’s residual energy into considers but also node’s neighbor degree, improves the probability that the center area node’s becomes cluster head than boundary region, then to solve the total energy waste in the networks, and prolongs the lifetime of networks. Simulation experiments show that, compared with LEACH and LEACH-B, the proposed algorithm can effectively balance the network and prolong the lifetime of the networks.
