Welcome to the Proceedings of the 24th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP 2013), held at the Nemacolin Woodlands Resort, Farmington, Pennsylvania, USA. This year's program includes 30 papers, and touches on a wide range of computer systems topics, from kernels to big data, from responsiveness to correctness, and from devices to data centers. The program committee made every effort to identify and include some of the most creative and thought-provoking ideas in computer systems today. Each accepted paper was shepherded by a program committee member to make sure the papers are as readable and complete as possible. We hope you will enjoy the program as much as we did in selecting it.
