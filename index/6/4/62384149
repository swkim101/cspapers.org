In the past decades, research efforts in microfluidics – an enabling technology to perform automated operations on fluid using submicroliter volumes – have rapidly expanded in terms of both theoretical studies and applications [1]. Microfluidic devices can handle small volume of fluids, extending down to attoliter-scale volumes in forms of droplets or liquid sections in confined micro-channels, which can be applied a large variety of biological solutions (e.g. enzymes, nucleic acids, antibodies or cells). Such devices offer excellent portability, in form of bench-top devices, and controllability, with manipulations of molecules or cells in micro-channels/chambers with dimensions in the order of ~10 – 100 μm. Microfluidic devices have also been used to precisely control the in vitro biofilm environment. Development of microfluidic devices has become a cross-disciplinary effort, often involving different aspects of science and engineering, including optics, biology, chemistry, mechanics and material science [2]. Some of the major advantages of the device miniaturization are the reduction in biological and chemical wastes production, precise fluid handling, faster analysis and molecular-based detection, and the capability to carry out parallel or high-throughput operations [3]. In particular, the length scale of microfluidic systems increases the speed of common experimental techniques, such as protein and DNA electrophoresis, by orders of magnitude. As a tool for cellular culture, microfluidics is a tool that enables researchers to spatiotemporally regulate the environment around cell populations at different scales, ranging from single cells to thousands/millions of cells.
