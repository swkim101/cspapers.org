In this paper, we will argue that developments in social media in the past few years open up an opportunity space for developing "integration software". Such software supports company specific use cases, while the software expands on existing social media infrastructure through web API's. We have explored this opportunity space for social media integration in companies with a conceptual design project. Seven groups of students designed and built "integration software" for two different companies. In this paper we present the three most interesting student concepts and identify challenges and opportunities for building "integration software".
