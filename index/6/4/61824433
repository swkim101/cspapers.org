There are a variety of factors that affect the performance of an expert system. This paper presents an evaluating method focusing on the complexity, costs and efficiency of inference structure in a rule Knowledge-source based expert system. The performance measuring factors proposed here, when fedback to Knowledge engineers, can help them gain a quantitative understanding of reasoning performance of Knowledge acquired at the (early) stages of the development life cycle, and enable them to make a numeric comparison and a choice among several structures, or have some refinements. This paper also presents some application examples of this evaluating method and describes an evaluating facility based on it.
