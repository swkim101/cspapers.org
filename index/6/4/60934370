In recent years, the complex event processing technology has been used to process the VANET’s temporal and spatial event streams. However, we usually cannot get the accurate data because the device sensing accuracy limitations of the system. We only can get the uncertain data from the complex and limited environment of the VANET. Because the VANET’s event streams are consist of the uncertain data, so they are also uncertain. How effective to express and process these uncertain event streams has become the core issue for the VANET system. To solve this problem, we propose a novel complex event query language PSTeCEQL (probabilistic spatio-temporal constraint event query language). Firstly, we give the definition of the possible world model of VANET’s uncertain event streams. Secondly, we propose an event query language PSTeCEQL and give the syntax and the operational semantics of the language. Finally, we illustrate the validity of the PSTeCEQL by an example.
