An improved controller for opening and closing a vertical blind over a door or window opening. A rotatable mechanism pivots individual louvers or vanes in the window blind. A cord has first and second lengths ending in a looped end retained by a bar. A handle is engaged with a cord lock for selectively grasping the cord for moving the vanes horizontally across the opening. The rotatable mechanism can comprise a hollow cylinder to permit reciprocation of the rotatable mechanism relative to the handle. The cord is substantially enclosed within the handle and the rotatable mechanism so that the looped end of the cord is not accessible to persons adjacent the window blind.
