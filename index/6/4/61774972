Welcome to the 1st International Workshop on Software Engineering for Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (SEsCPS 2015) collocated with the 37th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2015) held in Firenze, Italy. 
 
Recent advances in technology have dramatically raised the potential in the development of computational systems and created opportunities to further link systems together (creating systems of systems) with collaborative sensing and actuating capabilities. This opens the possibility of building Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that can efficiently deal with adversities of their environment, be tolerant to threats, cope with emergent behavior and overall, by distributed collaboration, can provide a value which is larger than sum of value provided by individual parts. To emphasize such embedded intelligence, these modern CPS are called Smart CPS (sCPS). 
 
sCPS heavily rely on software up to the point of becoming software-intensive systems. The software in sCPS is by far the most important and most complex constituent. This calls for systematic software engineering (SE) of sCPS, which is not only able to address individual SE challenges, but provides synergistic solutions that are resource efficient and respect the sCPS specifics such as mobility, limited connectivity, partially uncertain environment, etc. 
 
SEsCPS workshop is one of the first events specifically addressing the software engineering for sCPS. It investigates challenges and specifics of software engineering (SE) for sCPS. It aims at deepening the understanding of SE for sCPS and at identifying promising solutions and their novel synergies.
