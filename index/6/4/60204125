Combination strategies are test methods that generate testcases based on input parameter models. This paper suggestsa structured modeling method used to translate requirementsexpressed in a general format into an input parametermodel suitable for combination strategies.This paper also describes results from two initial experimentsexploring the efficiency and effectiveness of themodeling method. These results indicate that the resultingmodels may contain enough information to detect the vastmajority of faults in the system under test. Further, resultsindicate that the modeling method is simple enough to usein practical testing.
