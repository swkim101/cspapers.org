In realistic image processing, it is a problem of image foreground extraction. For a large number of color image processing, an important requirement is the automation of the extraction process. In this paper, by automatically setting foreground seed, we improve the image existing segmentation algorithm; by automatically searching image segmentation region, we accomplish image segmentation with the GrabCut algorithm, which is based on Gaussian Mixture Model and boundary computing. The improved algorithm in this paper can achieve the automation of image segmentation, without user participation in the implementation process, at the same time, it improves the efficiency of image segmentation, and gets a good result of image segmentation in complex background.
