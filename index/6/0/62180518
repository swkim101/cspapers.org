We describe our experiences with two unification­based grammar formalisms, namely ALE and PATR, used for syntactic and semantic analysis of NL texts. These formalisms can be considered to be high-level tools, like expert-system shells, for writing a NL grammar and for parsing sen­tences. However there are a number of aspects, such as ease of expression, augmentability, linguistic felic­itousness and computational efficiency in which ALE and PATR differ. The experiment is carried out in the context of the Plinius project which requires a.o. a large sublanguage grammar covering a fragment of En­glish. We will describe the formalization and imple­mentation of our linguistic ideas in PATR and ALE. Subsequently we will evaluate both exer­cises ihereby focusing on both practical and theo­retical properties of the two formalisms. The pur­pose of the experiment is to reveal whether there are motivated reasons concerning which kind of formalism can be employed best given the partic­ular Plinius task.
