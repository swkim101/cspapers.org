The applications of Monte Carlo method in reactor physics analysis is somewhat restricted due to excessive memory demand in solving large-scale problems. Domain decomposition and data decomposition are two remedies. Memory demand in MC simulation is analyzed firstly. Domain decomposition and tally data decomposition algorithms separately are designed and implemented based on reactor Monte Carlo code RMC. Numerical tests are executed to evaluate performance of new algorithms respectively. Domain decomposition algorithm shows potentials to speed up MC simulation as a space parallel method. As for tally data decomposition algorithms, memory size is reduced obviously.
