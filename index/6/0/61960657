This paper aims at furnishing basic definitions for robotics in the span of man-made intelligence. Simple robotics and their faculties such as sensors and actuators are included in the definition. Moreover, intelligent and non-intelligent types of robotics are described in this research work. We generally focus on non-intelligent robotics (program-based robotics) and the setbacks designers can encounter .The methods and designs of an arm robot generally encompass three components: namely, the mechanical assembly of the arm robot, the electronic circuit, and software design employing Prolog software programming language. Our design concentrates generally on programming an arm robot to manipulate its movements. In our case study programming an arm robot we delineate probable resolutions to setbacks we encountered without going intensely into theory, and we demonstrate a stable design for resolving these setbacks via a flowchart. The design of the flowchart is next explained and subsequently coded.
