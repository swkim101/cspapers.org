There are two ways to solve workspace boundary, analytic geometry method and numerical method. In this paper, boundary search method is used to wok out the PPP-δ parallel robot workspace. And the relevant points coordinates and motion displacement of expression S1, S2, S3 is worked out. And the PPP-δ parallel robot graphical workspace is also obtained.
