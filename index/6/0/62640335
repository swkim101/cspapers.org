DSL access multiplexers (DSLAMs) link the customer side of the network with the service side. In this domain, recent trends, such as end-to-end IP and QoS based protocols for better bandwidth utilization, require in-field reconfigurable, yet costeffective solutions. This, however, suggests that common network processors cannot be used efficiently since they scale their resources linearly with the throughput class. The scaling limitations are due to the fact that they are either used stand-alone or within rather symmetric clusters, which makes them sub-optimal for the asymmetric topology of a DSLAM. Clearly, to develop an appropriate architecture a careful application domain analysis and a well defined benchmark are required. The availability of system-level network processing benchmarks, however, is still an unresolved issue. This is especially true for the network access domain, where no established benchmarks exist. In this paper, we present a complete system-level benchmark including function, traffic models, and environment specification. We first perform the domain analysis, derive its requirements, and examine existing approaches. We then apply the benchmark to a number of processors, including NP elements. Finally, we discuss our observations. This not only demonstrates the concept, but also shows how the benchmark can be used for the subsequent design space exploration step.
