This paper discusses a method to determine the optimal direction of the principal moment of inertia in frames element cross-sections for the design of mechanical structures at the conceptual design phase. The direction in each frame element is determined by maximizing the structural stiffness. Construction of the optimization procedure is based on the KKT-conditions and the balance of bending moments applied to each frame element. This method is implemented as an application in a structural topology optimization procedure that uses frame elements. Finally, several examples are presented to confirm that the proposed method is useful for the topology optimization method discussed here.Copyright Â© 2004 by ASME
