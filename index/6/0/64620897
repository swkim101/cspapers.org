In translating Object Constraint Language (OCL) to Prototype Verification System (PVS) using model transformation technique, the problem is the absence of PVS metamodel. The PVS metamodel is crucial to the transformation because it defines the elements that may involves in it. This paper proposes a PVS metamodel. The metamodel is created based on the main language construct of PVS where each PVS language construct is represented by element in the metamodel. An example of how the metamodel is used in the transformation is also discussed.
