Logical models or schema are used to represent the entities, relationships, and transformations of an information system. The relational model and the relational algebra have been developed to perform this function for database systems, but until recently only a few writers (e.g., Crawford, MacLeod, Schek) have studied logical models for bibliographic retrieval systems. This paper examines an extension of the relational model, called a semantic model, as a schema for bibliographic systems. An alternative notation is suggested for the semantic model, based on the Warnier/Orr diagram. An experimental semantic model user interface, which has been developed for an experimental microcomputer information retrieval system, is briefly described.
