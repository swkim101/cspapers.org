The 4th International Workshop on Trustworthy Embedded Devices (TrustED 2014) was held on November 03rd, 2014, in Scottsdale, Arizona, USA, and it was co-located with the 21st ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2014). TrustED 2014 is a continuation of previous workshops in this series, which were held in conjunction with ESORICS 2011, IEEE Security & Privacy 2012, and ACM CCS 2013 (see http://www.trusted-workshop.de for details). 
 
The paradigm of ubiquitous computing and permanent, mobile connectivity has already started to become reality through modern technologies that allow for electronic systems to be embedded practically everywhere. However, with new opportunities come new risks, affecting security and privacy. Embedded devices differ significantly from ''classical'' systems, such as desktop PCs, in various aspects which include more severe constraints and an increased vulnerability with respect to physical or network attacks. The scope of TrustED is security of embedded devices in general with focus on cyber physical systems and their environments. It aims to bring together experts from academia and research institutes, industry, and government in the field of security and privacy in cyber physical systems to discuss and investigate the problems, challenges, and recent scientific and technological developments in this field. 
 
This year, twelve papers have been submitted. Each paper received at least three reviews, which were followed by an online discussion to decide on the program. The program committee accepted five papers that cover a variety of topics, including Trusted Computing, efficient hardware implementations, and side-channel attacks. In addition to the technical program, the workshop featured five internationally highly renowned speakers: Yier Jin, Tiffany Hyun-Jin Kim, Christof Paar, Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi, and Gene Tsudik.
