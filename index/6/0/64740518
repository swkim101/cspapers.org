Template matching is wildly used as an effective method for object recognition and localization which plays an important role of machine vision technology. In this thesis, an improved adaptive sequential similarity detection algorithm (SSDA) using wavelet pyramid as the searching strategy is presented. It is found that this algorithm has advantage of greatly improved matching speed with small error between the theoretical displacement and the actual displacement.
