A general particle population control method has been derived from splitting and Russian Roulette for dynamic Monte Carlo particle transport. A well-known particle population control method, known as the particle population comb, has been shown to be a special case of this general method. This general method has been incorporated in Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Monte Carlo Application Toolkit (MCATK) and examples of it’s use are shown for both super-critical and sub-critical systems.
