We presented an algorithm to recognize overlapped bubbles in two-phase flow. We extracted bubble images from gray image by Background subtraction, and then converted them to binaries. Final images were segmented to compare them with the templates of bubble pattern. Finally, we obtained the recognition accuracy to compare their similarities. The recognition rate is to 93% and it is efficient in the field of the machine vision.
