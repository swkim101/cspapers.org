This method simulates a stepped beam by substructuring it into its n spans and treating each of which as a uniform continuous beam, clamped to its adjacent spans. Thus, at each step of the stepped beam, the two adjacent spans have identical displacements, slopes, bending moments and shearing forces. Theoretically speaking, these boundary conditions along with those of the extreme ends (total of 4n), when applied to the vibration equation of corresponding spans, generate a set of 4n simultaneous equations whose solution generates the natural frequencies of the stepped beam, as well as the constants of the vibration equation of all spans. The mathematical algorithm furnished herein degenerates the above-mentioned 4n simultaneous equations into groups of four at a time and solves them one after the other. The algorithm is programmed in VISUAL C++, and its accuracy is justified via application to a five-span stepped-beam.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
