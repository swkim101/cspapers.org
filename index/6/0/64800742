With the rapidly aging populations around the world, 
research on technology as related to the elderly is 
becoming increasingly relevant. In this paper, we 
review papers addressing this topic during the last ten 
years at the CHI conference. Insights from this review 
allow us to gain an overview of what has been achieved 
in the field so far and to recommend future directions 
that the community should look into.
