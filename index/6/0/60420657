Service-oriented architectures are increasingly used in the context of business processes. However, the proven practices for process-oriented integration of services are not well documented yet. In addition, modeling approaches for the integration of processes and services are neither mature nor do they exactly reflect the proven practices. This paper presents the design, implementation of an extensible, scalable, web services ripple propagate routable base, transnational hierarchical global patch consistent model called THGPCM (Transnational Hierarchical Global Patch Consistent Model). Improving the OPDS (Original Patching Data Source) enabled network equipments, capable of updating patch parameter that existed in enterprise with specified OPDS partially dependency relationships. The paper also proposed a new scalable patching replica routing service algorithm, that dynamic reconfiguration distributed forwarding data path within enterprises hierarchical region enterprise portal. Apply scenario can reduce the global patch service cost of transnational enterprise network equipments and minimum the turnaround time of patch service delay.
