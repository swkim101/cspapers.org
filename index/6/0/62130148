The paper describes the outline of the design automation system which provides the following design methods: Higher level structural drawings capable of expressing designs with Boolean equations and truth tables. Function level logic simulation of the entire computer design with extensive use of function test programs Automated logic synthesis generating detailed logic just as designers expect Delay check promising the most truthful timing evaluation at each design stage in progress Highly automated physical design and diagnosis data generation The latest very large scale general purpose computer HITACHI M-680H/682H utilizes these methods to successfully reduce its development time.
