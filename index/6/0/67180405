Time-Series Shapelets are shown to be useful features to learn accurate classi(cid:12)ers for various time series. There are many algorithms for searching or optimizing shapelets, however, they use limited classes of features based on subsequences in the training data. In this paper, we consider an in(cid:12)nitely large set of sequences as a class of shapelets and discuss the generalization bound of the shapelets-based hypothesis class. In practice, instead of us-ing in(cid:12)nitely many sequences, we propose a heuristic approximate algorithm using random sequences that allows us to obtain good classi(cid:12)cation rules and shapelets. In preliminary experiments over real data sets, we obtained accurate classi(cid:12)ers which are comparable to the state-of-the-art methods.
