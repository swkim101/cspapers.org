The work is a generalization of three Wilson's models related with the gestion (management) of stocks in the deterministic case. A new variable r, called stock rate or simulation rate, appears in all models. This variable assures a better stock controlling by deterministic simulation method. For r = 1/2 we obtain all Wilson's results from the bibliography [4], [5]. For each economical model the mathematical foundation is given, together with several numerical applications and economical interpretations. All models are based on the same notations with their specific meanings.
