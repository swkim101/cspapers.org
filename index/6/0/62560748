SPOT-5 image is widely used in every trade by its special advantage of high spatial resolution and stereo mapping. SPOT-5 image is difficult to composite true color without blue wavelength channel. This article aims to achieve approximation from RS images colors to natural colors through true-color processing. The experiential arithmetic module of true-color composite is established by Using Erdas Imagine, which is the software for processing RS image, and ERDAS Macro Language (EML), which is modeling language. Loading module and some simulations get more effective images of approximating natural colors by all kinds of surface features of SPOT-5 image.
