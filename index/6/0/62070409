In this paper we propose a cellular automata model (CA) to understand and analyze how customers adapt their decisions based on local information regarding the behav- ior of the system and how the interactions of individuals and their decisions influence the formation of queues, which in turn impacts the sojourn time. We illustrate how a multichannel system of service facilities with endogenous arrival rate and exoge- nous service rate, based on local information and locally rational agents, may present different collective behaviors and in some cases reaches the nash equilibrium.
