In this paper, we present a new platform for environment monitoring using very low specification cameras. These latter are distinguished by their visual sensors offering tiny images (30*30 pixels), completely local processing thanks to the max10 FPGA and the SmartMesh IP technology offering a mesh network. The lack of information extracted by visual sensors is filled by intensive communication and data exchanged between cameras after each detection. Thus, a re-identification process is applied based on exchanged and extracted data after each target detection.
