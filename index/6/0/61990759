The paper describes the application of Occam and the transputer, in the simulation of real time control systems, replacing the established analogue computation techniques. Analogue simulators are expensive, slow to develop and require temperature stabilisation and complex compensation circuitry. The transputer and Occam may offer an alternative to the mainframe computer for this task since for certain applications multi-transputer systems offer a performance comparable to that of a mainframe at a fraction of the cost. >
