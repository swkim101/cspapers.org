To put it simply, the main idea of Variational dropout is to search for posterior approximation in a specific family of distributions: q(wi) = N (θi, αiθ i ). Then the reparameterization trick [12] for this model is equivalent to plain Gaussian dropout wi ∼ q(wi) ⇔ wi = θi( √ αiεi + 1), εi ∼ N (0, 1). Now we can treat α as variational parameters and optimize the lower bound w.r.t. θ and α. The prior distribution is chosen to be log-scale uniform distribution. If we optimize the lower bound w.r.t θ with fixed α, log-scale uniform prior makes Variational dropout equivalent to Gaussian dropout.
