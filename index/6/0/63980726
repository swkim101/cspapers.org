In modern Electrical Power and Drives the computer is of ever increasing importance in numerous applications. To keep in step with the state-of-the-art of some computer-based approaches in power engineering, the teaching-staff of schools are constantly forced to up-date the existing curriculum in shorter time intervals as compared to the past. Within this context a project has been started recently to explore possible applications of Object Oriented Design (OOD) in power system analysis with the emphasis on student training. This paper describes in some detail the progress of the ongoing project.
