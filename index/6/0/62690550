The makeup and relationships within the design supply chain are changing rapidly. One-stop shopping, whereby a system house procures most of its design and fabrication services from a single source, is now being supplanted by a host of outsourcing suppliers. These players are developing online integration plat-forms for outsourced design engineering, business transactions, and data management.
This evolution is being felt by the entire design automation industry, whether it be focused on the electronic design of chips, boards, or systems, or even the mechanical design of their packaging and housing. What are the implications of this trend on cost, demand for services, and time to market? How can all parties ride this wave of the future to achieve the best outcome in terms of collaborative design capabilities and quality of results?
