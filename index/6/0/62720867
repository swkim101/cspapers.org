Expert systems use the expertise of experienced people to evaluate and solve problems in a decision making domain. Such systems use their knowledge base to model a human approach to the problems' solution. Expert system technology has been applied to many areas of problem solving. This paper describes an expert system approach to completing partially routed printed circuits boards. An experimental expert system has been implemented to solve the associated local blockage problem. This research should provide the foundation for the development of an expert system for a Computer Aided Design Workstation.
