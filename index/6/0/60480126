Generating the more efficient dynamic test cases became a challenging task, which improvises the test result accuracy while testing a software application. Metamorphic Testing (MT) has emerged as successful and proven methodology to alleviate the design of complex test oracles in software testing since last decade. Generating the follow-up test cases is the featured advantage of Metamorphic Testing to reveal the hidden bug information from underlying software applications. But earlier research scholars of Metamorphic Testing were used the traditional follow-up test case generation strategies, which are suffering from inadequate or no training data set which leads to inefficient test case generation. Because of this limitation, MT is unable to reach the expected performance in testing of a software application. In this paper, we introduced a Successive Test Case Generation (STCG) Algorithm in the area of Metamorphic Testing to generate the efficient follow-up test cases to identify the hidden bugâ€™s information. STCG algorithm is designed as to implement a supervised training data set, to direct the follow-up test case generation strategy to generate the next level cases. STCG algorithm is different from the traditional algorithm in the way of mapping the relations based on rank values. Experimental results are showing that our approach is having high scalability than other approaches.
