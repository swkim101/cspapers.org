During extensive fieldwork in tropical and equatorial areas of Africa, South America and Asia, numerous collections have been made among which several collections all characterized by resupinate basidiomes, ventricose, apically curved to distinctly hamate hymenial setae, and ellipsoid, slightly thick-walled, and pale yellowish basidiospores. Morphologically, these collections could be hardly distinguished, or by some subtle characteristics, which taxonomic pertinence remain uncertain.
