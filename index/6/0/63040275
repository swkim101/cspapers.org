A Multiagent Chess playing paradigm is defined. By defining spheres and strength degrees for pieces winning strategies on games can be defined. The new Intelligent Tree Computingth eories we have defined since 1994 can be applied to present precise strategies and prove theorems on games. The multiagent chess game model is defined by an isomorphismo n multiboards and agents. Intelligent game trees are presented and goal directed planning is defined by tree rewrite computation on intelligent gamet rees. Applyingin telligent gamet rees we define capture agents and state an overview to multiagentc hess thinking. Gamter ee intelligence degree is defined and applied to prove model-theoretic soundness and completeness. The game is viewed as a multiplayer game with only perfect information between agent pairs. The man-machine technologies thought dilemmias dispelled in brief by addressingt he thinking in the absolute versus thinking for a precisely defined area with a multiagenti magef or the computing mind.
