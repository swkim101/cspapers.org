We are pleased to present the proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Release Engineering (RELENG 2015), which was held in Florence, Italy on Tuesday the 19th of May 2015, colocated with ICSE 2015. With an actual release engineer as one of the co-organizers, 42% of the PC consisting of actual release engineers, and a separate abstract track for practitioner reports (in addition to a regular academic track), RELENG has been built from the ground up to bring together researchers and practitioners in the area of release engineering to meet each other and share experiences, tools and techniques to help organizations release high quality software products on time. 
 
The term "release engineering" basically covers all activities in between regular development and actual usage of a software product by the end user, i.e., integration, build, test execution, packaging and delivery of software. This comprises a variety of activities like managing test infrastructure, code flow through branches, building and configuring a product from source code, reporting quality gate results, signing off source code, manufacturing CDs, deploying applications, managing hot-fixes, and anything else that is necessary to bring high quality products to the end user on time.
