These proceedings contain the collection of papers presented at the ESEC/FSE Workshop on Software Integration and Evolution @ Runtime -- SINTER'09. The goal of the workshop is to bring researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry together, who are interested in the domain of runtime software integration and evolution. Moreover, we would like the workshop to be a place for discussions on the relevant and urgent aspects of runtime integration and evolution, address the demands of dynamic systems with high availability requirements, join forces towards more coherent and coordinated approaches to master the challenges of dynamic ICT solutions, and form a forum for people interested in the subject of the workshop. SINTER gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of runtime software integration and evolution. 
 
The program committee selected 8 papers that cover a variety of topics, such as runtime evolution infrastructures, testing of runtime evolving systems, or runtime fault localization. In addition, the program includes two keynote speeches, one by Toine Hurkmans (Exact Software) on the issues of zero down-time requirements in multi-tenant systems, and one by Stefan van Baelen (KU Leuven) about the general problems of runtime adaptation, and a component platform that supports runtime updates with state transfer. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for research in the area of runtime software integration and evolution.
