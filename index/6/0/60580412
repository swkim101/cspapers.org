Recently, a new web development technique for creating interactive web applications, dubbed AJAX, has emerged in response to the limited degree of interactivity in large-grain stateless web interactions. In this new model, the web interface is composed of individual components which can be updated/replaced independently, and the client/server communication is based on a delta-communication style of interaction. With the rise of AJAX web applications classical multi-page web applications are becoming legacy systems. This research seeks to explore how software engineering techniques can assist in comprehending, analyzing, and restructuring classic web applications towards AJAX.
