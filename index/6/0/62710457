ET++ is an object-oriented application framework implemented in C++ for a UNIXâ€  environment and a conventional window system. The architecture of ET++ is based on MacApp and integrates a rich collection of user interface building blocks as well as basic data structures to form a homogeneous and extensible system. The paper describes the graphic model and its underlying abstract window system interface, shows composite objects as a substrate for declarative layout specification of complex dialogs, and presents a model for editable text allowing the integration of arbitrary interaction objects.
