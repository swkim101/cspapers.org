In this paper, we introduce a design exploration method for adaptive design systems (DEM-ADS), which is proposed to manage the uncertainty in the system design process. The proposed method includes the local regression model and an inverse design procedure derived from the existing Inductive Design Exploration Method (IDEM). To demonstrate the proposed method, the design of a photonic crystal coupler and waveguide containing two subsystem analyses is presented. The result indicates that the proposed method effectively attains solutions that are robust to uncertainty in the system more efficiently than IDEM.Â© 2009 ASME
