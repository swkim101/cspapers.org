A new parsing algorithm is described. It is intended for use with advice-taking (or augmented) phrase structure grammars of the type used by Woods, Simmons. Heidorn and the author. It has the property that it is guaranteed not to propose a phrase unless there exists a continuation of the sentence seen thus far, in which the phrase plays a role in some surface structure of that sentence. The context in which this algorithm constitutes a contribution to current issues in parsing methodology is discussed, and we present a case for reversing the current trend to ever more complex control structures in natural language systems.
