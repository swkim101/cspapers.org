This paper presents the kinematic synthesis of a CRR serial chain. This is a four-degree-of-freedom chain constructed from a cylindric joint and two revolute joints in series. The design equations for this chain are obtained from the dual quaternion kinematics equations evaluated at a specified set of task positions. In this case, we find that the chain is completely defined by seven task positions. Furthermore, our solution of these equations has yielded 52 candidate designs, so far; there may be more. This synthesis methodology shows promise for the design of constrained serial chains.Copyright Â© 2003 by ASME
