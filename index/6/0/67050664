Aiming at the problem of ineffective use of large amount of energy consumption data in public buildings at present, this article proposes data mining to subentry measuring data collected by data center of construction committees in various provinces and cities by utilizing improved Apriori algorithm, to find out the relation between different air conditioning refrigerating system forms and unit area energy consumption of air conditioning of the same building types in the same region. It briefly introduces the basic idea and process of the Apriori algorithm, and preliminarily designs preprocessing of experimental data and result analysis method; the result after data mining can provide reference for energy conservation design of new buildings and energy conservation reconstruction of old buildings.
