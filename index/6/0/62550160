The Third ACM Workshop on Digital Rights Management (DRM 2003) was sponsored by ACM SIGSAC and was held in conjunction with the 10th ACM conference on Computer and Communication Security (CCS).The notion of Digital Rights Management (DRM) has been gaining importance. This is due to the fact that the Internet has become the center of distribution for digital goods of all sorts. The business potential of digital goods distribution and manipulation is huge, as are its economic, legal and social implications. DRM, as a technical interdisciplinary field, is at the heart of controlling the digital content and assuring authorized, user-friendly, safe, well-managed, automated, and fraud-free distribution. The field combines cryptographic technology, software and systems research, information and signal processing methods, legal, social and policy aspects, as well as business analysis and economics. The diversity of sub-fields that contribute to the complex notion of DRM is an interesting characteristic of the area that was manifested in this year's workshop (as was the case in past DRM workshops).The workshop received 30 submissions, of which 13 were accepted. In this proceedings volume you will find the revised versions of the papers that were presented at the workshop. I wish to thank the authors of all submitted papers. Indeed, it is the authors of all papers who have made this workshop possible, regardless of whether or not their papers were accepted. The workshop program also included an invited talk by Tsvi Gal, the CIO of Warner Music Group, who presented possible future scenarios for intellectual property from his point of view as a consumer of DRM.
