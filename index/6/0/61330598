These proceedings contain the papers selected for presentation at the 2004 ACM Workshop on the Security of Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks (SASN) held in association with the 11th ACM Computer and Communications Security Conference, October 25, 2004, in Washington, DC. 
 
We received a total of 35 paper submissions, of which 7 were selected as full papers, and 6 as short papers for presentation at the workshop. Each paper was reviewed by at least two members of the program committee (most papers received three reviews), and was evaluated on the basis of its importance, novelty, technical quality, and relevance to the workshop theme. The program committee discussions were conducted electronically. In addition to the selected papers, the workshop program includes an invited keynote talk by Jack Stankovic (University of Virginia), and a panel discussion. 
 
The relatively short time frame for the review process resulted in a large workload for the program committee. We thank all the program committee members for their hard work and insight in reviewing submissions. Committee members sometimes solicited the advice of colleagues; we are grateful to those colleagues, in particular: Lujo Bauer, Nauel Ben Salem, Srdjan Capkun, Mario Cagalj, Roberto Di Pietro, Kris Gaj, Jihye Kim, Yong Lee, Donggang Liu, Jun Luo, Allesandro Mei, Jonathan McCune, Panagiotis Papadimitratos, Maxim Raya, Nitesh Saxena, Bob Simon, Gurmeet Singh, Stefan Schmit, Runting Shi, and Jeong Y.
