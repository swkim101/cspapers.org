This paper presents a probabilistic design system (ADAPRES_NET) in which structural reliability problems are addressed by applying structural reliability methods along with a response surface method in a distributed computing environment. In this study, first the value of using distributed network computing for structural reliability analyses is explained. Secondly, a basic structure of distributed networking is given in which the fundamental concepts of network programming for structural reliability analysis are explained. Finally, the use of ADAPRES_NET is demonstrated for a case study involving the concurrent application of structural reliability analyses.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
