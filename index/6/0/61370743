An approach to rule discovery has been presented in which the strategy of targeting a restricted class of rules is combined with a technique for their efficient discovery. Attribute values in the dataset are distributed among the outcome classes in the dataset in such a way that the attribute values associated with an outcome class are more likely, on a heuristic basis, to appear as conditions of a discovered rule with this outcome class on the RHS. The discovered rules are exact rules with additional properties depending on the heuristic used to distribute attribute values among outcome classes in the dataset.
