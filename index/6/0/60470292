This paper designed a multiple channel audio acquisition system based on FPGA and ARM. On the one hand, the system uses FPGA as the core, realize high speed logic control and the AD interface control unit. On the other hand, the ARM is responsible for the logic control and the realization of the HumanMachine Interaction, and to save the audio data to the SD card. The system has the advanced of low power consumption, real-time and high scalability. Therefore, we can implement the reliable and lower cost acquisition system of multi-channel audio signal.
