We propose a novel goal-oriented method to model AUP software development process. Our method is based on Goal-Net modeling theory, which can be used to model complex process with phase goals and hierarchy goals. Our educational practices of Goal Oriented AUP (GOAUP) for Master of Software Engineering (MSE) students at College of Software, Beihang University showed that the work productivity and artifact quality can be improved by infusing GOAUP into their course and software development process. By analyzing and studying the educational case, our experiences that infusing GOAUP into the software engineering education are shared to professions and educators.
