Operational capability aggregation of armaments systems is significant for its future developing, planning, manufacturing and synthesis using. Holistic avalanche character of armaments systems can't be represented in traditional linear aggregation of operational capability, which regards the "system" or "platform" as the core. Cellular automata that indicate the holistic effect of system evolvement by processing partial conversions is firstly introduced on this paper, on the base of which, analogy cellular automata model is proposed, combing with applied details of operational capability aggregation. Experiment results prove that the model is valid.
