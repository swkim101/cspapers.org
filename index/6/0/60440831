Darwin is a genomics co-processor that achieved a 15000x acceleration on long read assembly through innovative hardware and algorithm co-design. Darwins algorithms and hardware implementation were specifically designed for DNA analysis pipelines. This paper analyzes the feasibility of applying Darwins algorithms to the problem of protein sequence alignment. In addition to a behavioral analysis of Darwin when aligning proteins, we propose an algorithmic improvement to Darwins alignment algorithm, GACT, in the form of a multi-pass variant that increases its accuracy on protein sequence alignment. Concretely, our proposed multi-pass variant of GACT achieves on average 14\% better alignment scores.
