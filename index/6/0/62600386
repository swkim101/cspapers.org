A free-air ionization chamber is used as a standard of photon air-kerma. Several correction factors are applied to the air-kerma value. Correction factors for electron loss (kloss ) and for additional ionization current caused by photon scatter (ksc ), photon fluorescence (kfl ), photon transmission through diaphragm edge (kdtr ), and photon scatter from the surface of the diaphragm aperture (kdsc ) were determined by the MCNPX code utilizing information stored in Particle Track (PTRAC) output files. Individual steps of the procedure are described and the calculated values of the correction factors are presented. The values are in agreement with the correction factors published in a literature for similar free-air chambers.
