Response of the scintillation spectrometer to incident photons has complex character due to complex character of photon interaction processes. Experimental spectrum thus provide qualitative information given by the identifiable peaks positions, while extraction of the full, quantitative information (i.e. photon flux energy distribution) require spectra unfolding based on the spectrometer response (represented by the response matrix) knowledge. As experimental determination of response matrix is difficult or impossible in most cases, the Monte Carlo simulation is the proved solution. Usage of the unfolding for experimental spectra processing enable to determine dosimetric characteristics of the incident photon fields and/or characteristics of the sources, creating those photon fields.The response matrices for scintillation spectrometers with different detectors (commonly used NaI, BGO and new LaBr) were calculated using Monte Carlo method. The response to the internal activity of the LaBr detector was also simulated and considered in spectra processing. Calculated matrices were used for unfolding of the experimental spectra from different applications to determine desired dosimetric quantities. Typical applications are environmental monitoring, monitoring of the working environment, accidental monitoring and contamination measurement, etc. Method is suitable also for the airborne monitoring or security applications. Results for individual detection systems are compared and discussed with aim to analyze potential advantages of the LaBr detector for considered applications.
