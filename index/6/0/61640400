Global software development (GSD) is nowadays pervasive among large enterprise organizations. Physical separation in GSD has raised many issues, mainly due to cross-sites communication and coordination problems, which have made software development an even more challenging task. Hence, distributed workgroups need tools to support a load of activities that usually take place through the direct interaction among people. This paper presents a tool, called P2PConference, to conduct conferences over a distance. The tool provides basic features for simple brainstorming sessions as well as more sophisticated features to accommodate the needs of other types of meetings, such as presentations and panels. P2PConference adopts a decentralized architecture and it is implemented upon a peer-to-peer infrastructure platform, called JXTA.
