CASTA 2009 is the first international workshop on Context-Aware Software Technology and Applications. Context-awareness is an emerging theme in a large number of application domains, and supporting mechanisms in areas such as programming languages and middleware have appeared in recent years. Nevertheless, the diverse communities working on context-awareness have largely worked independently. This workshop is a first attempt to bring these communities together to compare experiences and discuss directions for future research. 
 
The call for contributions attracted submissions in a wide range of different domains, ranging from components and architectures to support context-awareness, through context-aware programming languages, to approaches for modeling context for web services, business processes, and access authorization. 
 
The workshop presentation format is modeled after an approach pioneered by WCRE (the Working Conference on Reverse Engineering). Instead of authors presenting their own paper, each paper in a session is presented by an author of a different paper. A short yes/no question period may follow. After all papers have been presented, a general discussion on the session theme is opened. This format has proven to be very stimulating for workshops, since it raises open questions and differences in perspective rather than focusing on established results. For a workshop on context-awareness, it offers an ideal way to highlight differences in context arising from the different participating communities. 
 
In addition to paper presentations and open discussions, the workshop includes an invited talk by Hajo Reijers entitled "Some Context Dimensions for Business Processes," and a demonstration session devoted to tools and applications.
