Our social capital has collapsed along with the rule of the New Order, and getting crushed in the period thereafter. Solidarity and trust between members and community groups dwindling. Even within the community groups, they had already decreased dramatically. Through this study, the authors use the method of literature study to find solutions and strategic moves to low social capital at this time. Results of the study showed that education as a force means that education is one of the very strong human power and potential to fight all the forces of human nature hampers. One step educational strategy that must be taken is how to cultivate and simultaneously strengthen the social capital of the nation by building mutual trust, conduct reciprocal relations such as mutual respect, sharing, cultivate positive emotions for the continuity of social transformation better, and has wide network. The implication of this study is education as a force provides an opportunity for us, teachers, students, and parents can revitalize the education through social capital formation strategies in academic and non academic programs.
