This paper investigates the classification of news headlines as positive, negative, and neutral. A news headline is positive if is associated with good things, negative if it is associated with bad things, and neutral in the remaining cases. The classification of a news headline is predicted using a supervised approach. The experiments show an accuracy that ranges from 59.00% to 63.50% when argument1-verb-argument2 relations are combined with other features. The accuracy ranges from 57.50% to 62.5% when these relations are not used.
