It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2017 Women in Cyber Security Workshop - CyberW'17. The mission of this workshop is multi-fold. First and foremost, we hope to attract females and people from other underrepresented groups to engage in cutting-edge security and privacy research. Second, we hope to showcase the achievements of outstanding female and minority researchers and leaders and encourage others to take on senior and leadership roles. Last but not the least, the workshop provides an interactive forum for helping people who seek research feedback and career advice. 
 
We are extremely honored to have a group of outstanding security and privacy researchers, whose mindsets are aligned with the CyberW missions, to give two (2) insightful opening remarks and six (6) technical keynotes. The open remarks are:
