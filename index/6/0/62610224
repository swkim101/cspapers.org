Nowadays, with the development of science and technology and the improvement of people's living standard, Internet cloud computing develops the smart city. A smart city cloud was constructed. Based on the cloud computing, a novel information system was designed with Web. The traditional information system only had one-way data collection function. It could not be used for analysis and executive. The novel system adopted closed-loop topology structure. Efficient sensor data protocol was discussed. B/S service software was developed by MS ASP+SQL Server database. 3D interface was built by using TWaver MONO DESIGN development tool. The system can help us achieve the purpose of acquiring information from sensor and controlling actors based on Web service, optimizing usersâ€™ experience compared to the traditional system.
