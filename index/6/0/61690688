On behalf of the organizing committee, I welcome you to the 2010 ACM MobiCom and MobiHoc. These two conferences were brought together for the first time in 2007 in Montreal. The 2010 edition is the sixteenth in its series for MobiCom and eleventh for MobiHoc. Over the years, both conferences have established themselves as premier forums for presentation of research on mobile computing and wireless networking. I hope that you will attend the exciting paper presentations at both the conferences, which are being scheduled as parallel tracks this year. 
 
The papers included in the conference proceedings reflect the outstanding research performed by our authors, and also the conscientious and dedicated efforts of the two technical program committees, ably led by Suman Banerjee and Dina Katabi for ACM MobiCom, and Christoph Lindemann and Jitendra Padhye for ACM MobiHoc. The program committee chairs devoted substantial effort, working with the respective program committees, to ensure that the review process resulted in fair and timely decisions. In addition to the refereed papers, this year's program also includes poster and demo sessions. I am sure that you will enjoy the diversity of research being presented in these sessions. We also have several workshops scheduled this year on a wide range of emerging topics of interest to the conference attendees.
