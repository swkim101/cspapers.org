A neural model is described which uses oscillatory correlation to segregate speech from interfering sound sources. The core of the model is a two-layer neural oscillator network. A sound stream is represented by a synchronized population of oscillators, and different streams are represented by desynchronized oscillator populations. The model has been evaluated using a corpus of speech mixed with interfering sounds, and produces an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio for every mixture.
