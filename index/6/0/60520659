We have developed a robot controller based upon a neural implementation of Norman and Shallice's model of executive attentional control in humans. A simulation illustrates how attentional control leads to the suppression of action selection errors in neurally controlled robots. A related demonstration illustrates how lesioning of the control architecture leads to behavioural pathologies that resemble those seen in human patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex.
