The problem of optimum recognition of edges is examined from a matched filter perspective, and optimum edge filters are derived. It is shown that the common belief that good detection and good localization are in opposition is incorrect. Rather, there is a coupled relationship between detection and localization. Moreover, the performance of the linear matched filter for edge detection cannot be exceeded by any form of nonlinear filter. No assumption as to the shape of the edge or the form of the noise power spectrum is made other than that it is (locally) stationary. Consequently, the results are valid for any desired feature to be detected, including step, ramp and roof edges. Under conditions of white noise and a Gaussian signal form, the one-dimension Marr-Hildreth edge operator approximates to the optimum. However, in two dimensions, this is not so, since optimum 2-D operators are radially asymmetric. A noise analysis of machine vision cameras is included.
