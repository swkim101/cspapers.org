Development of a numerical analysis method was performed to clarify thermal-hydraulic characteristics in supercritical water reactors. Because the thermo-physical property of fluids at the supercritical pressure condition is different from that at the subcritical condition and has a special feature, current numerical analysis codes cannot be applied. Then, Japan Atomic Energy Agency is developing a numerical analysis code which can calculate the thermo-fluid properties of the supercritical fluids correctly. This paper describes the predicted results of a newly developed analysis code and the comparison results with the experimental results.
