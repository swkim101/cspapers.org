Utilizing available assembly resources can greatly reduce the development time and cost for platforms and new product family members. This paper presents a method to utilize existing assembly plant resources, during the development of new product family members, by comparing existing assembly plant with feasible assembly processes. An assembly sequence design space that can be used to perform new family member process and existing plant utilization trade-off study is presented in the paper. The assembly sequence design space is combinatorial in nature. This research seeks to provide a systematic method to represent and reason with combinatorial design spaces in which these assembly process combinations lie. Models that capture effects of constraints on these spaces, explicitly represent feasible regions, and efficiently enumerate designs within this space are investigated. Application of the assembly sequence space to perform assembly plant utilization trade-off study is demonstrated using a coffeemaker family.Copyright Â© 2004 by ASME
