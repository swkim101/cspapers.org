The workshop schedule is divided into four sections. Each section has a dual purpose - first, to provide you an opportunity to learn about and practice an aspect of developing and running a user evaluation, and second, to build community by learning about one another's research and brainstorming together. We begin by exploring early investigative and organizational methodologies: contextual inquiry, interviews, and affinity diagramming. We follow by developing research questions and refining them into testable hypotheses. Third, we survey various experimental designs and use that knowledge to create study plans. We conclude by piloting the most promising studies on one another, reflect on how they went, and refine their design.
