Traditional dimensional analysis techniques for predicting the performance characteristics of a product can be greatly improved in both accuracy and domain of applicability by the infusion of empirical data, derived from material tests, into the equations that characterize the system parameters of interest. Advanced similarity methods are investigated which overcome the constraints associated with the traditional methods and provide increased analysis capability and improved insight into the phenomenon governing the problem. Such capability greatly increases the design toolbox available to product developers, across a large range of scale and application. It also significantly enhances a developer’s choices for prototype portioning during a development cycle. Solid mechanics and heat transfer applications are used to illustrate the basic utility of the methods.© 2002 ASME
