An integrated multiscale modeling framework that incorporates a simulation-based upscaling technique is developed and implemented for the material characterization of additively manufactured cellular structures in this paper. The proposed upscaling procedure enables the determination of homogenized parameters at multiple levels by matching the probabilistic performances between fine and coarse scale models. Polynomial chaos expansion is employed in upscaling procedure to handle the computational burden caused by the input uncertainties. Efficient uncertainty quantification is achieved at the mesocale level by utilizing the developed upscaling technique. The homogenized parameters of mesostructures are utilized again at the macroscale level in the upscaling procedure to accurately obtain the overall material properties of the target cellular structure. Actual experimental results of additively manufactured parts are integrated into the developed procedure to demonstrate the efficacy of the method.Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME
