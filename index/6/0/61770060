We present an object-based semantics for informative question answering in the University domain. Semantic rules specify how the internal representation is built from the parse tree for a sentence. A collection of rules is given for generating internal representations for the natural language requests that arise in the University domain. The action of the semantic interpreter is also illustrated by showing how it applies the rules to a particular sentence to produce an internal representation.
