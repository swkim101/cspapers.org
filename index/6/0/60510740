The ceaseless expansion of the World Wide Web is making more and more complex for humans to efficiently find the needed information. The underlying idea of having a description of the data on the Web, organized in such a way as to be used by machines for automation, integration and reuse across various applications, has been exploited in several research fields. 
 
As in the previous editions, the International Workshop on "Semantic Web Information Management" (SWIM) aims at reviewing the most recent data-centered solutions for the Semantic Web. In particular, its ambition is to present and analyze the techniques for semantic information management, by taking advantage of the synergisms between the logical basis of the semantic web and the logical foundations of conceptual modeling. Indeed, the leitmotif of these researches is the proposal of models and methods conceived to represent and manage the so-called "semantic data", that is, data appropriately structured to be easily machine-processable on the Web, according to semantic models (e.g. RDF, RDF(S), OWL). The long-standing experience of the information modeling community can provide a priceless contribution to the substantial problems arising in semantic data management.
