Wireless sensor network is a type of communication which gives a steadfast communication at the minimal expense. This paper highlights one of the fundamental concern namely node localization by using the combined effect of randomly generated tokens at anchor nodes and vector iterative process (RGT_VIP). Time synchronization is a critical aspect in the wireless sensor networks for their data transmission. But with this approach, we can range and estimate the position of deployed nodes without depending on central synchronized time reference at receivers end and at the anchors/transmitter end. Results show that this newly proposed method gives a greater accuracy in terms of average distance error on different variance of Gaussian values and performs better than synergetic localization algorithm on higher values of variance.
