We present work carried out on journalistic political commentaries in two Italian newspapers, by two wellknown Italian journalists, Maria Novella Oppo, a woman, and Michele Serra, a man1. Political commentaries published on a daily basis consists of short texts not exceeding 400 words each. Sixty-four texts come from Michele Serra’s series titled “L'Amaca”, published daily on the newspaper “La Repubblica” between 2013 and 2014; usually the targeted subjects are politicians, bad social habits and in general every trendy current event. Forty-nine texts come from Maria Novella Oppo’s series titled “Fronte del video”, published daily on the newspaper “L’Unita” in a previous span of time, say from 2011 to 2012; the targeted subjects are usually politicians and televised political talk shows. The two journalists have been chosen for specific reasons: Oppo is a master in highly cutting and caustic writing, Serra is less so. Both are humorous, however, Oppo is more witty in building the overall logical structure of the underlying satiric network of connections. Oppo borders sarcasm, Serra never does so. Oppo's texts are slightly longer than Serra's. Italy is not included in the upper part of the list of countries where the freedom of information is very strong. Because of her trenchant and stinging style, Oppo has been publicly attacked by some of her favourite targets, politicians including Berlusconi and Beppe Grillo, who reacted bitterly to her commentaries by including her in a black list of journalists criticizing his movement called Movimento5Stelle. In particular, she has been attacked – and heavily offended by Grillo who claimed that since she has always been working for the same newspaper for all her career, she will be out of her job in case the Parliament approves the law that precludes newspapers from receiving public financial support. And she will be obliged to find a new job.
