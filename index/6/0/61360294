Most website classification systems have dealt with the question of classifying websites based on their content, design, usability, layout and such, few have considered website classification based on users’ experience. The growth of online marketing and advertisement has lead to fierce competition that has resulted in some websites using disguise ways so as to attract users. This may result in cases where a user visits a website and does not get the promised results. The results are a waste of time, energy and sometimes even money for users. In this context, we design an experiment that uses fuzzy linguistic model and data mining techniques to capture users’ experiences, we then use the k-means clustering algorithm to cluster websites based on a set of feature vectors from the users’ perspective. The content unity is defined as the distance between the real content and its keywords. We demonstrate the use of bisecting k-means algorithm for this task and demonstrate that the method can incrementally learn from user’s profile on their experience with these websites.
