This paper describes and discusses the pedagogical foundations and the technical features that enables rapid generation of role-play simulations on the Web. The pedagogical approach of this learning technology is based on the principles of dynamic goal-based learning, and learning by doing within the context of authentic educational settings where students are allowed the opportunity to acquire the intended learning outcomes by making mistakes in safe environments. Based on this clearly articulated and proven pedagogical design, we are able to develop a process by which a designer can quickly create a web-based role-play simulation. Incremental modification is an essential feature in this rapid cyclic development process allowing further refinement to the simulation as it progresses. The technology used to support this environment is FablusiTM Role-Play Simulation Generator (see Fablusi Website at http://www.Fablusi.com/authoring/).
