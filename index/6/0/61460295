This paper describes several extensions to standard Production System (PS) languages that appear to make them more conveniently usable for a wider variety of perceptual and cognitive systems. The extensions are described (giving parallel productions, multiple memories, and productions that are implied by productions), and a programming language ((PS)"M") is presented (in Uhr, 1978) that incorporates them. Sketches are given indicating how several different kinds of cognitive and perceptual systems might be coded in this extended language, and suggestions are made as to additional extensions that might further arugment the power and convenience of such a language.
