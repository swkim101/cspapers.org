Welcome to AST 2016---the 11th International Workshop on Automation of Software Test, held in conjunction with the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2016) in Austin, TX, USA, May 14 -- 15, 2016. 
 
The workshop is the 11th edition of the successful AST workshops held at ICSE conferences. It aims to foster a forum for academia, industry, and the research and development community to share their knowledge, exchange experiences and ideas, and discuss challenges and future research directions in the area of automation of software testing. The workshop provides an opportunity for researchers and developers of testing tools to work together to identify the problems and to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of software test automation. 
 
The special topic and charette discussions of AST 2016 focus on scalability of test automation. In recent years, the complexity of software systems is due more and more to their execution in large and complex platforms and environments, such as mobile devices, distributed wireless networks, large scale clusters and mobile clouds. In such settings, like SaaS, and Big Data applications, Web of Systems, and Cyber-physical Systems, computation must be able to scale up as well as scale out, and there are increasing high demands to the automated testing of large scale software systems. The AST 2016 special theme covers all aspects of scalability problems of test automation, including the development and assessment of automated software testing techniques that are capable of dealing with large scale software systems, and supporting the testing of software systems when they are scaled up and out.
