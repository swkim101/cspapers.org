This paper describes an application of the recently introduced gene expression messy genetic algorithm (GEMGA) (Kargupta, 1996) for detecting fraudulent transactions of credit cards. It also explains the fundamental concepts underlying the GEMGA in the light of the SEARCH (Search Envisioned As Relation and Class Hierarchizing) (Kargupta, 1995) framework.
