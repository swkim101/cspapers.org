This article develops a hypothesis to explain the sudden, intense shift in votersâ€™ opinions on gun control following television campaign advertisements in October 2005. We argue that the shift occurred because the ads supporting the maintenance of the gun trade were successful in exploiting popular perceptions of public security constructed over the years by mediatic crime narratives. We base our hypothesis on an empirical analysis of the crime coverage in the nightly edition of RJ-TV, the most watched local news show in Rio de Janeiro, in the year 2004.
