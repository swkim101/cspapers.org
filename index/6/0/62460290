Welcome to the 3rd ICSE Workshop on Games and Software Engineering (GAS): Engineering Computer Games to Enable Positive, Progressive Change is held on May 18, 2013 in San Francisco, U.S.A., located with the 2013 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering. 
 
We are pleased to build upon the first two ICSE GAS Workshops and provide a forum to interactively explore leading edge research in game software engineering from a number of perspectives, including (1) how the challenging requirements (functional and non-functional) of games influence methodologies; (2) the role of games in education, whether as projects in courses, a teaching tool to complement traditional lectures, or in student competitions to motivate and reward GAS skills; (3) exploring reuse in GAS to reduce development time, improve software quality through the use of product lines, libraries, frameworks, engines, domain assets, and game modifications by the player; (4) revisit scalability and alternative platforms from the technical viewpoint (mini-games for phones to massive open on-line courses).
