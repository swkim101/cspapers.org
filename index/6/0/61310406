This volume contains the papers presented at the 28th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.Our invited speakers always add a special sparkle to our meetings, so I would like to personally applaud Lila Gleitman from the University of Pennsylvania and Fred Jelinek from the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.
