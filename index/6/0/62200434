The commonly used method for high resolution velocity analysis in seismic data processing and interpreting is based on signal estimation algorithm. However, the numerical realization of this method is complicated and time-consuming due to the process of signal-noise separation requiring enormous loop calculations before constructing the energy function. In this paper, we improved the method on the base of multi-trace signal estimation. This improved method made full use of amplitude information that can enhance the anti-noise ability and improve the resolution greatly. Meanwhile, this method has more economical calculation cost than other methods for it didnt require multiple loop calculations.
