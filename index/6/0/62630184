A maximum conﬁdence enhancement (MCE)-based sequential sampling approach isdeveloped for reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) using surrogate models. Thedeveloped approach employs the ordinary Kriging method for surrogate model develop-ment and deﬁnes a cumulative conﬁdence level (CCL) measure to quantify the accuracyof reliability estimation when Monte Carlo simulation is used based on the developed sur-rogate model. To improve the computational efﬁciency, an MCE-based sequential sam-pling scheme is developed to successively select sample points for surrogate modelupdating based on the deﬁned CCL measure, in which a sample point that produces thelargest CCL improvement will be selected. To integrate the MCE-based sequential sam-pling approach with RBDO, a new sensitivity analysis approach is developed, enablingsmooth design sensitivity information to be accurately estimated based upon the con-structed surrogate model without incurring any extra computational costs, thus greatlyenhancing the efﬁciency and robustness of the design process. Two case studies are usedto demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the developed approach. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4026033]
