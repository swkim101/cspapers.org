The handling of anomalous or outlying observations in a dataset is one of the most important tasks in data preprocessing. It is important for three reasons. First, outlying observations can have a considerable influence on the results of an analysis. Secondly, although outliers are often measurement or recording errors, some of them can represent phenomena of interest, something significant from the viewpoint of the application domain. Thirdly, for many applications, exceptions identified can often lead to the discovery of unexpected knowledge. We propose an algorithm for outlier analysis. In this approach, outliers detected by statistical methods and the context in which these outliers occur are examined by acquiring and applying relevant domain knowledge. In particular, we try to establish domain-specific hypotheses which may be used to explain the data points.
