It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the proceedings of the 2013 ACM Workshop on Refactoring Tools (WRT'13). Following in the tradition of previous WRT instances, this workshop brought together researchers and developers of refactoring tools to share new ideas and practical insights, discuss challenges and solutions, and together shape the future of refactoring. 
 
The call for papers solicited short 4-page papers on topics such as refactoring tools for new domains, novel interface paradigms, and refactoring for previously unsupported languages, attracting nine submissions from Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Each submission was independently reviewed by three members of the program committee, and it was decided to accept all submissions in order to ensure timely dissemination of new ideas and promote discussion of emerging ideas. 
 
In addition to paper presentations, the workshop program included two panel discussions and a keynote by Bill Opdyke on Refactoring, Reuse & Reality---Revisited.
