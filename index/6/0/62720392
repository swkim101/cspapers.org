In this paper, compliant mechanism design with non-linear materials using topology optimization is presented. A general displacement functional with non-linear material model is used in the topology optimization formulation. Sensitivity analysis of this displacement functional is derived from the adjoint method. Optimal compliant mechanism examples for maximizing the mechanical advantage are presented and the effect of non-linear material on the optimal design are considered.
