Our digital story exercise for induction week continues to be a success that we are keen to share. This exercise brings unfamiliar students together quickly in an engaging collaborative exercise: to describe what HCI is to a young audience using the ‘digital story’ technique. Students are immediately confronted with sharing and negotiating their perspectives of HCI, working on a coherent and engaging message for their audience and getting to grips with the digital story technique. In this paper we focus on the pragmatics of the exercise that can be adapted for other purposes.
