Data nowadays comes from various sources including log files, transactional applications, the Web, social media and many others. A large part of this data is generated and transmitted in real time and in a large scale. To create value out of these data sets, business analysts and scientists employ advanced data analytics techniques combining, among others, traditional BI, text analytics, machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing. Tackling the complexity of both the data itself and its analysis remains an open challenge.
