This study explores the use of a bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder/decoder based on a mechanism of attention for a Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) task. First experiments carried on the ATIS corpus conﬁrm the quality of the RNN baseline system used in this paper, by comparing its results on the ATIS corpus to the results recently published in the literature. Additional experiments show that RNN based on a mechanism of attention performs better than RNN architectures recently proposed for a slot ﬁlling task. On the French ME-DIA corpus, a French state-of-the-art corpus for SLU dedicated to hotel reservation and tourist information, experiments show that a bidirectionnal RNN reaches a f-measure value of 79.51 while the use of a mechanism of attention allows us to reach a f-measure value of 80.27.
