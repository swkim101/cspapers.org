Under the guidance of the Talmud allocation scheme’s theory, the paper analyzes the algorithm implemented process via the perspective of graphic point-segment way, and designs the point-segment way’s Talmud property allocation algorithm. Then it uses Java language to implement the core of allocation algorithm, by using Android programming to build a visual interface.
