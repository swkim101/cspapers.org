Small volume and high product-mix contribute greatly to the complexity of job shop operations. In addition, shop floor uncertainty or fluctuation is another issue regularly challenging manufacturing companies, including job delay, urgent job insertion, fixture shortage, missing tool, and even machine breakdown. Targeting the uncertainty, we propose a function block based approach to generating adaptive process plans. Enabled by the function blocks, a so-generated process plan is responsive and tolerant to an unpredictable change. This paper presents in detail how a function block is designed and what it can do during process plan execution. It is expected that this new approach can largely enhance the dynamism of fluctuating job shop operations.Â© 2007 ASME
