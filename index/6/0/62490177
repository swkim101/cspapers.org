The major theme of the program is to identify challenges facing the work toward a unifying theoretical foundation of stochastic image grammars. The program has research topics that deals with stochastic image grammars. The topics include learning vocabularies of visual primitives and parts; hierarchical models of events, activities, and scenes; taxonomies and ontologies for activities; inference algorithm for image grammars; use of grammars for image parsing, and generating sentences of image interpretation; and image datasets and evaluating stochastic image grammars.
