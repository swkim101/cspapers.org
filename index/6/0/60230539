Domain names are a very crucial part of applied Internet technology. To this day, they remain dependent upon Latin characters regardless of the global reach of the Internet itself. Other languages are not yet fully supported to locate resources and sites on the network. Nevertheless, using Arabic domain names is essential to increase Internet penetration in the Arab world. Supporting the Arabic language in domain names calls for investigating and addressing a number of questions related to linguistic issues and the Arabic domain name tree structure. 
 
This paper highlights and discusses the contributions and offers some recommendations regarding the accepted Arabic character set to be used in Arabic domain names, as well as some recommendations concerning the appropriate Arabic generic and country code top-level domain names (i.e., Arabic gTLDs and ccTLDs).
