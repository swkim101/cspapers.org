A software engineering course project in a computer engineering program should reflect the general orientation of the program. It should address the development of software for an embedded computer system operating in real time. The project should also satisfy a number of other requirements arising out of its embedding in the curriculum and the general constraints on laboratory equipment cost and student time. The author describes on such project. The main requirements on a software engineering course project in a computer engineering program are listed. A description is given of a project designed to meet these requirements-the specification, design and implementation of software for a small, 60-line private branch exchange (PBX). The exchange is emulated on a Sun workstation. The author overviews the deliverables required in the project and discusses experiences with the project. >
