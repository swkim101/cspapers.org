In this paper, we present a new driver vehicle interface based on hand gestures that uses a hierarchical model to minimize resources requirements. Depth information is provided by time of flight sensor with automotive certification. In particular, we develop our implementation of a Random Forest based posture classification in two subcases: micro gestures at the wheel and macro gestures in front of the touch screen.
