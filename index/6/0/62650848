In terms of approximation of labeled transition systems, it is inefficient to simplify system actions. This paper proposed approximation of homogeneous linear algebraic transition systems. In order to extend the system actions, homogeneous linear algebraic programs are applied to describe system actions. Then it proposed the theory and algorithm of approximation of homogeneous linear algebraic transition systems. Under certain conditions, approximation of homogeneous linear algebraic transition systems can optimize homogeneous linear algebraic transition systems efficiently. Finally, above view is verified by a simple example.
