Large scale tri-dimensional transport calculations in unstructured meshes are limited in scale mostly by the amountof data to process (memory space limitations), the number of operations to perform (computational time limitations), or both. A method relying on a prismatic projection of non-uniform 3-D geometries is proposed, that reduces both memory space and computation time without introducing new approximations and opens new possibilities regarding large scale parallel processing.
