The software design phase is one of the critical phases in the software development life cycle, contributing very significantly to the success of the overall software product. Many organizations involved in large scale software development are using structured software design processes with varying degrees of control and flexibility. The complexities of the problem domain and the system environment would significantly influence the software design process and the software itself. Though there is a good understanding and application of the structured software design process in the industry, software project managers often face difficulties in establishing the design effort, the progress made and the design quality achieved. It has always been a challenge to make correct assessment of the design effort, establish some intermediate steps for measuring the progress of designs and assuring their quality. The challenge can be met by a good engineering of the design phase and training software engineers and design managers in acquiring the "process knowledge". Engineering the design phase with well defined tasks, methods, procedures and deliverables facilitates measurability of progress and easier control of the process. This paper discusses the software design process and describes some important steps and guidelines which help in building the required design deliverables in a measurable manner at the same time assuring quality. The steps integrate the technical and non-technical aspects of the software design process in a cohesive way.
