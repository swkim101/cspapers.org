The development of a profile of conceptual understanding in the area of parallel resistors is aimed at providing a tool to assist Physics educators to identify the basic problems underlying the understanding of parallel circuits. Hence, it can lead to a better intervention program for the students upon entry to the universities. This profile covers the major problematic areas in electricity as identified by McDermott and Shaffer [1], Duit and von Rhoneck [2], Metioui [3] and Beh [4]. It focuses on the six main domains which are "the meaning of parallel", "practical knowledge of current, voltage and resistance", "circuit connection" and problem solving using mental models". The research was conducted on 192 Diploma in Engineering students. Results revealed that these Engineering students can be classified into 2 categories when it comes to their knowledge in electricity; 'smart' and 'mediocre'. The Electrical Engineering students are the most competent with person mean at +0.76 logit in the area of parallel resistors compared to the other 2 groups. The traits of both categories for all three groups are listed out with the reference. In this study, Rasch measurement Model has the ability to serve as a mean of creating a profile of the students on the basis of parallel resistors.
