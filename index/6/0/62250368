It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 4th ACM Workshop on Recurring Malcode (WORM'06). Internet-wide infectious epidemics have emerged as one of the leading threats to information security and service availability. Self-propagating malicious programs -- generally termed 'worms' -- exploit software weaknesses, hardware limitations, Internet topology, and the open Internet communication model to compromise large numbers of networked systems. Internet worms are increasingly being used as delivery mechanisms for malicious payloads such as spyware, phishing servers, spam relays, denial-of-service attacks, and information espionage. Current operational practices still face significant challenges in containing these threats as evidenced by the rise in automated botnet networks and the continued presence of worms released years ago.This year's workshop continues the efforts of the previous three years by providing a forum for exchanging ideas, increasing understanding, and relating experiences on self-propagating malicious software. We invited participation from researchers and practitioners from academic, commercial and government communities. The program committee selected ten papers and one panel based on quality, focus, and the likelihood of stimulating productive discussion at the workshop. The program committee also solicited invited talks from two leading practitioners to share their perspectives.
