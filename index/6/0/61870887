The Institut fur deutsche Sprache recently has begun setting up a LExicographical DAta Base for German (LEDA). This data base is designed to improve efficiency in the collection, analysis, ordering and description of language material by facilitating access to textual samples within corpora and to word articles within machine readable dictionaries and by providing a frame to store results of lexicographical research for further processing. LEDA thus consists of the three components Text Bank, Dictionary Bank and Result Bank and serves as a tool to support monolingual German dictionary projects at the Institute and elsewhere.
