It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the First ACM Workshop on Network Data Anonymization (NDA 2008). This inaugural workshop focuses on the theory and practice of anonymization as it applies to network data for use by the Internet measurement research community and operators deploying network measurement technologies. Though the application of anonymization techniques to network traffic data is not a new area of work, several factors are now converging to focus attention on network data anonymization. These include a growing requirement for "real" network data for Internet measurement research studies as Internet measurement matures as a science; increasing interest in network data sharing across administrative domains for network operations and security purposes; and the continued scaling up of network monitoring and measurement activities, with the attendant increase in difficulty of maintaining the privacy of the end users of the network's end users. 
 
The program this year consists of an invited talk, two panels, five papers, and addresses a wide variety of issues surrounding these factors. The talk and panel discussions focus on the interaction of network measurement, data sharing, and anonymization within their greater social, political, legal contexts, and feature jurists, researchers, technologists, and operators, for a wide and varied perspective on the field. Papers address advances in anonymization itself, especially relating to anonymization metrics and operational applications of anonymization, and in novel approaches to the problems anonymization is intended to solve. Authors and participants hail from North America, Europe, and Asia, reflecting the global nature of research in the field.
