In order to deeply exploit the knowledge hidden in the telemetry data and find out the correlation between the data, ID3 algorithm was used in the article to analyze the telemetry data of solar panel substrate. The information gain value of parameter was calculated and the maximum gain value is the split property, the decision tree was constructed based on the split property. The knowledge and the correlation between the property data were discovered; the correlation affected the state of solar panel substrate. These results are necessary for analyzing the satellite on-orbit performance and diagnosing fault. The analysis result shows that ID3 algorithm is suitable for the analysis of satellite telemetry data, and the proposed algorithm improves the quality of telemetry data processing.
