This paper proposes a component-based methodology for consistency checking between behavioral models and scenario-based specifications depicted respectively by UML state and sequence diagrams. When plugging any component within some system, we do not explore its entire state space to uncover design flaws of the added component. We just generate its partial reachability graph from StateCharts and then, we synthesize a transition system from the subset of interaction diagrams in which this component is involved as participant. Afterwards, we check whether the former graph fulfills the partial specification via a fitting comparison criterion.
