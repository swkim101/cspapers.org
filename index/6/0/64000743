In the last decade or so, the scope of database research has witnessed an explosive expansion. When one looks at the research publications in top DB conferences, it is not surprising to see papers on topics ranging from machine learning to distributed systems, multi-modal datasets to petabytes of scientific data, solutions customized for modern hardware to visualization-driven analytics, and so on. In fact, these papers dominate the proceedings compared to papers on "traditional" DB topics.
