Recent technology developments have made eye-tracking 
systems more affordable and less cumbersome. Many 
members of the HCI community will therefore consider 
employing this method in usability research and 
assessment. This paper, provides an overview of the eye 
movement data that can be collected, what is involved in 
analysing them, and what it can add to current HCI 
research and usability assessment practice. We argue that, 
whilst much work is required to develop the use of eyetracking 
as a practitionerâ€™s method, it can provide valuable 
objective data about the impact of visual design on human 
performance. To illustrate this point, some preliminary 
results of a study into web page usage are reported. The 
results are examined with regard to explaining task 
performance, user physiology as well as in the assessment 
of the difficulties and the potential behind eye-tracking.
