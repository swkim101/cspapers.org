This paper describes the design and implementation of tiny TTY for an ARM based multi-process mono-kernel, including overview of TTY, and implementation of the TTY routines such as data structure of TTY, TTY input, TTY read, TTY write, TTY waiting and TTY signal setting. A demo example is also provided at the final of the paper to show the effect. The mono-kernel is developed by the author of this paper on Linux with GNU tool chain from scratch, for which the tiny TTY is designed. Based on this mono-kernel, other components can be added such as file system, network management, etc. to form a more powerful embedded operating system.
