Causal inference, from experimental and observational studies, is critical to answering important questions in natural, social and digital systems. Unfortunately, applying causal inference to large systems—such as markets, societies or even teams of people—presents critical challenges in causal inference due to network effects, feedback loops and other complications. While many causal methods have been introduced and are applicable to some of these problems, their use requires careful thought and adaptation by experts. But what if we could identify a (large) class of important questions that could be answered without repeated expert intervention? We identify such a broad class of simple questions about individual experiences—essentially, what happens after a person takes some action or has some experience—that can be answered through analysis of a large-scale corpus of individual-level social media timelines under ignorability and SUTVA assumptions. Our goal is to create a framework for data processing and causal inference methods that can best answer these action-outcome questions from social media timelines.
