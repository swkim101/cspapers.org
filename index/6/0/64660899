Hypothesis / aims of study Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia, without proven infection or other obvious pathology. The prevalence of OAB with bothersome symptoms is 11% in women and 5% in men (>40 years old) and the incidence increases with age (1). This condition has a serious impact on the individualsâ€™ physical capacities and well-being as well as on society. Daily oral anticholinergic drug intake is the first-line treatment of OAB. Several compounds with a similar effectiveness on OAB symptoms are currently used and available on the market however they can display a distinct spectrum of adverse effects. Commonly described side-effects are dry mouth (30%), constipation (8%), blurred vision (4%) and some other less frequently reported effects (2). As these medications pass the blood brain barrier, also cognitive effects can take place such as confusion, concentration problems, troubles in finding words, decreased functioning of the long or short term memory (3). Up until now, although OAB occurs more frequently with increasing age, no data exist that highlight which adverse effects are considered important by older people. The aim of this study was to determine which of a selected number of side effects would attribute most to the choice of oral anti-cholinergic medications for OAB in older people.
