This paper describes a strategy to transform Data Flow Analysis into Object Oriented Design. This transformation is performed by extracting information from the Data Flow Model, by enriching with Design decision and by finally producing an Object Oriented Design Model. Semiformal transformation rules are described. Also a special notation is introduced to describe the Object Oriented Design Model. The Model used to represent Data Flow Analysis is the one originally proposed by Yourdon, complemented with Ward-Mellor's Real Time extensions (the “Essential Model”).
