An attention-aware peripheral display that measures user's visual attention and dynamically changes its awareness level is presented in this paper. In order to make the peripheral displays dynamically engage users, we augmented a conventional peripheral display with the notification control and with an infrared camera to detect the user's gaze as visual attention. We conducted comparative user tests between the typical peripheral displays and the proposed system. The result confirmed that the proposed system ensured better information delivery while it did not affect on the task performance. In conclusion, design considerations utilizing user's attention for a peripheral display were discussed.
