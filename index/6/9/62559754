With the promotion of 3G networks and upcoming 4G network, mobile phone users in constant rise. The volume of data they produce will soar every day. A variety of data appear results in the database have rapid increasing. Some application system in access to these heterogeneous, huge databases is bound to access difficulties, the problem of low efficiency of access. Query optimization technology is proposed in this paper, based on data partitioning, by reducing the database size to solve the problem of memory and huge amounts of data access problems. From the experiment test, the method can effectively improve the efficiency of huge amounts of data access, can get satisfactory results.
