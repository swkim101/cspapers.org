The classic benchmarks for transport through a binary markovian mixure are revisited to look at the probability distribution function of the chosen “results”: reflection, transmission and scalar flux. We argue that knowledge of the ensemble averaged results is not sufficient for reliable predictions: a measure of the dispersion must also be obtained. An algorithm to estimate this dispersion is tested.
