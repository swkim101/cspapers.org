This paper describes a framework that provides a clear semantics and well-developed algorithms for both the control and diagnostics of discrete event Systems. This framework integrates important characteristics of two discrete event system representations, finite state machines (used primarily for control) and causal networks (used primarily for diagnosis). We provide a clear semantics for system models that incorporates control and diagnosis, extending the framework of both finite state machines and causal networks. We show mappings between the two representations, and demonstrate the enhanced power of this integrated representation over the existing representations.
