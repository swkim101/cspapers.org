This paper presents a small vision system created to study Minsky's theory of Frame Systems It is organized around a detailed semantic hypothetical model of the scene, which is capable of being structurally altered and adjusted to fit the visual data. Visual data is gathered through a window, whose position is controlled by suggestions which arise from uncertain parameters of the hypothetical model.
