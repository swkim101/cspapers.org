The research of the chromosomal positions enrichment of genes is a method widely used to characterize a set of genes. In this paper we have developed MTGCFinder, an online tool for mining microRNA-regulated target genes clusters on chromosome. The sliding window algorithm is provided to mine the target genes clusters on chromosome segments. At the same time, it also provides a search for the enrichment of all microRNA-regulated target genes on chromosomes/regions in number of species. In order to further study the relationship between microRNA and human cancer, MTGCFinder also provides the function for mining cancer-related microRNA target genes clusters on chromosome regions, which is helpful for the study of human cancer.
