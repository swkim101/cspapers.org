A new video image interpretation technology applied mainly to the angular distortion measuring system of navy vessel is developed in this paper. The video interpretation system incepts two video signals coming from two CCD of photoelectric self-collimation parallel optic equipment. Real-time video image processing and interpretation, as well as dynamic miss distance are achieved by using concurrent working mode, and the relatively distortion of vessel can be obtained by combining the two measurement results.
