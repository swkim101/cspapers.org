Increasingly, with the abundance of data, science requires robust, new cyberinfrastructure. Cyberinfrastructure has focussed on the immediate demands of experimental and analytical work using large scale data and processing infrastructure, but the problems of recording, preserving, accessing and reusing the resultant data scientific outputs have largely been overlooked in the immediate gratification that comes from the ability to start undertaking Big Science. In the recent years, escience may have received a lot of attention, but the problem of long term information curation and management that it leaves in its wake has not. 
 
CIMS'07 is a workshop that aims to facilitate discussions and exchange off ideas among computer scientists working on cyberinfrastructure issues for scientific applications. We have accepted a set of exciting papers to be presented and discussed at the workshop. During the workshop, we hope to be able to redefine this new field, identify problems associated with creating computational infrastructure and more importantly on the curation, management, and preservation of the data for scientific applications, learn about exciting directions of research and propose some solutions to some problems that our participants have dealt with before. The workshop will discuss papers dealing with data modeling, data preservation, data and metadata visualization, tool support for scientific applications, and data mining tools for various cyberinfrastructure component.
