Summary form only given, as follows. The 5G system is about to be developed and the devices in IoT systems are expected to grow exponentially. There are many challenges that come with this development and growth â€“ one of which is how to efficiently use the available bandwidth. With devices needing to continuously exchange information via shared channels, deciding if, when and how much to transmit in efficient ways becomes important, especially when data stream flows continuously. Since transmission causes a drain on battery power, another challenge is how to design sensing and communication protocols that are energy efficient. The key objective here is to integrate cognitive abilities to these devices and device-to-device interactions to enable coordinated decision making that enhances the efficiency of the overall system. By integrating cognition, we mean enabling the sensors to exploit and mine available (and possibly correlated) data. In this presentation, we review some of the capabilities needed in 5G and IoT and show application of machine learning to make significant energy savings.
