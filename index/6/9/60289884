It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 7th ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC'07). This year's conference continues its tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research on Internet measurement: both on new techniques, and empirical studies that contribute to our understanding of that immensely-complex network known as the Internet. The conference covers a wide array of techniques from software tools to mathematical models, and these are applied to understand a variety of network issues from security, to topology and routing, to network traffic and performance, and even user behaviour. 
 
IMC was begun as a workshop in 2001, but due to its success was upgraded to a full conference in 2003, and that success has continued this year. The call for papers attracted 140 submissions from around the globe with 24 countries from five continents contributing papers. Even more impressive was the high quality of the submissions, which made selecting the program a difficult task. The program committee selected 18 short papers, and 21 long papers that provide a wide range of results from theory all the way to practical measurements of the Internet. Among the excellent submissions the committee singled out the paper "I Tube, You Tube, Everybody Tubes: Analyzing the World's Largest User Generated Video System", for the best paper award for a paper that makes its data sets publicly available (an award designed to encourage data sharing). One further paper of note was "Legal Issues Surrounding Monitoring During Network Research", which was selected as an invited paper because the paper should be of great interest to our community despite being different from the usual technical contributions to the conference.
