Understanding network behaviour under perturbations can improve the performance of current networks, as well as lead to a more resilient and survivable Future Internet. Therefore, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of the network behaviour when exposed to challenges, such as component failures, attacks, large-scale disasters, and effects of the mobile wireless communication environment. Furthermore, intelligent attacks with an adaptive scheme can cause the most damage. Recognition of network disruptions and their causes is crucial for planning and designing networks. In particular, the mobile ad hoc network (MANET) environment has a dynamic and intermittent connectivity resulting from channel fading and mobility of the nodes; hence, it is more complex and difficult to model these networks and apply challenges to them.
