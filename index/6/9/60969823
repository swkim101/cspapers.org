In this paper an improved image segmentation algorithm based on watershed transform is presented. Firstly the normalized cut method and watershed transform are explained and analyzed. Secondly the idea of the improved algorithm and the main formula are explained. We consider the area and perimeter when we merge adjacent regions. We define a new weight value and discuss the value of the parameter αand β. Finally the experiment result is presented. The new algorithm reduces the nodes and the computational demand of the common normalized cut technique.
