It is well-known that successfully researching, designing and building mobile systems and algorithms requires access to large-scale mobility data. Unfortunately, the wireless and mobile research communities lack such data. For instance, the largest publicly available human contact traces contain only 100 very sparsely connected nodes, a limitation of the experimental setup. We believe that large-scale datasets are important, not only in communication network design, but also for fundamental study in other academic disciplines, e.g., epidemiology, urban planning, and social science. An analogy can be made to the field of complex networks research, which flourished since 1989 when the first large datasets from the Internet (and subsequently the World Wide Web) became available. To achieve similar improvements in mobile networking and other related fields, relevant large-scale datasets must be made available.
