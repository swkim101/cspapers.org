Importance The article scrutinizes the transition to the non-resource-based model of the Russian economy through the systems approach to addressing imperfections of institutional, organizational and other conditions for national producers of goods, other than resources, eliminating impediments to manufacturing enterprises’ competitiveness and expanding Russia’s share of the international high technology markets. Objectives I determine what streamlines and impedes the development of high technology production so as to outline an appropriate model of the economy, which would not be based on resources, and choose tools of the governmental policy to facilitate the transition to such a model. Methods The research relies upon the methodology and methods for the systems analysis of the external and internal operational environment of the Russian enterprises. I refer to official statistical data, Russian Export Center, open corporate sources, and experts’ assessments from two international export forums. I analyze factors and conditions for a growth in the non-resource-based export using case studies. Results The article classifies key conditions for a competitive development of the high technology sector and formulates a set of measures to ensure the future growth of non-resource national companies on the basis of the State financial and non-financial aid. Conclusions and Relevance Successful solution, efficient cases and mechanisms of national companies’ competitiveness can underlie the model for developing technological producers in Russia as part of economic and institutional support of the non-resource-based export.
