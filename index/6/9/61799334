Integration of mobile devices in the m-learning systems provides the learner with scaffolding outside the classroom, it allows them to easily store, record and deliver multimedia content in real-time. The process of delivering multimedia learning objects (rich text, video, images, audio, animation, etc.) from the mlearning systems to the users requires more computational resources than mobile devices can provide. Considering the existence of different kinds of mobile browsers, which have limited support for HTML plugins (Flash, Java and Silverlight), we face the challenge to deliver the adapted multimedia contents in the interactive m-learning system. Installation of add-ons to the mobile browsers is just a provisional solution that is not always possible on each mobile device. Generally, the m-learning systems presented on the mobile device that not provide rich multimedia information leads to a degraded learning experience. In order to provide users with multimedia content that is suitable for their mobile devices and according to their needs we introduce the mobile cloud computing environment as paradigm that is ideal to overcome these problems. The proposed interactive mCloud system should provide high scale collaboration and interaction between the professor and students, in direction of increasing the quality of learning. The main focus is the delivery of multimedia learning objects to the users depending on the studentâ€™s cognitive style and adapting the content in accordance with the context-aware network conditions. The main task within this paper is to design a QoE model for estimating the multidimensional metric based on multimedia content adaptive features.
