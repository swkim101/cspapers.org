The slowdown and the nearing end of transistor scaling play a vital role in the rise of domain-specific architectures. Domain-specific architectures rely on “accelerators” that are specialized chips designed to efficiently execute dominating computation patterns and improve performance under a given transistor budget. Unfortunately, accelerators like FPGAs and ASIC chips are also implemented using transistors, and therefore abide by the same transistor limitations that motivated their deployment. The wide-spread of accelerators necessitates new ways to evaluate the impact of specialization in modern chips. We present a methodology that decouples specialization-driven benefits from transistor-driven benefits, and show that in popular accelerator applications specialization gains are less significant than transistor-driven gains.
