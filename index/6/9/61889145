2014 has been another incredible year for Ubiquitous Computing, as body worn, mobile, sensor rich technologies pervade every aspect of our daily lives and the augment the infrastructures and environments we inhabit, and instigates changes in our societies. Such technologies both enable new practices and behaviours, but also challenge us to consider the role and impact of such technologies are having on our lives, and even to question our very rights and entitlements. This year's program reflects the full gamut of these endeavours, from fundamental techniques in sensing, activity recognition, and security on mobiles, to focused interventions in healthcare and for specialist applications. We are particularly delighted to welcome our keynote, Gaetano Borriello, who's work on Open Data Kit is leading to new Applications of Mobile Devices in the Developing World, inspiring us to think how we might transform lives using ubiquitous technologies within our own work.
