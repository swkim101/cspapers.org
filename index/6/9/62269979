The ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language and Design has its roots in the 1979 Symposium on Compiler Construction, and has grown to be the premiere conference in its area. While computer science has matured to include many other subfields, the core area PLDI represents needs to remain vital and current. The difficult job of the program committee in 2007, and the selection of a record number of papers, is a welcome sign of this vitality. . 
 
In my role as General Chair, I would like to thank our Program Chair, Professor Kathryn McKinley, Tutorial Chair, Professor Michelle Mills Strout, Poster Chair, Stephen Fink, and Submissions Chair, Maria Jump, as well as our program committee members, for their excellent job. I also acknowledge the strong organizational support from ACM and my assistant Cheryl Eng. 
 
Finally, I'd like to reflect on two defining moments in our community this year. Two giants in the area of programming languages, Joseph Goguen and Ken Kennedy, passed away, and our community mourns their passing. More joyously, the A.M. Turing Award this year goes to one of the founders of our area, Frances Allen, for "contributions that fundamentally improved the performance of computer programs in solving problems, and accelerated the use of high performance computing." We honor and celebrate Fran's achievements at FCRC and PLDI 2007.
