Cognitive Informatics is a field that studies internal information processing mechanism of the human brain and its application in software coding and computing. This paper attempts to empirically demonstrate the amount of information contained in software and develops a concept of cognitive information complexity measure based on the information contained in the software. It is found that software with higher cognitive information complexity measure has more information units contained in it. Therefore cognitive information complexity measure can be used to understand the cognitive information complexity and the information coding efficiency of the software. For any complexity measure to be robust, Weyuker properties must be satisfied to qualify as good and comprehensive one. In this paper, an attempt has also been made to evaluate cognitive information complexity measure in terms of nine Weyuker properties, through examples. It has been found that all the nine properties have been satisfied by cognitive information complexity measure and hence establishes cognitive information complexity measure based on information contained in the software as a robust and well-structured one.
