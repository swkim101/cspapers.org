In this paper, we present an adaptation for hypergraph partitioning of the multilevel cooperative search paradigm first introduce by Toulouse, Thulasiraman, and Glover [15]. We also introduce a new approach for coarsening hypergraphs, and describe a parallel implementation of this algorithm on the SGI O200 system. Experiments on ISPD98 benchmark suite of circuits show, for 4-way and 8-way partitioning, a reduction of 3% to 15% on hyperedge-cut compared to hMETIS. Bisections of hypergraphs based on our algorithm also outperforms hMETIS, although more modestly.
