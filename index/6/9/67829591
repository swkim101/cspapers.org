Much research on biometric technology and information system focuses on privacy and security such as access control and information security. Few researches infer issues and challenges in biometrics and how they relate to privacy and security within biometric technology. Thus, this research investigates how issues and challenges in biometric are correlated with privacy and security of data and information in biometric technology and organizational information system network. The outcomes would assist organizational management to determine whether implementing biometric technology invades. A survey that has been conducted on fingerprint and facial recognition (aged in between 20-50) found that there is a substantial relationship between biometric user authentication system and privacy and security of user data and information. Additionally, the implementation of biometric technology for user authentication and access control draw the attention and curiosity and this technology were not apparent to be depraved, abusive and fierce. Biometric technology that contains user information is more efficient in identification and verification purpose and does not need to remember like password but once stolen could not be replaced. The outcomes further point out that biometric data and information are irreplaceable and once compromised, then cannot be replaced or changed like passwords. Biometrics technology is apposite and user friendly even though the contentious stratagem of data uniqueness and its cost of stolen. Organization management should therefore carefully understand the need of organization and the feature and risk factor of biometric technology should be considered while implementing it.
