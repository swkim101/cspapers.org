According to knowledge sharing&reusing problem and system extensibility&portability problem in meteorological and hydrological support, the knowledge concepts, attributes, instances, hierarchy and relationships were clarified; the ontological knowledge base was established by OWL ontology language and SWRL rule language. With the help of Racer, Protégé, Jess, and class positioning algorithm, class testing algorithm, rule testing algorithm, the meteorological and hydrological support prototype system was implemented by Eclipse, ProtegeInEclipse plug-in and Jena. The system includes the server, the client and the processing controller. It provides artificial intelligence techniques means for knowledge maintenance and usage in meteorological and hydrological field.
