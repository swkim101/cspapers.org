Real time systems are defined to investigate how time is involved in their general requirements. The authors review the concept of time from a general perspective and the role of time within computer science is discussed. The means to express and enforce timing constraints are found to be lacking. A different approach is taken in developing a concept of time that is adequate for the specification and design of real time systems. The implications for specification of real time systems are outlined and a method is presented that demonstrates how time can be used for synchronisation purposes.
