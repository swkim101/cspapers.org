The Doctoral Symposium of ESEC/FSE aims at creating a forum for PhD students working in the area of software engineering to present and discuss their research goals, methods, and preliminary results with senior researchers from the software engineering community, in a constructive and friendly atmosphere. Besides providing a setting whereby students receive feedback on their research and guidance on future directions from the doctoral symposium panel, the meeting fosters the creation of a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research, also through interaction of the participants with other researchers at the main conference. 
 
Both mature and initial stage students were invited to submit abstracts describing their research of 4 and 2 pages respectively. Of these, 8 submissions were chosen for publication in the conference proceedings. Selection was based on two criteria: interest and soundness of the proposed research theme and potential for interesting discussion and feedback.
