Design grammars have been successfully applied in numerous engineering disciplines, e.g. in electrical engineering, architecture and mechanical engineering. A successful application of design grammars in Computational Design Synthesis (CDS) requires a) a meaningful representation of designs and the design task at hand, b) a careful formulation of grammar rules to synthesize new designs, c) problem specific design evaluations, and d) the selection of an appropriate algorithm to guide the synthesis process. Managing these different aspects of CDS requires not only a detailed understanding of each individual part, but also of the interdependencies between them. In this paper, a new method is presented to analyze the exploration of design spaces in CDS. The method analyzes the designs generated during the synthesis process and visualizes how the design space is explored with respect to a) design characteristics, and b) objectives. The selected algorithm as well as the grammar rules can be analyzed with this approach to support the human designer in successfully understanding and applying a CDS method. The case study demonstrates how the method is used to analyze the synthesis of bicycle frames. Two algorithms are compared for this task. Results demonstrate how the method increases the understanding of the different components in CDS. The presented research can be useful for both novices to CDS to help them gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between grammar rules and guidance of the synthesis process, as well as for experts aiming to further improve their CDS application by improving parameter settings of their search algorithms, or by further refining their design grammar. Additionally, the presented method constitutes a novel approach to interactively visualize design space exploration considering not only designs objectives, but also the characteristics and interdependencies of different designs.Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME
