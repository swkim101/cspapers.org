An aspectual pattern is a pattern that captures a generic aspect. It is argued that the realization of an aspect in the form of a pattern is beneficial because various mechanisms available in generic pattern-based environments become available for aspects as well. These benefits follow mostly from the fact that the structural information concerning an aspect is clearly defined and preserved (as a pattern) separately from the actual system description. We demonstrate the concept of an aspectual pattern and its application in the case of the JUnit testing framework. A prototype tool environment supporting aspectual patterns in UML has been developed.
