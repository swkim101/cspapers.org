The recuperator tube of ammonia condenser on a factory was made of 316L stainless steel and pitted after used for only one year. By the macro and micro morphological analysis, water analysis and structural and operation condition examination, the results indicate that this failure started from wall and the high content of Cl~- and impurity in the cooling water destroyed the passivation film and made the pitting corrosion happen.
