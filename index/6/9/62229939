The Series Dynamic Voltage Regulator can compensate the harmonics distortion caused by voltage type harmonic source This paper presents a new approach of detecting harmonic voltage in dq0 coordinates, based on the generalized instantaneous reactive power ,and used in the series dynamic voltage regulator successfully. It is demonstrated by theoretical analysis and simulation results that the proposed detecting method of harmonic voltage is correct and valid.
