Project management tools are mandatory to properly manage a software project. The teaching of these tools is carried out in superior computer courses, but often the instructional strategies are used in an ad-hoc manner. This study aims to analyze the literature about teaching of the usage of project management tools and to identify the instructional strategies and the utilized tools. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify the most significant studies that report experiences on this context. After analyzing more than 2700 studies a total of 5 primary studies were selected, and then others were manually included. The instructional strategies and the utilized tools are presented, highlighting the main functionalities and educational features of these tools, as well as the instructional activities carried out to meet the educational goals. Concluding with a discussion of the advances and gaps that remain in this area. Keywords-Project Management; Project Management Tools; PMBOK; Systematic Literature Review; Teaching; Education.
