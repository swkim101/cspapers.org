The 10th International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS 2015) is being held in Firenze, Italy on 18-19 May 2015. Welcome to the proceedings! Many more domains are requiring software systems to be adaptive to changing contexts, environments and requirements, to be resilient in the face of uncertainty and error, and to be composed and managed at run time. SEAMS provides a venue to present novel self-adaptive applications and domains, and to formulate and discuss methods for engineering such systems in a methodical and assurable way.
