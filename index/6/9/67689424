Importance Strategic goals of the socio-economic development management depend on the effective use of the region’s potential capabilities. There is a need in the increased food security strategy and its implementation mechanism. In providing the region with the supply of strategic food products, managerial decision-makers shall have mathematical rationale based on respective tools. Objectives We outline a methodological approach to evaluating, modeling and forecasting the sufficiency of the region’s stock of strategic food resources, socio-economic sustainability of its development. These processes are important to strengthen food security of certain constituent entities of the Russian Federation and the State as a whole so to develop the regional agri-food system and integrate it into interregional economic relations and global economic market on equal terms. Methods The research relies upon methods of comparative, mathematical-statistical, econometric (regression, correlation, factor, variance, statistical hypothesis testing, simultaneous equations models) analysis and modeling. The research also draws upon the classification and zoning. Results We substantiate that the balanced and reasonable structure of food production is feasible if there is an effective mechanism coordinating needs, consumption and production. We comprehensively evaluated the Russian constituent entities’ stock of strategic food resources through econometric modeling. We devised the methodological approach to making managerial decisions for improvements. The article suggests principal functional steps of the regional food strategy. Conclusions and Relevance The findings can be used for evaluation, comparative analysis of the regional system and predict the sustainability of their development.
