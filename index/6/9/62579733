The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the application of Differential Evolution to a realistic design optimization test problem. The present contribution regards the improvements implemented to the original basic algorithm as well as the application of a new algorithm for dealing with the unique challenges associated with real world optimization problems. The selected example is a three-dimensional vehicular structure optimization problem modeled using the commercial Finite Element software ANSYS® that has a combination of continuous and discrete design variables. The use of traditional gradient-based optimization algorithms is thus not practical. The numerical results presented indicate that the Differential Evolution algorithm is able to find the optimum design for the proposed problem. The algorithm is robust in the sense that it is capable of dealing with the numerical noise involved in the modeling of the system and to manipulate discrete design variables, accordingly.© 2007 ASME
