• Inverse planning refers to the problem of learning a probabilistic model of the dynamics of a robot (or a human) by observing her optimal behavior performing a given task. • This work extends previous work on inverse reinforcement learning [Ng et Russell, 2000, Ramachandran & Amir, 2007, Baker et al., 2009] to the problem of learning a transition function when a reward function is given. •We show that inverse planning can be efficiently used for cooperative planning in teams of heterogenous robots.
