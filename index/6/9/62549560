Because of the integration of three networks in China, search requirements with multimedia information will increase. The contents on TV, computer and cell phone are different in format and protocol not to intercommunication and share. When the national policy demand makes the division up, the content provider must provide formats and adapter mechanisms which are intercommunicated. As precondition of Three Screen Adaption, TCP/IP PROTOCOL Monitoring's accuracy determines the effect of three screen fusion directly. In this paper, the methods of protocol monitoring are introduced firstly. With comparing, the existing monitoring's accuracy can't meet the requirement of three screen protocol adaption. Then a new protocol monitoring model in three screen protocol adaption environment is proposed and protocol recognizer is designed and optimized with HMM technique. It will simplify development and publishing information unified that three screen equipment access the same protocol monitoring model, which has important practical value and application prospect.
