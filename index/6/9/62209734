This paper describes the design and implementation of executing ELF files on an ARM based multi-process mono-kernel embedded operating system, including overview of ELF files, and key techniques of loading and executing ELF files. At the final, the paper provides some demo examples to show the effects of a simple shell interpreter and typical shell commands, echo, date, and pwd. The entire embedded operating system including the routines of executing ELF files are developed by the author of this paper on Linux with GNU tool chain, based on which more powerful shell interpreter and shell commands analogous to that of embedded Linux can be designed.
