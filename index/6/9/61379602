It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the City Data Management Workshop 2012 (CDMW'12), co-located with the 21st ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2012) at Hawaii, USA. The workshop aims to provide a forum to discuss challenges and opportunities of city data management and to promote interaction among experts in different domains. In this regard, one of the main objectives includes the positioning of the city data management topic among the other types of data management (e.g. enterprise, Web) by identifying its unique characteristics (e.g. heterogeneity, openness, geospatially, privacy, data source variety etc.) and by listing the requirements for managing such data. Another objective is also to show how the particular challenges (e.g. urban planning, resource optimization, emergency evacuation, transportation planning) of cities can be addressed by the information contained within the vast amount of available heterogeneous city data. Thus CDMW'12 gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of city data management. 
 
The CDMW'12 program committee accepted 3 papers that cover a variety of topics, including data integration, data mapping, provenance, urban planning, ubiquitous sensing, spatial aggregation and high performance computing over city data. In addition, this year we have co-located CDMW'12 with the 2012 International Workshop on Web-scale Knowledge Representation, Retrieval, and Reasoning (Web-KR 2012). Thus we are delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the topic of city data management together with researchers from the Web, high performance computing, knowledge mmanagement and representation, and machine learning in a great depth.
