Adhoc network is composed of mobile nodes having dynamic topology .The nodes sends the data packet to the other nodes by forwarding mechanism. The black hole is a malicious node that advertises itself as a node through which the path to the destination is present. The nodes send the data packet to the black hole considering it as a right path. The problem with the black hole is that it drops the packet or sends it to a route away from the destination. In this paper present various aspects of black hole attack that tells the reasons and the problem in the network due to black hole.
