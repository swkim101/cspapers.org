According to the problem of parameter selection and feature extraction for vibration diagnosis of traditional internal combustion engine is discussed. The method based on S-transformation and Module Two Dimensional Principal Components Analysis (M-2DPCA) is proposed to carry out fault diagnosis of I.C. Engine valve mechanism. First of all, the method transfers cylinder surface vibration signals of I.C. into images through S-transform. The second, extracting the optimized projection vectors from the general distribution matrix G which is obtained by all sample sub-images, so that vibration spectrum images can be modularized using M-2DPCA. The last, these features matrix obtained from images project will served as the enters of nearest neighbor classifier, it is used to achieve fault typesâ€™ division. The method is applied to the diagnosis example of the vibration signal of the valve mechanism eight operating modes, recognition rate up to 94.17 percent; the effectiveness of the proposed method is proved.
