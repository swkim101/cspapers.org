This paper summarizes ISO 24617-8 (ISO DR-Core), a new part of the ISO SemAF framework for semantic annotation. Within this framework a range of standards is developed to support the interoperable annotation of semantic phenomena. The effort to develop a standard for the annotation of semantic relations in discourse is split into two parts, of which ISO 24617-8 concerns the first part, formulating desiderata for the annotation of discourse relations and providing clear definitions for a set of ‘core’ discourse relations, based on an analysis of a range of theoretical approaches and annotation efforts. Following the ISO principles for semantic annotation, an abstract syntax as well as a concrete XML-based syntax for annotations were defined, together with a formal semantics. Mappings are provided between the ISO core relations and various other annotation schemes.
