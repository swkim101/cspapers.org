A deterministic model is constructed for preliminary design of non-terminal railroad stations. Monotonicity analysis is used to obtain a simple and rigorous procedure for optimizing the principal design characteristics of the station layout. The resulting design procedure has no iterative computations and can be automated for parametric studies. This provides a rational basis for design decisions when architectural and esthetic considerations are included.
