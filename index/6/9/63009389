Playfair cipher is the form of block cipher which has no limit on the number of characters in a message it can do, but it operates on block of characters encrypting and decrypting two characters at a time cipher. In this, the plain text digrams are converted to cipher text digrams and vice versa using a pre-shared key. This is achieved by performing several operations column wise row wise and by creating rectangular form. Even so the traditional 5 x 5 Playfair cipher supports twenty five uppercase alphabets only. To overcome this drawback, various authors have proposed extended Playfair cipher. This paper deals with the study of these variations proposed by different authors on the basis of some parameters.
