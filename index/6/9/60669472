An in-depth study on different control algorithms reveals that the performance of a particular control scheme depends mainly on the wise selection of the control algorithm after detailed study of the process behaviour. As a step towards standardisation in process-control computer, capable of handling any process optimally irrespective of its inherent behaviour, the idea suggested is to maintain a library of control modules from which few modules may be chosen selectively and configured in a particular sequence to build the final and best control strategy. The paper also presents the general structure of the individual modules and of the configurator block. >
