Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is a sub class of mobile adhoc networks. VANET provides wireless communication among vehicles and vehicle to road side equipments. The communication between vehicles is used for safety, comfort and for entertainment as well. The performance of communication depends on how better the routing takes place in the network & traffic scenario determines reliability and capability of transmission of information which is the important characteristics that are necessary for the performance analysis of VANET. Routing of data depends on the routing protocols being used in network. TCP/FTP (Transmission Control Protocol/File Transmission Protocol) and UDP/CBR (User Datagram Protocol/Constant Bit Rate) traffic are two different traffic pattern used in this paper to generate Random Traffic for wireless scenario and are compared. And the better traffic type is used for the further performance evaluation of different ad hoc routing protocols for VANET is investigated in city scenario. The main aim of the study was to identify which ad hoc routing method has better performance in highly mobile environment of VANET. Discrete event simulator NS-2.35 is used for simulation in this paper.
