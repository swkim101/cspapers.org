This paper addresses the long-standing problem of feature representation in the natural world for autonomous navigation systems. The proposed representation combines Isomap, a non-linear manifold learning algorithm, with Expectation Maximisation, a statistical learning scheme. The representation is computed off-line and results in a compact, nonlinear, non-Gaussian sensor likelihood model. This model can be easily integrated into estimation algorithms for navigation and tracking. The compactness of the model makes it especially attractive for deployment in decentralised sensor networks. Real sensory data from unstructured terrestrial environments is used to demonstrate the versatility of the computed likelihood model. The experimental results show that this approach can provide consistent models of natural environments to facilitate complex visual tracking and data association problems.
