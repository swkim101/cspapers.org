This paper develops practical stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) methods under error bound conditions with theoretical guarantee. Error bound conditions, an inherent property of the optimization problem, have recently revived in optimization for developing fast algorithms with improved global convergence without strong convexity. A particular condition of interest is the quadratic error bound (aka the second-order growth condition), which is weaker than strong convexity but can be leveraged for developing linear convergence for many gradient and proximal gradient methods. Several recent studies have also derived linear convergence under the quadratic error bound condition of the stochastic variance reduced gradient method, itself an important milestone in stochastic optimization for solving machine learning problems. However, these studies have overlooked the critical issue of algorithmic dependence on an unknown parameter (analogous to the strong convexity modulus) in the error bound conditions, which is usually difficult to estimate and therefore makes the algorithm not practical for solving many interesting machine learning problems. To address this issue, we propose novel techniques to automatically search for the unknown parameter on the fly of optimization, while maintaining almost the same convergence rate as an oracle setting assuming the involved parameter is given.
