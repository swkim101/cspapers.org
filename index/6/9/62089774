In Databases one of the active research fields is mapping relational databases (RDB) into Resource Description Framework (RDF). An enormous data is kept in the form of relational databases and accessing of data is done in the semantic web. The data stored in RDB is to be efficiently mapped to the semantic web or RDF for data availability to the users. There is a definite need for improvement in technologies for efficient mapping languages from RDB to RDF in semantic web. This paper presents an up-to-date survey of different RDB to RDF mapping languages proposed in recent times. It outlines the main features or characteristics to be considered for efficient mapping in different scenarios. The main objective of this content, pictures identification of limitations existing in the mapping languages. It also enhances the comparisons between each language and helps researchers to propose further better proposals in their future scope of work to improve better mapping techniques.
