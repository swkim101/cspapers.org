Service-oriented Architectures obviously improve the design of Information Systems IS. Moreover, the omnipresence and the diversity of devices led to the development of new infrastructures which encourage the use of multiple interaction techniques to use IS. In this article, we present an architecture of evolution control which supports the adaptation of applications according to discovered services or devices, by respecting the preferences of the users as well at the level of the information system as the level of the support of interaction.
