This paper describes some of the results and algorithms from the development of a compiler utility for an Architecture Description Language π-ADL, for the .NET platform. Architecture Description Languages or ADLs, are special purpose high level languages especially construed to define software architectures. π-ADL, a recent addition to this class of languages, is formally based on the π-Calculus, a process oriented formal method. The compiler for π-ADL, named π-ADL .NET, is designed with the view of bringing the architecture driven software design approach to the .NET platform. 
 
The process oriented nature and a robust set of parallelism constructs of π-ADL make the π-ADL.NET project a novel application of compiler techniques in the context of the .NET platform, with many valuable lessons learnt. This paper presents the π-ADL.NET effort from a compiler design perspective, and also documents the motivation, vision and future possibilities for this line of work.
