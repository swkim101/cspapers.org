For large software systems, requirements are always changing and new requirements inevitably emerge. Therefore, most of the software systems erode of their original documentations. To control this erosion, the extraction of the systemâ€™s architecture has been widely proposed. The extraction of a software architecture from existing systems is the science of analyzing and converting the source code to a software architecture. While several automatic extraction processes proved to be very efficient, there is no tool allowing an architect to build his own extraction process, integrate his knowledge and interact with the process. Thus, our main contribution in this field is providing a manner that gives an architect the ability to build his own extraction process and interact with the process. The proposed approach is based on KNIME, a KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) tool that allows a user to build a process in order to discover new knowledge from different databases. Thus, our approach consists at extending KNIME into the software architecture extraction field by adding new functionalities enabling the architecture extraction from the source code.
