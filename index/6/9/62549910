The multi-billion dollar market for SQL database management software is supported by ongoing national and international standardization efforts. Under the auspices of ANSI and I SO, committees of experts are actively working to add object extensions to SQL. There is no clear marketplace consensus, however, on how to best accommodate objects in the relational database world. Vendors of object-oriented database management systems believe that they represent the next generation of technology. Others, including participants in the Object Management Group, are convinced that database is only a small part of the object-oriented challenge Some question the focus on SQL; they want to jettison SQLâ€™s many compromises by returning to the theoretical relational model while im tegrating object and relational concepts.
