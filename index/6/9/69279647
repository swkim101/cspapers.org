The main goal of our demonstration is to show how omniscient debugging can be applied in practice to cognitive agents. A concrete implementation of the mechanisms proposed in [Koeman et al., 2017] has been created for the GOAL agent programming language in the Eclipse environment, integrated with the source-level debugger of [Koeman et al., 2016], thus fully implementing the proposal within a state-of-the-art setting. The implementation will be used together with typical agent programs to demonstrate its practical use.
