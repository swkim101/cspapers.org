Welcome to CIKM 2005 -- the Fourteenth ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management. The Organizing Committee, and also the numerous sponsors wanted it to be a premier place for the participants to exchange the latest results in the strongly interrelated fields of information retrieval, data bases, and knowledge management.This year, the conference is held the first time outside the United States of America: it takes place in Bremen, Germany, not only one of the famous old European Hanse Cities and one of the contemporary sixteen German States, but also City of Science in Germany for 2005. This fits very well the goal of this conference and all the co-located workshops: staying abreast of the scientific progress and exchanging ideas. We look forward to host the top scientist working in the three conference fields and the workshop subjects.
