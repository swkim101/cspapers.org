FormaliSE is a yearly workshop on Formal Methods in Software Engineering. FormaliSE is organized by FME (Formal Methods Europe) and is co-located with ICSE (International Conference on Software Engineering). The main goal of the workshop is to foster integration between the formal methods and the software engineering communities. The lack of formalization in key places makes software engineering overly sensitive to the weaknesses that are inevitable in the complex activities behind software creation. This is where formal methods (FMs) have a huge opportunity.
