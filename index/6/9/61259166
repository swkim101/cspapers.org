We are delighted to welcome you to the 2012 ACM SIGPLAN X10 Workshop | X10'12. This second edition of the workshop provided a forum for X10 developers, researchers, and educators to interact with the larger X10 community by sharing their insights, experiences, and plans. 
 
The call for papers attracted eight submission. The program committee accepted six papers that cover a variety of topics, including applications written in X10, compilers for X10, garbage collection for X10, libraries for X10, and compilers that use X10 as a target language. Slides for all presentations are available at the workshop website (x10-lang.org). We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for programming language researchers, educators, and developers. 
 
In addition to the six presentations, the program also included an introduction to the language, a discussion of future language directions and community feedback, as well as several invited talks.
