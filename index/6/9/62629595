Advances in process technology have enabled integrated circuits to approximately double in complexity every year. Todayâ€™s VLSI circuits are approaching 500,000 transistors; and we envision 5 and 50 million device circuits in the not too distant future. While process technology has driven the increase in circuit complexity, the design tools have lagged behind and constrained the designlsr. Even with the rapidly accumulating knowledge of VLSI design, the time required to design, layout and test VLSI circuits is growing linearly with the complexity of the circuits. New tools, oriented toward dramatically increasing productivity, are necessary to avoid design catastrophe.
