A new multiphysics method is presented for coupled neutronics and thermal fluids calculations in the VHTR. This new method combines the capabilities of two existing solvers: the COMET neutronics solver, and a thermal fluids module designed specifically for the gas-cooled reactor lattice design featured in this next-generation reactor. This paper provides the necessary background on the neutronics and thermal fluids aspects of the new solution strategy and explains the mode of coupling. A test problem is presented in order to prove the efficacy of the new coupled method.Results are given for a whole-core VHTR, including detailed temperature information at the fuel pin level, explicit power calculations of individual pins, and a thermal map of the bulk graphite and coolant temperatures throughout the core. Solutions are determined quickly when compared to other methods which offer the same level of detail and accuracy, and thus justify further research and development of this method in the near future.
