It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2010 ACM International Workshop on mmWave Communications: from Circuits to Networks (mmCom'10). This workshop presents research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of mmWave communications. The workshop brings experts from academia and industry together and covers topics from protocol and hardware design to standardization and product development. 
 
The program consists of eleven high quality papers which are presented in three sessions: The first session covers network architecture, protocols and algorithms as well as cross layer design for support of high performance applications. The second session focuses on coding, antenna design and beamforming techniques. And the last session covers mmWave band channel modeling as well as implementation challenges faced by mmWave developers. In addition, the program includes a panel entitled mmWave Communications: What is the killer Application and How to Make it Happen? and a keynote speech by Dr. Ali Sadri on Defining the Future of Multi-Gigabit mmWave Wireless Communications. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers in the field of mmWave communications.
