The PC industry was the major consumer of silicon in the 80’s and 90’s. In a world dominated by PC’s, clock frequency was the ultimate measure of performance. Times have changed. Today the internet, wireless communications and consumer applications such as high end gaming stations have replaced the PC as the primary driver. How we measure ‘cutting edge’ has also changed. Raw computing speed measured in terms of clock speed has given way to altemate forms of measuring performance MBits/s, MMACS, and Polygonshec now capture the differing computation requirements for these domains. Depending on the application domain, weight and power are just as important if not more important than raw computational power. How do these changes drive technology development in EDA? Which of these is the dominant EDA driver? How much of this drive is a function of EDA following the money? How much of this drive is a function of unique technical challenges posed by these domains? This diverse set of panelists with representation from various application segments and the EDA industry will attempt to answer these questions. It defined the requirements for EDA.
