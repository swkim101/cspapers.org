Complex systems often have long life cycles with requirements that are likely to change over time. Therefore, it is important to be able to adapt the system accordingly over time. This is often accomplished by infusing new technologies into the host system in order to update or improve overall system performance. However, technology infusion often results in a disruption in the host system. This can take the form of a system redesign or a change in the inherent attributes of the system. In this study, we analyzed the impact of technology infusion on system attributes, specifically the complexity and modularity. Two different systems that were infused with new technologies were analyzed for changes in complexity and modularity.Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME
