The 1 PHDA 2013 is building on successful events run by the chairs: the ehealth 2009-11 conference (http://electronic-health.org/) held in Istanbul, Casablanca and Malaga, the DDD 2012 conference in Boston (http://healthmap.org/ddd/) and the EE2 workshop (http://www.isi.it/events/ee2) in Courmayer in 2012. We succeeded in our ambitious aim of bringing together professionals from computing and medical backgrounds which will make the workshop a truly unique event. The formal and social discussions promise to generate cross-fertilisation of ideas and numerous stimuli for new collaborations.
