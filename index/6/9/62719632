The ageing of pressure vessel steels under radiation has been correlated with the formation of more or less dilute solute clusters which are investigated in this work using a multiscale approach based on ab initio and atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo (AKMC) simulations. The microstructure evolution of Fe alloys is modeled by AKMC on a lattice, using pair interactions adjusted on DFT calculations. Several substitutional elements (Cu, Ni, Mn, Si, P) and foreign interstitials (C, N) are taken into account to describe the alloy. The point defect created by the irradiation, i.e. the vacancies and self interstitials have a tendency to form clusters. The evolution of these clusters is governed by the migration energy of the individual point defects which is very heavy in terms of computing time due to the large number of AKMC steps required. The structure of all the possible objects that can form is complex and some optimized and accelerated methods will be presented.
