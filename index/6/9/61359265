In a text-production system high and special demands are placed on the grammar and the lexicon. This paper will view these components in such a system (overview in section 1). First, the subcomponents dealing with semantic information and with syntactic information will be presented separately (section 2). The problems of relating these two types of information are then identified (section 3). Finally, strategies designed to meet the problems are proposed and discussed (section 4). One of the issues that will be illustrated is what happens when a systemic linguistic approach is combined with a KL-ONE like knowledge representation - a novel and hitherto unexplored combination.
