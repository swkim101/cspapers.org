Space time block code combined with spatial modulation forms the space time block coded spatial modulation (STBC-SM), is proposed in MIMO transmission scheme. In STBC-SM, information bits get transferred through symbol pair and antenna pair selections, i.e. transmitted through time, space domain and spatial domain. Advantage of STBC-SM is high spectral efficiency which is given by antenna domain and STBC-SM is optimized by deriving its diversity and coding gain to minimize the BER which is the advantage of STBC. Low complexity maximum likelihood (ML) decoder is used in this scheme which gains from the orthogonality of the STBC core. Analysis is carried out for various dimensions of MIMO systems. (7 pages)
