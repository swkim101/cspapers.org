This paper presents a new technique for topology optimization of fluid channels using generative design methods. The proposed method uses the generative abilities of graph grammars with simulation and analysis power of conventional CFD methods. The graph grammar interpreter GraphSynth is used to carry out graph transformations, which define different topologies for a given multi-inlet multi-outlet problem. The generated graphs are first transformed into meaningful 3D shapes. These solutions are then analyzed by a CFD solver to find the optimum. The effectiveness of the proposed method is checked by solving a variety of available test problems and comparing them with those found in the literature. Furthermore by solving complex problems the robustness and effectiveness of the method is tested.Copyright Â© 2013 by ASME
