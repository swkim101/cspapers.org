The optimal solution of economic-environmental dispatch not only leads to the condition of least generation cost but minimize the pollutant emission of power plants. Multi-Objective Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (MOQPSO) algorithm based on Pareto Dominant strategy and crowding distance ordering is used to solve this multi-objective problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by calculation example.
