This paper sets out to present the integration of the scheduling of deadline-constrained checkpointing in a batch scheduler for dynamic environments such as virtual clusters. The checkpointing scheduler implemented focuses on the parallel checkpointing on a unique server of long-running independent applications in a virtual cluster made up of free resources for long periods of an intranet network, assuming that the resources must be released within a delay T . As parallel checkpointing on a unique server can face bandwidth constraints, the checkpointing scheduler uses a func tion that gives the aggregated bandwidth suitable for the parallel checkpointing of m applications of aggregated size V to solve the deadline-constrained checkpointing problem within the deadline T. Specifically, we present the integration of the checkpointing scheduler in the batch scheduler OAR. This implementation uses data from the OAR database for the checkpointing scheduling. It is portable and can be easily modified to interact with any other batch scheduler, provided that the structure of the database is known and an estimator of the bandwidth of the system suitable for parallel checkpointing available. Experimental results obtained on a virtual cluster built on GRID5000 show that the implementation of the checkpointing scheduler does not induce a significant overhead on checkpointing mechanisms. As a consequence, this work aims at providing HPC platforms for a tool to enhance the quality of services offered to end users.
