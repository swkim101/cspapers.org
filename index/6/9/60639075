OpenInterface Kernel is a lightweight open-source plat-form designed for supporting the effective prototyping of multimodal interactive systems. Iterative design of such applications requires the easy integration, replacement, interconnection or upgrade of components. OpenInterface provides a thin integration platform able to manage these key elements with little programming knowledge, and thus provide the research community a tool to fill the gap in the current support for multimodal applications implementation. The platform offers non-intrusive tools and techniques to assemble various modalities developed with different implementation technologies, while keeping a high level of performance of the integrated system.
