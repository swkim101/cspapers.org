Today’s electronic devices are multi-faceted, software-intensive systems that interact with the real world. These interactions create a new kind of complexity that increases pressure on engineering teams to deliver the right product under shrinking schedules. These multi-disciplinary teams are inhibited by gaps between the different tools and workflows they must use for system concept development, hardware design, and software development. Unless we connect these tools, we’ll continue to see missed deadlines and spiraling verification costs.
