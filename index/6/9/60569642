The fidelity – that is, the error, precision and accuracy – of the crystallographic orientations and disorientations obtained by the classical two-dimensional Hough-transform-based analysis of electron backscatter diffraction patterns (EBSPs) is studied. Using EBSPs simulated based on the dynamical electron diffraction theory, the fidelity analysis that has been previously performed using the patterns simulated based on the theory of kinematic electron diffraction is improved. Using the same patterns, the efficacy of a Fisher-distribution-based analytical accuracy measure for orientation and disorientation is verified.
