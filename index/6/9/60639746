A holder for a roll of paper has a back plate, a hollow side extending laterally from each end of the back plate, a cavity defined in each side, an opening defined in one end of each side and communicating with the cavity, a through hole defined in each side, a frame securely received in the cavity of each side and a tube post pivotally mounted on the frame and extending outward from the through hole of the side. A biasing member laterally extends from each end of each tube post and engages with the frame. By such an arrangement, the holder has no metal parts so the holder will not get rusty in any wet environment. The useful life of the holder will be prolonged.
