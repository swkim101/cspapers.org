Deep learning based automatic feature extraction methods have radically transformed speaker identification and facial recognition. Current approaches are typically specialized for individual domains, such as Deep Vectors (D-Vectors) for speaker identification. We provide two distinct contributions: a generalized framework for biometric verification inspired by D-Vectors and novel models that outperform current stateof-the-art approaches. Our approach supports substitution of various feature extraction models and improves the robustness of verification tests across domains. We demonstrate the framework and models for two different behavioral biometric verification problems: keystroke and mobile gait. We present a comprehensive empirical analysis comparing our framework to the state-of-the-art in both domains. Our models perform verification with higher accuracy using orders of magnitude less data than state-of-the-art approaches in both domains. We believe that the combination of high accuracy and practical data requirements will enable application of behavioral biometric models outside of the laboratory in support of much-needed improvements to cyber security.
