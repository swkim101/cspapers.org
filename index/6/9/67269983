Both the current trends in technology such as smart phones, general mobile devices, stationary sensors and satellites, as well as a new user mentality of utilizing this technology to voluntarily share information, produce a huge flood of geo-spatial data enriched by multiple types of information or contexts, such as social, text, multimedia data and scientific measurements. This data flood provides a tremendous potential of discovering new and useful knowledge. The novel research challenge is to search and mine this wealth of multi-enriched geo-spatial data. The aim of the GeoRich workshop is to provide a unique forum for discussing in depth the challenges, opportunities, novel techniques and applications on modeling, managing, searching and mining rich geo-spatial data, in order to fuel scientific research on big spatial data applications. The focus of the fourth installment of GeoRich is to analyze what has been achieved so far and how to further exploit the enormous potential of this data flood. Its ultimate goal is to develop a general framework of methods for searching and mining enriched geo-spatial data in order to fuel an advanced analysis of big data applications beyond the current research frontiers. This year's workshop brought together researchers from different fields of databases, data-science and geo-science that deal with the management of spatial and spatio-temporal data, social network data, textual data, multimedia data, semantic data and ontologies, uncertain data, and other common types of geo-referenced data. In total, GeoRich 2017 had a total of 10 research paper submissions out of which 8 research papers have been accepted for presentation.
