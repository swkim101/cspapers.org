This paper presents an ant-colony approach for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). The fast local search and insertion (FLS&I) methods used are based on well known heuristics, were implemented in C as Matlab mexfunc- tions, and were tested against the well known Solomon benchmark for the VRPTW. It is shown that solutions close to the best known results for the Solomon benchmark can be reliably obtained within the re-planning horizon ofa typical military UGV appli- cation. The FLS&I algorithm and similar methods significantly improve upon agent based methods recently considered in the literature. It is also shown that, against the type C2 Solomon instances, the FLS&I heuristics used here outperform some recent methods that require much more processing time. The algorithm presented here has a feature that determines when an acceptable solution has been found to facilitate an early exit and save computer resources. With this feature, the average CPU time required to find the best known solution for the clustered Solomon instances is under one minute, well within the re-planning horizon.
