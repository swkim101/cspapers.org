The interactive soft pneumatic actuator (SPA) skin is a soft wearable device with integrated actuation and sensing. The SPA skin is a flat flexible patch that can be worn on the body, consisting of a 2-D matrix with independent actuation and sensing elements at each node (a taxel). The SPA skin acts as a bidirectional communication interfacing device. Vibrotactile actuation is achieved using SPAs and the tactile sensing is done via piezo-electric sensors. It can take in input from the user, as well as actuate in various patterns, simulating various sensations such as touch, brush, move, etc. thus allowing a bidirectional communication.
