The ACM SIGPLAN 5th Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security (PLAS) was held on June 10, 2010 as a satellite event of PLDI 2010 in Toronto, Canada. The call for papers attracted 15 submissions, of which four full papers and four position papers were selected for presentation at the workshop and inclusion in these proceedings. Each paper received three reviews. The workshop also featured invited talks by Ranjit Jhala of University of California, San Diego and Nikhil Swamy of Microsoft Research.
