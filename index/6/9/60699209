On behalf of the program committee, it is my great pleasure to present the proceedings of the 5th ACM Workshop on Recurring Malcode (WORM). Internet-wide infectious epidemics have emerged as one of the leading threats to information security and service availability. Self-propagating threats, often termed worms, exploit software weaknesses, hardware limitations, Internet topology, and the open Internet communication model to compromise large numbers of networked systems. Malware is increasingly used as a beachhead to launch further malicious activities, such as installing spyware, deploying phishing servers and spam relays, or performing information espionage. Unfortunately, current operational practices still face significant challenges in containing these threats as evidenced by the rise in automated botnet networks and the continued presence of worms released years ago 
 
This year's workshop continues the efforts of the previous years by providing a forum for exchanging ideas, increasing understanding, and relating experiences on malicious code. To this end, we invited participation from a wide range of communities, including researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and the government. The WORM program committee received 30 paper submissions from all over the world. All submissions were carefully reviewed by at least three members of the program committee and judged on the basis of scientific novelty, importance to the field, and technical quality. The final selection took place at the program committee meeting held in Boston, USA, on August 7th 2007. The program committee selected nine papers based on quality, focus, and the likelihood of stimulating productive discussion at the workshop. Moreover, the program committee also solicited invited talks from leading practitioners to share their perspectives
