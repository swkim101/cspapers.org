The purpose of this study is to examine the vacant technology areas by conducting patent analysis of financial technology (FinTech) related to mobile devices. To this end, this study investigated the technological scheme and industry trends first and then derived the technology classification system. Subsequently, key patent was selected from the effective data extracted from this study, and then vacant technology areas of FinTech were examined. It is expected that this study will be used as reference data in order to check patent trends of key technology in FinTech related to mobile devices and to choose the direction of technological development of FinTech.
