Ontologies as part of a lexicon are important for many NLP tasks. In this paper, an ESPRIT project called TREVI is presented, which concerns news (cid:12)ltering and enrichment and draws upon a Spanish/English multilingual Lexicon. The paper describes the way the Lexicon, including the ontology, will be acquired and the methodology for building domain ontologies. In general, the approach is lexicon-driven in the sense that ontology and lexicon (vocabulary) are developed in tandem.
