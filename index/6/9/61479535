Health data, a rich source of medical knowledge, often have not been used efficiently for medical treatment as well as financial management. Their accesses are very limited. This paper introduces the design of a well-structured medical advisory system based on the advanced Internet. The system is also equipped with data mining and AI techniques to make it becoming an active distributed medical advisory system.
