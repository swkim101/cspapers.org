This paper describes the implementation and testing of a contactless smart card in a Japanese commuter environment. The combination of a new non-battery smart card along with a newly designed gate was effective in dealing with problems experienced in previous trials. The system proved to be more efficient and equally as stable as the conventional magnetic gate system.
