The ISO is developing a new ISO 25000 series on Software Product Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) to improve the interpretation and use of quality measures for software products. This chapter explains how the ISO 19539 Measurement Information Model can be used to implement the ISO 9126 models for software product quality. It also identifies some of the harmonization issues arising as a result of the addition of new documents like ISO 25020 and ISO 25021, in particular with respect to previously published measurement standards for software engineering.
