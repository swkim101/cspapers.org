This paper focuses on a rapidly growing population on many college and university campuses today: students equipped with laptop computers capable of wireless connection to the Internet. More and more departments are requiring that students enrolling in certain courses bring laptop computers to class. The course instructor is sometimes overwhelmed by the prospect, asking "How should I change my lesson plan in order to integrate the laptop in my daily lecture?" This paper first describes the effort to bring the laptop to campus at a number of colleges and universities around the country. It then offers concrete suggestions based on the experiences of several professors who either have taught, or are now teaching, laptop-required courses. The paper concludes with a summary and a look toward the future.
