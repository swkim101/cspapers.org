Developing algorithms that allow robots to independently navigate unknown environments is a widely researched area of robotics. The potential for autonomous mobile robots use, in industrial and military applications, is boundless. Path planning entails computing a collision free path from a robots current position to a desired target. The problem of path planning for these robots remains underdeveloped. Computational complexity, path optimization and robustness are some of the issues that arise. Current algorithms do not generate general solutions for different situations and require user experience and optimization. Classical algorithms are computationally extensive. This reduces the possibility of their use in real time applications. Additionally, classical algorithms do not allow for any control over attributes of the generated path. A new roadmap path planning algorithm is proposed in this paper. This method generates waypoints, through which the robot can avoid obstacles and reach its goal. At the heart of this algorithm is a method to control the distance of the waypoints from obstacles, without increasing its computational complexity. Several simulations were run to illustrate the robustness and adaptability of this approach, compared to the most commonly used path planning methods.
