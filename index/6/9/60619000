CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools for the software design and implementation phases are intended to shorten the software life cycle and to increase the quality of the resulting products. One way to achieve this goal is to bridge the gap between design and implementation phase by automating the transition from design to code. The paper presents the complete program generation approach of Hierarchical CHILL Design Method/Graphical Software Design System (HCDM/GSDS) and compares it with other approaches. Arguments for the complete generation approach are outlined. Some unsolved technical problems with that approach are discussed based on the practical experience of the application of HCDM/GSDS methods and tools.
