Name origin recognition is to identify the origin of a name. In natural language processing, information of name origin is an important feature for name entity translation and question answering. Language identification of the origins of names can help to know what language-specific transliteration approaches to use. While some early work used two main methods, which are based on rules and statistics. In this paper, we use the conditional random fields (CRFs) model and view the task as a labeling problem on a sequence of words, taking advantage of the ability of using arbitrary features as input in CRFs under the character-based framework. Experimental results show that CRFs model is effective in recognizing origins of personal names in Chinese texts.
