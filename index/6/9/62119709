We propose a novel technique for improving the efficiency of cloud-based continuous integration development environments. Our technique identifies repetitive, expensive and time-consuming setup activities that are required to run integration and system tests in the cloud, and consolidates them into preconfigured testing virtual machines such that the overall costs of test execution are minimized. We create such testing machines by reconfiguring and opportunistically snapshotting the virtual machines already registered in the cloud.
