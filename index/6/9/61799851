Risk analysis in engineering design is of paramount importance when developing complex systems or upgrading existing systems. In many complex systems, new generations of systems are expected to have decreased risk and increased reliability when compared with previous designs. For instance, within the American civilian nuclear power industry, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has progressively increased requirements for reliability and driven down the chance of radiological release beyond the plant site boundary. However, many ongoing complex system design efforts analyze risk after early major architecture decisions have been made. One promising method of bringing risk considerations earlier into the conceptual stages of the complex system design process is functional failure modeling. Function Failure Identification and Propagation (FFIP) and related methods began the push toward assessing risk using the functional modeling taxonomy. This paper advances the Dedicated Failure Flow Arrestor Function (DFFAF) method which incorporates dedicated Arrestor Functions (AFs) whose purpose is to stop failure flows from propagating along uncoupled failure flow pathways, as defined by Uncoupled Failure Flow State Reasoner (UFFSR). By doing this, DFFAF provides a new tool to the functional failure modeling toolbox for complex system engineers. This paper introduces DFFAF and provides an illustrative simplified civilian Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) nuclear power plant case study.Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME
