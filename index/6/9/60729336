Shows how state space generation can be used in validation of embedded system software. The authors concentrate on practical aspects. They discuss the suitable application areas and the performance problem of state space generation. Advances in efficient state space generation make it possible to analyse meaningful systems and system parts. They discuss how concurrency oriented errors are detected by state space generation. Next they discuss their approach to writing state space generation analysis models and validating embedded system software. >
