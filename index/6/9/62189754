Broadband ISDN will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) as its basic switching, multiplexing and transmission technique. ATM is very flexible and promising, nevertheless, it requires high-performance switching hardware. The ATM Switching Element (ASE) proposed in this paper, called the Gauss ASE, can meet ATM requirements. Using traffic observations and a number of well known design principles the Gauss ASE gets a number of favorable properties, for example the Gauss ASE is nonblocking and has minimum delay and variance of delay. The ASE is kept modular so that it can easily grow towards a large single stage switching fabric using only two types of Integrated Circuits.
