Borehole logging tools are used for measuring a detailed record of a geological formation that is penetrated by a borehole. Values of interest of a geological formation are for example its density, chemical composition and porosity. Density of a formation can be measured using tools based on a chemical CS-137 gamma ray source. Porosity can be measured using a chemical AmBe neutron source. The resulting measurement of the tool, for example the density of a formation, has to be corrected for borehole influences such as borehole fluid or borehole size. These corrections depend on the individual tool design. The best way to calculate this vast number of corrections is using Monte-Carlo simulations. The software of choice is the MCNP5 package(1) . At Antares Datensysteme simulations are further used in pre design studies, to get the best physical layout of a tool.
