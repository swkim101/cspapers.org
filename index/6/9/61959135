This paper derives new results for theadaptive control and synchronization design ofthe Shimizu-Morioka chaotic system (1980), when the system parameters are unknown. First, we build an adaptive controller to stabilize the Shimizu-Morioka chaotic system to its unstable equilibrium at the origin. Then we build an adaptive synchronizer to achieve global chaos synchronization of the identicalShimizu-Morioka chaotic systems with unknown parameters. The results der ived for adaptive control and adaptive synchronization for the Shimizu-Morioka chaotic system have been proved using adaptive control theory and Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulations have beendepicted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ada ptive control and synchronization schemes derived in this paper for the Shimizu-Morioka chaotic system.
