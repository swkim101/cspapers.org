A lot of work has been done to track a moving object with the aid of a camera. This paper describes one such technique, which can constantly track and follow moving objects. Most of the work done in this paper were referred from the work done by Nazim[4].The camera is used as a feedback sensor to help the robot follow the object. The robot system is truncated into two subsystems: vision and motion. The vision system comprises of a two-motor pan-tilt camera driving mechanism with embedded potentiometer sensor, PCI image acquisition board and PWM based DC motor driver board. The motion system is made up of a two-wheel and two-castor platform driven by servomotors with amplifiers. The system tries to demonstrate the eye tracking ability of a human when a moving object is in focus. The robot used for this purpose is Alice, the most recent model that was developed in the year 2002 has been chosen.
