For over a decade the Internet engineering and research community has debated, designed, and ignored IP Quality of Service (QoS) tools and techniques. There's a sense that something might be needed, but little agreement on why and who will pay. At times the very notion of QoS has seemed to be a pointless waste of time, almost a solution waiting for a problem.This workshop solicited input from researchers and practitioners to discuss the history of IP QoS research and development, review what could have been done better (or totally differently), and challenge the industry to think out of the box going forward. We asked a couple of questions in the call for papers:IP QoS schemes never quite seem complete. Is this just a great research game for academics?Where's the money? How do we make IP QoS pay when typical Internet applications don't care, and the user's don't know any better? Will online, multi-player games be the market segment that justifies end-user/access ISP investment in IP QoS tools and solutions?Isn't more bandwidth the answer?An interesting and diverse range of perspectives, chosen through a blind-review process, are presented in this workshop. It is my sincere hope that we have provided serious food for thought to researchers and practitioners alike. Ultimately it will be up to us all to decide whether IP QoS is indeed something to be Revisited, or lefl to Rest In Peace.
