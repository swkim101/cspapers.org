A scheme used in building models of three - dimensional objects through binocular and motion parallax analyses is presented. Some preliminary results in using the models for recognition are described, and a discussion of the major objectives summarizes the rationale of the work. The principal emphasis throughout the paper will be that effective vision requires flexible, domain-free, three-dimensional modelling.
