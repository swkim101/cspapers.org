The finite element method is the most commonly used method for determining tooth-root and contact stresses of gears. The linear analysis or nonlinear contact analysis can be used. In the linear analysis the load distribution on mating teeth should be determined in order to achieve more accurate results, especially for high contact ratio gears. The application of nonlinear contact analysis of gears in mesh gives very accurate results, without necessity of previously known load share. The formulation for this analysis is presented in the paper, by using programme package ANSYS 5.7.1
