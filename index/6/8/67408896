The nested test design and data analysis in equipment test are studied, and the influence and signification of factors on test results are defined. The nested test is explained. The nested design of an explosive power experiment is realized using SAS and the test data is gained. The test data is analyzed using variance analysis in nested design. The main influential factors are determined, the interactions between factors are analyzed, and the influence difference in factors is gained as well. The introduction of experimental design and data analysis of this study can be adopted in other fields.
