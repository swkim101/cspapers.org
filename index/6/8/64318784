A computer integrated environment has been developed around the filament winding process encompassing design as well as manufacturing. The design facilities cover geometrical design in a commercially available CAD system, fibre path and winding pattern calculations in the computer code CAWAR, and laminate design using these fibre paths as input to FEA analysis. This paper presents and discusses the methodologies applied to the laminate design optimisation within this environment, with emphasis on the use of semi geodesies. A first methodology concerns the optimisation of individual paths. Following this methodology fibres are placed in the most appropriate directions towards uniform strength ratio all over the structure, dealing with slippage and fibre bridging as boundary conditions. The second methodology concerns the coverage optimisation of "tubelike" parts. In this case a set of optimum paths is designed in such a way that, besides the requirements of strength, a complete and uniform coverage of the mandrel is obtained. Results from experimental validation are also presented and discussed.
