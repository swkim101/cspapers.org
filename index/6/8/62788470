This paper presents a proposal for a context-aware pervasive framework. The framework follows a general purpose architecture, centered around an ontological context representation. The ontology provides the vocabulary upon which software agents communicate and perform rule-based reasoning, in order to assess the system reaction to context changes. The system components and their coordinated operations are described by providing a simple example of a concrete application in a realistic home-care scenario.
