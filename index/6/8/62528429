Video compression coding technology is the key to implement network video transmission, and the increasing requirements of network content transmission quality accelerate the development of video compression coding technology. H.264 is a highly compressed digital video codec standard, and is a hybrid coding mode of differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) and transform encoding. In this paper, we introduced several techniques of hybrid coding algorithm based on H.264 standard, including differential coding, block matching motion prediction method, normalization criteria, variable-size block motion compensation, and multiple hypothesis motion compensation. We did extensive experiments on variable-size block motion compensation coding method. The experimental results show that, with the premise of the 1/4 pixel motion compensation accuracy and hybrid coding, 8 Ã— 8 or larger block partition of content for normal video object, can further make use of space correlation and improve compression efficiency.
