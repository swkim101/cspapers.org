It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 8th ACM Cloud Computing Security Workshop (CCSW). Since its inception, CCSW has been a forum for bringing together researchers and practitioners to discuss technological advances bearing on the security of compute clouds, their tenants, and the larger Internet community. This year's workshop continues in this tradition. 
 
Submissions were evaluated by a program committee of 30 experts in the field, resulting in the selection of 3 full papers and 4 short papers after a roughly one-month review process and online discussion. In addition, the workshop hosted several invited lectures by top researchers in the field of cloud security.
