1. Abstract This paper describes how computer algebra techniques may be applied to finding numerical solutions to systems of differential equations using some simple iterative methods. The advantages and disadvantages of using computer algebra techniques rather than procedural programming languages such as Pascal and C are assessed. We consider how the student may learn from using computer algebra software, using simple iterative methods to emphasise the general approach and the flexibility of the software. Common examples in engineering are considered.
