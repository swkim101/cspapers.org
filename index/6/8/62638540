Air-combat decision modeling in effectiveness simulation has to be concerned with the important feature of decision making, such as complexity, diversity, flexibility. So Several challenges have to be mastered, including: improving the abstract level of modeling, providing friendly modeling language, validating concept model and generated code (or executive model) automatically. In this paper, domain-specific modeling (DSM) method is applied in air-combat decision simulation modeling to cope with those challenges. A graphical and textual domain-specific modeling language (DSML) of air-combat decision is designed through metamodel based on an open source tool, Generic Modeling Environment (GME). A code generator is developed to implement users decision model based on python script.
