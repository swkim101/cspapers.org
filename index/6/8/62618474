The ACM Workshop on Digital Rights Management is an international forum that serves as an interdisciplinary bridge between the areas that can be applied to solving the problem of Intellectual Property protection of digital content. These include Cryptography, Economics and Game Theory, Information Theory, Intellectual Property Law, Signal Processing, Trusted Computing and Software and Systems Design. Its purpose is to bring together researchers from the above fields for a full day of formal talks and informal discussions, covering new results that will spur new investigations regarding the foundations and practices of DRM. 
 
This year's workshop, the seventh in the series, continued this tradition. As in the previous years it was sponsored by ACM SIGSAC and was held in conjunction with the ACM Conference in Computer and Communications Security (CCS). This volume contains the proceedings of the workshop and is a good representation of the diverse areas of research endeavor that relate to the DRM problem. The workshop received 28 submissions out of which 10 were accepted for presentation after a rigorous refereeing process. 
 
This year we had the pleasure to have as part of the program an invited talk by Andrew Odlyzko of the University of Minnesota. His timely presentation cast the DRM problem on Economics, pointed at new directions for research and discussed the role of the field at a time that the ways DRM is advocated for use by the industry receive criticism as being prohibitive to creative human collaboration and interaction.
