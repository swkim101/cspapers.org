s:Heat preservation and anti-corrosion of outer steam calciner has been puzzling soda industry for years. In order to solve this problem, we've designed an adiabatic ceramic anticorrosive coating system based on parameters of corrosion environment, heating area, furnace speed, etc. Herewith heat insulation principles of ceramic coating, demonstrating methods of heat insulation performance, optimized configuration of Compound layer heat preservation as well as results determined by coating experiments, are covered.
