The interaction of modules for depth perception was studied psychophysically by measuring the perceived depth of computer generated images showing simple solid objects with different combinations of depth cues. Accumulation of information from shading and stereo and vetoing of depth from shading by edge information have been found. Cooperativity and other types of interactions are discussed. If intensity edges are missing, as in smooth-shaded surfaces, the image intensities themselves could be used for stereo matching. Matching primitives other than edges were studied in additional experiments. The results are compared with computer vision algorithms for both single modules and their integration for 3D-vision.
