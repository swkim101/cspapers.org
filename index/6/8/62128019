AREVA has developed a new coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics code system, ARCADIA®. It makes use of modern computing resources to enable more realistic reactor analysis as improved understanding of nuclear reactor behavior is the basis for efficient margin management, i.e. optimization of safety and performance. One of the principal components of this new system is the core simulator, ARTEMIS™. The purpose of this paper is to recall its features, present the latest developments and give a summary of the validation tests.
