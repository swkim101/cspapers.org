With extensive and thorough research on the three-tier B/S/D architecture and software development theory, we develop an elementary school online registration and allocation system using the bit-operation and template layered management technology in authorization management and implemented a three-tier management information system for Changchun city educational bureau, districts educational bureau to local elementary schools. In the allocation module, we propose an isometric random sample algorithm which is a fair and efficient allocation algorithm. Later, we discuss our in-depth analysis on the overall framework of the platform and each function module of the elementary school online registration and allocation system.
