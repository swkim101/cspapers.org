We have been making researches on system design method for web application systems using models in knowledge base. Web systems are comprised of hetero-genius domains: user-interface, communication system, and database system. In this paper we propose a method using meta-models to derive Java source codes. This method, first, extracts program model skeletons by using knowledge about implementation patterns. Then, it derives concrete program models by using basic functional units. This method can be applied for problems over a wide range: from communication application in pure Java to communication using sessions in WEB system.
