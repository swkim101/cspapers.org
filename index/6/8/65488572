An increasing number of theoretical frameworks have incorporated an abnormal sensitivity response inhibition as to decision-making and working memory (WM) impairment as key issues in Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study reports the effects of 5 weeks cognitive training (RoboMemo, Cogmed) with fMRI paradigm by young adolescents with ADHD at the level of behavioral, neuropsychological and brain activations. After the cognitive remediation, at the level of WM we observed an increase of digit span without significant higher risky choices reflecting decisionmaking processes. These preliminary results are promising and could provide benefits to the clinical practice. However, models are needed to investigate how executive functions and cognitive training shape high-level cognitive processes as decision-making and WM, contributing to understand the association, or the separability, between distinct cognitive abilities.
