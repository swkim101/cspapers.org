Different from typical mechanical products, tickets for movies and performing arts can be considered as a special type of consumer products. Compared to widely known box-office receipts prediction with single-output in movie industry, estimating the market share and price for performing arts is still a challenging problem due to high dimensional datasets yet limited number of samples. This paper describes a data-driven decision support system to help arts managers make strategic decisions, especially on session-determination and price-setting, considering price discrimination and prediction on the corresponding sales volume. Eight different attributes from the database, with multiple labels in each attribute, are used to accurately and comprehensively represent and classify the characteristics of performing arts in each genre. A web-based influence factor is also defined to quantify the popularity and publicity of performing arts. For this multi-input and multi-output problem, support vector regression (SVR) is employed and its optimal parameters are determined using genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) respectively. Price utility axiom with the law of demand is applied to maximize the receipts. Compared to artificial neural networks (ANN), those two optimization based SVR methods perform much better, in terms of effectiveness and reliability.Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME
