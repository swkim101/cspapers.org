This paper first introduces wireless sensor networks self-positioning classical algorithm DV-Hop (distance vector-hop) algorithm, then analyze its shortcomings, Finally, a new improved algorithm and through improved algorithm matlab simulation verify the situation after the positioning accuracy.Comparative analysis of experimental data, the improved algorithm error is smaller than the original algorithm, more precise positioning.
