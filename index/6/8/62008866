In attempting to discuss the development of telecommunication networks, it will be useful to construct an exemplar which will encapsulate the nature of what is intended. The exemplar will provide information on the technical implementation features which are required for an intelligent network. The properties of the same exemplar will also serve as a user tool, to allow the user to understand what the network has to offer. The users should be able to express their telecomms requirements in terms of the exemplar and thereby effect control over the network according to their service needs. It would be convenient, if the employment of the exemplar by users to formulate their requirements, had a direct correspondence to the use of the exemplar in a subsequent implementation on the network, but this is not essential. The two uses of the exemplar (drawn from object oriented software engineering) are expanded upon. >
