Sequential sampling refers to a set of design of experiment (DOE) methods where the next sample point is determined by information from previous experiments. This paper introduces a qualitative and quantitative sequential sampling (Q2S2) technique, in which optimization and user knowledge is used to guide the efficient choice of sample points. This method combines information from multiple fidelity sources including computer simulation models of the product, first principals involved in design, and designer’s qualitative intuitions about the design. Both quantitative and qualitative information from different sources are merged together to arrive at a new sampling strategy. This is accomplished by introducing the concept of a confidence function, C, which is represented as a field that is a function of the decision variables, x, and the performance parameter, f. We compare the sampling plans generated by Q2S2 to previously known sample plans on five test functions using various metrics. In each case, the performance of Q2S2 is highly encouraging.© 2007 ASME
