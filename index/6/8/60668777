It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 1st ACM International Workshop on Complex Networks in Information & Knowledge Management -- CNIKM'09. 
 
We are in a connected age: real-world entities often interconnect with each other through explicit or implicit relationships to form a complex network, such as technological networks, social networks, and information networks. They exhibit interesting statistical characteristics like "small-world" and "scale-free." 
 
The past decade has witnessed an explosive growth of research on various complex networks. How can we analyze, manage and mine information in large-scale complex networks effectively and efficiently? This gives researchers in database, information retrieval and knowledge management great challenges as well as opportunities. In line with CIKM's tradition of promoting interdisciplinary research, this workshop aims to bring together researchers across both computer science and the emerging network science to foster discussion and exchange ideas. Although these two scientific disciplines speak quite different languages, they certainly can benefit a lot from each other by sharing their concepts, models, techniques, and tools, etc. 
 
The call for papers attracted 19 submissions from 12 countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Korea, Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom). The program committee accepted 9 full papers and 3 short papers that cover a variety of topics, including community detection, information spread, centrality analysis, link prediction, peer-to-peer networks and recommender systems. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech by Prof. Jure Leskovec of Stanford University on the clustering structure of very large networks. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in this area.
