The fundamental principle of MR fluid fan clutch in transmitting torque is analyzed, in the meantime, a shear model of MR clutch is proposed; MR fluid fan clutch having simple, novel structure is designed and made; At the same time, on the basis of experiments, the characteristic of velocity regulating of the clutch is studied in detail. The experimental results indicate that, compared with the shearing rate, the change of magnetic fields has a tremendous influence on the speed regulating characteristic of a fan clutch, and output torque of fan clutch can satisfy demand of engine cooling fan.Â© 2005 ASME
