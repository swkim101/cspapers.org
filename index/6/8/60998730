This paper presents a formalisation of the Jackson system development (JSD) method based on the theory of communicating sequential processes (CSP). The paper describes how a specification written in the JSD notations can be translated into CSP, which is well suited for modelling and reasoning about the behaviour of concurrent systems. The translation process is formally defined and a tool has been developed to automate the process. The theoretical basis is extended to cover the JSD implementation phase which has not been previously tackled by other researchers. >
