The auditory filter-bank is the key component of auditory model, and its implementation involves a lot of computations. The time spent by an auditory filter-bank to finish its work has a significant effect on the real-time implementation of auditory model-based audio signal processing systems. In this paper, a multi-rate implementation of auditory filter bank is presented. Through using low sampling rate for the filters with low centre frequency, and using high sampling rate for the filters with high centre frequency, we can greatly reduce the computation requirement.
