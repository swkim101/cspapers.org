Research in the field of brain-computer interfaces is growing exponentially and even reaching such lesser-known areas of the United States like Kennesaw, Georgia thanks to researchers who continue to pursue ways to improve the quality of life for individuals with severe motor disabilities. This is my first year as an Assistant Professor at Kennesaw State University (KSU) located in Kennesaw, Georgia which is primarily an undergraduate institution but also seeing tremendous growth of their student population and scholarly activities. I was hired into the area of Business Information Systems with the expectations that I would start a “BrainLab” at KSU and continue my work of five years that I started in 2002 when I began my doctoral program at Georgia State University (GSU).
