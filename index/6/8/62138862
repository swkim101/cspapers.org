According to the independent research small Programmable Logic Controller based on ARM and FPGA, a miniPLC programming system is designed. LPC2478 and Î¼C/OS-II system are adopted as the platform's core. Instruction List is adopted as the programming language. A new instruction system and its encodes are designed. PLC source instruction file is editted and compiled. The mapping relation among PLC source instruction file, PLC object instruction file, PLC object code file, ASCII character table, dot matrix table is established. LCD screen display is planned.Two-way chain tables are adopted to edit and store PLC source instruction file.After analysis, optimization and error handling, PLC source instruction file is compiled to create binary object code file PLC host can identify. The object code file is sent to PLC host via CAN Bus.Through the test, it is demonstrated that the system can edit and compile PLC instruction list correctly and effectively, and monitor PLC host via CAN Bus.
