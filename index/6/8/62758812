Unsupervised learning of morphology is an important task for human learners and in natural language processing systems. Previous systems focus on segmenting words into substrings (taking â‡’ tak.ing), but sometimes a segmentation-only analysis is insufficient (e.g., taking may be more appropriately analyzed as take+ing, with a spelling rule accounting for the deletion of the stem-final e). In this paper, we develop a Bayesian model for simultaneously inducing both morphology and spelling rules. We show that the addition of spelling rules improves performance over the baseline morphology-only model.
