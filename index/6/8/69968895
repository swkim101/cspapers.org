Target model update plays an important role in visual object tracking. However, performing optimal model update is challenging. In this work, we propose to achieve an optimal target model by learning a transformation matrix from the last target model to the newly generated one, which results into a minimization objective. In this objective, there exists two challenges. The first is that the newly generated target model is unreliable. To overcome this problem, we propose to impose a penalty to limit the distance between the learned target model and the last one. The second is that as time evolves, we can not decide whether the last target model has been corrupted or not. To get out of this dilemma, we propose a reinitialization term. Besides, to control the complexity of the transformation matrix, we also add a regularizer. We find that the optimization formulaâ€™s solution, with some simplifications, degenerates to EMA. Finally, despite the simplicity, extensive experiments conducted on several commonly used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in relatively long term scenarios.
