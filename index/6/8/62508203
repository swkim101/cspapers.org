The principles underlying the transmission or reception of electromagnetic energy by an antenna is based on relationships between electrical and magnetic fields, which can be described by Maxwell's equations. The directional characteristics of the antenna are best understood from its radiation pattern which is a 3 dimensional plot of the radiated or received fields. In this paper, the students are oriented towards utilizing some computational graphics techniques which enable them to implement their own software packages that can help in visualizing the antenna radiation patterns.
