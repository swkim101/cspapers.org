It is our great pleasure to welcome you all to the 4th Workshop on Information Credibility on the Web (WICOW'10) organized in conjunction with the 19th World Wide Web Conference in Raleigh, NC, USA on April 27, 2010. 
 
The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum for discussion on various issues related to information credibility criteria on the web. Evaluating and improving information credibility requires combination of different technologies and backgrounds. Through the series of WICOW workshops we hope to exchange novel ideas and findings as well as promote discussions on various aspects of web information credibility. 
 
This year we received 22 full paper submissions from 12 countries: Austria, Brazil, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, The Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, UK and USA. After a careful review process, with at least three reviews for each paper the Program Committee has selected 10 full papers (45% acceptance rate) covering variety of topics related to information credibility. The accepted papers were grouped into 3 sessions: "Wikipedia Credibility", "Studies of Web Information Credibility" and "Evaluating Information Credibility". We are also pleased to invite Miriam Metzger from University of California, Santa Barbara for giving a keynote talk entitled: "Understanding Credibility across Disciplinary Boundaries."
