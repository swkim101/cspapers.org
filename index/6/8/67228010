Cryptography is a major area of study that provides mechanisms to achieve confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation in information and computer security. For many not in the area of cryptography, teaching cryptography may be a challenge due to the mathematically heavy background underlying the subject. For students it may be intimidating to read about cryptography with all the terminology new to them. This workshop provides an introduction to basic functions and terminology of cryptography without going into the details of the specific implementations and the mathematics involved in them. The workshop includes four modules focusing on four main mechanisms of cryptography; namely, symmetric key encryption, public key cryptography, hash functions, and digital signatures and certificates. Each module in the workshop starts with a presentation of the topic and proceeds with hands-on activities. The presentations include descriptions of mechanisms as well as the reasons for using such mechanisms. For example, it provides answers to questions such as what does asymmetric encryption provide us that symmetric key encryption does not? Why are hash functions necessary in digital signatures? Why do we need digital certificates in addition to digital signatures? The participants will receive access to presentations and hands-on exercises as well as supplementary material such as assignments for students and questions for assessment. Educators who want to introduce computer security and cryptography early in their curriculum and students and educators who want to learn the basics of cryptography would benefit from this workshop. A laptop is needed for the hands-on activities.
