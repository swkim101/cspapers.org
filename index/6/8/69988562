In this paper, we propose a novel Human-like Semantic Cognition Network (HSCN) for aspect-level sentiment classification, motivated by the principles of human beingsâ€™ reading cognitive process (pre-reading, active reading, post-reading). We first design a word-level interactive perception module to capture the correlation between context words and the given target words, which can be regarded as pre-reading. Second, to mimic the process of active reading, we propose a targetaware semantic distillation module to produce the targetspecific context representation for aspect-level sentiment prediction. Third, we further devise a semantic deviation metric module to measure the semantic deviation between the targetspecific context representation and the given target, which evaluates the degree we understand the target-specific context semantics. The measured semantic deviation is then used to fine-tune the above active reading process in a feedback regulation way. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on three widely used datasets. The experiments demonstrate that HSCN achieves impressive results compared to other strong competitors.
