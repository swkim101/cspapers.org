Clonal selection algorithm has a shortcoming when solving the problem of combinatorial optimization,which is that the antibody diversity of population evolution declines in later stage. Therefore, this paper has improved the selection operator of this algorithm and introduced tabu criteria. What's more, the benchmark of a typical combinatorial optimization problem is combined to carry out simulation analysis on this algorithm. The result shows that the improved clonal selection algorithm owns a better global convergence, stability and quick convergence ability to solve combinatorial optimization problems.
