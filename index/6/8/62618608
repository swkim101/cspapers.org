A new deterministic BIST approach to generate a set of test vectors is proposed. Given a set ofpre-computed test vectors (obtained by an ATPG tool) with a predetermined fault coverage, a simple test vector generator (TVG) based on a cellular automata (CA) structures is synthesized to generate the given test set. The CA used here, has a rule space not limited to linear rules as usually used in the recent studies of CA. Some new notations and new formulations of CA properties are given to synthesize such a TVG. The resulting TVG is very efJicient in terms of hardware size and speed performance while being very regular and easy to test. Simulation of some benchmark circuits has given good results compared with an alternative solution.
