A SpaceWire is a standard for on-board satellite networks as the basis for future data-handling architectures. However, it cannot meet the deterministic requirement for safety/time critical application in spacecraft, where the delay of real-time (RT) message streams must be guaranteed. Therefore, SpaceWire-D is developed that provides deterministic delivery over a SpaceWire network. Formal analysis and verification of real-time systems is critical to their development and safe implementation, and is a prerequisite for obtaining their safety certification. Failure to meet specified timing constraints such as deadlines in hard real-time systems may lead to catastrophic results. In this paper, a formal verification method, Real-Time Logic (RTL), has been proposed to specify and verify timing properties of SpaceWire-D network. Based on the principal of SpaceWire-D protocol, we firstly analyze the timing properties of fundamental transactions, such as RMAP WRITE, and RMAP READ. After that, the RMAP WRITE trans...
