In this paper, we introduce the construct of microstructure-mediated design of material and product. The microstructure of the material is controlled within feasible bounds to achieve the performance targets of the product. We illustrate the efficacy of this construct via the integrated robust design of a submersible and Al-based matrix composites. The integrated design is carried out using an Inductive Design Exploration Method (IDEM) that facilitates robust design in the presence of model structure uncertainty (MSU). Model structural uncertainty (MSU), originating from assumptions and idealizations in modeling processes, is a form of uncertainty that is often virtually impossible to quantify. In this paper, we demonstrate a method, the Inductive Design Exploration Method (IDEM), that facilitates robust design in the presence of model structural uncertainty. We achieve robustness by trading off the degree of system performance and the degree of reliability based on structural uncertainty associated with system models (i.e., models for performances and constraints). IDEM is demonstrated in the design of a shell of a robotic submersible. The material considered is in-situ Al metal matrix composites (MMCs) due to the advantages that the in-situ MMCs have over the conventional MMCs. This design task is a representative example of integrated materials and product design problems.Copyright Â© 2009 by ASME
