In this paper, we briefly present our work on applications for ‘learning analytics’. Our work ranges from dashboards on small mobile devices to learnscapes on large public displays. We capture and visualize traces of learning activities, in order to promote self-awareness and reflection, and to enable learners to define goals and track progress towards these goals. We identify HCI issues for this kind of applications.
