Electricity trade contracts are an important basis for market settlements in China. In order to implement centralized management and extended maintenance for all kinds of contract, contracts are described by public properties and private properties in this paper. The public properties are modeled as fixed relational data structure, and private properties are modeled as fine-grained atomic date, which described by metadata and can register online. Through assigning different private properties for different contract type, the contract can configure flexible. Based on this, Batch maintenance functions and data check functions are designed further. Keywordscontract management; metadata; electricity market; batch maintenance; data check
