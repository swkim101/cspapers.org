Autonomous driving is the main development direction of the automobile in the present and the future. Intelligence braking is the key assembly to realize autonomous driving. The pneumatic brake system is the principle part of commercial vehicle to brake. In order to meet the requirements of autonomous driving, this paper proposed the concept of intelligent braking and pneumatic automatic braking, and then a kind of pneumatic automatic braking circuit is designed. The pressure change rate is used as a new index to evaluate automatic braking and control. This study provides a new theoretical basis for design and application of the pneumatic braking system.
