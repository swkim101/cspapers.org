The Web played a role in the burst of economic activity that occurred in the late 1990s that saw company values dramatically rise and fall, business and government processes reshaped, traditional marketing media challenged, and much written concerning the benefits to customers from the adoption of what was initially termed e-commerce. Initial empirical studies of Australian and New Zealand business and government use of the Web found that while the Web was used for marketing communication, it was not as favoured as trade press reports suggested as a marketing transaction channel, nor for relationship management. This paper, which reports the findings of a pre-test of the self-administered online questionnaire stage of a three-phase study, suggests that little has changed in organisational use of the Web in Australia and New Zealand since the late 1990s, even among high network traffic organisations. The pre-test findings reported do not present a clear picture concerning the influence of strategic use of traditional and online marketing mix elements on organisational performance. Analysis employing a Marketing Readiness of Website Indicator (MRWI) content analysis tool is shown not to predict organisational performance as hypothesised.
