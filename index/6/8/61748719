RACE requires a method which allows the formation of consensus between a set of actors, handles the complexity of future telecommunication systems, defines and makes explicit the policies of interested parties. The BEST method is open in the sense that it is not tied to any particular language. It is flexible in the sense that any specification or design language can be used within the framework of the BEST method. The paper describes the BEST method and gives some examples of the types of conceptual models developed using the method. The BEST method supports the requirement definition, specification and design of an abstract system. A key requirement on the method, in order to support the building of consensus, is that all requirements, assumptions, policies and decisions arising during the process are made explicit and open to inspection.<
