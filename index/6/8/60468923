10G Ethernet technology has been widely used in modern high speed communication system. As a result, program design for high-speed data capture on 10G Ethernet, as the first and important step in network monitor and analysis system, has become a challenging task. This paper proposed a high-speed data capture method based on WinCap and shared memory pool technology and has features of high speed, low packet loss rate, high efficiency and good portability. The system test and data analysis proved that the proposed method in this paper can effectively capture the data at speed of 6Gbps and stably keep the packet loss rate under 0.03%.
