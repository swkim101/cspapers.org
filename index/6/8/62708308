This study proposed that the origami curriculum can be one of the important educational activities for Grade 1-9 because origami is not only a form of arts, but also possesses the learning functions that involve hand-brain-eye co-ordination and can upgrade learners non-classical logic deduction skills. This study uses Huzitas Axioms and Huzita-Hatori Axioms (HHA) to implement the Web of Origami Simulator (WOOS). WOOS is produced by a computer algebra system (CAS) and it allows users to arbitrarily rotate or zoom origami forms, calculate the length of line segments, calculate area, and measure angles. Moreover, the steps taken can be recorded so that learners can observe the entire process after the activity. WOOSs ultimate objective is to be implemented in the origami or algebra teaching activities of junior and elementary schools.
