Describes test and verification tools which make it possible to design and evaluate computer communication software. The tools are based on methods already standard for hardware testing. A short description of the concepts used in hardware testing and communication software (protocol) testing is given. Metrics are introduced to evaluate tests for complicated distributed applications, such as the OSI session layer. >
