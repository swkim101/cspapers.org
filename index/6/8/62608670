Broadband access communications have been continuously developed with many advances in response to increasing demands of multimedia services and applications. Broadband communications systems are generally power- and bandwidth- limited while the communications channels are characterized by their frequency-selective fading and the presence of noise and interference. Due to the dynamic nature of both transmission media and multimedia traffic, re-configurable and adaptive schemes are of particular interest. Furthermore, in most broadband communications systems, interference is the major performance-limiting factor and interference mitigation can be more efficiently done by coordination of the transmission and resource allocation between users to minimize mutual interference in a collaborative manner. The talk will provide an overview of new developments/deployments in broadband access communications, and highlight technical issues in dynamic resource allocation and intelligent multi-dimensional signal processing and the evolution from competition, to cooperation and cognition in communications.
