Social software is built around an "architecture of participation" where user data is aggregated as a side-effect of using Web 2.0 applications. Web 2.0 implies that processes and tools are socially open, and that content can be used in several different contexts. Web 2.0 tools and technologies support interactive information sharing, data interoperability and user centered design. For instance, wikis, blogs, tags and feeds help us organize, manage and categorize content in an informal and collaborative way. Some of these technologies have made their way into collaborative software development processes and development platforms. These processes and environments are just scratching the surface of what can be done by incorporating Web 2.0 approaches and technologies into collaborative software development. Web 2.0 opens up new opportunities for developers to form teams and collaborate, but it also comes with challenges for developers and researchers. Web2SE aims to improve our understanding of how Web 2.0, manifested in technologies such as mashups or dashboards, can change the culture of collaborative software development. 
 
The goals of this workshop are to: 
Collect an overview of the latest developments with regard to the use of Web 2.0 technologies in software development. 
Explore new opportunities that Web 2.0 creates in software development. 
Investigate to which extent the "socially open" attitude of Web 2.0 applies to software development. 
Explore how Web 2.0 technologies can be incorporated into and adapted to software engineering processes and methods. 
Discuss potential risks of using Web 2.0 in software development. 
Address challenges for researchers who are studying the use of Web 2.0 in software development.
