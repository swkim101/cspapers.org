This short paper reflects on a digital arts intervention at a second-hand shop in Manchester, UK. The work entitled RememberMe utilised RFID tags and two-dimensional barcodes to allow visitors to the shop the opportunity to listen to audio stories that were associated with objects that have been recorded by their previous owners. The artwork offered a tangible manifestation of an Internet of things in which the material instantiation of an artefact was complemented by immaterial information. The project team who developed the work found that the nature of the immaterial data encapsulated in a recorded memory, had a profound affect upon consumers and visitors to the shop.
