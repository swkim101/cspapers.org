In the embedded era, reconfigurable components comes in three forms of IP Intellectual Property cores i) Soft core ii) Firm core and iii) Hard Core. This paper presents a new technique of embedding multigrain parallel processing HPRC using FPGA in the CPU/DSP unit of OR1200 a soft-core RISC processor. The core performance is increased by placing a multigrain parallel processing HPRC internally in the Integer Execution Pipeline unit of the CPU/DSP core. Depending on the complexity/depth of the code, the dependency level of vertices DL were created and numbers of threads N were created to run the code parallel in HPRC. Multigrain parallel processing HPRC is achieved by two function i) HPRC_Parallel_Start to trigger the parallel thread ii) HPRC_Parallel_End to stop the thread. In the first phase of this paper a Verilog HDL functional code is developed and synthesised using XIINX ISE and in the second phase a CoreMark processor core benchmark is used to test the performance of the reconfigured IP soft core.
