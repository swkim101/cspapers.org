Internet of things is becoming the most growing technology in recent days. Main idea behind the IoT is to extract the various values from various sensors which are attached to various objects by connecting them to the network and automating the actions performed by the object or a system. In this review paper, a study is made to understand the importance of use of IoT in humanoid robots. In order to appreciate this growing technology, this technology should be implemented to as many objects as possible so that everything will get connected in future. Along with other hardware developments, 5G internet technology is also getting developed rapidly. Use of IoT in humanoid will make many things easier to monitor and control in many ways which is discussed further in this paper. Case studies are also involved in this study to get the brief idea about how the hardware development is being done in this area. Comparison of various hardwares available to make the system work is done considering the factors like cost, ease of development, simplicity, etc.
