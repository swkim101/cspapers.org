Welcome to the sixth edition of the Virtual Machine and Intermediate Language (VMIL) workshop! We hope you find the program stimulating and participate in the lively and collegial discussions that are a hallmark of the VMIL workshop. This year's workshop program consists of seven paper presentations and two invited talks. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at VMIL had the option to include the paper in the formal proceedings of the workshop; six of the seven accepted papers are included in these proceedings. The papers covered a range of topics in virtual machine design and optimization. 
 
The VMIL workshop is a forum for research in virtual machines and intermediate languages. It is dedicated to identifying programming mechanisms and constructs that are currently realized as code transformations or implemented in libraries but should rather be supported at the VM level. Candidates for such mechanisms and constructs include modularity mechanisms, concurrency mechanisms, etc. Topics of interest include the investigation of which such mechanisms are worthwhile candidates for integration with the run-time environment, how said mechanisms can be elegantly (and reusably) expressed at the intermediate language level (e.g., in bytecode), how their implementations can be optimized, and how virtual machine architectures might be shaped to facilitate such implementation efforts. We especially welcome transformative ideas for virtual machines, including efficient support for game-changing IL mechanisms.
