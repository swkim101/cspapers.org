Substantial progress was made in implementing design aids during the 1970s; however, the development of new aids must be accelerated during the 1980s to support circuit designs of VLSI complexity. New design aids-will be required because of (I) increased design complexity 9 (2) scarcity of design engineers, (3) need to reduce circuit design time and cost~ and (4) increased emphasis in producing error-free manu~actur~ble~designs. The reduction of fabrication @O#~-~-wi~me more important as processing equipment costs and the sophistication of individual processing steps continues to increase to support VLSI complexity circuits. These design and manufacturing problems can be solved only by increasing the use of design automation and improving the design aids.
