Introduction • The output, activity, and bugs of the program all express themselves visually. The Nifty Assignments panel is a practical forum for the sharing of assignment ideas — demonstrating good assignment features and tradeoffs, and providing concrete materials for the CSE community to use. • It is extensible in various ways. Examples: multiple implementations of the region list, one using an array, the other using a linked list; support of colored squares within regions (clicking on an uncolored area creates a square, and clicking on a colored square erases it). Each panelist will introduce the basic idea of their assignment, give a quick demo, and describe its niche in the curriculum — its strengths and weaknesses. The live presentation is merely an introduction to each assignment. Fortunately, the following web page has handouts, data files, etc. for each of the assignments... Stuart Reges Personality Test (CS1) This assignment is based on a personality/temperament test developed by Keirsey and Bates in the pop-psych book Please Understand Me. The first part of the assignment is a straightforward application of 70 multiple choice questions. Collecting answers to these questions is a fine CS1 problem which may or may not be used as part of the assignment (if not, there are tools to do it). http://cse.stanford.edu/nifty/
