Recently, it is very likely to be a shift towards highly personalized interfaces in which communication between user and computer will be mediated by anthropomorphic and/or life-like agents. However, it is often a tough problem to design and program animated CG agents for many researchers that are willing to study and construct such interface systems. In this paper, we introduce a CG tool for constructiong such agents. We plan to open this tool as a free software in the near future.
