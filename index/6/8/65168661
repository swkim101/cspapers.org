The present paper introduces the results of a review of the methods measuring player experience proposed in articles published in human-computer interaction journals. The present review focused more specifically on the cases of combination of two or more methods. The results showed that 11 articles, all published in the last decade, proposed mixed methods to measure player experience. All these articles proposed at least a subjective measure method, always questionnaire, in combination with an objective one, mainly physiological measures. Player's emotions were the aspects of player experience that were the most studied in the case of mixed methods. A synthesis of these results was proposed and may be discussed at the workshop.
