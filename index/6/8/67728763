This paper uses 51 (single chip microcomputer) SCM as the operation and data processing center. According to the change of sunshine intensity and ambient temperature, a new type of intelligent curtain control system is designed by adopting photosensitive element and temperature sensor. In addition, the design also has a manual control mode. In the rain, when the light intensity is weak, the open position of the curtain can be set by the user. The system can maximize the user to provide user-friendly operation and comfortable living environment. The system can be applied to home or office environment, with a wide range of applications and simple operation and so on.
