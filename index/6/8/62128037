This poster presents the Hodoscope calibration curves calculation with 3D Monte Carlo code MORET. The fast neutron hodoscope is a facility of the CABRI research reactor at Cadarache (FRANCE). This hodoscope is designed to measure the fuel motion during a RIA in a pressurized water reactor. The fuel motion is measured by counting fast fission neutrons emerging from the test fuel placed in an experimental loop functioning like a Pressurized Water Reactor (T=300Â°C and P=155 bar), at the center of the CABRI core. The detection system of the hodoscope measures a signal which is a function of the fuel motion. The calibration curves allow then to convert the signal in a fuel mass. In order to calculate these curves, we have developed a method based on a Monte Carlo calculation code.
