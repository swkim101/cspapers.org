The 2001 International Workshop on Web Information and Data Management (WIDM?01) is the third in a series of workshops on Web Information and Data Management held in conjunction with the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). The objective of the workshop is to bring together researchers, industrial practitioners, and developers to study how the web information can be extracted, stored, analysed and processed to provide useful knowledge to the end users for various advanced database applications. Apart from the sponsorship from both ACM SIGIR and ACM SIGMIS, WIDM?01 has received generous sponsorship from the E-Book Systems Pte Ltd.The Call for Papers attracted 34 submission of research papers, out of which 11 were accepted. All papers were thoroughly reviewed by the program committee and external reviewers. These papers have divided into 4 sessions: ?Web Data Mining,? ?Web Information Management,? ?Web Performance Optimization,? and ?Web Information Integration.? The workshop would not be a success without the help of a few important people. Lay-Choo Tan and Chee-Keong Lai, the technical officers from the Centre for Advanced Information Systems (CAIS) did a wonderful job in setting the website for the electronic submission of abstracts and papers. We are also indebted to the CIKM?s main committee for their support: Il-Yeol Song for coordinating WIDM?01 with the other workshops; Eun-Kyo Park for managing the financial and registration matters; and Alvin Lim for local arrangement. Finally we would like to thank the authors and contributors for their effort in supporting the workshop.
