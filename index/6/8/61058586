As the research object to IRB660 palletizing robot, its workspace is calculated. On this basis, the concept of workspace area influence coefficient and direction influence coefficient is brought forward and defined. The relationship map of coordinate plane projection area caused by robot structural parameters is drawn by MATLAB GUI programming, and the influence degree and influence direction caused by the change of unit length of the robot structural parameters is calculated precisely and quantified, which will provide a solid basis for its structural optimization and design from kinematic view.
