For high concrete face rockfill dam (CFRD) based on deep overburden layers, the interaction between dam body and foundation results in the dynamic response and permanent deformation during the earthquake. Using the 3D non-linear dynamic FEM and “Dam-Reservoir” dynamic coupling system, the dynamic response of high concrete face rockfill dam was analyzed with emphasis on the distribution characters of dynamic displacement, absolute acceleration and dynamic stress. Besides, the seismic liquefaction and seismic settlement of the overburden layers was also discussed. It is shown that the seismic subsidence rate is small and the earthquake liquefaction does not happen under the earthquake with intensity of VII degree.
