As the different QoS requirements of different businesses in wireless sensor networks, we proposed a QoS routing algorithm-EAQoS. The algorithm built multiple paths to sink node by recording the minimum hops of neighbors to sink. Then data was sent by the path that satisfied its QoS requirements and had enough residual energy. According to the comparisons with the SAR routing algorithm, this algorithm has obvious advantages in providing different services and prolonging the lifetime of network.
