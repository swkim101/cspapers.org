Depletion codes such as VESTA are used to calculate the evolution of a material subjected to radiation (be it neutrons or another type of particle) for a wide variety of applications in the fields of nuclear safety, radiation protection and environmental health safety. For these applications, experimental validation is paramount. In this paper we will describe the experimental validation of the latest version of VESTA using a set of 76 samples consisting of radiochemical assay data and decay heat measurements. We will describe the general calculation procedure that has been applied to determine the uncertainty on each individual nuclide measurement as well as the general tendencies and detailed results.
