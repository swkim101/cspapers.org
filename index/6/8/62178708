The information management also plays a crucial role in construction contracts management, because information is associated with the terms of construction contracts, and the construction enterprise can fulfill the management of construction efficiently by using the information. Especially in the modern construction engineering, the transferring, collecting, storage and application of information are associated with the quality and efficiency of construction engineering. So we must strengthen the information management in construction engineering to guarantee the engineering construction.
