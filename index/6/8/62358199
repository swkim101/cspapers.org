It is our great pleasure to welcome you all to the Twelfth ACM International Workshop on Data Engineering for Wireless and Mobile Access (MobiDE 2013), held in conjunction with SIGMOD/PODS 2013. MobiDE continues its tradition of bringing together researchers and practitioners in databases, mobile computing, and networking, and providing a day of exciting presentations and discussions. As in previous years, the workshop is a forum to present latest research and engineering results, and set directions in wireless and mobile data management.
