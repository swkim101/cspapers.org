Considers the combination of the CCITT Specification and Description Language (SDL), the Occam programming language, and transputer hardware. The structured use of this combination encourages formality in the total system design process and allows performance to be considered at an early stage in the design. An environment in which an SDL system can be translated to an occam program has been built. The use of this environment assists in producing a correct implementation of SDL, and allows one to estimate the performance of an SDL system on single- and multi-transputer systems at the point of specification.
