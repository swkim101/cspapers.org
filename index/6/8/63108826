Although filament winding is a versatile manufacturing process, it has to cope with inherent boundary conditions which significantly restrict the tailoring potential and the integration possibilities in its products. To optimise the integration of obstacles within filament wound components, a methodology has been developed based on semi-geodesic winding. Maximum friction is applied to minimise fibre path disturbance around the obstacle, thereby integrating the obstacle in a controlled way. In this paper the obstacle integration methodology will be described and preliminary validation results discussed.
