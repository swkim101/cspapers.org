Front-loading problem solving is a strategy that seeks to improve product development performance by shifting the identification and solving of design problems to the earlier phases of product development process. Front-loading reduces the development time by speeding up problem solving process and eliminating the total number of problems solved in a project. Furthermore, it supports intelligent decision making through loading problem solving tasks with required pieces of knowledge. In this work, front-loading is studied from a conceptual view point. Also different approaches for front-loading are investigated and classified. To support the discussions with practical examples, front-loading in studied in the context of engine engineering.Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME
