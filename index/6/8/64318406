It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 4th ACM International Workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental Evaluation and Characterization (WiNTECH) 2009 and to the city of Beijing! Following the three previous successful editions in San Francisco, Montreal and Los Angeles, WiNTECH has now established itself as a high quality forum that brings together researchers sharing new ideas and experiences in experimental wireless systems and networks. 
 
This year, WiNTECH received 25 paper submissions. After a thorough review by the members of the Technical Program Committee, 9 papers were selected for publication. We believe that thanks to the high-quality submissions, we can present a strong and broad technical program. The topics span a significant part of experimental wireless networks' research including methodologies, tools and techniques for both mobile and static wireless network testbeds. We trust you will find the papers both stimulating and valuable. In addition to paper presentations, we will continue with the innovations introduced at last year's WiNTECH program. The workshop will be one full day, featuring 9 papers, 5 posters, and 9 demos which will compete in the WinCool demo contest.
