The MORET 5 Monte Carlo code includes two calculation routes: a multi-group route based on cross-sections calculated from various preliminary cell codes and a continuous energy calculation route. The criticality experimental validation database is made up of 2255 benchmarks, mainly taken from the Handbook of the International Criticality Safety Benchmark Evaluated Experiments Project or performed in French facilities. Most of them have been investigated with the two different routes. The calculation results are generally in good agreement with the benchmarks, depending on the nuclear data used.
