In this paper we present a model processing approach and an accompanying platform for building software engineering tools. The approach is based on small model processing tasks that can be combined to gain higher level functionality, and eventually complete tools. The model processing platform can be seen as middleware that can be integrated with any other tool having an appropriate application programming interface or data transform file format like XMI. As an example of applying the platform, we introduce a tool for validating software architectures against UML architectural profiles, embodying domain, product-line, or platform specific conventions and constraints. The tool and the platform have been used as a part of a maintenance process of real-life mobile terminal software.
