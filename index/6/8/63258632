In this paper we consider manufacturing of elements SRAM with increased density of field-effect transistors consisting these elements. The approach based on manufacturing of the elements in heterostructure with specific configuration. We consider doping of several required areas of the heterostructure by diffusion or by ion implantation. After that dopant and radiation defects have been annealed framework optimized scheme.
