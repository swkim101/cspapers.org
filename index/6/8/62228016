Search Engine retrieves significant and essential information from the web based on the query term given by the user. The query log file contains log entry for every request given by the user to the search engine and it is maintained in the system desktop or in the proxy server. The process of mining the query log file improves the performance of the search engine. The proposed algorithm mines the query log file to discover the similarity between the query keywords and URLs in its first phase. In the second phase, the query cluster and the URL cluster is created by using the combined similarity measure generated from the first phase. The clusters recommend query to the user to frame their future queries based on their previous search histories and click through data. This combined similarity based approach also recommends the user about the URL selection for the future queries. (6 pages)
