The importance of computer aided engineering (CAE) in product development processes and research has been increasing throughout the past years. Consequently, optimization tools gained more and more importance. In state-of-the-art processes and methods concerning structural optimization it is assumed that there exists a set of external loads or load functions acting on the part. Very often modern products represent complex mechatronic system. The fact that the system’s dynamic properties and its overall behaviour may change due to geometric modifications of a part caused by an optimization process is typically neglected. In order to take into account the interaction between the part, dynamic system, control system and the changing mechanical behaviour with all its consequences for the optimization process, a simulation of the complete mechatronic system is integrated into the optimization process within the research work presented in this paper. A hybrid multibody system (MBS) simulation, that is, a MBS containing flexible bodies, in conjunction with a cosimulation of the control system represented by tools of the Computer Aided Control Engineering (CACE) is integrated into the optimization process. The research work presented in this paper is a contribution towards the integration of existing CAE methods into a continuous process for structural optimization. The benefits will be illustrated by an example, namely a part of the humanoid robot ARMAR III of the collaborative research centre for “Humanoid Robots” [1]. Especially the optimization of two parts at a time within one optimization loop allows an efficient optimization of structures “within” their surrounding mechatronic system.Copyright © 2008 by ASME
