In this paper the research based on the idea of use of Soft Input Decryption is further developed. The function of Soft Input Decryption is to integrate decryption into the decoding process. This paper shows how Soft Input Decryption can be enhanced using feedback from the channel decoder. In this way, the cooperation between channel coding and cryptography is further develops. Like in Soft Input Decryption, also in feedback method is the usage of reliability L-values of SISO channel decoder of great importance. The results of computer simulations have been presented and discussed.
