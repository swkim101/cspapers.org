Uncertainty in programming is one of the challenging issues to be tackled, because it is error-prone for many programmers to temporally avoid uncertain concerns only using simple language constructs such as comments and conditional statements. This paper proposes ucJava, a new Java programming environment for conquering uncertainty. Our environment provides a modular programming style for uncertainty and supports test-driven development taking uncertainty into consideration.
