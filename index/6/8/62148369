The paper introduces the design of elevator monitor system, and the system can monitor the running status of the elevator and ensure the safety of the elevator. The system is based on Freescale corporation MCF51AC128 Coldfire microcontroller. We adopted Free Real Time Operating System (FreeRTOS) as software platform. We adopted General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Controller Area Network (CAN) bus technology to implement remote elevator monitor, and users can choose according to their requirement. In addition, the system used capacitance isolation technique to design CAN bus interface and software control flow error check technique to assure reliability. The application shows that the system runs stably. The system is very cost effective and easy to use.
