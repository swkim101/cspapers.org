This paper describes the use of a workshop module within an Undergraduate Modular Degree Scheme to investigate the technical and educational issues involved in providing an introductory course in Multimedia title production. A major issue is the discernment of criteria for "Quality" in Multimedia titles. Conclusions are drawn concerning the identification of certain essential skills such as creativity, project management and inter-personal skills, needed by the student in order to produce a high quality title.
