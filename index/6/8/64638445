This paper aims to analyse how films can represent urban sound ambiences. Therefore, it takes a closer look at the so called “city sinfonies”, films made between the late silent era and the early sound years. In a second section, it moves forward to contemporary cinema, analysing productions in which the representation of the city area plays a central part. In each of the films cited, and at this point it makes no difference to this analysis which period they come from, it is of our interest to think 
of the specific part of the cinematic representation given to sound, as far as it is possible to think about how listening to those films can lead the spectator towards a reflexion on how they relate to sounds that surround them in the urban space they live in.
