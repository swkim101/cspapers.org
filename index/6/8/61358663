In this paper, we present a new algorithm called, BiBinConvmean, for biclustering of binary microarray data. It is a novel alternative to extract biclusters from sparse binary datasets. Our algorithm is based on Iterative Row and Column Clustering Combination (IRCCC) and Divide and Conquer (DC) approaches, K-means initialization and the CroBin evaluation function (6). Applied on binary synthetic datasets, our algorithm outperforms other biclustering algorithms for binary microarray data. Biclusters with different numbers of rows and columns can be detected, varying from many rows to few columns and few rows to many columns. Our algorithm allows the user to guide the search towards biclusters of specific dimensions.
