An overview is given of a system for specification development as well as the method and the tools that support it. The objectives of the system are to produce specifications which are: clear, consistent, complete and totally unambiguous; support mathematical reasoning; and lead to the production of relevant documentation and the automatic generation of application code. The system addresses requirements expression. It comprises a language and a set of tools for manipulating statements in the language. The system toolset is rule-based with a mathematical foundation in predicate calculus and relational algebra. It is susceptible to mathematical reasoning and it is applicable to a wide range of problem areas. Tools available include a (syntax directed) editor, compiler, animator, a preliminary symbolic manipulator and a partial code generator. Additional tools under development include a configuration manager, an extended code generator and some preliminary mathematical reasoning tools. >
