This paper presents the new approach to ray tracing for nuclear reactor neutron transport computer simulation analysis. This method is aimed for Monte-Carlo methods as well as for deterministic neutron transport methods. Special attention is attended for reactor core composed of a set of material zones with complicate geometrical boundaries.The idea of this approach is described. Method works for 3-D space in general case. Algorithms of octree map generation and the tracing phases for typical geometric bodies are given. Simple 2-D numerical benchmark is given to demonstrate the advantage of new approach.
