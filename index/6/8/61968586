We demonstrate the use of a hyper-programming system to build persistent Java applications in PJama, an orthogonally persistent version of Javaa. This allows program representations to contain type-safe links to persistent objects embedded directly within the source code. The potential benefits include greater potential for static program checking, improved efficiency, and reduced programming effort.
