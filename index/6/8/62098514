As an important means of clinical diagnoses and treatment of liver diseases, CT scan of liver has been applied more widely. How to extract liver from CT image automatically and accurately is one of the hot topics in the field of medical image segmentation. Because of the diversity and complexity of medical image, traditional segmentation methods may cause errors. Therefore, this paper presents an improved image segmentation method based on three-dimensional region growing algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method is an effective way for improving the accuracy of liver segmentation.
