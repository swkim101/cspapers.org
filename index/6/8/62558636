In this paper, a strategy as proposed whach takes into account all aspects of wezghted random testzng for BIST. Our approach arwes from results concernzng the ampact of wezght roundang and a new combznataon of known technzques lake couplzng unweaghted and weighted pattern generatzon, basang weaght calculatzon on a precomputed test [2, 61, numerical maxzmazataon of pattern coverage [4], GURT-like hardware amplementatzon [lo], and avozdzng auto-correlataons. As an empiracal evaluation, we examzned the only random pattern resastant ISCAS 85 benchmarks c2670 and c7552. For these ctrcuats, 100% fault coverage was achieved after a total of 16,000 and 256,000 patterns, respectively. The hardware overhead compared to a pure random test as less than 2.5%.
