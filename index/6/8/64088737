Imitating the practice of Work Integrated Learning (WIL) in Australian human capital capacity building, this research is based on student internship as a form of WIL. The aim of the research is to compile enough data and information, collected by students and their supervisors during their internships, write two text books on 1) Population and Tax; and 2) Political Party Accountability, to be used later as teaching aids. The textbooks are specifically written for elective subjects for Sociology, Political Sciences and Public Administration programs. All chapters were written by a research working group of nine lecturers, and are designed to compliment 50 hours of work experience by students at government and NGO institutions. Students who undertook the internship received a minimum of 2 hours of induction lectures before they started their internships at various institutions related to the topic area of the books and elective subjects. Twelve institutions provided placement for the interns. The research findings show an increase in the students' professional competence benefiting their future career choices and productivity and furthermore have facilitated two new textbooks, based on real-world data, that will guide future WIL programs for elective subjects about population, tax, and the accountability of political parties.
