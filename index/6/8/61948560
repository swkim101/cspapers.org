The growing application of software and resource constraints in software projects development need a more accurate estimate of the cost and effort because of the importance in program planning, coordinated scheduling and resource management including the number of programming's and software design using tools and modern methods of modeling. Effectively control of investment for software development is achieved by accurate cost estimation.The accurate Software Cost Estimation (SCE) is very difficult in the early stages of software development because many of input parameters that are effective in software's effort are very vague and uncertain in the early stages. SCE that is the basis of software projects development planning is considered to be of high accuracy, because if the estimate is less than actual values, confidence factor is reduce and this is means the possibility of failure in project. Conversely, if the project is estimated at more than the actual value it would be the concept of unhelpful investment and waste of resources. In the evaluation of software projects is commonly used deterministic method. But software world is totally different from the linear variables and nowadays for performance and estimation should be used nonlinear and non-probabilistic methods. In this paper, we have studied the SCE Using Fuzzy Logic (FL) and we have compared it with COCOMO model. Results of investigations show that FL is a performance model for SCE.
