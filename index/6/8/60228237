Microarray data provides a powerful basis for analysis of gene expression. Data mining methods such as clustering have been widely applied to microarray data to link genes that show similar expression patterns. However, this approach usually fails to unveil multiple interactions by the same gene. Association rule mining has been used for this purpose, but the inherent limitations of association rules limit the applicability of the results. In this paper we use a combination of association rule mining and loglinear modeling to discover k-gene interactions. Using this technique we can discover interactions among k-genes that cannot be explained by the combined effects of any of the subsets of those genes. We test our technique experimentally, using yeast microarray data. Our results reveal some previously unknown associations that have solid biological explanations.
