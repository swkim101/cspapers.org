We present CARPANTA, an e-mail summarization system that applies a knowledge intensive approach to obtain highly coherent summaries. Robustness and portability are guaranteed by the use of general-purpose NLP tools, but it also exploits language- and domain-dependent knowledge. The system is evaluated against a corpus of human-judged summaries, reaching satisfactory levels of performance.
