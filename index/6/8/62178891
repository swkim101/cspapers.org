Video cameras are no longer being used only in their traditional role of providing "viewable pixels", but are rapidly becoming sources of intelligent information about the world. More recently 3D cameras are being developed to directly provide 3D measurements of objects and scenes. Appearance and geometry of objects and scenes, and the temporal dynamics of objects are the key information bearing sources for deriving visual intelligence. This talk will highlight sensor data analysis techniques for creating intelligent representations from 2D and 3D sensors. Intelligent sensor data analytics can be performed for mobile as well as widely distributed static sensor platforms. Applications ranging from 3D video manipulation, 3D situational awareness, wide area surveillance and tracking to video/3D object recognition and fingerprinting will be used to illustrate the work.
