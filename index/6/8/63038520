This dissertation expands the understanding of the relationship between mobility and technology for ubiquitous computing. Beginning with an examination of urban mobility, I propose and illustrate new ways researchers might study and design for this complex field by first looking for insight from a different discipline, cultural geography. Building on this foundation, I present two ethnographic studies done on the public transportation systems of Orange County, California and London, UK, which investigate the aesthetic aspects of urban journeys. An analysis of this ethnographic work gives rise to a series of inspirations for design, which act as new avenues for technological explorations of urban mobility. Drawing from these principles and ethnographic material, I will describe two very different design concepts envisioned for use in the London Underground: a mobile music sharing system, undersound, and an augmented Oyster Card wallet, SeeShell. A reflection upon these interrelated pieces of research will serve to highlight new, actionable directions, for further ubiquitous computing work relating to mobility.
