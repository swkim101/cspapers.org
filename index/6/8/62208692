Taking into account the gradually expanded scale of large interconnected power system, especially the UHV synchronous grid successfully puts into operation. Traditional centralized computing will encounter the bottleneck of hardware computing power. A protection setting online checking hybrid parallel algorithm based on P2P is proposed. Peer-to-peer communications using P2P network technology to achieve inter-regional information fast interactive. The design of MPI+OpenMP hybrid parallel programming models and algorithms is emphatically introduced. Online checking two levels parallel of process-level and thread-level is achieved through the parallel analysis of online checking. Finally, the hybrid parallel algorithm was tested and compared based on P2P technology distributed parallel computing platform. The results show that the proposed algorithm is correct and effective.
