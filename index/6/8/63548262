The alpha magnetic spectrometer (AMS) is a sophisticated instrument developed for the determination of anti-matter nuclei in the outer space. Following specific requirements the silicon sensors are included in an array of several thin carbon fiber composite tubes of different length in various horizontal layers, which will be supported by an outcr vertical cylindrical structure also made in composite. A structural analysis of single tubes and of the complete structure has been performed using a fine element code. The main results of this study are reported in terms of maximum lateral displacement of tubes, suggesting the necessity to use shock absorbers between them; and in terms of vibration behavior expressed as the equivalent Von Misses stresses. The analysis shows that the designed structure accomplish with NASA specifications. where triangular elements were considered. The weight of electronic was considered increasing the density of the outer structure, where it is glued.
