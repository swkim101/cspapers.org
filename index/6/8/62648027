One kind of processors with coprocessor is widely used in control areas. Traditional single-core operating system (OS) cant support the coprocessor. In order to take full advantage of the performance of the processor, we presented a real-time operating system framework named AutoOSEK-CP on the basis of AutoOSEK, which is a single-core operating system based on AutoSAR OS, to support dual-core processor. In this architecture, alarm management, interrupt processing and inter-core communication mechanism were moved in coprocessor module, and the master processor was responsible for the other functions of OS. Finally, we designed a prototype of AutoOSEK-CP to test the performance in HCS12XEP100. The results showed that the real-time performance and the time-tick accuracy were improved significantly compared with AutoOSEK.
