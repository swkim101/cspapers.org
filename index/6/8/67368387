It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 9th Workshop on Large-Scale and Distributed Systems for Information Retrieval -- LSDS-IR'11. As in the previous years, LSDS-IR continues to be the leading venue for presentation of cutting edge research findings on topics including largescale data processing, efficient and scalable information systems, large-scale web search, and distributed information retrieval. The primary objective of the LSDS-IR workshop is to bring together both young and experienced researchers to share their ideas and disseminate their research findings among a small yet tightly coupled researcher community working on large-scale and distributed information retrieval systems. 
 
This year's call has attracted nine papers. The author affiliations spanned four different continents (Asia, Europe, South America, and North America) and eleven different countries (Argentina, Chile, China, Czech Republic, Greece, France, Italy, Norway, Spain, U.K., and U.S.A.). The program committee, which is formed of 24 experienced researchers, accepted six papers for presentation in the workshop. The accepted papers cover a diverse set of research areas, including P2P information retrieval systems, community detection in social networks, search efficiency, and management of web graphs. In addition to these, the workshop program contains two keynote speeches by leading researchers and a group presentation session, in which selected research groups will have the opportunity to present their on-going research.
