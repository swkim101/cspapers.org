This paper presents an embedded cognitive kernel, along with a common-sense ontology, designed for robotics. We believe that a direct and explicit integration of cognition is a compulsory step to enable human-robots interaction in semantic-rich human environments like our houses. The OpenRobots Ontology (ORO) kernel allows to turn previously acquired symbols into concepts linked to each other. It enables in turn reasoning and the implementation of other advanced cognitive functions like events, categorization, memory management and reasonning on parallel cognitive models. We validate this framework on several cognitive scenarii that have been implemented on three different robotic architectures.
