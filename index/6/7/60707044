This paper formalizes the notion of justified plans, which captures the intuition behind "good" plans. A plan is called justified if it does not contain operators that are not necessary for achieving a goal. We explore several different types of justification, present algorithms for removing "useless" operators from a plan, and show that the task to remove all useless operators is NP-complete.
