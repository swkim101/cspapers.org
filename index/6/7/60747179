Notwithstanding the latest buzzword (grid, cloud, utility computing, SaaS, IaaS, KaaS, PaaS, etc.), large-scale computing and cloud-like infrastructures are here to stay. How exactly they will look like tomorrow is still for the markets to decide, yet one thing is certain: clouds bring with them new untested deployment and associated adversarial models and vulnerabilities. Thus, it is essential that our community becomes involved at this early stage. The Cloud Computing Security Workshop (CCSW) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in all security aspects of cloud-centric and outsourced computing. 
 
The call for papers attracted overwhelming interest from the community with over 34 submissions from Asia, Canada, Europe, and the United States. The program committee accepted 5 full and 9 short papers. Additionally, four distinguished speakers were invited: Leendert van Doorn, AMD Senior Fellow, Eric Grosse, the Google Security Engineering Director, Steve Riley, Amazon Web Services' Sr. Technical Program Manager, and Michael Waidner, IBM Security CTO.
