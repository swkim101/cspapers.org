NS-3 (Network Simulator version 3) could construct a network environment to simulate protocols in computer network. The purpose of this paper is implementing global routing by using the NS-3 with modified OSPF source code. The processing of simulation had been described with C++ code. Furthermore, the result of the network simulation had been analyzed with different software tools such as gawk, gunplot. In this paper we focused on simulating the global routing of Internet by NS-3 and analyzing the related theories about the routing protocol, at last, this paper was analyzing the average delay under different rates.
