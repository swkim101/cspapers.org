Welcome to MobiSys 2007! This year's conference continues the MobiSys tradition of providing a forum for the presentation of innovative research in mobile systems, applications, and services, with an emphasis on results obtained from experiments with working implementations. 
 
We received 105 paper submissions by authors from 23 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. Each paper received three initial reviews by members of the program committee, assisted by a small number of additional topic experts. Based on the results of this first round of reviews, 73 papers went on to a second round where each received a fourth review. An email discussion among the reviewers of each paper proceeded to narrow the pool to 57 papers. The program committee then met in person for a full day in Tucson, Arizona, to discuss these remaining papers. At that meeting 22 papers were selected for acceptance. Each of these papers was later shepherded by a member of the program committee to guide the authors in addressing recommendations made by the reviewers and during the meeting. The end result of this process is the set of papers that you find printed in these proceedings. In addition to the sessions devoted to presenting these papers, the conference program includes a keynote address, a panel discussion, a demo and poster session, and three workshops.
