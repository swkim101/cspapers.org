Hypothesis / aims of study There is a comorbidity and a possible causality between nocturnal enuresis (NE), sleepdisorders and attention deficithyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as suggested by CK Yeung, a theory that has not yet been confirmed, although we found some correlation in an extremely therapy resistant population. If the mismatch between nocturnal diuresis/functional bladdervolume, resulting in enuresis has a negative effect on cognitive function and sleep characteristics, then an effective anti-enuretic therapy should ameliorate these comorbid symptoms.
