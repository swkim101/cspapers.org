: This paper presents a robust system for online handwritten Chinese/Japanese character recognition. Online handwritten character recognition, recognizing characters from their trajectories, will be used more widely, with the development and proliferation of pen-based or touch-based input devices such as tablet terminals, smart phones, electronic whiteboards and digital pens (e.g., Anoto pen). This paper focuses on the online handwritten Chinese/Japanese character recognition, and describes its recent technology trends, problems and methods to solve them.
