The authors review some of the services that could be supported over a broadband multi-service network and present some of the associated control and management issues. The wide range of services which need to be supported will challenge the design of the associated software system. A number of standards have and are being developed to help with this and there are many exciting issues to be addressed on the route to a broadband multi-service network. By drawing on practical work currently being undertaken within BT Laboratories and studies into available equipment, a progression from MAN systems, initially supporting only a few services, to a broadband multi-service network, is presented as the likely evolutionary path. The authors raise the question as to whether a software system can be flexible, service independent, fast, reliable, and at the same time remain cost effective. >
