Attempts to specify requirements adequately normally fail - sometimes catastrophically. One reason is the lack of a rigorously defined method which directly addresses the needs of requirement specification. CORE, the subject of this paper, is such a method. CORE is the result of several years of practical experiment by the author, using a number of published approaches to specification and design. It is supported by a diagrammatic notation whose key features are a composite of ideas drawn from several widely used notations for expression of requirement or design.
