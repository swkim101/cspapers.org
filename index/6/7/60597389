It is a pleasure to present to you the proceedings of this year's ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2012), held October 16-18 in Raleigh, NC, USA. 
 
This year we received 423 submissions from 41 countries. Each submission was reviewed by a technical program committee of 61 experts as well as over 293 external reviewers. The final program contains 81 full papers, a record number for any computer security conference so far, representing an acceptance rate of 19%. 
 
The double-blind review process was organised in two rounds; it included an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews between rounds; and was followed by a discussion amongst the PC - a process that spanned overall 10 weeks. Reviews were assigned between phases dynamically to maximise scrutiny and discussion around submissions whose inclusion in the program was most uncertain. Overall 1395 reviews were filled, including 489 from external reviewers. Overall 365 papers received at least 3 reviews and 149 papers received at least 4 reviews - some 5 or 6. The decision to allocate fewer than 3 reviews to some papers was taken on the basis of both qualitative feedback, as well as a systematic quantitative analysis of the likelihood of them being included in the program given the first round reviews. 
 
Many papers that were not selected for presentation contained interesting results and ideas, and we hope that the authors have benefitted from reviews to improve them further and eventually present them. We have also worked closely with the Program Chairs of workshops associated with CCS to ensure that authors have an opportunity to submit their work in those venues.
