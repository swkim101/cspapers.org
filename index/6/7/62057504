The emergence of portable devices and online social networks (OSNs) has changed the traditional video consumption paradigm by simultaneously providing multi-screen video watching, social networking engagement, etc. One challenge is to design a unified solution to support ever-growing features while guarantee system performance. In this demo, we design and implement a multi-screen technology to provide multi-screen interactions over wide area network (WAN). Furthermore, we incorporate face-detection technology into our system to identify users' bio-features and employ a machine learning based traffic scheduling mechanism to improve the system performance.
