Whan a user interacts with a natural language system, ha may wall uaa words and expressions which ware not anticipated by tha systea designers. This paper describes a systea which can play TIC-TAC-TOE, and discuss tha game while it Is in progress. If the system encounters new words, new expressions, or inadvertent ungrammatlcalltles, It attempts to understand what was meant, through contextual inference, and by asking intelligent clarifying questions of the user. The system than records the meaning of any new words or expressions, thus augmenting its linguistic knowledge in the course of user interaction.
