The measurement of geomagnetic field conducted by underwater robot is widely used during cruise, however, it is often influenced by the strong electromagnetic interference of the other large-scale electronic equipment on the robot itself. The leakage magnetic field of high-power brushless DC motor (BLDCM) has been identified as one of the main interference source. To obtain accurate geomagnetic data, it is necessary to analyze the magnetic field characteristics of the leakage field of BLDCM. In this paper, we build a two-dimensional BLDCM model. In addition, we present the rotor’s leakage magnetic field when the BLDCM is static, dynamic leakage magnetic field of the stator and rotor when BLDCM is working and the near-field characteristic of BLDCM’s leakage magnetic field. Finally, this paper studies the relationship between the frequency of the magnetic field change and the speed of the BLDCM, which can be used to eliminate the AC interference magnetic field. Therefore the measuring accuracy of the geomag...
