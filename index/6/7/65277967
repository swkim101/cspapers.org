In this paper we proposed an algorithm for handling the aliasing problem of the images. The proposed method is post processing approach which is applied after the image acquisition. The paper tries to restore the image quality which is affected by the aliased edges, and gives the image free from the effect. The resultant images will have smoother edges than the input image. The algorithm is fast as it does not use the complex mathematical structure and focused itself on the affected areas only. The result on the grayscale images have been displayed to prove the working of algorithm.
