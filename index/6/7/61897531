It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 1st Programmable File Systems Workshop -- PFSW'14 at the 23rd International ACM Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC-23). This workshop focuses on frameworks that allow the programmability of file and storage systems while addressing the risks of data interface change. The workshop aims to serve as a venue for leaders in the file system and storage community to exchange ideas outside the tradition of half a century of classic file and storage systems research, which focused on a small set of unchanging interfaces. 
 
The call for papers attracted 7 submissions from Germany and the United States. The program committee accepted 3 papers that cover programmability topics ranging from automated resource provisioning, active object storage programming, and policy-based data management. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech by Alvin Cheung (MIT CSAIL) on "Rethinking the Application-Database Interface" and a fishbowl panel on "Programmable File Systems: What, Why, How?" We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers interested in programmable file and storage systems.
