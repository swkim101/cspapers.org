In multi-objective problems, one is often interested in generating the envelope of the objective-space, where the envelope is, in general, a superset of pareto-optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a method for tracing the envelope of multi-objective topology optimization problems, and generating the corresponding topologies. The proposed method exploits the concept of topological sensitivity, and is applied to bi-objective optimization, namely eigenvalue-volume, eigenvalue-eigenvalue and compliance-eigenvalue problems. The robustness and efficiency of the method is illustrated through numerical examples.Copyright Â© 2011 by ASME
