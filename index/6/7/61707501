COGSYS is unusual in several respects. Firstly, it is an almost unique example of collaboration between UK companies to exploit home-grown research. Secondly, the target of the cooperation is an AI product designed for real-time reasoning in the world of industry. Finally the technical specification is being driven by the industrial users themselves. COGSYS is being developed by a collaborative club whose objectives are: to support the building of a fully engineered continuous reasoning system-COGSYS-for commercial and production use; to support the exploitation of COGSYS for club profit; and to provide an educational and awareness component. Specifically, COGSYS is an AI product which provides the framework and functions for the industrial user to configure a real-time reasoning system for a specific industrial application. The COGSYS product comprises a generator system which allows the user to build the application and a run-time system which runs the application itself. The author describes these systems and goes on to look at COGSYS networks, COGSYS evaluation at various test sites and the future of COGSYS. >
