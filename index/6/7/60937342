This chapter describes a number of empirical studies in the use of the data mining approach to the analysis of health information. The examples serve to highlight the factors perceived as influencing the success or otherwise of the data mining approach in each case and to illustrate the difficulties which may be encountered during the data mining process and how they may be overcome.
