When an application is being executed, users can read the application's output. If sensitive information is managed by an application, information should be prevented from being leaked to unauthorized users during application execution. The prevention can be achieved through information flow control. Since the procedural C language is still in use heavily, we developed a model based on role-based access control (RBAC) for C applications. This paper describes the model.
