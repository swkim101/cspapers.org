It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 1st ACM Workshop on Networking, Systems, and Applications for Mobile Handhelds -- MobiHeld 2009. Today mobile handheld devices come in many forms, ranging from traditional cellular phones, smart phones, music players, electronic book readers, computation capable watches, and many more. This platform has grown both in numbers and their programmability in the recent years and is likely to change the computing, communications landscape in a radical ways in the years to come. The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss, debate, demonstrate, and speculate on emerging challenges in this domain within the broad context of its networking, systems, and applications related issues. 
 
In this first year, MobiHeld attracted 21 paper submissions from a diverse set of countries, including Belgium, England, Finland, France, Germany, India, Israel, Slovenia, and the United States. The program committee deliberated over all of these submissions and accepted 10 of these papers for regular presentation in the workshop. These papers cover a wide range of topics, such as new input mechanisms, collaborative video recording, tracking medical drugs, facilitating electronic payments, enabling distributed computation, multi-player online games, web search techniques, energy efficiency issues, and user privacy. In addition, MobiHeld also accepted 8 posters and 2 demonstrations, some of which were picked from the paper submissions. These proceedings capture all of the above content, and we hope that they will serve as a valuable reference this growing community.
