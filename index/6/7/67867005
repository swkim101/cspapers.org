The new graduate curriculum initiative, COSMIC: Change Opportunity - Start Masters in Computing, is aimed at an adult population that is typically under-served by computing programs at institutions of higher education. The COSMIC initiative provides an accelerated pathway to a professional Master of Science (MS) degree for individuals who do not have an undergraduate degree in computing, but who wish to cross over into the computing field. The COSMIC initiative is based on a highly focused summer bridge course combined with a customized curriculum pathway that allows people without computer science degrees to merge quickly and efficiently into a professional MS in Computing degree program. In this poster, we discuss our bridge course, additional bridge curriculum and its connection to our MS in Computing program; and present preliminary data from initial COSMIC cohorts. The COSMIC initiative's goal is to provide the computing profession with a documented model for training students that seek to cross over from non-computer science undergraduate degrees to work in the computing field.
