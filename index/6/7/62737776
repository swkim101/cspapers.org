Compared with other methods, the question sentences processing method based on sentence-template match avoids complex lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis, but the size of the question template library is the key. To solve this problem, this paper used domain ontology and semantic block to build question templates, and added synonymous question templates into question model, then proposed a question template matching algorithm based on the semantic similarity, length similarity and sequence similarity. The experimental results show that this method greatly improves the success rate to extract the semantic features of users question sentences.
