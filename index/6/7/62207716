In order to evaluate the efficiency of the new spectrometry detector available in the STEP unit of the R&D from EDF, a numerical model of the FALCON 5000 radiation measurement system, based on the Ge technology, has been constructed thanks to the computer calculation code MCNPX. Due to the ignorance of the source term and the geometry of irradiation in our facilities, some cases of irradiation induce by a radioactive source has been planed to be simulated with different parameters which has been studied. For different energies and different distances and angles of incidence, simulations have been performed in order to assess an average the response of the modeled detector by MCNPX. Thanks to all these results, a global curve for the efficiency has been established taking into account of the energy, the distance between the source and the detector and the angle of incidence of the photon. The modeling of the detector, its validation and the efficiency curve have been presented in this paper.
