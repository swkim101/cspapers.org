Summary form only given. The word “Robot” means many things. According to some definitions “A robot is a mechanical contraption which can perform tasks on its own, or with guidance. In practice a robot is usually an electromechanical machine which is shown what to do by computer and electronic programming.” And another says “A machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically, especially one programmable by a computer.” All these definitions lead us to realize that these Robots are not intelligent machines so they seek our instructions to function. The sub category “mobile robots” serve us from domestic applications, exploration and mapping, traffic control systems, aero space applications, flight controlling and in network centric warfare.
