In this paper, we present a design concept that aims to combine a purely natural phenomena of falling snowflakes and new communication technologies. We propose a new application that helps the user to connect with nature in a way that is at the same time educational, playful and aesthetic. We utilize a mobile platform to analyze and process the information received by the camera equipped with a specially designed gadget. We also present the background information for our concept and offer applications where the concept can be adapted. Author
