Humanitarian Free/Open Source Software (HFOSS) participation has been shown to promote real world experience and a create a portfolio of work for students that prove to be valuable assets for entering the work force. Creating a senior level software engineering elective that provides the scaffolding for students to participate in an HFOSS project allows professors to ease the often daunting steep learning curve that exists in contributing to these projects. Educators in computer science have recognized that building community within student cohorts provides many benefits for all students as well as being important for creating inclusive environments for underrepresented minorities. Based on the Communities of Practice model, developed by Lave and Wenger, mentorship also plays an important role in bridging entrance into professional communities. Using a classroom model that incorporates both levels of community by putting students into self-selected groups and using mentors from an HFOSS project provides the mechanisms for the aforementioned scaffolding. This poster will show the student perceived benefits of this course for their overall understanding of their place within the community of CS practitioners, their ability to participate with a diverse group of developers, and how this experience influences how they see their skills in relation to a project of this size. Included will also be lessons learned by teaching this course and resources for teachers to build the knowledge for teaching a course in HFOSS development.
