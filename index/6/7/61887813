In cloud computing users always hope their identity can’t be disclosed while they access the cloud service. Although there are many research focus on the security issue in cloud, none work has been carefully addressed about the proposed problem. To allay users' concerns of disclosure of their identity, we proposed a novel approach based on private matching protocol to protect users’ sensitive information in cloud computing. Besides, this paper also states the new problem of privacy indexing in the internet and proves that our proposed protocol can avoid privacy indexing in the cloud.
