Hand hygiene is essential in preventing costly and potentially lethal hospitalacquired infections. Proposed by the World Health Organization, the Five Moments of Hand Hygiene is an evidence-based and field-tested categorization designed to measure and improve clinical hand hygiene. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of a viewpoint invariant convolutional network for automatically identifying the five moments of hand hygiene. Using de-identified images from privacy-safe depth sensors inside patient rooms, we demonstrate the viability of our deep learning method and provide interpretable visualizations. Our results show that computer vision can offer high-fidelity monitoring of this paramount clinician behavior.
