This paper applies self-determination theory (SDT), a macro-psychological theory of human motivation to explore what gets young women interested in computer science. SDT argues that when students feel equally competent, autonomous, and related to others, they will be intrinsically motivated to study. This paper applies SDT to young women in computer science to identify the best ways to motivate them towards intrinsic motivation to study computer science. Using a survey administered at Bit by Bit, a conference for young women in computer science, this paper identifies that relatedness is significantly more important for girls than either competency or autonomy. Additionally, it determines the psychological pathway through which feeling related to others influences students' motivation. Specifically, it determines that feeling related to others influences young women's sense of self-efficacy, which improves their computer science motivation. These findings contribute to our understanding of SDT and of how to motivate young women to study computer science.
