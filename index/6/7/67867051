Data science encompasses elements of statistics, computer science, and mathematics as well as domain-specific knowledge, suggesting that with interdisciplinary conversations and collaborations we can make data science curricula more comprehensive and successful. Development of such programs provide an exciting collaboration opportunity for faculty in statistical and computer and mathematical sciences as well as a wide array of other disciplines. This BOF provides an opportunity for faculty involved/interested in the development of undergraduate data science curricula to come together and discuss forming collaborations across disciplines and what the disciplines can learn from each other. The discussion will be led by faculty from computer science and statistics departments who have been involved with both disciplinary and interdisciplinary data science education initiatives. One of the goals of this BOF is to jumpstart conversations across disciplines, which we hope the audience will continue at their home and/or nearby institutions.
