In the light of recent press coverage of Wolverhampton University's attempts to sensitise students and staff to the dangers of copying and plagiarism in assessed coursework, it is timely to look at one facet of this problem peculiar to software engineering, namely the copying of source code by novice programmers, especially those novice programmers on high-volume modular programmes of study. This paper attempts to review the issue of plagiarism and copying from a wide variety of angles and in the light of this review draws on informal surveys and ongoing project work at Wolverhampton to highlight possible improvements. The paper starts by reviewing the most general factors that influence academic misdemeanors. These factors are common to all subjects and cover not only the institutional climate and its regulatory framework, but also the professional ( as opposed to academic ) context of courses and aspects of course management, particularly the assessment regimes, staff: student numbers, strategies for deploying staff and the extent of permeability and modularity. Moving on specifically to plagiarism in novice programmers' source code, surveys of our teaching staff and feedback from students inform a discussion of why students copy, how they go about it, how staff currently detect such copying and how they feel computer support would help to fight the problem. Having got this far, it is clear that we need to review how the choice of initial programming language and environment is a factor in the occurrence of copying and plagiarism. Moving onto a more practical treatment, we look at the technical issues involved in implementing computer support for copying detection, specifically detection-in-the-small, that is dealing with mere handfuls of programs, and homes in on some strategies investigated by student projects. Finally the paper tackles the problem of detection-in-the-large, that is dealing with high volumes of programs from large introductory programming modules, and of validating such detection programs. The purpose of this paper is to stimulate discussion of all these issues and the ways in which they are inter-related.
