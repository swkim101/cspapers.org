2014 has been an exceptional year for wearable technology, and this year's conference promises a broad program of cuttingedge research and discussion. In the last year wearable technology has reached the consumer market in unprecedented volume. New products emerge daily, in the form of apparel, accessories, and personal devices. With the explosion of consumer and media interest comes important questions and passionate discussion. As always, the ISWC program presents a diverse array of cuttingedge developments in both theory and practice of wearable technology, continuing to move the field ever forward while providing a forum for reflection and discussion of emerging themes, technologies, and perspectives. Our keynote speaker Amy Ross, lead Space Suit designer at NASA, will present one of the highlights of this year's program: a vision of the far future of wearable technology, apparel and on-body technologies that will facilitate travel to asteroids, Mars, and beyond.
