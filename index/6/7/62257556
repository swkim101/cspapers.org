1. Introduct ion Expert systems provide a rich testbed from which to develop and test techniques for natural language processing. These systems capture the knowledge needed to solve real-world problems in their respective domains, and that knowledge can and should be exploited for testing computational procedures for natural language processing. Parsing. semantic ,nterpretation, dialog monitoring, discourse organization, and text gef,eration are just a few of the language processinq problems that might takeadvantage of the pre.structured semantic knowledge of an expert system. In particular, the need for explanation generation facilities for expert systems provides an opportunity to explore the relationships between the underlying knowleqge structures needed for automated reasoning and those needed for natural language processing. One such exploration was the development of an explanation generator for XSEL, which is an expert system that hellos a salesperson in producing a purchase order for a computer system[10]. This pager describes a technique called "link-dependent message generation" that forms the basis for explanation generation in XSEL.
