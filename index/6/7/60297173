Searching for information in a specific topic has always been a challenge in computer networks. The semantic web approach provides the documents with metadata that helps exploring the web by categorizing the pieces of information. Another way for information retrieval is the peer-to-peer (p2p) approach that looks up the specified document in a distributed network. This latter solution generates huge network traffic because the basic p2p protocols do not take the content of the stored or searched documents into account. Some initiatives are launched to increase the hit rate and/or decrease the network traffic by dynamically changing the network topology based on run-time statistics or some kind of semantic information. Our solution improves the performance of a peer-to-peer network by constructing semantic profiles based on document metadata followed by a comparison of the semantic similarities on generalized topics, where these topic generalizations are made with an adaptive algorithm that utilize a well-tried full-language taxonomy.
