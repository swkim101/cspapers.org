Successful selection of COTS software is difficult and requires tight integration of 2 processes multicriteria decision making and requirements engineeringwhich are both complex and problematic. The selection of COTS software is a multi-criteria decision-making process However, it is problematic because the selection criteria (i.e. the requirements) are often incomplete and interdependent, and one COTS software rarely satisfies all of the criteria. However, when selecting anti-virus systems, there are added problems. The reason is that for the anti-virus systems, is that you can not just run and test the software as you would do in in other systems. This paper reports some lessons learned in the selection of a anti-virus software for a merchant bank. These lessons were later incorporated into a methods for COTS software selection.
