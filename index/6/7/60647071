Stored program control switches split their functions between hardware and software; therefore, the effective allocation of functions is important in system design. A fault recovery process simulator is useful in supporting the designer's thinking because he can easily test his ideas for the function allocation and confirm the system behavior with the tool before hardware and software designs become far advanced. The paper describes hardware and software specifications and a simulation technique based on these specifications. The main subjects discussed are: the model of the fault recovery process for hardware faults in ESS; the fault recovery process; user interfaces; and the simulation technique. >
