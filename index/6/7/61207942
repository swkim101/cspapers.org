Too many scientific arguments in peer-reviewed articles are backed by flawed or inadequate data. Articles can now be annotated in pre- or post-publication review using models such as W3C Open Annotation, to produce multipolar argumentation networks as an overlay on Web documents. This would assist in improving scientific reproducibility by integrating discussion and analysis of doubtful results.
