With the growing number of debit card transactions, security issues have arisen correspondingly. By applying the latest technical innovations, criminals are using more and more effective methods of card fraud. They are exploiting security weaknesses of existing debit card payment rules. For instance, if a criminal has acquired the complete card data, he will be then able to use it to withdraw money until the card is blocked. To authorize each payment and to guarantee the integrity of payment information, we have developed a service architecture for mobile signature secured payments at the POS, which we present in this paper. To support the proposed architecture we suggest service subscription and payment protocols.
