In 2016, we launched an interdisciplinary, undergraduate Data Analytics major that extends the definition of "interdisciplinary" beyond computer science, mathematics, and statistics to the natural and social sciences, humanities, and fine arts. Our program was conceived, and continues to be administered, as an independent academic unit by a Committee of faculty representing ten disciplines. Students majoring in Data Analytics complete four or more mathematics and computer science courses, four project-oriented Data Analytics courses, three to four courses in one of seven applied domains, and a required summer internship. Data Analytics courses are taught by both dedicated Data Analytics faculty and other faculty from the Committee. Partnerships with campus offices, alumni, businesses, and nonprofits have enhanced both coursework and internship opportunities. The major's popularity has exceeded our expectations, and has succeeded in attracting students with a variety of academic interests, many of whom would not have otherwise pursued a computational or quantitative major.
