This paper describes the design and implementation of MINIX file system for an ARM based multi-process mono-kernel embedded operating system, including overview of MINIX file system, design of SD card driver, design of file system routines such as caching, essential functions, system call functions, and system call interface functions. At the final, the paper provides a demo example to show the effect of the file system routines, including commonly used file operations such as opening, closing, reading and writing by positioning, getting status, and removing, as well as a brief function for listing directories.
