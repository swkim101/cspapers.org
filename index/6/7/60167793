• Specifying a reward function by hand is not easy in most of the practical problems [Abbeel & Ng, 2004]. • It is often easier to demonstrate examples of a desired behavior than to define a reward function. • In apprenticeship learning, we assume that the reward function is unknown. There are two parts involved in apprenticeship learning: 1. An expert agent demonstrating an optimal policy πE for some states. 2. A apprentice agent trying to learn a generalized policy πA by observing the expert.
