Lots of community empowerment programs in tourism development has been done in order to improve social welfare and maintaining quality of physical, social and cultural aspect. Unfortunately, community empowerments often deal with a lot of problems, partly due to the lack of insight of local community about the importance of sustainable tourism management. The problems become more difficult when the community based tourism (CBT) program should applied in mountain based destination, with tight preservation function. The regulations of tourism development are tight, while the willingness of local community to participate as a part of tourism system is high. Therefore, some of the community empowerment program should be directed to the activities that support the program of sustainable tourism development. Regarding to this problem, the research was done to analyze the relationship between community's insight on sustainable tourism with their willingness to participate in sustainable development program. The hypothesis is people who have a good insight expected to participate in voluntary sustainable tourism development activities. The research was conduct in Ciwidey district, a popular mountain based destination in West Java, Indonesia. A questionnaire survey was conducted with 100 samples of local community who were identified through Slovin formula. The results indicate that there is a significant correlation between the variable of community insights on sustainable tourism with their participation (Î± = 0.02). It can be interpreted that the higher the public insight the higher the level of community participation. This research is related with the specific aspect of CBT's perception that dealing with individual decision to participate, rather than CBT's model development as previous researches. The result of this research is utilitarian in building other CBT program in mountain based destination, especially in preserving the quality of nature environment.
