In the development of real-time software, there are intimate relationships between the run-time kernel and the real-time application, of which the software designer and developers must be aware. These interrelationships include meeting system deadlines, exhibiting predictable deterministic performance, task scheduling, and minimization of interrupts-off time and interrupt latency. The paper reviews the current state-of-the-art of real-time operating system kernel technology, followed by a discussion of development directions which may be the basis for new operating system kernels as seen by Ready Systems Corporation-a leader in the development of operating system kernels for critical real-time systems. >
