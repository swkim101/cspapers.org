The ACM CIKM 2009 Workshop on Web Information and Data Management (WIDM 2009) is the eleventh in a series of workshops on Web Information and Data Management held in conjunction with the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). The objective of the workshop is to bring together researchers, industrial practitioners and developers to study how Web information can be extracted, stored, analyzed, and processed to provide useful information to the end users for various advanced database applications. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for all experts in the field. 
 
In response to the call for papers, we received 41 papers from 18 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, the United States, and Vietnam. 
 
Starting from 2005, the workshop has a one-day schedule. This year, we adopted a double-blind review process and all papers were reviewed thoroughly by the program committee and external reviewers. The program committee accepted seven full papers and nine short papers, resulting in a competitive 39% acceptance rate. The 16 accepted papers have been divided into four sessions: "Querying, Question Answering and Searching", "Web Algorithms", "Web Information Mining and Extraction Techniques", and "Searching, Matching and Browsing". In addition, Professor Dik Lun Lee from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology will present a keynote talk this year.
