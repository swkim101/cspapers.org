Compositional data are a speciﬁc type of multivariate data, in which individual variables represent relative contributions to a whole, typically expressed as 1 or 100%. Driven by a lot of potential applications in many domains, this paper presents various supervised algorithms for learning compositional data from other data sources, leading to a novel multi-label learning setting that bears strong similarities with multivariate regression, multi-label classiﬁcation and multi-class classiﬁcation. Building further upon our previous work on this topic, we compare in this paper several ensemble meth-ods that take into account speciﬁc properties about compositional data. We analyze three diﬀerent types of kernel base learners for bivariate compositions, respectively based on maximum likelihood estimation, least-squares minimization and a label transformation. We also investigate two approaches for aggregating the bivariate predictions of these base learners into multivariate compositions, respectively based on a pairwise and a tree-based decomposition technique. The comparison of the algorithms is supported by empirical results on synthetic data and a real-world application in bioinformatics.
