CARD 2011 presents three mini-panels consisting of three experts in the field, two as panelists and the third as a moderator/panelist. The purpose of this workshop is to serve as a forum in which experts in each field can debate the state of the field and future directions. The format is designed to quickly focus on areas of disagreement, rather than expounding on areas of agreement which, presumably, have ceased to be controversial, at least between the two panelists. 
 
The hope is that the workshop will be useful to a diverse audience from a graduate student looking for good thesis topic areas to a senior researcher who wants to hear the opinions of other area experts. 
 
Each 60 minute panel will consist of an opening statement from each panelist (10 minutes each, 20 minutes total), discussion between the moderator and panelists (5 to 10 minutes), and questions from the audience (30 to 35 minutes).
