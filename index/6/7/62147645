A numerical calculation with the commercial CFD code CFX is conducted for a test facility simulating the CANDU moderator thermal-hydraulics. Two kinds of moderator thermal-hydraulic tests at Stern Laboratories Inc. were performed in the full geometric configuration of the CANDU moderator circulating vessel, which is called a Calandria, housing a matrix of horizontal rod bundles simulating the Calandria tubes. The first of these tests is the pressure drop measurement of a cross flow in the horizontal rod bundles. The other is the local temperature measurement on the cross section of the horizontal cylinder vessel simulating the Calandria. In the present study the full geometric details of the Calandria are incorporated in the grid generation of the computational domain to which the boundary conditions for each experiment are applied. The numerical solutions are reviewed and compared with the available test data.
