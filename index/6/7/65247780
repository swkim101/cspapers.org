The exponential growth of the Social Web is virally infecting more and more critical business processes such as customer support and satisfaction, brand and reputation management, product design and marketing. Because of this global trend, web users already evolved from the era of social relationships, in which they began to get connected and started to share contents, to the era of social functionality, in which they started using social networks as the main platform for communication and dissemination of information. Today, web users are going through the era of social colonization, in which every experience on the Web can be social (e.g., Facebook Like button), and are getting ready for the era of social context, in which web contents will be highly targeted and personalized. The final stage of such Social Web evolution is the so called era of social commerce, in which communities will define future products and services. In such context, the research field of sentiment analysis, which has already been rapidly growing in the last decade, is destined to become more and more important for Web and business dynamics. To this end, the Second International Workshop on Issues of Sentiment Discovery and Opinion Mining (WISDOM 2013: http://sentic.net/wisdom) aims to explore how the wisdom of the crowds is affecting (and will affect) the evolution of the Web and of businesses gravitating around it. In particular, the workshop explores two different stages of sentiment analysis: the former focusing on the identification of opinionated text over the Web, the latter focusing on the classification of such text either in terms of polarity detection or emotion recognition.
