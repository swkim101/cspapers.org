Database applications such as enterprise resource planning systemsand customer relationship management systems are widely usedsoftware systems. Development and testing of database applicationsis difficult because the program execution depends on thepersistent state stored in the database. In this paper we show thathow versioning of the persistent data stored in the database cansolve some critical problems in the development and testing ofdatabase applications can be solved by versioning the data storedin the database. Our solution framework is based on longtransaction management, a well-researched branch of databasesystems. We also present empirical experimental results that showthe proposed framework's effectiveness in practice.
