Camoids are three dimensional cams that can produce more complex follower output than plain disc cams. A camoid follower motion is described by a surface rather than a curve. The camoid profile can be directly synthesized once the follower surface is fully described. To define a camoid follower motion surface it is required that the surface pass by all predefined constraints. Constraints can be follower position, velocity and acceleration. These design constraints are scattered all along the camoid follower surface. Hence a fitting technique is needed to satisfy these constraints which include position and its derivatives (velocity and acceleration). Furthermore if the fitting function can be of a parametric nature, then it would be possible to optimize the follower surface to obtain better performance according to a specific objective. Previous research has established a method to fit camoid follower surface positions, but did not tackle the satisfaction of derivative constraints. This paper presents a method for defining a camoid follower characteristic surface B-Splines on two steps first synthesizing the sectional cam curves then using a surface interpolation technique to generate the follower characteristic surface. The fitting technique is parametric in nature which allows for its optimization. Real coded Genetic algorithms are used to optimize the parameters of the surface to meet a specified objective function. A demonstration problem to illustrate the suggested methodology is presented.Copyright Â© 2008 by ASME
