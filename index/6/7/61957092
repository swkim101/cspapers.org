There is a growing realization that optimization can be applied to many aspects of the software development process - a research area known as Search- Based Software Engineering (SBSE). Search- Based Software Testing - one of the largest research areas within SBSE - is the process of using searchbased optimization algorithms to specifically address problems in software testing. SBST has been applied to a wide variety of testing goals including structural, functional, non-functional and state-based properties. Many approaches to testing and a wide diverse range of development domains have been addressed, including exceptions, interactions, integration, mutation, regression, and web applications. 
 
Work in SBST has developed to the point at which it is now ripe for combination with other areas of software engineering. The common "lingua franca" that makes these combinations possible is the definition of the fitness function that guides a search algorithm. A fitness function is merely a form of metric, and metrics exist across the entire software engineering spectrum. Therefore, the central objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers and industrial practitioners from SBST and the wider software engineering community to share experience and provide directions for future research, and to encourage the use of search techniques to combine aspects of testing with other aspects of the software engineering lifecycle.
