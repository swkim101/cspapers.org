This paper present a typical respiratory movement method simulated by LabVIEW and Simulink.Because calling Matlab in LabVIEW can control hardware easily and realize complex algorithm concurrently,so we combine the capabilities of Simulink and Real-Time Workshop with LabVIEW,and use Simulation Interface Toolkit importing simulation models into LabVIEW.This paper provides a through introduction for respiratory modelling and control design,the combined method that can integrate the advantage of the two method is illustrated for control aim.
