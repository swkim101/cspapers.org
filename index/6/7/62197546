Compliant sheet metal assemblies are often used as support structures in automobiles, airplanes and appliances. These structures not only provide a metrology frame for other modules to be assembled, but also give the product its aesthetic form. For this reason, the dimension quality of the assemblies is a very important factor to control, in order to make sure that the product will function as planned and continuously keep the product cost low. The assembly is influenced by variations in the component parts and the assembly processes. Tolerance analysis, as conducted in most industries today, is normally based on the assumption of rigid parts and is thus not always valid for sheet metal assemblies, due to their compliance. This paper will present a method, based on finite element analysis (FEA) and design of computer experiments, of identifying the influence of input variables on the final geometry variation of the assembly. The influence and the interactions among the input variables are analyzed with a response model that has been constructed, using the simulation results. This response model could be used to identify the important variables that need to be controlled in assembly. An example application is included, in order to demonstrate the simulation model and response model construction. Analysis of the results from the simulations can facilitate the design of the assembly process, in order to control the dimensional quality of the product.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
