This experiment is the third in a series investigating characteristics of software which are related to its psychological complexity. A major focus of this research has been to validate the use of software complexity metrics for predicting programmer performance. In this experiment we improved experimental procedures which produced only modest results in the previous two studies. The experimental task required 54 experienced Fortran programmers to locate a single bug in each of three programs. Performance was measured by the time to locate and successfully correct the bug. Much stronger results were obtained than in earlier studies. Halstead's E proved to be the best predictor of performance, followed by McCabe's v (G) and the number of lines of code.
