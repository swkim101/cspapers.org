This paper discusses implementation of an implicit solid modeling approach to the representation of heterogeneous objects, i.e. solids whose material composition is not uniform. We present a brief review of related literature and then focus on implementation of heterogeneous implicit solid modeling (H-ISM) using a computer algebra system. Several heterogeneous implicit solid models of multi-material objects from standard part catalogues are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of H-ISM implementation.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
