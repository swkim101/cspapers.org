Prior work. Much of the literature on crowdlearning focus on the static case where we have a batch of noisy labels (Raykar, 2010) (Karger, 2011) and need to infer the true labels. The emerging online crowdlearning papers either assumes 1) we can repeatedly access any worker (Yan, 2011), or 2) each worker only labels one item. The decision task is how many labels to obtain for each item (Sheng, 2008).
