We present a Matrix Factorization (MF) based approach for the Netflix Prize competition. Currently MF based algorithms are popular and have proved successful for collaborative filtering tasks. For the Netflix Prize competition, we adopt three different types of MF algorithms: regularized MF, maximum margin MF and non-negative MF. Furthermore, for each MF algorithm, instead of selecting the optimal parameters, we combine the results obtained with several parameters. With this method, we achieve a performance that is more than 6% better than the Netflixâ€™s own system.
