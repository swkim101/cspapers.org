In this paper a new efficient algorithm for computation of corona power loss in grid is described. The algorithm is based on a new finite element method (FEM) which allows computing corona power loss in high-voltage lines transmission. The new algorithm method is intended for considering the effects of various parameters on corona current such as: the height of conductor, the radius of conductor, the surface factor, distribution of electric potentials in space of between conductor and ground plane with applying space charges, and ambient temperature. The algorithm results were compared with the existing methods and the result accuracy was confirmed. Also, the results show that the new algorithm has positional to reduce the number of iteration for calculation of the corona current. The knowledge of the corona phenomena discharge will assist in monitoring and controlling the reliability of high voltage systems. This information can be monitored for measuring, detecting and taking appropriate control actions.
