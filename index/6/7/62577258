Successfully optimization of product designs calls for the continuous evolution of optimized design solutions, which is best achieved by collaboration among a group of experts who understand the intricacies of the product’s characteristics. The achievement of successful collaborations depends on optimization methodologies that focus on design characteristics located at deeper levels of hierarchically decomposed design problems, and the construction of optimization scenarios that have an explicit goal of maximizing the expected profits that result from the collaboration. This paper proposes methodologies and procedures based on hierarchical optimizations that aim to effectively conduct collaborative product design optimizations. The proposed methodologies are applied to a machine product design, and their effectiveness is demonstrated.Copyright © 2009 by ASME
