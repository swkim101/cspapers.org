To achieve this goal, it requires the discovered knowledge is valid and the discovery process itself is reliable. In the last 20 years, many data mining algorithms have been developed for the discovery of knowledge from given data bases. However in many cases, the discovery process is not robust or the discovered knowledge is not reliable or even incorrect in certain cases; moreover, in some real problems, the discovered knowledge may not necessary be the real reflection of the data. Why does this happen? What are major factors which affect the discovery process? How can we make sure that the discovered knowledge is reliable? What are conditions under which a reliable discovery can be assured? These are some interesting questions to be discussed at this workshop.
