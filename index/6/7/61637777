Current reverse engineering approach is an effective way for technology progress of developing countries. Based on analysis of existing reverse engineering technology, a new concept of Product Reverse Engineering (PRE) is proposed and its theoretical framework is discussed first in this paper in order to extend its application from components to the overall product structure and design process. Then a brief introduction is made to the technical system architecture and key techniques for PRE, which include the rapid solid modeling, integrating with existing CAD systems through STEP file, assembly modeling for conceptual structure, and reverse design process reconstruction. Finally, a prototype system PRE-DARFAD is developed with initial verification by a fixture design example.Copyright Â© 2007 by ASME
