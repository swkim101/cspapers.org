This dissertation suggests the effective methodology for the feasibility analysis of R&D program by computing priority through an AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) expert survey and by applying a Fuzzy Measure whereby, through which, giving objectivity and eliminating the duplicated factors. And then, utilizing of the Bayesian Network can allow inference analyses. We can quantitatively define the satisfactory/unsatisfactory level of each program/project factor and each analysis factor by assigning probability values. It is possible to analyze the relationship between program/project evaluation results (qualitative result) and feasibility analysis factor (quantitative analysis). This feasibility analysis framework can infer posteriori probability using the prior probability and the likelihood function of each feasibility factor.
