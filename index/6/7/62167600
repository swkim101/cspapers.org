This paper investigate the utility and feasibility of a computer-based system that supports managers by allowing them to ask questions and issue commands in English. To determine managers' actual requirements an experiment was conducted in which subjects were asked to solve a problem using a Perfect System that could respond to any request made to it. Their behaviour was analyzed to determine the acceptability of the system and the facilities it would have to provide as well as the power of the parser and the vocabulary that would be required. these requirements were modified in light of available technology to design a system that is both useful and feasible.
