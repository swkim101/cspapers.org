This paper proposes an approach to improve word alignment in a specific domain, in which only a small-scale domain-specific corpus is available, by adapting the word alignment information in the general domain to the specific domain. This approach first trains two statistical word alignment models with the large-scale corpus in the general domain and the small-scale corpus in the specific domain respectively, and then improves the domain-specific word alignment with these two models. Experimental results show a significant improvement in terms of both alignment precision and recall. And the alignment results are applied in a computer assisted translation system to improve human translation efficiency.
