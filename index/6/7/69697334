Engineering privacy in information systems requires systematic methods to capture and address privacy issues throughout the development process. However, the diversity of both privacy and engineering approaches, together with the specific context and scope of each project, have spawned a plethora of privacy engineering methods. Method engineering can help to cope with this landscape, as it allows describing existing methods in terms of a limited variety of method elements (and eventually enable their recombination into new, customized methods). This paper applies method engineering to introduce a privacy engineering metamodel, whose applicability is illustrated with a set of popular privacy engineering method elements, and a widely recognized privacy engineering method.
