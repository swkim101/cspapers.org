In order to ensure system performance, it is necessary to model the performance of a system during the entire development phase. Traditional performance modeling approaches, however, lack the ability to optimize the deployment of a distributed system, which is a critical performance aspect. Existing methodologies for performance optimization, on the other hand, often lack accuracy or the ability to express resource constraints. 
In this paper, an ILP-based methodology is presented that allows to optimize the deployment of a distributed system, starting from the UML system model. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated using two different case studies, and the approach is validated by comparing the calculated optimal deployment to the results of modeling the system performance using layered queuing networks.
