We have implemented a learning method for testing the Java programs developed by students of a sophomore class. They can write programs; however, they cannot test them well to check if they meet the specified requirements. Our learning method provides a navigation process for testing their programs under the condition that all the method specifications and their signatures are given by the instructor. This navigation process comprises three steps. The first step is to learn to decide the order of unit testing for all the methods of the program. The second step is to learn to define test cases for each method. The third step is to learn to develop a unit testing program and execute it. In this paper, we propose a learning method for testing and the development of a support tool for learning the method to test Java programs.
