It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2014 ACM Workshop on Location and the Web -- LocWeb'14. This is the fourth workshop in its series which is hosted by CIKM after having been held previously at WWW, CHI, and IoT. 
 
The main objective of the workshop is to bring together a community of researchers at the intersection of location and the Web, serving as a unique venue to integrate different backgrounds and to stimulate the exchange of ideas and closer cooperation. LocWeb will provide a topicspecific venue where researchers from different fields, be it data mining, recommendation, search, systems, social media, applications, or standards, can discuss and develop the role of location. 
 
In the context of LocWeb 2014, the location topic is understood as a cross-cutting issue that not only concerns information retrieval, but databases, knowledge management, and systems as well. The workshop establishes an integrated venue where the location aspect can be discussed in depth within an interested community. LocWeb follows the main theme of Location-Aware Information Access, with subtopics related to Search, Analytics, Mobility, Apps, Services, and Systems. It is designed to reflect the multitude of fields that demand and utilize location features from an interdisciplinary perspective. 
 
We also encourage attendees to attend the highly relevant keynote presentation. It will give an interesting overview of different ways to think about human mobility and explore research into modeling approaches: Two Ways of Thinking About Where People Go, Vanessa Murdock (Microsoft).
