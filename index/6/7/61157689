Welcome to Japan and WWW2005. This is the 14th conference in the series that was started by Robert Cailliau in Geneva in 1994. It is also worth noting that the conference has now been held in each of the three major W3C host countries (USA, France, and Japan).This year's conference maintains the traditional 1:3:1 format including: a day of tutorial and workshop sessions, three days of keynotes, paper tracks and poster presentations as well as the special W3C track, and finishes with Developers' Day.Once again we are delighted to have Tim Berners-Lee deliver the opening keynote and to be followed by four internationally distinguished speakers in the other plenary session slots. This year Developers' Day also begins with a special keynote address.
