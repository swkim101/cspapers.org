As a novel sensor, fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) havebroad applicability by virtue of their excellent characteristics such as compactness, large multiplexing capacity, and corrosion resistance. However, the ability to acquire high-frequency signals is still limited in traditional demodulation technology. The speed of the demodulation systems for such sensors requires improvement. This paper proposes a novel method of high-speed FBG demodulation. By using the dispersion effect of a dispersion-compensating fiber (DCF) to transform the wavelength drift into the time domain, information on the wavelength drift of all FBGs can be obtained from a single light pulse. In addition, the influence of perturbations of the DCF length on the system can be eliminated with a reference grating. To enhance the demodulation precision, a dynamic dispersion value is used for demodulation instead of a fixed value. Thus, in the resulting system with an all-fiber structure and no wavelength scanning, the speed of demodulation is g...
