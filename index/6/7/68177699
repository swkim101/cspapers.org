Computational discovery, design and study of novel molecules and materials requires accurate electronic structure calculations, whose high computational cost is often a limiting factor. In high-throughput settings, machine learning can significantly reduce overall computational costs by rapidly and accurately interpolating between reference calculations. Effectively, the problem of solving a complex equation such as the electronic Schr√∂dinger equation for many related poly-atomic systems is mapped onto a nonlinear statistical regression problem. [1] I will introduce essential machine learning concepts, give a brief overview of machine learning for electronic structure calculations, and present our latest contribution, the many-body tensor representation [2] which enables predictions for both molecules and crystals, with state-of-the-art empirical performance on a variety of benchmark datasets.
