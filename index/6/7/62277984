Welcome to the Second International Workshop on Underwater Networks (WUWNet'07). Underwater Networking is an emerging area of research. It has a profound impact on many civilian and military applications including environmental monitoring, marine biology, earthquake detection, weather forecasting, etc. The challenges of underwater networks come from noisy environment for acoustic communications, long delays, energy efficiency and re-supply, and data collection. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practicing engineers to share their research results and to build a research community such that further and faster advancements in underwater network research can be fostered. Since fewer researchers are able to access real underwater equipment or testbeds, it is extremely important for us to create a collaborating community. 
 
The call for papers attracted 25 submissions from the United States, Norway, Ireland, Australia, South Korea, Singapore, Turkey, France, and Italy. The program committee accepted 10 full-length papers and 5 short papers (to be presented as posters). We are also delighted to include 2 invited speakers. The papers cover a variety of topics in underwater communications, networking, and applications. Specifically, they address acoustic modem technology, methods for localization, network topology, energy efficiency, media access control, routing protocols, and deployment considerations. We hope these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for users, engineers, and researchers interested in underwater networks.
