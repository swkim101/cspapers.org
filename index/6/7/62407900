Designing software systems is difficult. Designing systems that are capable of evolving is even more difficult. Often the system evolves in an unforeseen direction. Practice shows that software systems grow in small evolutionary steps. An evolution usually influences the behavior and the structure of the system. However, it is not desired that the evolution influences one or more modules of the system that are functionally or logically not related to the evolution; the behavior and structure of these modules should be preserved.
