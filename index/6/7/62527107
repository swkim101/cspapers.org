Multiple user interface is a medium where all objects being shared on it can be viewed indifferently from the geographical location and its users can interact with each other in real-time. Designing such an interface for users working collaboratively requires to deal with a number of issues. Herein, our concerns lies on the control component of human-computer interaction design and corresponding user interface software that implements it. We propose a protagonist-based approach approach for multiple user interface design which considers the mapping from a protagonist-oriented notation into extended statecharts.
