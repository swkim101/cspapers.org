Several garbage collection algorithms exist, but it is not always straightforward to adapt them to a given platform. In this article, we describe our work to fit a distributed garbage collection algorithm to a persistant distributed store called PerDiS. We pinpoint ordering and consistency problems, and present the way we solved them. We also address the dilemma of performance versus modularity
