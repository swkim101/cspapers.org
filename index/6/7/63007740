Personal informatics (PI) systems, which aggregate and analyse personal data from activity tracking devices and lifelogging services, have been shown to provide benefits in health and wellbeing settings. In this workshop paper we report a preliminary analysis of interviews with users of a personal informatics system and discuss the challenges that these users encounter in making sense of their data. We identify four challenges that may have implications for the use of PI systems in a health context, which we propose to discuss at the WISH workshop with other researchers who have considered self-monitoring from health and sensemaking perspectives.
