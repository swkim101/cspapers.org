Determining node positions is essential for many next-generation network functionalities. Previous localization algorithms lack correctness guarantees or require network density higher than required for unique localizability. In this paper, we describe a class of algorithms for fine-grained localization called Sweeps. Sweeps correctly finitely localizes all nodes in bilateration networks. Sweeps also handles angle measurements and noisy measurements. We demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm through extensive simulations on a large number of networks, upon which it consistently localizes one-thousand-node networks of average degree less than five in less than two minutes on a consumer PC.
