It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Thirteenth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS XIII). This year's symposium continues its tradition of being the premier forum for the presentation of research results on leading-edge issues that cross the boundaries of computer architecture, programming languages and compilers, and operating systems. This year's conference is also the first since ASPLOS's transition to an annual event. 
 
The call for papers attracted 188 abstracts from all over the world, which resulted in 127 full (10 pp.) papers being submitted to the program committee. Papers were submitted for blind review, without the authors' names or identifying information. Each paper was read by 3 program committee members and one external reviewer, who was suggested by a fourth PC member and confirmed by the PC chair. Eleven papers received 5 reviews and regrettably, 4 papers received only 3 reviews. Twelve papers had a PC member as a co-author. The conference used the excellent HotCRP conference management software written by Eddie Kohler at UCLA. 
 
After the reviews were submitted, authors were given two days to consider and respond to questions raised by reviewers. These comments were read by the PC and frequently came up in discussion at the PC meeting. The PC met for one day at Microsoft Research for an efficient and professional discussion of the submitted papers. We started with the 59 papers (7 PC papers) that had a rating of 3.0 or higher. PC members were invited to bring up other papers for discussion and 8 additional papers were added in this way. The PC papers were discussed after the rest of the papers had been resolved, and these papers were held to a higher standard than the others. The PC selected 31 papers (including 3 PC papers), for an acceptance rate of 24.4% (25% for PC papers).
