Software development processes need to have an integrated environment that fulfills specific developer needs. In this context, this paper describes the modeling approach SAGM ((Similarity for Adaptive Guidance Model) that provides adaptive recursive guidance for software processes, and specifically tailored regarding the profile of developers. A profile is defined from a model of developers, through their roles, their qualifications, and through the relationships between the context of the current activity and the model of the activities. This approach presents a similarity measure that evaluates the similarities between the profiles created from the model of developers and those of the development team involved in the execution of a software process. This is to identify the profiles classification and to deduce the appropriate type of assistance (that can be corrective, constructive or specific) to developers.
