The multi-model rehabilitation training system was manufactured according to the demands of patients’ practical training. Through the use of the patient’s exercise physiology information, the ability of muscle force and movement efficiency of the patient were identified. Following with medical rehabilitation therapy, the training model, a combination of active and passive training, was proposed to enhance the training efficiency and rehabilitation effect. Furthermore, taking the sitting movement training as an example, the research theory was applied in knee rehabilitation training. The results of the research provid technical support and practical reference to the relevant training equipment designs and clinical applications.
