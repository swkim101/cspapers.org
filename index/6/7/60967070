A description is given of the performance evaluation of an adaptive water supply control system using a personal computer PC. In order to have the plant dynamics identified in the shortest possible time, the adaptive infinite impulse response filter is formulated to represent the system dynamics. A real time recursive least squares algorithm incorporated with U-D factorization is adopted for the purpose of parameter identification. This algorithm possess significant properties in numerical stability and fast execution in arithmetic computation on the PC even without the co-processor. These are considered to be the advantages for the real time control system. The results obtained from the self-tuning control scheme with considerations for software implementation are presented. >
