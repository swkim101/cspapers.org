The past few years have seen improvements in the frame rate, accuracy, cost, and size of 3D sensors, including systems based on stereo vision, time-of-flight, structured light, and depth-from-X methods. These exciting developments have sparked increasing interest in industry and academia in the challenges and opportunities afforded by real-time 3D sensing. Applications such as tracking, recognition, and scene understanding may become more robust and more feasible thanks to these sensors.
