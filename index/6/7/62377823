In a real-time distributed application, the crucial problem is the coordination between the cooperating application processes. The available resources sometimes do not suffice for installation of an underlying distributed operating system, and the inter-process coordination must be embedded directly into the application processes. An enhancement of the protocol derivation algorithm of M. Kapus-Kolar (1991) is proposed, to cover the most typical timing requirements of service specifications, in particular the relative real-time scheduling of service interactions. The proposed solution is sound if the distributed system is not too time-critical. In the opposite case, the temporal inter-dependence of all actions in the system might be so strong that they can not be satisfactorily scheduled without some additional communication between the participating protocol entities. >
