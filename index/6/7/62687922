Because of the tremendous difficulty of producing reliable software (application and system software) and the serious consequences of software errors, a new solution is being explored: the development of a new computer architecture that will substantially enhance the reliability of the programs executing above it. This paper concentrates on the storage concepts (e.g., data representations and addressing) in the architecture.
