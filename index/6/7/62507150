It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 1st International Workshop on Model Inference In Testing (MIIT 2010), co-located with ISSTA 2010. 
 
There are many existing research works aiming at developing software of high quality, including automated formal reasoning and testing. Normally, these techniques rely on the availability of models of software. But in practice, models are often missing. In software development procedure, it is very costly to maintain the model and the code simultaneously while the software is evolving. For software developed by a third party or off-the-shelf, normally models are not provided. So, there is a clear gap between the research and current practice. Model inference techniques can be used to obtain models or reverse engineer structures of software-based systems. Typically, this has been proposed to infer model of black box components, to analyze interactions between known and unknown components in a grey box system, or to combine with source-code analysis to infer dynamic flows. Since testing gathers information on a real system, this information can be used to derive or refine models, or check their accuracy. The objective of the MIIT 2010 workshop is to share ideas, methods, techniques, and tools that help software practitioners to infer models and use the inferred models. The MIIT 2010 workshop will try to bring together people from both academia and industry, from all the different areas that want to develop new techniques to infer model, to report their experience on using tools or methods of model inferences. 
 
For each submission to the MIIT 2010 workshop, three program committee members were assigned to provide review. Finally, the program committee accepted three papers with a clear majority of positive reviews. We hope that the proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners on model inference in testing.
