This poster provides a description of an NSF-sponsored project entitled "ECS4Alabama" that addresses one of the nation's areas of highest priority in K-12 education: To offer all children opportunities for preparation in authentic Computer Science, with a specific focus on students from rural high-minority schools. ECS4Alabama addresses this need locally in Alabama by preparing teachers to offer a stand-alone, College preparatory Computer Science course - Exploring Computer Science (ECS) - in the participating high schools. Over the last two years, 52 in-service teachers have received training on ECS who in turn are teaching the course to nearly 1,500 students. Approximately 80% of the enrollment is minority and 48% of the students are young women. In many communities, ECS4Alabama is bringing access to challenging Computer Science curricula in school districts that often lack preparatory experiences that are typically only available to students in more affluent districts. Teachers Leaders are emerging and are spearheading Professional Development Communities to assist their peers with ECS implementation. In addition to sharing ECS4Alabama's implementation successes and challenges, the poster will also describe the project's rigorous evaluative and Social Science research components. Initial findings reveal that ECS professional development opportunities enhance teachers' self-efficacy and confidence in teaching CS through a problem-based, engaging curriculum that teachers view as relatable and relevant to students' daily lives. Students report that teachers make great efforts to facilitate their involvement in cognitively demanding work to solve real problems, encourage autonomy and stimulate student interest in CS.
