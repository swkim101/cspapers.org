A total of 17 tutorial proposals were submitted to the ACL 2012 Tutorials track from which six were finally accepted. I am grateful to the ACL community for the diverse, and high-quality proposals I received. This guarantees a strong tutorials track at ACL 2012, but at the same time made the selection process very difficult. All 17 proposals were reviewed by the chair with assistance by colleagues and experts from the NLP community where necessary. The final selection was approved by the ACL 2012 General Chair.
