Online Shopping has become a part of our daily routine, but it still cannot offer intuitive experience as store shopping. Nowadays, most e-commerce Websites offer a Question Answering (QA) system that allows users to consult other users who have purchased the product. However, users still need to wait patiently for othersâ€™ replies. In this paper, we investigate how to provide a quick response to the asker by plausible answer identification from product reviews. By analyzing the similarity and discrepancy between explicit answers and reviews that can be answers, a novel multi-task deep learning method with carefully designed attention mechanisms is developed. The method can well exploit large amounts of user generated QA data and a few manually labeled review data to address the problem. Experiments on data collected from Amazon demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority over competitive baselines.
