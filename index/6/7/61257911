We are pleased to present this year's technical program. Both papers and keynotes represent a broad spectrum of exciting ideas relevant to the computer architecture community in the near and the long term. 
 
This year we had 209 submissions. Program Committee (PC) members were not allowed to coauthor more than two submissions each. The reviewing process involved 34 PC members and 244 external reviewers. We assigned all PC and external reviews for those papers for which we did not have a conflict. In cases where one of us had a conflict, the other one assigned the reviews; and in the few cases where we both had a conflict, a third PC member assigned the reviews and led the discussion at the PC meeting. We made sure each paper had adequate expert coverage in both the PC and externally, and that each paper had high-quality reviews returned. In the end, 998 reviews were filed--an average of 4.8 reviews per submission. All reviews were made available for comment by the authors during the response period. To make the final decision for each paper, the PC carefully considered the reviews and author responses. 
 
The PC meeting was held on July 25 at Newark Airport. All 34 PC members were in attendance, many traveling great distances to be there. At the meeting, every paper was eligible for discussion. Conflicts were handled using the hot-seat model in all cases and prior to revealing the paper about to be discussed. Papers with PC members as co-authors were not handled as a separate category. Overall, the PC meeting was very collegial and constructive, and we strived to reach consensus on each paper. In the end, 52 papers were selected, 4 of which co-authored by PC members, constituting a 24.9% acceptance rate.
