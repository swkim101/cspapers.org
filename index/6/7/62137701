The vibration unit was enhanced using an extra hardware installation and the window-based software design control panel. The whole vibration unit contains 3 main parts: the frequency convertor, the driving motor and the vibrating platform. The frequency convertor receives signal from computer and give a specific current to the motor. The motor’s shaft is connected to the vibrating platform by gears as the medium of transmitting power. With the rotation of the cam, the vibrating platform can accelerate/ decelerate in sine wave form up to the stated frequency. The vibration unit can operate at nine frequencies from 1.6 Hz to 10 Hz [1]. The vibrator can generate a sine wave form peak-to-peak stroke of 10 mm. The vibration unit is designed to support up to 130 kg load, the vibrator’s platform is connected to a 4 kW, 960 rpm motor with the gear ratio of 1/1.54. The motor chosen was a 4 kW with 960 rpm. A pair of gears with 1/1.54 gear ratio was connected to the motor shaft to reduce the angular speed and increase the resulting torque and power.
