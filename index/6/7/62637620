With the development of multimedia network, more and more real-time multimedia applications require a network capable of satisfying QoS constraints such as delay and delay-variation bound so that the messages reach each destination node at almost the same time within a certain specified time limit, and certain application also demand that different streams for each different destination node should reach with minimum cost under the constraints. Therefore, the delay and delay-variation constraint multicast routing problem is studied and a new strategy in core selection methods is proposed. The algorithm we propose guarantees that the delay from the source to any destination does not exceed a real-time constraint satisfying the delay-variation constraint under cost minimization. In addition, this core selection methods achieve a balance of optimizing cost and delay of the multicast tree. Simulation results show that the algorithm has low complexity and balances between the computational complexity and performance, it can also meet the requirements of real-time network communication.
