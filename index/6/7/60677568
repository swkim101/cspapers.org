The need for reliable software has rapidly overtaken the ability to produce it. In control applications, particularly disastrous results may arise from errors. For many years computer scientists have been developing languages and techniques to clarify the structure of programs through establishing a sound mathematical foundation. The techniques included under the general umbrella of formal methods have been introduced especially to put the design phase of program onto an analytical basis. The authors examine their application in control systems, and especially their applicability in verifying and validating control software. The context of the article is a programme of research in developing validation techniques in control using formal methodologies. The author examines: application areas and benefits for industrial control; establishment of control software integrity; and examples of formal methods in control systems.
