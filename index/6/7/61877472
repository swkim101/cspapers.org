Traditionally, software engineering research tools have been developed from scratch without much reuse. Software components offer now a different way of tool-building, which replaces hand-crafted code with pre-packaged functionality. Tools based on components have unique characteristics for developers as well as tool users. This paper describes three common approaches to tool-building with components and evaluates the approaches from a toolbuilderâ€™s perspective.
