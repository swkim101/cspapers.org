In the local area environment, the near future user-needs show an increasing demand for voice, data and image services. In a multiservice local area network (MLAN), the growing penetration of wideband services and the considerable amount of real-time voice and interactive data require simultaneously handling of stream and bursty type communications. Besides high-speed and service integration features, such a system has to provide powerful interconnection with both public networks and other, well diffused in the market, LANs. Therefore, the implementation of gateways becomes an important part of the network design. The paper addresses the gateway design and implementation for the local integrated optical network (LION) and Ethernet.
