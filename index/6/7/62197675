The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) recently released a report that questioned monoculture's effect on cybersecurity. The report's central idea is that if everyone is running the same hardware and software (a monoculture), a single attack could compromise every machine on the Internet. We obviously need to avoid such a situation, but implying that monoculture is the main cause and destroying monoculture the cure is naive.
