Parallel mechanisms are characterized by several kinematic chains connecting the base to the end-effector. Because of this characterization, parallel mechanisms have significant advantages over serial mechanisms in several aspects such as dynamic properties, load-carrying capacity, high accuracy as well as stiffness. So far, parallel mechanisms have many applications: robotic parallel manipulators, flight simulators, parallel kinematics machines, etc. However, the closed-loop nature of parallel mechanisms limits the motion of the platform and creates complex kinematic singularities inside the workspace. Therefore, how to maximize the singularity-free workspace of parallel mechanisms becomes a very important topic in the design context of parallel robots.
