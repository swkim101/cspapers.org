Text Information Retrieval (TIR) is considered the heart of many applications such as Document Management System (DMS). TIR that used for DMS requires different techniques of data structure than that used in the search engine. Search engine, requires special hardware (super computers with high memory) to perform information retrieval algorithms. In this paper, a new approach is developed to make it easy for DMS to perform the retrieval process with high performance. Conventional approaches are based on single inverted file but our approach is based on object and multi-tier inverted index files structure.
