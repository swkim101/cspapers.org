This poster presents our experiences in offering 10 years of CS/SE capstone projects in the distributed systems area. Based on a presentation of typical example projects over time we draw interesting conclusions. Our observations over this time span address suitable project subjects, development methodology as well as student motivation in projects and how to raise it. We will show that certain aspects have not changed much over time such as: system integration and its effort is always larger than expected. Similarly, using even a well-established enterprise open source technology usually requires more work than estimated upfront. Also, better students tend to prefer more challenging projects. Other aspects have improved making use of recent findings in research and technological development such as using agile development methodology or novel communication means. Also, we demonstrate that good students projects can contribute to research publications and that an international setting for capstone projects is both raising motivation for students as well as increasing organizational challenges. Overall we found that company sponsored projects generally increase result quality as the "real world touch" seems to be appealing.
