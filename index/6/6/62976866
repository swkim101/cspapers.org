Current research efforts that intersect with game designer and developers following a point-solution approach: one specific game is developed to address one specific research need. Although researchers have proposed frameworks to generalize characteristics of serious games and in that way support the development of those, there is no platform that aligns game developers interests with those of researchers. In this paper, we detail a system architecture for a platform that enables game developers to expose aspects of their games to researchers. Moreover, the platform would facilitate researchers to insert their instruments for attitudinal or behavioral user research.
