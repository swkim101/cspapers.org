At universities around the world, class sizes in Computer Science and other STEM courses are rapidly growing, as these skills become increasingly sought after in the marketplace, promising lucrative careers to graduates. Staffing-up to support the influx of students in this field presents challenges of its own. Hiring and training TAs to allow for quality and personal interactions with students, even as the class sizes grow, is expensive and difficult to maintain. Existing tools provide some automation by focusing mainly on output correctness but often overlook the student's approach to solving a problem. A solution is required in order to provide high-quality personalized feedback to very large numbers of student submissions for open-ended assignments, and in the timeframe that will keep today's instant-feedback-seeking students moving forward and not discouraged. The Sense platform utilizes algorithms from bioinformatics and genomics to identify patterns in student submissions and quickly surface insights about how students solved a problem. This enables the educator to provide rapid, equitable, in-depth feedback to each and every student, regardless of class size, and to use insights gained from this process to optimize their teaching methods and choice of assignments. In our presentation, we will show how our system identifies patterns in student submissions and uses those to generate clusters of students who have approached the problem in a similar way. We will use this time to facilitate a discussion about the specific insights that can be gleaned from the results for the students and for the educator.
