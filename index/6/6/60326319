The data backup implicates the choice of formats that assure accessibility and integrity of information. Facing to these numerous data saving formats, XML is one of the simplest and most promising approaches to guarantee the perpetuity and the integrity of data. In this article, we propose a model of data backup in XML format. This model is developed with Java. Our approach consists in defining an application able to convert information of a database in XML format and restore them later. This model will allow the managing of the recurring problems of disparities between different platforms and versions met during the data saving.
