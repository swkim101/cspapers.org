This experience report describes a faculty member's effort to create educational videos that support students' learning in a programming intensive CS1 class, along with an evaluation of their use by students. The videos that were created were supplementary in nature, providing students with an optional opportunity to go back and re-watch live coding demonstrations performed in class. The production process used to create the videos is described, along with several lessons learned during this undertaking. Student usage data is reported, along with survey results collected from 164 students. Survey results show that a strong majority of students who watched the videos believed that the videos helped them learn the material in the course. Several risks that should be considered before creating custom programming video content for a course are also discussed.
