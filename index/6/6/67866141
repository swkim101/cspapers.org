Many computer science students are eager to learn about how to contribute to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects, but like most computer science departments, ours has no courses to help them achieve that goal. Creating such courses requires buy-in by deans, department chairs, and other faculty, who, because of lack of knowledge, can have little interest in supporting such efforts. Our poster shows how we solved this problem and created a means for students to simultaneously learn how to be contributors to FOSS projects and earn credit toward their major. It shows how we sought and found interested students and engaged them through repeated, informal meetings, which we used to gain the support of the chair and dean, and how we simulated a prototype course by having the students sign up for independent study credit. The group then met at regular intervals, communicated and shared work using discussion forums, source code repositories, and IRC chat. All course content is based on open source materials, including free textbooks, an abundance of on-line tutorials and reference materials, lecture notes and assignments that we wrote, with open source licenses, and other materials borrowed from http://foss2serve.org. The success of this simulated course led to the creation of a pilot course for the Spring 2019 semester, endorsed by the college. The poster presents several assignments, discusses preliminary findings, and provides links to materials that we created for this course. It also shows how we encouraged students to work on humanitarian FOSS (HFOSS) projects.
