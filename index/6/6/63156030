The optimising code generators employed as part of the model-based development of embedded control software must undergo intensive quality assurance. The use of test suites plays a central role in this process. This article describes the construction of a modular test suite for code generators and proposes a testing approach which makes a systematic test of the optimisations employed by the code generator possible.
