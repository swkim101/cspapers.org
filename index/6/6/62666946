With the development of our country electric power enterprise, closed-loop pour load operation has become increasingly frequent in power distribution network, the resulting circulation problems affect the safe operation of power grid. The calculation method of system is used by BX type solution fast decomposition method and it is very suitable for distribution integration, by the method we can calculate the steady state current and transient current of closed-loop. It also provide accurate current analysis and control. With analysis of examples, finally indicates that the method can offer good for dispatch staff for closed-loop operation decision support, and it has a certain guiding significance.
