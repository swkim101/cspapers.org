The production of isotopes for diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients involves handling and processing of irradiated materials. This process is performed inside heavily shielded workstations termed Hot Cells. A modular robotic design for handling irradiated materials inside hot cells is introduced. The new robotic system is reconfigurable in order to enhance versatility of applications and precision of its tasks. The reliability of the introduced robot control system is assessed using Failure Trees (FT) Methodology. The technology developed in the present work allows for improving productivity and cost effectiveness for production of medical isotopes.
