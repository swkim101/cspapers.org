The Touring Machine project is a research experiment that explores the role of public communications networks in facilitating future multimedia applications. The research focuses on the design and realization of a robust software control infrastructure that enables a broad class of communications applications. The author provides an overview of the Touring Machine project and discusses the second iteration of system design, which currently provides multimedia, desktop communications applications for several dozen researchers at two Bellcore locations. >
