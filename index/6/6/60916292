It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Third International Workshop on Applications and Advances of Problem Frames - IWAAPF'08. 
 
Problem Frames are, this year, fourteen years old. It all started with an idea in the Jackson's 1994 paper "Software Development Method" that appeared in "A Classical Mind: Essays in Honour of C A R Hoare." There were, at that time, no diagrams but the idea was sweet. (Diagrams came later in "Problem Complexity" published in the proceedings of Third IEEE International Conference on Engineering of Complex Systems (ICECCS'97) in 1997.) 
 
As a measure of the popularity, google-scholaring "Problem Frames" returns 741 hits. Right at the top is Jackson's 2001 eponymous book "Problem frames: analyzing and structuring software development problems". 
 
This year, we add another 14 excellent papers to that count, one for each year, with our workshop. Those papers come from authors located in six countries. Some describe work completed, some work in progress and some work yet to be done. There are variants of Problem Frames, ontologies for Problem Frames, and the continuing work on taking Problem Frames closer to the solution space and more traditional software engineering techniques. Moreover, the workshop boasts a keynote presentation from Professor John Knight, Virginia, that places Problem Frames squarely as a useful engineering technique in the real-world.
