It is our pleasure to welcome you to the first International Workshop on End-to-end Test Script Engineering (ETSE), co-located with the 2011 International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis. 
 
In recent years, we have witnessed the growing importance of software test automation. In particular, the creation of automated test scripts has seen an increasing emphasis and interest in industry. Automated test scripts provide many benefits, such as repeatable, predictable, and efficient test executions. However, creating scripts from manual test cases can be tedious and can require significant up-front investment. Moreover, after the initial development, like any software system, the test scripts require maintenance. Thus, test scripts have a lifecycle---involving different development, maintenance, and validation activities---and must co-evolve with the application. To perform such activities efficiently (especially when the test suite of an application grows over time to consist of hundreds of scripts), the development of appropriate tools, techniques, and methods that encompass the entire test-script lifecycle is essential. 
 
The goal of this first workshop is to emphasize the end-to-end aspect of test-script engineering, and provide a forum for academics and practitioners to discuss the challenges, accomplishments, opportunities, and promising research directions related to the development and maintenance of automated test scripts. 
 
ETSE 2011 received nine submissions. Each submission was reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. The Program Committee discussed the papers online and accepted six papers. These include five regular papers and one position paper, which cover topics such as test modeling and instantiation, test-script design, and test-script repair.
