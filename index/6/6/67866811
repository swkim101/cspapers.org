Studies in other disciplines demonstrate that writing summaries of videos or readings is an effective strategy for increasing student understanding. We explore a related strategy in computer science where we ask students to write explanations of program behaviour. Our experiments are conducted through an online application used by students to prepare for class by watching videos and solving follow-up exercises. With students randomly assigned to treatment groups, we evaluate the effect of different kinds of video follow-up questions by analyzing pre- and post-performance on subsequent select-all-that-apply multiple-choice questions. In experiment one, we found no difference in post-performance between students who wrote explanations and those who were not asked to do so. When the same prompt for explanations was accompanied by a motivational sentence, the quality of the student answers increased, but post-performance was unchanged. In a second experiment, students received either no experimental questions, questions requiring a written explanation or short-answer questions with a single correct response. Again, we found no difference in post-performance across the different treatments. This non-significant result might be explained by the post-performance question difficulty -- the question might not be hard enough to reveal differences in understanding. The question timing might also be a factor, since students complete all the questions soon after watching the video and there may not be enough time for students to need the extra retention benefit gained by doing the experimental questions.
