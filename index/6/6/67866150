The efforts of a Generation Z student to improve K-12 cyber competency through curriculum design and educator professional development, is having a positive impact in Virginia. School Systems in Virginia and across the nation tend to focus on cyber bullying as the primary issue. The issue that is not addressed is what cyber mechanisms allow cyber bullying to occur. This is often due to administrators and educators themselves not understanding what cyber competencies are needed to protect oneself in today's technological world. Studies show that social engineering, hacking and defending, cyber awareness, and personal connections have more impact on Generation Z and Generation Alpha students. My efforts started out to help my peers and have spiraled into a crusade to improve cyber competency of K-12 students and educators. One school system has created a Digital Citizenship Committee to support the concept of cyber competency beyond just teaching cybersecurity courses to a select few. This is a pay forward approach as the student leading the charge was impacted by two other students who were bullied through cyber stalking and classroom discussion boards. This effort is being aided by national organizations such as Safe Surfin' Foundation, National Center for Women & IT (NCWIT), and National CyberWatch Center. My presentation will show attendees how to expand this movement into their community to help slow down some of the cyber challenges facing Generation Z and beyond.
