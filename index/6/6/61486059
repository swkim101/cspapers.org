The head-corner chart parsing algorithm by Sikkel and Op den Akker in [SA92] defines a new way to grammatically analyse sentences of a context-free language. In this algorithm sen足tences are parsed in another order than as usual from left to right. In informal terms, head-driven parsing is a strategy for syntactic analysis in which we start by looking for the main word. There is a linguistic motivation for the notion head, but in this paper the subject is looked at only from a computing science perspective. The head-corner parsing algorithm has been extended to unification grammars and an imple足rnention of the extended algorithm has been writ足ten. In this paper will be presented: the original algorithm: the extension1 some aspects of the im足plementation and results of comparisons of the head-corner parser with some other parsers.
