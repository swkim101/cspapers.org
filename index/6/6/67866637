Research has shown that self-efficacy, a student's confidence in his or her ability, contributes to student success. Here, we examine if teaching students to recognize common programming errors increases student self-efficacy in an introductory programming course. We provided students with exercises containing examples of typical novice programming errors and methods for fixing them. At the beginning of the course we assess self-efficacy and administer a test to measure programming competence. We repeat these measurements at the end of the course. To assess self-efficacy, students rate their confidence in completing various programming tasks on a scale of 0 to 100. The test has fourteen questions; thirteen are short answer and one is multiple choice. Short answer questions require the student to write at most a few lines of C++ code, with most requiring only a single line. We analyze student self-efficacy in relation to our pre- and post-test, student course grade, assignment grade, and final exam grade. Our analysis shows improvements between the experimental term compared to the control terms across eleven measures of self-efficacy, but only three of these improvements are significant (p < 0.05).
