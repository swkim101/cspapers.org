The foundation of the compiler-based culture is the assumption that our product is essentially a single text in a single language, to be processed by a single tool of great complexity the compiler. Even when we break development into several gross stages such as requirements definition, specification, design, and programming, we retain the assumption that we are producing a single text in a single language: the use of libraries of texts is aimed only at convenience of handling very large texts, and does not reflect any fundamental change in the assumpt%on.
