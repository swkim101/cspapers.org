How do we integrate requisite thinking skills into children's earliest informal and formal learning experiences in order to prepare the next generation of problem solvers? This project examines how Computational Thinking (CT) skills align to the abilities and interests of young children and can be integrated with other STEM learning activities in order to promote school readiness. The goals of the project are to (1) build a knowledge base on how CT can be promoted in early childhood through integration with mathematics and science, (2) develop learning blueprints to guide the development of integrated classroom and family resources, and (3) develop and evaluate prototype activities to identify design principles useful to future development efforts integrating CT and STEM in early childhood. In this work, a multidisciplinary research team with expertise in CT, early science and mathematics, technology and media, and home and school learning partners with preschool educators and parents to co-design and pilot test prototype activities. Emerging prototypes presented integrate fundamental science and mathematics concepts and practices with CT skills such as problem decomposition, logical and algorithmic thinking, abstraction and debugging. They include hands-on activities with manipulatives familiar to young children and developmentally appropriate technology with unique affordances for complementing and reinforcing the learning that occurs during hands-on experiences. With a goal of addressing CS For All, the co-design, development and pilot testing of prototype activities aim to take into account the needs and strengths of preschool programs and families from low-income and culturally diverse communities.
