The level set approach has been used as a powerful tool in designing structures with a proper safety margin against stability and buckling issues. In this article a closed form equation for critical buckling load of any arbitrary topology has been proposed and employed in Level Set formulation in order to maximize it. Results show that the Level Set Method is straight forward and easy to implement, with fewer limitations overall in the topology optimization of engineering structures.Copyright Â© 2010 by ASME
