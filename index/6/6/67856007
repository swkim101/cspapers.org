In this paper we present a study of a specific class of vibration-driven robots: the brushbots. In a bottom-up fashion, we start by deriving dynamic models of the brushes and we discuss the conditions under which these models can be employed to describe the motion of brushbots. Then, we present two designs of brushbots: a fully-actuated platform and a differential-drive-like one. The former is employed to experimentally validate both the developed theoretical models and the devised motion control algorithms. Finally, a coordinated-control algorithm is implemented on a swarm of differential-drive-like brushbots in order to demonstrate the design simplicity and robustness that can be achieved by employing a vibration-based locomotion strategy.
