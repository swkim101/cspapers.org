Recent popularity of computer science courses has caused class enrollments to skyrocket to mega level of several hundred students. Due to space and other constraints, multiple sections of each class are often taught by the same instructor. Students attending different section are taking the same exam, which requires the instructor to keep teaching repeating lectures consistently. This can be difficult and is further complicated by the varying number of students and questions posed during different sections. The lightning talk explores one faculty's solution to lecture consistency issue by making use of technology in the classroom: review and discussion of lecture recordings with students in attendance. All lectures were recorded during the first session. During the subsequent session, those recordings were played back to students in attendance on the large projector screen. This practice offered the opportunity to the instructor to further clarify concepts taught in class and receive continuous feedback how to improve her teaching in addition to delivering consistent lectures. More importantly, it offered students an opportunity to hear the questions asked by the students in attendance of the recorded session, before asking their own or offering additional discussion points. Class participation increased significantly as a result of this practice.
