During the 2018 RESPECT Conference, a group of us facilitated a conversation about inclusion in computing. The discussion focused on critical issues of equity and inclusion and how to engage people from all groups in learning key concepts in computing. For this SIGCSE panel, we propose to continue the conversation through a broader conversation around the terms "broadening participation" and the roles of relationships, identity (cultural and personal), and academic, political, and professional perspectives when supporting equity and inclusion in computing education. This panel seeks to disrupt the conversation about computer science education, and participants to this session will leave having had a safe space in which to discuss issues of identify, race, and privilege that are critical to spaces like SIGCSE.
