Atomic requirements are one way of specifying software requirements. In this paper, we describe how atomic requirements can be of particular interest in the context of software architectures. We describe the way how to specify atomic requirements and their impact on the requirements engineering process, with an emphasis on architectural issues. In this work, we combine the theoretical concept of atomic requirements with ideas from Volere, a requirements engineering process used by various industrial consultants.
