Welcome to the Thirty-Eighth Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, held January 26--January 28, 2011, in Austin, Texas. This volume contains 49 papers selected from 209 submissions. 
 
The POPL'11 PC made an attempt to increase the number of accepted papers while maintaining very high quality and to increase the thoroughness of the reviews. Twenty-five PC members spent 10 weeks reviewing the papers; the reviews were forwarded to the authors who were allowed to respond. Then the PC members discussed the papers electronically during a period of two weeks. Finally all PC members flew to Maryland for two days to discuss the papers. This required a lot of effort from the PC members and additional external reviewers. Indeed, 379 reviewers produced 140,000 lines of reviews. In certain cases, the reviews reveal significant technical errors and other major problems in the submitted papers. I am totally amazed by the devotion of each of the PC members and the external reviewers. 
 
Program Committee members were allowed to submit papers, but such papers were accepted only if there was a consensus among the PC members and the external reviewers that the paper is strong enough to be included in POPL. Six out of sixteen submissions co-authored by PC members were accepted.
