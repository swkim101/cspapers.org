The ACM Data Science Task Force was established by the ACM Education Council and tasked with articulating the role of computing discipline-specific contributions to this emerging field. This special session seeks to introduce the work of the ACM Data Science Task Force as well as to engage the SIGCSE community in this effort. Members of the task force will introduce key components of a draft report, including a summary of data science curricular efforts to date, results of ACM academic and industry surveys on data science, as well as the initial articulation of computing competencies for undergraduate programs in data science. This session should be of interest to all SIGCSE attendees, but especially faculty developing college-level curricula in Data Science.
