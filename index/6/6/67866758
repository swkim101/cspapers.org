The purpose of this paper is to investigate student perspectives of how college computer science (CS) programs compare to those of coding bootcamps. In particular, the research examines to what degree students report their respective programs instill the necessary interpersonal and intrapersonal skills (i.e., teamwork and resilience) necessary for workforce entry. Prior research from the authors suggests there is a perception among the software industry that college graduates often lack the necessary so-called "soft" skills for successful workforce entry; this research investigates to what degree students from each educational environment mirror this sensibility in the assessment of their own abilities, learning preferences, and educational experiences. Data is based on a series of fifty (50) one-on-one interviews with students, 22 of whom come from a coding bootcamp background and 28 who come from a four-year college. Alongside these interviews, students completed both pre-surveys (50 students) and post-surveys (19 students) on learning preferences and programmatic experience; 12 students also participated in follow-up interviews further articulating their learning experiences. Results indicate that despite significant differences in age and workforce experience, coding bootcamp students and undergraduates differ little in how they perceive themselves as learners; there were notable differences in reasons for application to respective programs as well as exposure to practical learning experiences through coursework. Discussion focuses on the degree to which the aforementioned "soft skills" are perceived as learned expertise versus a personal attribute, and to what degree such perception may contribute to higher education's pedagogical and curricular approaches to CS instruction.
