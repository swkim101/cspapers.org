Summary form only given. The electronic age has provided enormous opportunities to advance our understanding of the world around us. It has allowed us to work remotely but collaboratively, generate and move terabytes of data at levels never anticipated even two decades ago, bring science to those who never could have imagined having the opportunity to contribute solutions, and it has allowed us to explore the details and intricate workings of nearly every part of our physical world. But our ability to process all this information is outpacing our infrastructure and is requiring us to develop new analytical methods and techniques that can fully exploit these datasets. The geoscience community is dealing with these same issues and society is now demanding detailed historical, current and future information about our Earth system. This talk will discuss these challenges and opportunities.
