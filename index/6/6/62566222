Visual image, as a kind of rich content and performance of multimedia information, has been tremendously popular for a long time. Using text-based Image Retrieval TBIR (Text-based Image Retrieval, TBIR) during retrieval will provide keywords and description of the image text matching, operation simple and quick. The defects of TBIR also, however, there are the following: (1) image library image all the need for manual annotation, time-consuming and laborious with subjective factors; (2) image semantics is rich, simple key words cannot fully express its meaning and accurate. Image Retrieval Based on regional RBIR (Region-based Image Retrieval, RBIR) first of all, by using image segmentation method, divides an image into several different regions. At last image matching is converted to match between the regions. We just need to user submits a retrieval image, greatly reducing the user's retrieval burden.
