Nowadays, researchers are looking for ways to adapt education to include technology and more engaging methods. For computer science courses, the use of problem-based learning, virtual tutors, learning style personalization and game programming are possible ways to achieve this goal. In this context, this work proposes and evaluates an approach to generate different kinds of virtual tutors (with various levels of interaction) for problem-based game programming classes. The system was evaluated in an experiment where two types of virtual tutors were proposed and generated considering two virtual game programming classes. Results showed that the use of virtual tutors promoted efficient learning and that the availability of different kinds of tutors can optimize individual engagement.
