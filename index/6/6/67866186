Educators are challenged to provide computer science students enough skills-based practice within the confines of a course. Yet it is also difficult to motivate students to spend additional time for further practice outside of course requirements. We are investigating games and gamification as methods for motivating students to engage in additional practice. In this paper, we report on the study of a fantasy-themed serious game to teach Ruby programming skills. We examine how well it motivated students to complete additional levels of the game than was assigned for course credit in an undergraduate Software Engineering course. Of the 185 student participants, 42.78% completed one or more optional game levels. These students spent more than twice as much time playing than their counterparts who only completed the mandatory game levels.
