Automatic grading systems such as Web-CAT are widely used when students learn programming, especially in CS1/CS2 courses in colleges and universities. Current feedback mechanism in these systems benefits students with performance-based information. They have negative effects to often frustrate students especially novice programmers to belief of fixed mindset - their programming abilities are native and limited. Students with fixed mindset can seriously influence female and minority enrollment and retention rate in CS major. It is important to move students to growth mindset instead - belief their programming skills can be improved by practice and hard work. Recently effort were made to improve feedback mechanism in automatic grading systems. One effort was the design and implementation of a group of indicators to reflect students' progress and effort, based on their programming submissions. Another effort was the design of virutalTA Maria to deliver positive comments to encourage and reinforce students. We demonstrate the design of boosters (rewards) component and positive encourage and reinforcement comments feedback by virtualTA, based on indicators information. We simulated boosters (rewards) and comments component with a historical programming dataset to validate boosters (rewards) strategy. Simulated results found only 32 percent students did not get any Booster (rewards). 68 percent students won four types of booster range from Tier 1 to Tier 4. This result is what we are as expected. We also designed positive encouraging and reinforcement comments feedback from VirtualTA in adaptive style, based on indicator information. We plan to apply these two designed components to classroom for evaluation.
