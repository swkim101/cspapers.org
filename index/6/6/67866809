We are designing a year-long program for internal Shopify employees who want to retrain as software developers. Our aim is to provide a better base in core computer science concepts than boot camps, but be less comprehensive than a degree. The design leverages the best of our Dev Degree work-integrated learning program that combines developer skills training and team placements at Shopify with a fully accredited computer science degree. Participants will spend six months on education full time, and six months in a team at Shopify with some continuing education an hour or two a week. By the end of the program, participants will have the opportunity to join a team as a back-end web developer. Our lightning talk will share key aspects of the program design and solicit feedback offline.
