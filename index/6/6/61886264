We present analog neuromorphic circuits for implementing bistable synapses with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) properties. In these types of synapses, the short-term dynamics of the synaptic efficacies are governed by the relative timing of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes, while on long time scales the efficacies tend asymptotically to either a potentiated state or to a depressed one. We fabricated a prototype VLSI chip containing a network of integrate and fire neurons interconnected via bistable STDP synapses. Test results from this chip demonstrate the synapse's STDP learning properties, and its long-term bistable characteristics.
