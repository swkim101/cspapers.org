This paper sets out a second order modal logic for reasoning about multilevel security in probabilistic systems. We present a possible world semantics and prove that the logic is sound with respect to it. The semantics is novel in treating probability measures themselves as possible worlds. We give a syntactic definition of security and show that the semantic interpretation of our syntactic definition is equivalent to an earlier independently motivated characterization, Probabilistic Noninterference ([141). We also look at a syntactic representation of Grays Applied Flow Model (a special case of McLean's Flow Model, given in [25]), and discuss the relation between these characterizations of security andbetween their usefulness in security analysis. We give a syntactic description of a round-robin server and sketch the formal proof of its security.
