This report documents the implementation of a self-paced, mastery learning inspired CS1 course. The course was designed to increase the completion rates observed in flipped and online CS1 formats already offered at our institution. We explore the experience of students in the course and evaluate performance outcomes using grade data from all three CS1 formats, student survey responses, and exit interviews. Our evaluation identifies three main challenges in our implementation. First, the course requires significant resources and administering it is significantly more time consuming for instructors than a regular course. Second, students hesitated to treat mastery quizzes as formative. Finally, the flexibility that the course provided, with little structure and few incentives to help students stay on track, led to considerable procrastination. These factors combined to lead students to delay coursework until the end of the semester -- and beyond. As a result, while our data shows an increase in completion relative to the online format, we saw no change in completion relative to the flipped CS1 offering and saw no change in student performance as evaluated by a final exam. However, students reported more deep engagement with and understanding of the material, which encourages us to further develop the course.
