We shall discuss ways of enriching courses on Computers and Society and Computer Ethics to better engage and stimulate students, including those from Computer Science as well as other disciplines. This topic is significant because society is experiencing increasing stress due to data breaches, privacy invasions, fake news, election hacking, corporate concentration with increased power by a few dominant high-tech firms; and recent advances in AI. Based upon participant interest, we shall discuss and share experiences dealing with issues such as: 1) prerequisites, 2) kinds of assignments and projects; 3) teaching materials including media; 4) the mix of individual and group assignments; 5) how to handle the increasing numbers of desirable topics; 6) how much of the course to focus on AI; 7) methods of teaching ethics; 8) level at which to teach the course, including use in secondary schools; 9) differences between CS courses and general education courses; 10) integration with other CS courses; 11) follow-on options for students wanting to learn more. BOF attendees will be able to hear multiple viewpoints and connect with other people in similar situations, so they can share resources and techniques for teaching such courses. The audience is expected to consist of professors and lecturers who teach, are planning to, or are considering teaching such courses.
