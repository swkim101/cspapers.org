Virtual try-on systems under arbitrary human poses have significant application potential, yet also raise extensive challenges, such as self-occlusions, heavy misalignment among different poses, and complex clothes textures. Existing virtual try-on methods can only transfer clothes given a fixed human pose, and still show unsatisfactory performances, often failing to preserve person identity or texture details, and with limited pose diversity. This paper makes the first attempt towards a multi-pose guided virtual try-on system, which enables clothes to transfer onto a person with diverse poses. Given an input person image, a desired clothes image, and a desired pose, the proposed Multi-pose Guided Virtual Try-On Network (MG-VTON) generates a new person image after fitting the desired clothes into the person and manipulating the pose. MG-VTON is constructed with three stages: 1) a conditional human parsing network is proposed that matches both the desired pose and the desired clothes shape; 2) a deep Warping Generative Adversarial Network (Warp-GAN) that warps the desired clothes appearance into the synthesized human parsing map and alleviates the misalignment problem between the input human pose and the desired one; 3) a refinement render network recovers the texture details of clothes and removes artifacts, based on multi-pose composition masks. Extensive experiments on commonly-used datasets and our newly-collected largest virtual try-on benchmark demonstrate that our MG-VTON significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, showing promising virtual try-on performances.
