This paper presents an approach to enhance Hooke-Jeeves optimization search algorithm using fuzzy logic. Hooke-Jeeves algorithm, similar to many other search algorithms, use predetermined fixed parameters. These parameters do not depend on the objective function values at the current search location. Fuzzy logic controllers are incorporated in at various stages of the algorithm to create a new optimization search algorithm: Fuzzy-Controlled Hooke-Jeeves algorithm. The results of this paper shows that incorporating fuzzy logic in Hooke-Jeeves algorithm can enhance the ability of the algorithm to reach extremum in different typical optimization test cases and design problems.Â© 2008 ASME
