Pair-programming is an Agile technique in Extreme Programming (XP) where traditionally two programmers need to be collocated and work together at one workstation. Previous research has shown that pair-programming is very beneficial in software engineering education. However, learning and practicing pair-programming are mostly limited in a class where students can only learn to collaboratively program with another student in controlled or laboratory settings. Although nowadays there exist some collaborative tools, such as CodePilot, Google Colaboratory and Git, they are not specifically pair-programming-oriented. This impedes a pairing's ability to discuss effective strategies in problem solving, to form productive or mutually learning pairs, and to predict pair compatibility. To encourage students in out-class practice of pair-programming, we present a demonstration of a novel web-based software development environment, called CodeBuddy, for remote pair-programming. CodeBuddy provides instructors and students with several features for managing laboratory classes and practicing pair-programming. Examples of CodeBuddy's features include: coding screen mirroring between a pair, output terminal to show compiled results, face-to-face like communication channels (i.e., video calling and instant text messaging), automatic and manual role switching, code quality analysis for monitoring coding students' progress and recommending a pair with targeted pairing goals, implicit code reviews using face detection for tracking a reviewer's engagement, line-by-line code commenting, etc. The demonstration consists of a walkthrough of two use-case scenarios: an instructor assigns a problem-solving task and two students remotely work together in a pair using CodeBuddy on two different workstations to solve it.
