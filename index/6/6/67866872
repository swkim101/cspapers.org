As we celebrate the 50th SIGCSE Symposium, this panel explores how computing education researchers chart a course individually and as a community to build our research practices and collective knowledge of computing education. This navigation involves developing our research goals, which tools we use to work towards those goals, and which academic communities outside of computing education we seek to learn from and contribute to. However, these processes of navigation are rarely discussed as a community. Paper and grant submissions and reviews provide an imperfect way for our community to communicate our varied values and priorities. This panel brings together experts in computing education research who differ in their research goals, tools, and external communities. We can expect a lively discussion amongst the panelist and we hope to spark important discussions within the computing education research community!
