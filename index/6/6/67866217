In computer science, educational innovation is constant, but many great ideas never achieve the type of widespread adoption necessary to make lasting and effective change to the way we teach and learn. Research across STEM education has shown that propagation planning is often an overlooked or undervalued part of educational innovation. Whether promoting our own projects or an outside innovation, barriers to success are more difficult to overcome when encountered without sufficient preparation. Plans for adoption and scaling of innovations are not one-size-fits-all, but there are lessons we can learn from both successful and unsuccessful previous projects. We will present a summary of these lessons based on our recent ITiCSE working group research experience on the topic. This writing workshop will focus on building propagation plans informed by best practices, within the context of individual project definitions of success. We will work in small groups to identify potential barriers to the success of our projects, learn about best practices for overcoming those barriers, and put in place a measurable and actionable plan for adoption and propagation. Participants will work toward a better plan for propagation while garnering advice from their peers, learning and generating new ideas about and methods for dissemination and adoption, and building a community of resources for future collaboration, champions for change, and peer feedback. Bringing a laptop is recommended.
