It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the first ACM Workshop on Cognitive Radio Architectures for Broadband (CRAB). This workshop focuses on architectures, applications, protocols, and implementations of cognitive radio to address the future of mobile broadband. CRAB'13 gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their ideas, theoretical analysis, and practical implementation on cognitive mobile broadband networks, including both application of cognitive radio to current 4G LTE environments and how it could be used to enable later generations of mobile broadband services. 
 
The call for papers attracted 13 submissions from Asia, Europe, and the United States. The program committee accepted 8 papers that cover a variety of topics, including spectrum access, energy efficiency analysis, resource allocation, transceiver and testbed design, and network and application design. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for cognitive radio network researchers and developers. 
 
We also welcome attendees to attend the keynote and invited talk presentations. These valuable and insightful talks will guide us to a better understanding on start-of-the-art and future research directions.
