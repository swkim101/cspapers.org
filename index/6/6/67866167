Experts and practitioners have long published reflections on how mathematics connects with computer science and how best to integrate mathematics within computing education. However, little literature exists that investigates this area empirically. One recent study used in-depth interviews to generate a theory of the relationship between student perceptions of mathematics and their attitude toward computer science. However, this theory is based on interactions with a limited number of students. Our study tests this theory in a larger population. We present a survey-based exploration of the attitudes 218 undergraduate computer science students hold on mathematics. We present quantitative evidence that supports the theory that student career inclinations are correlated with beliefs about mathematics. We also present additional qualitative data, obtained from free-response sections of the survey, that support the idea that student inclinations affect both their perception of the value of mathematics and academic decisions such as course selection.
