In this paper we describe an optimized BIST scheme based on reseeding of multiple polynomial Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs). The same LFSR that is used to generate pseudo-random patterns, is loaded with seeds from which it produces vectors that cover the testcubes of difficult to test faults. The scheme is compatible with scandesign and achieves full coverage as it is based on random patterns combined with a deterministic test set. A method for processing the test s et to allow for efficient encoding by the .scheme is described. Algorithms for Calculating LFSR seeds from the test set and for the selection and ordering of polynomials are described. Experimental results are provided for ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits to demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme. The scheme allows an excellent trade-off between test data storage and test application time (number of test patterns) with a very small hardware overhead. We show the trade-off between test data storage and number of test patterns under the scheme.
