Programming is a skill, often acquired through repeated practice and feedback. During traditional lectures, students not actively engaged in their own learning. It is imperative to pique students motivation and direct their focus on gaining the requisite knowledge. As the class size grows, instructors feedback is delayed that impacts student engagement and learning. Educational researchers have supported using web-based tools to help evaluate student work, provide timely feedback and increase the amount of time they spend improving their skills. Motivated by the previous work, our team has developed the SEP-CyLE (Software Engineering and Programming Cyber Learning Environment) - a cyber learning environment that contains digital learning content of software programming and testing concepts. SEP-CyLE incorporates collaborative learning, social networking and gamification-based learning engagement strategies (LESs) that has led to an improved motivation and understanding of programming concepts. This paper aims to assess the impact of different combinations of these LESs on student learning in the context of CS1 classrooms. We coordinated studies at two universities wherein different combination of LESs were utilized using SEP-CyLE in CS1 classrooms. We analyzed the impact of LESs on students' acquisition of programming concepts, their engagement and usage of SEP-CyLE. The pre and post test results indicated that the assorted LEs have shown a positive impact on student learning across all the institutions. The correlation results demonstrated that there is meaningful relationship between the LEs and the student performance.
