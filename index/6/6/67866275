Long hours, pressure to meet deadlines, and fear of failure are just some of the stressors that affect CS students and professionals alike, leading to burnout, anxiety and depression. These issues are particularly amplified in students who are already living with diagnosed mental illnesses such as bipolar mood disorder, schizophrenia, or autism spectrum disorder. A quarter of the world's population lives with some form of mental illness, and recent research suggests that 50% of those working in the tech community have been diagnosed with a mental illness, a statistic that may actually underestimate the problem because of stigmas in certain cultures and communities around seeking mental health services. These numbers suggest a significant need for awareness and support in the CS education community. This BOF will provide attendees an opportunity to discuss the mental illnesses that affect CS students and how to create a culture of understanding and support within their communities.
