Anaphora Resolution is the process of finding referents in the given discourse. Anaphora Resolution is one of the complex tasks of linguistics. This paper presents the performance analysis of two computational models that uses Gazetteer method for resolving anaphora in Hindi Language. In Gazetteer method different classes (Gazettes) of elements are created. These Gazettes are used to provide external knowledge to the system. The two models use Recency and Animistic factor for resolving anaphors. For Recency factor first model uses the concept of centering approach and second uses the concept of Lappin Leass approach. Gazetteers are used to provide Animistic knowledge. This paper presents the experimental results of both the models. These experiments are conducted on short Hindi stories, news articles and biography content from Wikipedia. The respective accuracy for both the model is analyzed and finally the conclusion is drawn for the best suitable model for Hindi Language.
