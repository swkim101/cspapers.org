Welcome to the 1st International Workshop on Context Discovery and Data Mining (ContextDD 2012). The workshop was held in Beijing, China, on August 2012, in conjunction with the 18th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2012). 
 
ContextDD 2012 is a forum to discuss the research issues and challenges within rich context mobile computing from both an academic and industrial research perspective. Some of these research issues and challenges include: context data collection, rich context data definition, context sensing, context recognition, context aggregation, context segmentation, context management and inference, context fusion, context awareness methods, context frameworks, context datasets and algorithms for mining user behavior and other intelligence. Applications of this includes context recommendation, context-aware personalized smart applications and services, location based services, etc. The workshop aims to attract and bring together researchers working in data mining and retrieval, mobile computing and pervasive computing to attend, as well as students, professors, and industry researchers from leading universities and research labs internationally that are doing work in the context, sensing, mobile, social and pervasive computing areas.
