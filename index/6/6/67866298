This paper builds from over a decade of engagement with an equity-focused initiative, the Computing Alliance for Hispanic Serving Institutions, an effort to both transform and supplement the educational experiences of computing students attending HSIs. This grassroots effort engages faculty, primarily department chairs in computer science and computer engineering programs at Hispanic-serving Institutions, in developing and implementing research-based educational practices to support the recruitment, retention, and advancement of Hispanics in computing fields. While we have addressed how CAHSI activities influence student experiences in becoming computer scientists in other work [1,2,3] we turn to the faculty to understand how faculty at Hispanic Serving Institutions act on their roles as educators at institutions with traditions of inclusive missions in a technical field. The research questions that direct the paper are: How do faculty perceive their role in educating underrepresented students in STEM? How do institutional contexts and current events in computing education constrain and support faculty action towards equitable practice in computing?
