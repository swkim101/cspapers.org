China is a Steel superpower, with large production and high efficiency. But we need more research in Business energy cost control. This paper is oriented to cost flow of steel industry, Aim at solve the shorting of energy cost control in steel industry. Using the producing data in steel making, Basing on BP neural network, optimizing by Genetic algorithm, I build the Predictive Model which has a better predict result and provide predict function for steel industry. It make business management more convenient, support the task of energy-saving. Mean while, it has validate that Genetic algorithm has good function in BP neural networkâ€™s optimizing problem and can be used in practical problems.
