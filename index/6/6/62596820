The objective of this paper is to develop techniques to sub-group multiple responses of a system. The proposal is intended for explorative preprocessing steps prior to the execution of a more formal multi-objective optimization. The sub-grouping techniques are developed based on orthonormal expansions. Factor Analysis (FA) and Total Sensitivity Analysis (TSA) are suggested when the relationships among responses are linear and non-linear, respectively. Automotive road Noise Vibration and Harshness (NVH) data is used to illustrate the application of the proposed methodologies.Copyright Â© 2003 by ASME
