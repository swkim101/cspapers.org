Crowd counting has recently attracted increasing interest in computer vision but remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a trellis encoder-decoder network (TEDnet) for crowd counting, which focuses on generating high-quality density estimation maps. The major contributions are four-fold. First, we develop a new trellis architecture that incorporates multiple decoding paths to hierarchically aggregate features at different encoding stages, which improves the representative capability of convolutional features for large variations in objects. Second, we employ dense skip connections interleaved across paths to facilitate sufficient multi-scale feature fusions, which also helps TEDnet to absorb the supervision information. Third, we propose a new combinatorial loss to enforce similarities in local coherence and spatial correlation between maps. By distributedly imposing this combinatorial loss on intermediate outputs, TEDnet can improve the back-propagation process and alleviate the gradient vanishing problem. Finally, on four widely-used benchmarks, our TEDnet achieves the best overall performance in terms of both density map quality and counting accuracy, with an improvement up to 14% in MAE metric. These results validate the effectiveness of TEDnet for crowd counting.
