Contact: herbertk@montclair.edu The United States does not produce sufficient numbers of well-qualified professionals in STEM, and in computing/ technology in particular. The number of students pursuing undergraduate degrees in computer science or related field continues to grow but is still not pacing industry growth. Employers repeatedly suggest that good professional and technical competencies, including "soft skills", are a major factor in both obtaining and succeeding in STEM careers. Moreover, both the Council on Graduate Studies and the National Science Board in the NSF 2018 STEM Trends report support the need of such skills for success in STEM. These competencies comprise (1) communication, oral and written, and in technical, business and general settings; (2) working in and leading teams, in varying roles; (3) managing business and professional relationships; (4) planning, problem solving, and critical thinking; (5) mathematical capabilities including numeracy; and (6) an understanding of ethical, social, managerial, and economic perspectives; plus, responding to recent developments in science and science careers, (7) an interdisciplinary perspective and overview understanding of data science. In this poster we present a proposal for a post baccalaureate certificate curriculum, which we suggest also assists students transitioning from other fields, and can be applied more widely across STEM.
