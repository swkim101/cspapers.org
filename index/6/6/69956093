One-class collaborative filtering (OCCF) problems are vital in many applications of recommender systems, such as news and music recommendation, but suffers from sparsity issues and lacks negative examples. To address this problem, the state-of-the-arts assigned smaller weights to unobserved samples and performed low-rank approximation. However, the ground-truth ratings of unobserved samples are usually set to zero but ill-defined. In this paper, we propose a ranking-based implicit regularizer and provide a new general framework for OCCF, to avert the ground-truth ratings of unobserved samples. We then exploit it to regularize a ranking-based loss function and design efficient optimization algorithms to learn model parameters. Finally, we evaluate them on three realworld datasets. The results show that the proposed regularizer significantly improves ranking-based algorithms and that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art OCCF algorithms.
