Virtual Globes is a new visualization platform in environmental science providing an intuitive interface and simple markup language. This study will demonstrate the realistic animation of Asian Dust and typhoons, which are frequently observed in Korea, are now feasible in Google Earth using Virtual Globes software. The study presents a new potential on visualizing temporal and spatial environment data through Virtual Globes by exploring methods for automatic conversion of satellite sensing data and meteorological prediction modeling into keyhole markup language (KML) format.
