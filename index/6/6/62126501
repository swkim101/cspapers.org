The Skilled Workforce Project Scheduling Problem (SWPSP) is a complex problem of task scheduling and resource assignment that comes up in the daily management of many company Service Centers. In this paper we present a constraint programming (CP) approach for the SWPSP. We extend the project scheduling literature by developing a project scheduling model that accounts for differing skills among workers. The computational results for the SWPSP show that the constraint programming approach increases the performance of the model solving processes. The results for the SWPSP is effective in solving the proposed problem.
