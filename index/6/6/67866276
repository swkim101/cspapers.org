In May 2018, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) formed a joint working group to develop national guidelines for teaching K-12 students about artificial intelligence. Inspired by CSTA's national standards for K-12 computing education, the - AI for K-12 guidelines (ai4k12.org) will define what students in each grade band should know about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. The working group is also creating an online resource directory where teachers can find AI-related videos, demo software, and activity descriptions they can incorporate into their lesson plans. The goal of this session is to raise the SIGCSE community's awareness of the initiative, its deliverables, and outcomes, and to foster a community-wide conversation about AI education in K-12. This initiative parallels other recent initiatives in K-12 AI education and community-wide initiatives and discussions around CS For All and CS in K-12. This Special Session is aimed toward K-12 CS educators, researchers, and curriculum and tool designers.
