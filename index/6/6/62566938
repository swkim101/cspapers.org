In the context of concurrent engineering, this paper presents a quite innovative approach to the collaborative optimisation process, which couples a multi-objective genetic algorithm with an asynchronous communication tool. To illustrate this methodology, three European companies’ collaboration on the optimisation of a ship hull is described. Our study demonstrates that when multi-objective optimisation is carried out in a distributed manner it can provide a powerful tool for concurrent product design.© 2003 ASME
