In order to improve product quality, it is necessary to summarize, analyze and resolve problems. This paper gives a concept of Problem model, which is essentially the use of Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) process. The Problem model derived from problem analysis and summarizing can find problems and the association rules between different problems. The model can improve the development process, improve testing design and find more problems. According to the analysis on Problem data of GUI, this paper established the Problem Model of GUI. Also the model is applied in some projects and got a nice result.
