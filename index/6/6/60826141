This paper explains how to use APL to build assemblers, PASCAL-like dialects, or special purpose languages. Our technique is to use APL not as a programming language but as an interactive software engineering environment Our experience is that modern programming techniques like extendibility, program and data structuring can be made available to mini and microcomputer programmers at a minimum expense and very quickly.
