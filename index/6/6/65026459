A numerical model for determination of the gear tooth root fatigue behaviour is presented. Two cases are being explored, first in which gear tooth was loaded with normal pulsating force acting at the highest point of single tooth contact, and second in which the fact that in actual gear operation the magnitude as well as the position of the force changes as the gear rotates through the mesh is taken into account. The critical plane damage model has been used to determine the number of stress cycles required for the fatigue crack initiation. The critical plane methods predict not only fatigue crack initiation life, but also the initiated crack direction, which makes a good starting point for further fatigue crack propagation studies. Finite element method and linear elastic fracture mechanics theories are then used for the further simulation of the fatigue crack growth under a moving load.
