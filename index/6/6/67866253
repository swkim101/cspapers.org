A large number of students drop out in the first year of their Bachelor's studies in Computer Science (CS). It is a problem in many countries worldwide. The aim of this study was to develop a scale for measuring the motivation and perception factors that influence students' decision to start studying Computer Science (CS), and to find the differences between these factors. A questionnaire was conducted based on expectancy-value theory to measure students' motivation and perception. Data were collected from 140 students who started their Bachelor studies in CS at a university in Estonia. The scale, named FICSS (Factors Influencing Computer Science Studies), was conducted and validated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Two models were identified: a four-factor model describing students' motivation ("Intrinsic value", "Utility value", "Social influences" and "Time for family") and a five-factor model ("Satisfaction with choice of specialty", "Social dissuasion", "Demanding work", "Salary and job security" and "Social status") that describes students' perception. "Intrinsic value" and "Utility value" were the highest-rated motivational factors. The lowest-rated factor was "Social influences". Among the perception factors, the factors with the highest means were "Satisfaction with choice of specialty" and "Salary and job security" while "Social dissuasion" was rated lowest.
