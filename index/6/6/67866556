In this workshop, participants will learn how to integrate in their classes computational thinking and creative thinking activities that have been shown via rigorous research to significantly improve student learning and performance. Specifically, participants will be familiarized with the suite of Computational Creativity Exercises (non-programming-based, group-based, active learning exercises), take part in completing two of the exercises, learn how to integrate and adapt them into their courses, and be exposed to the educational research studies behind the development, design, and administration of these exercises. Participants will also learn how to conduct evidence-based, educational research studies. Workshop sessions will include presentations, panel-based Q&A, breakout group discussions, and hands-on activities. More information can be found at cse.unl.edu/agents/ic2think/CCEWorkshop
