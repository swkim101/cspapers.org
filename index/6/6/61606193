People are cognitive units operating over a space of things, ideas, projects and so on in order to reach a certain goal. Inside our minds symbols are built and / or manipulated in other to provide for the continuous adaptation to the environment. Computer programs can be build to simulate any autopoietic system [1]. This paper will propose a cognitive database that, following a constructivist approach based on the work of Jean Piaget, is able to learn from the environment. Simple actions can be divided or added up to form more and more complex structures. Non linear techniques are employed for adapting purposes and fuzzy logic is the basis for the decision making process. Frames, schemes, scripts and so on can be built from innate reflexes using the reflexive abstraction equilibration mechanisms proposed by Jean Piaget. A new Knowledge Based Architecture results when one tries to adapt conventional expert systems to the cognitive psychological theories.
