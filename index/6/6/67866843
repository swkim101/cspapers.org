The low performance and drop-outs in Computer Science classes are frequently attributed to lack of engagement and motivation. Meanwhile, gamification - the application of game design principles and game mechanics to a non-game context - increasingly attracts the interest of educators due to its potential to foster motivation and behavioral changes in learning contexts. This Demo will introduce OneUp Learning, a platform aimed at facilitating the gamification of academic courses. OneUp enables instructors to define course activities and create exercise problems for practicing and self-assessment, as well as exams or quizzes for testing particular skills. The platform enables gamifying these practice activities. It is highly configurable and supports tailoring gamification features to meet the vision of the instructor. The gamification related configuration includes the choice of the game elements to be used along with specification of gaming rules for them. The system currently supports the following game elements: points (challenge points, skill points, and activity points), progress bar, virtual currency, badges, leaderboard, skill board, learning dashboard, and avatars. In the demo, we will show interested instructors how they can use OneUp in their classes. In particular, we will show them how to create problems and challenges, how to configure the gamification features they like to use, how to define their own badges, how to define rules for earning and spending virtual currency (in the course shop), and how to monitor the engagement and progress of their students.
