. Air pollution data are often made available as numeric values of the concentration of pollutant in the air, which is not conducive for determining the degree of air pollution intuitively. This study investigates a method on visualizing real time air pollution data on sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter on a 3D space using Google Earth and the keyhole markup language for intuitive understanding of air quality.
