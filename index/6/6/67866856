The material taught in a Formal languages course is mathematical in nature and requires students to practice proofs and algorithms to understand the content. Traditional Formal Languages textbooks are heavy on prose rather than visuals, and homework consists of solving many paper exercises. Some instructors make use of Finite State Machine simulators like JFLAP. JFLAP allows students to build different models and apply algorithms on these models, which improves student interaction with the material. However, students still need to read a significant amount of text without direct and immediate feedback on their understanding. Inspired by the Programmed Instruction (PI) teaching method, we have begun developing a new Formal Languages eText-book capable of conveying these concepts more intuitively (through visualizations) and more interactively (through the use of PI methods). Under PI methods, students read a little, ideally a sentence or a paragraph, and then answer a question related to that information. Based on the question response, students can go further and complete other frames of information or retry to solve the same question. To evaluate the pedagogical effectiveness of our new eTextbook, we will conduct time and performance evaluations across two offerings of a Formal Languages course. We will compare the time spent by students using materials with text and exercises only, with text and visualizations, and with the PI frames to determine levels of students engagement. Students grades will be compared to assess learning gains.
