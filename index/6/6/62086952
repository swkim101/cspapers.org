The option market in South Korea began on 7 July 1997. After then, the amount of option market has increased steeply. In these days, average daily payments is beyond 1 trillion won. It is impossible to predict the market. But using the statistics, investors can get a profit steadly. The open interest contracts of index future has increased over 4000 after start time of a day and decrease down to about 0 when closing time. As for this characteristics of index future, Ko [1] suggested the volatility strategy and brought the result of simulation with the profit of 1.07 % per a day. This profit comes to real if an investor finds a brokerage firm with low commissions. This paper suggests another strategy. The price of options consists of time value and intrinsic value. And the fall of index future is faster than rising. Therefore velocity of moving index cause the price of options. The simulation results give a fascinating fact that put option tends to increase in the morning and call option tends to increase in the afternoon. With this velocity strategy, investors get the profit 1.4% per a day except commissions of 0.15% per one trade.
