The goal of the session is to help attendees who are committed to diversity and inclusion learn to talk about different dimensions of identity (e.g., race, class, gender, sex, sexuality, etc.). The landscape of terms is always changing and we want SIGCSE attendees to feel more comfortable using current language to talk about issues related to diversity and inclusion. This special session will include six lightning talks, individual reflection, small-group discussion, and a Q&A with presenters. This is a reprise of a special session held at the NCWIT Summit in 2018; it was well received and we hope to offer it to the larger SIGCSE audience.
