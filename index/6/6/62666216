The Institute for Power System Automation decided to develop CADEL-a computer aided design system for real-time software. In addition to catalogue editors and CRI display generators, CADEL covers the Functional Data Processing (FDP) subsystem consisting of the FDP function library, interrogating mode editor and the FDP driver. The latter is implemented in on-line computers while the first two-on the editing computer (IBM AT-compatible). Using the FDP editor, control engineers may define a set of FDP action trees which are described as FDP control blocks as well as printed diagrams showing the control/processing actions in a form of self-explanatory diagrams. The FDP control blocks complete with preprepared FDP processing modules are consolidated with the operating system of the on-line computer involved or (for modifications requiring testing) are read in the by the operating system. In either case, the final version of on-line software is ready for normal operation. CADEL is described with special reference to FDP.
