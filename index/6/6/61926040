The 45th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Posters and Demonstrations session was held between the 25th to 27th June 2007 in Prague. This year we had 113 submissions out of which 61 were selected for presentation, resulting in a 54% acceptance rate. 
 
The criteria for acceptance of posters were to describe original work in progress, and to present innovative methodologies used to solve problems in computational linguistics or NLP. 48 posters were accepted. 
 
For demonstrations the criterion for acceptance was the implementation of mature systems or prototypes in which computational linguistics or NLP technologies are used to solve practically important problems. 13 demonstrations were accepted.
