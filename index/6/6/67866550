This workshop aims to assist high school and college educators with implementing cybersecurity into their existing curriculum. The workshop will introduce Raspberry Pi as a teaching platform for topics such as network traffic analysis, cryptography and web security. We will discuss the Raspberry Pi hardware and software requirements, and will demonstrate network traffic analysis using Wireshark. Participants will receive a fully configured Raspberry Pi kit to use during the workshop and then take home at the end. Manuals on Raspberry Pi configuration will be shared for both Windows and Mac platforms, along with sample lesson plans on network analysis and its security implications. The workshop will send all participants home with flexible tools and new expertise in implementing cybersecurity curricula. Bring a laptop with an Ethernet port or adapter, and ensure that you have full administrator privileges to configure settings and install software on your device.
