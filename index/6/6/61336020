This volume contains the papers presented at the ninth annual ACM Workshop on Digital Rights Management (DRM), sponsored by the ACM SIGSAC and held in conjunction with the 16th ACM Conference on Computer Computer and Communications Security (CSS). The daylong workshop consisted of informal discussions, peer-reviewed technical talks describing recent research contributions, invited talks that delved into policy issues related to DRM, along with a panel session that included experts in the field from both industry and academia. 
 
As in the past, the workshop provided an international forum that serves as an interdisciplinary bridge between areas that can be applied to DRM, including: cryptography, software and computer systems design, trusted computing, information and signal processing, intellectual property law, policy-making, as well as business analysis and economics. In addition, this year we were privileged to have three invited talks from different cross-sections of the DRM realm. The first of these was provided by a speaker with in-depth experience related to high-value content, namely, Scott Watson, senior Vice President of the Walter Disney company and Chief Technology Officer of Disney Imagineering Research and Development. The next invited talk was given by Randal Picker of the University of Chicago School of Law, who is an expert on laws related to intellectual property and regulated industries. Finally, an invited talk was also given by Edward Felten, Professor and Director of the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University, who is a longstanding proponent of informed public discussion of digital technologies.
