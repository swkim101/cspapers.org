Broadening participation in K-12 CS education at a statewide level is a challenge that requires substantial structural changes that need to be addressed across the K-12 system. At the same time, it is vital to find early successes in order to build both political and financial support for broadening participation in computing (BPC) efforts. Leadership teams from Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance states are responding to these two apparently conflicting drivers as they develop goals and metrics that measure outcomes that are both realistic in the short term and that will lead to long-term success. This lightening talk will discuss a framework for goal development used by Texas that addresses four interdependent components of the K-12 CS education system: capacity, access, participation, and equity. Focusing on measurable outcomes for each of these components can both lead to early "wins" that are meaningful and easily communicated to stakeholders and that lay the foundation for substantive changes in CS engagement and success for students from traditionally underrepresented groups including women, students of color, and students of low socio-economic status.
