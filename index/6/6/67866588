Competency-based education (CBE) has been the focus of much attention lately - from institutions, employers, and policymakers alike. Institutions - from ivy leagues to community colleges to K-12 - are incorporating some form of CBE. In computer science, CBE is an excellent modality to measure mastery and thus prepare students for the next phase whether it is further education or a job. This workshop introduces participants to CBE with an emphasis on CBE course design and competency development. This workshop will be useful for faculty and course designers at all levels - from K-12 through graduate school.
