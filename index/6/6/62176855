It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 2012 ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society -- WPES'12. The purpose of this workshop is to discuss the problems of privacy in the global interconnected societies and possible solutions. WPES brings researchers from both academia and industry to present research on all theoretical and practical aspects of electronic privacy, as well as experimental studies of fielded systems. This year WPES continues to be a workshop at the ACM CCS conference. 
 
This year, the program committee reviewed 48 papers. Each paper received at least three reviews, which were followed by an online discussion to decide on the program. The program committee accepted 11 full papers and 3 short papers that cover a variety of topics, including online advertising, anonymous communication, privacy-enhancing technologies, and understanding human behavior.
