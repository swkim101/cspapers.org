Component methodology helps in increasing the productivity of the system. Though reusing the existing components helps in developing the systems within time and budget. However because of the risk of effective reuse, developers are bound to develop the system from scratch. The components which are not reused can be reconfigured such that it can increase the reusability thereby increasing the productivity of the system. This paper presents an approach to reconfigure the less frequently used or victim component using AND relationship, such that it can be effectively re-used in future. The proposed methodology is tested for Network domain application and the results shows considerable amount of reusability of the components. (6 pages)
