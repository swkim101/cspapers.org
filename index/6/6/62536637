With the development of the computer technology, the size and complexity of software increase sharply. It is necessary to have further researches into the softwarequality measures. However, as one of the most important measures, the coupling frameworks are too subjective and ambiguous. There is also a lack of coupling framework applicable to systems of different programming paradigms. In this paper, aunified framework for software coupling measurement is presented. The advantages and disadvantages of framework for object-oriented systems and procedure-oriented systems are taken into consideration comprehensively, and the coupling types are complemented and unified. At last, effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through an experiment. Keywordssoftware quality; software measurement; software coupling
