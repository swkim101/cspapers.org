Manufacturing research is broadly concerned with tasks performed throughout the product manufacturing life cycle: • Design, • Planning, • Production, • Distribution, • Field Service, and • Reclamation. Decision making at each stage requires creativity, the ability to deal with complexity and coordination with other activities in the cycle. As such, manufacturing represents a fertile domain in which to apply Artificial Intelligence.
