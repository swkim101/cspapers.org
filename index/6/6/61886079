It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2010 ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Networking, Systems, and Applications on Mobile Handhelds -- MobiHeld'10. This year's workshop builds on the success of last year's initial workshop. The mission of the workshop is to generate discussion about the future of computing on handheld devices through presentation of new ideas, preliminary research results, and experience reports from all layers of the mobile-handheld stack. 
 
The call for papers attracted 17 submissions from Asia, Europe, and North America. The program committee accepted 9 papers that cover a variety of topics, including service architectures, wireless networks, and novel user interfaces. The program also includes a keynote speech by Sanjoy Paul on the rapidly evolving functionality of handhelds and their place in the larger computing landscape as well as a poster and demo session. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers interested in handheld computing.
