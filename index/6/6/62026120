Summary form only given, as follows. Comparing the original ARM design of 1985 to those of today's latest microprocessors, Mike will look at how far has design come and what EDA has contributed to enabling these advances in systems, hardware, operating systems, and applications and how business models have evolved over 25 years. He will then speculate on the needs for scaling designs into solutions for 2020 from tiny embedded sensors through to cloud based servers which together enable the internet of things. He will look at what are the major challenges that need to be addressed to design and manufacture these systems and proposes some solutions.
