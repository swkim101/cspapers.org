Responding to NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio's call to double the number of students graduating with Bachelor degrees in computer science, in 2017, the Tech-in-Residence Corps program - a first-of-its-kind multistakeholder partnership between academia, government, and private industry, was established to specifically address two challenges at the City University of New York; the capacity problem (not enough faculty to accommodate the growing student body) and creating curriculum that incorporates in-demand "applied knowledge" areas to increase students' job competitiveness. Moving industry practitioners into the classroom posed problems that both mirrored and went beyond those posed by the typical adjunct hire. First, accommodations had to be instituted to consider the industry adjunct's work schedule. Second, industry professionals professed a fear of not being able to develop materials and teach effectively. To address these concerns, we set up an administrative structure that paired industry adjuncts with campuses that fit their pedagogical strengths and goals, as well as their logistical needs. Industry adjuncts were assigned campus faulty mentors so that there was a point person with which to communicate other than the chairperson. Both industry adjuncts and faculty attended a two-day workshop focused on pedagogical best practices as well as campus logistics. This poster outlines the Tech-in-Residence Corps model and presents our initial results. Early data indicates that this program has proven quite effective for driving curriculum innovation and raising student awareness of industry trends and hiring practices, however, the jury is still out as to whether it helps address the institutional capacity problem.
