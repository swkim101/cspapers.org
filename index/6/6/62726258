This paper presents a distributed digital rights management platform (DRMp) based on a web-oriented watermarking protocol. The platform enables web service providers (SPs) to dynamically supply copyright protection services on behalf of web content providers (CPs) in a security context. Thus, CPs exploiting the platform can take advantage of copyright protection services supplied by SPs acting as trusted third parties (TTPs) without having to directly implement them. On the other hand, SPs can follow the proposed design approach to implement protection procedures that can be easily exploited by CPs without imposing a tight coupling among the involved web entities.
