There is a need for multicasting for different applications in all types of distributed computer systems. It is shown that multicasting can be integrated in a network as a special sublayer above the network layer. The migration of the multicast and other similar services into so-called 'intelligent network' reduces delays significantly, and makes use of transmission facilities more efficient. Multicasting in point-to-point networks is examined and a minimum-weight spanning tree of connections in a network is found to be an optimal connection pattern. The distributed algorithm for the MST construction is presented as well as the mechanisms for the distribution of data packets and for synchronisation inside a multicast liaison. Future research should be focused on the introduction of switches with copying facilities into network nodes and their impact on the efficiency of multicasting. >
