Buffalo State College has hosted a number of summer institutes and conferences over the years to increase the availability of computer science (CS) courses taught in western and central New York high schools. These institutes and conferences have contributed to strong CS programs in suburban and private schools, but not in urban and rural/small town schools. In the summer of 2018, Buffalo State invited high school principals from across the area to a summit to discuss the future of CS. Forty-six principals participated in the summit and of those school leaders, 30% of them were from rural/small towns. In this poster, the research team will present the results of a mixed-methods school leadership study based on the value rural/small town principals place on CS. Results from a survey, conducted at the summit, and semi-structured interviews will be presented. A sociocultural approach was used to analyze the data since the principals' values and mediated actions toward CS were influenced by the socially situated environment of the schools they lead
