We have introduced Peer-Educators through the Supplemental Instruction program and four Team-Based Learning laboratory assignments in our Introduction to Programming course. These four laboratory assignments are using Finch Robots to facilitate student comprehension of basic object-oriented programming concepts. In contrast to other lab assignments, Finch labs are team-based activities that revolve around programming Finch, a programmable robot to do activities like moving, sensing the environment, playing music, etc. Introducing the Finch labs has multiple benefits for the students. It helps better anchor the basic concepts of object-oriented programming, since interacting with the Finch robot is done by instantiating a Finch object and performing method calls on the object. This helps students understand many of the object oriented topics of the course, like object instantiation, method calls, passing arguments to a method and changing the state of an object. Furthermore, the labs facilitate peer learning in a natural way, since students group to work on a physical object. The goal of our intervention is to increase retention in our introduction to programming offerings. We are currently on the third year of our project and after having concluded in the interventions we want to adopt we are evaluating them through post-activity surveys, end of the semester surveys and comparison of retention data.
