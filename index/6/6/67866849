Investing in raising a generation with more security-aware minds is essential in preventing many of the security incidents that threaten us and our nation. In addition there is a high need for well-trained cybersecurity professionals to protect our networks, computer systems, and infrastructure. Early exposure is key to developing awareness, piquing student interest, and laying a foundation for more complex skill development. Students of today are parents, professionals, and leaders of tomorrow. The impact of their actions is significant for the future. In this work, TSYS School of Computer Science at Columbus State University and Rothschild Leadership Academy, a Title I middle school in the Muscogee County School District of Georgia collaborated to develop, deliver, and assess a middle school cybersecurity curriculum for U.S. grade 8 students. The project had three student achievement goals: 1. Provide a good foundation for students in cybersecurity knowledge and skills, 2. Enhance students' ability to secure their environment, and 3. Increase students' interest in cybersecurity education The project included development of the standards, objectives, lessons, and assessment instruments for implementation within a year-long business and computer science course and training of the teacher in cybersecurity. The course was piloted with sixty grade 8 students in two classes during the 2017-2018 school year. Results show significant growth in mastery of key cybersecurity concepts via a pre- and post- test and artifacts from the course indicate an increase in student interest in cybersecurity.
