This paper presents an axiomatic analysis of negotiation problems within task-oriented domains (TOD). We start by applying three classical bargaining solutions of Nash, Kalai-Smorodinsky and Egalitarian to the domains of problems with a preprocess of randomization on possible agreements. We find out that these three solutions coincide within any TOD and can be characterized by the same set of axioms, which specify a solution of task oriented negotiation as an outcome of dual-process of maximizing cost reduction and minimizing workload imbalance. This axiomatic characterization is then used to produce an approximate solution to the domain of problems without randomization on possible agreements.
