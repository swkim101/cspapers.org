Case studies are one of the best active learning approaches for teaching software engineering in general and requirements engineering in particular. They offer an effective approach to understanding a system or a phenomenon that are too large or too difficult to represent in a lab setting. As a tangible manipulative, LEGO works well to support designing hands-on case studies that mix studying software engineering concepts with the elements of team building and playful creativity. In our project, we study the role that LEGO has in engaging students in software engineering through a set of activities that leverage the case study and play aspects. This paper presents our design approach for requirements engineering activities, as well as current results from classroom testing with a focus on student engagement with the subject matter.
