How, and what for, the concept of acoustic space came up in McLuhan’s thinking? When we try to find the answer to this question, we face not a straight explanation but a speculative method of thinking named explorations. The aim of this article is to achieve the methodological and epistemological of McLuhan’s understanding. Based on this understanding we hope to 
comprehend the states of culture developed as the sensus communis of the electric age. 
Key words
