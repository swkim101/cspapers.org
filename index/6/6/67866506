In 1962, Thomas Kuhn changed our understanding of scientific progress through his explanation of scientific paradigms and attribution of scientific advances to paradigm shifts. According to Kuhn, a discipline's paradigm drives research, provides explanations, and directs the accumulation of discipline-specific knowledge. In 2006 and 2008 Jeanette Wing authored articles that reignited interest in computational thinking (CT) education and CT education research. Wing's articles, arguably, set in place the conceptual foundations of the paradigm currently guiding CT education and paved the way for a fruitful decade of CT education research. We are concerned, however, that the present direction of CT education and research will not support CT as an integral part of K-12 education. In its current form, CT instruction focuses almost exclusively on teaching students to program and isolates CT from disciplinary content; perpetuating the persistent misconception that programming = CT. This approach to CT education may deprive students of the opportunity to adequately develop foundational CT skills (e.g. systems thinking, abstraction and generalization, data collection and utilization, solution evaluation) and may prevent teachers from persistently and meaningfully integrating CT into their curriculum. Through this talk, we identify features of the current CT paradigm, question their alignment with Wing's ideal of "computational thinking for everyone," and propose specific recommendations for expanding the current CT paradigm.
