This birds-of-a-feather session discusses the global project Computing Curricula 2020 (CC2020), a joint project launched by professional computing societies worldwide. CC2020 is a priority of the ACM Education Council; its sponsors include ACM, IEEE Computer Society, and eight professional organizations from around the world. The project team consists of a task force of 38 members representing 16 countries and six continents. A steering committee of 13 members functions as an executive board to manage the project. CC2020 examines the current state of curricular guidelines for academic programs granting bachelor's degrees in computing and it provides a vision for the future of computing. Audience discussion encompasses new ways computing programs can prepare graduates both academically and professionally. Since computing competencies is an underlying theme of the project, this birds-of-a-feather session discusses competencies, their definition, and their inclusion into future curricular reports. Discussion surrounds competencies in computing, their effect, and the possible ways to visualize their meaning. This birds-of-a-feather session also allows the audience to provide comment on the elements of the project, to engage them to serve as potential project reviewers, and to provide a forum for lively interaction on a global and encompassing computing project.
