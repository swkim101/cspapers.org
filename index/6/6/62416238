It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2nd Workshop on The Role of Abstraction in Software Engineering (ROA). 
 
Abstraction is a central topic both in Computer Science and in Software Engineering. It is a cognitive means according to which, in order to overcome complexity at a specific stage of a problem solving situation, we concentrate on the essential features of our subject of thought, and ignore irrelevant details. Abstraction is especially essential in solving complex problems as it enables the problem solver to think in terms of conceptual ideas rather than in terms of their details. 
 
The first workshop on the Role of Abstraction in Software Engineering was held in conjunction with ICSE 2006 - the 28th International Conference on Software Engineering with a subsequent report in ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes. In this workshop, based on the accepted papers and several activities, we continue to explore the potential benefits, as well as the barriers, of using abstraction in software engineering. 
 
The one-day workshop consists of theory- and practice-based presentations, group work and discussions. It is envisaged that the workshop will contribute to the state of software engineering research, practice and teaching. The workshop consists of three parts: Abstraction in software engineering processes, educational perspective of abstraction and the nature of abstraction. In each part, papers will be presented in order to facilitate the discussions and activities. 
 
The call for papers attracted 9 submissions. The program committee accepted 7 papers. We would like to express our gratitude to the program committee -- Daniel M. Berry, Shing Chi Cheung, Yael Dubinsky, Carlo Ghezzi, Leah Goldin, Frank Maurer, Tetsuo Tamai, Sebastian Uchitel and Axel van Lamsweerde -- for their cooperation. We would like to thank also the authors for providing the content of the program.
