In this paper, we discuss the development of complex gaming systems by freshman college students using a rapid game development method called the GM-method. The method combines agile software engineering techniques with non traditional instructional methods and non traditional assessments of student performance. The GM-method we discuss herein provides freshmen with the cachet and magnetism of complex game development without sacrificing the development of core programming skills. The focus of the DWC classroom experience is on the development of competency, independent learning skills, massive knowledge assimilation, rapid product development and teamwork.
