Machine learning and neural networks have become key techniques for solving some of society's most difficult problems. Many students are intimidated by, or ignorant of the mechanics of AI. Teaching machine learning to early computing students is possible; in doing so students will gain further confidence and interest in the field of Computer Science. Through an NSF funded grant to the University of Nebraska Omaha, a unit of study was created to teach machine learning to high school students. Focuses for the unit include; neural networks, genetic algorithms, sigmoid and perceptron networks, social impacts, ethics, history, and supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The unit employs hands on learning approaches and media elements. Also included is a lab where students train an autonomous car. Students were administered pre and post Likert surveys for this unit using the Computing Attitude Survey V4.1 with additional topic specific questions. The study size was sixteen students from two sections of AP Computer Science Principles. Based on survey results, student perceived machine learning comprehension showed a positive delta value growth of 27.84% and negative results showed a delta value shrink of 20.45%. For questions related to computer science interest and confidence, students showed a positive delta value growth of 14.58% and a negative delta value shrink of 11.8%. We believe these results demonstrate that teaching machine learning topics to high school students is effective and has a positive impact on student desire and confidence to pursue further study in the field.
