It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Third Workshop on Quality of Protection (QoP'07), held in association with the 14th ACM Computer and Communications Security Conference, October 29, 2007, in Alexandria, VA (USA). The objective of this workshop series is to help security research progress towards a notion of Quality of Protection in security comparable to the notion of Quality of Service in networking, software reliability, or software measurements and metrics in empirical software engineering. 
 
The call for papers attracted 20 submissions. Each paper was assigned to three program committee members and evaluated on the criteria of scientific novelty, importance to the field and technical quality. The program committee accepted 7 full papers, 4 short papers and 1 poster. In addition, the program includes a panel on how to effectively research, assess, and use security metrics, and a keynote speech by Shari Lawrence Pfleeger on how to keep security metrics useful and realistic. from institutions around the world.
