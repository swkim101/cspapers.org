Monitor psychological parameters of driver to detect fatigue state is an effective approach to prevent traffic accident. Heart rate variability (HRV) has its particular advantage comparing with other methods, such as its accuracy and conveniences. ECG is a regular signal to obtain HRV, but during driving condition, electrodes and wires need to be placed on driver’s body and may disturb the driver’s normal driving behavior. Since ballistocardiogram (BCG) can reflect heart movement, so HRV can also be extracted from BCG. This paper gives a novel noninvasive method to detect driver’s BCG. Using PVDF sensor which is embedded in safety belt to get driver's BCG and designing hardware and software to amplify and convert it to digital signal for next processing. The result shows that the proposed device can obtain the driver’s BCG properly and the HRV of the driver can be calculated accurately and conveniently, so the design is reasonable.
