In this paper, we proposed a novel and simple gaze calibration procedure, namely Pattern Voting Scheme (PVS), for reducing the computing complex. The proposed method doesn't require multiple spatial coordinates to estimate the inner and outer parameters of the camera and without regard to the evaluation of accuracy. The iris location can be determined easy by using the voting weight. The PVS is a simple and feasible method applying in mobile device.
