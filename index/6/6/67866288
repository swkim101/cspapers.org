Online contests often have a wide skill range between each participant, making it feel overwhelming for high school students to compete in. On sites like HackerRank or TopCoder, students could be competing against professionals with years of work. The project narrows down the skill gap to a young audience so that they can compete against one another without having to compete with these professionals. In addition, this project provides the participants with the necessary environment and tools to run their programs without the hassle of having to installing necessary tools and its required files to run these programs. During the contest, participants can access a scoreboard, giving them a view of their progress against other participants. The purpose of the scoreboard is to show each participant their progress, as well as motivating them to achieve higher scores. The contest tool then grades based on time before correctness to provide fairness towards most students as the goal to solve problems early rather than optimize their program. With this, the focus is to improve their problem solving skills, pique curiosity, or serve as an impetus, to become a computer science engineering student.
