Modern software development approaches, especially those which follow a model-driven way of development, make heavy use of models during the whole development process. In this context models are being evolved, simplified and/or extended, over a longer period of time. This kind of model evolution leads to the need of keeping different versions of models, of comparing them, of measuring their (un)similarity, and of merging different models into one. 
 
Conventional techniques for document comparison, document retrieval, and document reuse, which have been developed in the context of version and configuration management systems, are primarily aimed at textual documents. They make use of a large body of knowledge developed over the years in the context of version management systems. They are not directly applicable to models, especially if they come as visual documents like UML diagrams. For models written in visual languages the foundations, algorithms, and tools are not so elaborated yet. 
 
The aim of the ICSE 2008 workshop on Comparison and Versioning of Software Models (CVSM08) is to establish the state of the art in the area of comparing and versioning of models. It follows similar events at the German Software Engineering Conference (SE 2007) in March 2007 in Hamburg, Germany (http://pi.informatik.uni-siegen.de/gi/fg211/VVUM07/), and at the Nordic Workshop on Model Driven Software Engineering (NW-MoDE'07) in June 2007 in Ronneby, Sweden (http://www.ituniv.se/~miroslaw/node.htm). 
 
14 contributions were submitted in response to the call. Each paper was assessed by at least three members of the program committee who agreed to accept 8 papers for this workshop. These papers hopefully will raise fruitful and inspiring discussions during the meeting. They will be presented in three sessions which are planned to provide enough time for extensive discussions. The final session will be dedicated to the discussion of a road map for future research in this area.
