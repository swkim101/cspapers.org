It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2014 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Ph.D. Symposium. This year's symposium continues its tradition, which is intended to bring together Ph.D. students working on topics related to the SIGMOD and PODS conference. The workshop will offer Ph.D. students the opportunity to present, discuss, and receive feedback on their research in a constructive and international atmosphere. The workshop will be accompanied by prominent professors, researchers and practitioners in the fields of database technology. These accompanying professors will participate actively and contribute to the discussions. The call for papers attracted 13 submissions from Asia, Canada, Europe, and the United States. The program committee accepted 10 proposals that cover a variety of topics, including stream and large scale data processing, query language and query processing. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech given by Dr. Divesh Srivastava, head of the Database Research Department at AT&T Labs-Research. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for Ph.D. students.
