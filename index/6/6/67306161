Welcome to the International Conference on Software and Systems Process (ICSSP) 2016 held in Austin, USA, from 14 to 15 May 2016. The ICSSP conference, continuing the success of Software Process Workshop and International Conference on Software Process (ICSP) conference series, has become an established premier event in the field of software and systems engineering process and is incooperation with ACM/SIGSOFT. It provides a leading forum for the exchange of research outcomes and industrial best-practices in process development from software and systems disciplines. 
 
The International Conference on Software and Systems Process (ICSSP) 2016 publishes papers in the many exciting areas of research going on in the domain of Software and Systems process. At the same time, the theme of this year's conference is focused on studying Process(es) in Action and recognizing that the AS-Planned and AS-Practiced processes can be quite different. 
 
ICSSP believes there is a strong need to bring practitioners and scientists together to discuss the role of the software process in current and future development of complex systems and in rapidly changing markets. To encourage these discussions and collaborative research, ICSSP provides a proven forum for the exchange of research outcomes and industrial best practices in process development.
