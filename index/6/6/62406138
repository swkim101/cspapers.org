Interest increasing to use of microstrip technology in fuzzy array systems and possibility of using millimeter-wave arrays have caused development of CAD techniques for accurate design of patches and microstrip arrays be necessary. Multiport network method is one of the best methods to design and analyse antennas and microstrip patch arrays. On other hand, square spiral antennas have the merits of not only wide bandwidth and circular polarization but also compact size which makes them good candidate for mobile receiver applications. In this paper, first, MNM is introduced and then a microstrip square spiral antenna is designed accurately and results are presented.
