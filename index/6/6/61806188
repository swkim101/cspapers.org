This article presents a computer simulated artificial intelligence (AI) agent that is able to move and interact in 2D and 3D environments. The agent has two operating modes: Manual Mode and Map or Autopilot mode. In the Manual mode the user has full control over the agent and can move it in all possible directions depending on the environment. In addition to that, the designed agent avoids hitting any obstacle by sensing them from a certain distance. The second and most important mode is the Map mode, in which the user can create a custom map, assign a starting and target location, and add predefined and sudden obstacles. The agent will then move to the target location by finding the shortest path avoiding any collision with any obstacle during the agentâ€™s journey. The article suggests as a solution, an algorithm that can help the agent to find the shortest path to a predefined target location in a complex 3D environment, such as cities and mountains, avoiding all predefined and sudden obstacles. It also avoids these obstacles during manual control and moves the agent to a safe location automatically.
