Ultrasonic imaging is a commonly used method to detect and identify defects in a mechanical part in nuclear applications. Nowadays massively parallel architectures enable the simulation of ultrasonic field emitted by a phased array transducer inspecting a part across a coupling medium. In this paper, regular field computation model will be discussed along its implementations on General Purpose Processors (GPP) and Graphic Processing Units (GPU).
