Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science A (CS A) is an introductory high school Java course equivalent to a CS1 course at the undergraduate level. Over 66,000 high school students sat for the AP CS A end-of-course examination in May 2018. The exam contains four free-response questions (FRQs) where students are to implement methods or a full class according to specifications. Each June, these exams are graded at the AP CS A Reading. This workshop provides a behind-the-scenes look at the Reading, during which the FRQs are read (scored) by more than 325 college faculty and high school AP teachers. You will learn how the FRQs are scored, the roles of the various Reading participants, and the steps to ensure consistent grading. You will engage in an AP Reading-style training by applying a rubric based on a past free-response question and then participate in a mock reading using the rubric. After attending this workshop, you will be able to understand the role and responsibilities of the Chief Reader, Question Leader, and Table Leader at the AP Reading; develop strategies for creating rubrics for code questions; consistently apply rubrics for free-response questions and similar assignments; and apply strategies to prepare students for the free-response portion of the AP Exam or to similar style questions in an introductory college-level course.
