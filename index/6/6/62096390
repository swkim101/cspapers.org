Modeling and simulation of robotics hands are significant topics that have been looked into by many robotics Specialists and programming experts. This is due to a demand to build a friendly platform for analyzing proposed hand design and movements, earlier to hand physical construction. For meeting such demands, a dexterous robotic hand software simulator was synthesized. The developed code is dexterity characterized robotic hand modeling and simulation software environment. The simulator was developed for robotics hands research purposes. This manuscript is presenting a brief documentation of such a modeling and simulating environment for simulating dynamic movements of multi-finger robotics hand. The environment is named as the e_GRASP. To make use of other supporting environments, e_GRASP is a Mat lab based simulator, with a quite large number of linked functionalities and routines that helps in simulating hand movements in a defined 3D space. e_GRASP was built after a number of years of experience while dealing with robot hands, hence it is a comprehensive Mat lab based Toolbox that makes use of other Mat lab defined Toolboxes. e_GRASP can also be interfaced to real-time hand control, with an ability to be linked with even higher levels of hierarchy. This includes Mat lab AI Tools, optimization, as considered useful toolboxes for dexterous hands for grasping and manipulation.
