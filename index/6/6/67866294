A meritocracy is an environment in which rewards are based solely on ability. The concept of privilege runs counter to this idea. Privilege is an unearned, unasked for advantage gained because of the way society views an aspect of your identity such as race, ethnicity, gender, perceived socioeconomic status, and language. Privilege can affect our students experiences in the classroom and beyond. However, privilege does not have to be viewed as an entitlement, but rather an opportunity to level the playing field for all people. In this session, we seek to visually display the world of privilege through adapting interactive activities known as a privilege walk and an asset walk. Come to learn and meet with other attendees who want to create a more inclusive society
