It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the International Workshop on Health Information and Knowledge Management -- HIKM'06, in conjunction with ACM Fifteenth Conference on Information and Knowledge Management -- CIKM'06. Health information technology is receiving a tremendous amount of attention as a strategic area that will benefit the society in the 21st century. The high stakes and unique characteristics of health information require special treatments of traditional information and knowledge management techniques. This workshop is the first in its series for presentation and exchange of research results and experiences on leading edge issues of health information and knowledge management. The mission of the workshop is to provide an open yet focused platform for researchers and practitioners from computer science as well as healthcare industry to discuss current research challenges and advances and share their perspective in various aspects of health information and knowledge management.The program features 7 papers that cover a variety of topics, including healthcare data integration and exchange, security management, medical document indexing and retrieval, medical data mining and clinical trial management. We hope that you will find this program interesting and thought-provoking and that the workshop will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world and serve as a catalyst for further research and collaboration.
