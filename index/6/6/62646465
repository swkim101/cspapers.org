One important function of process mining is to manage business process in order to detect the abnormal. A new process mining method is proposed based on process mining technology. The method will form a new process model that is more extensible relative to original process model. Then we use a effective method re-executing our event logs based on this new process model. Several kinds of abnormal are defined: task lost; task is excess; task replaced; tasks disordered. Due to the define of abnormal type, the re-executed results will show us the concrete mistakes about abnormal behaviors and help us understood and analysis the business process easily.
