Web development continues to grow as an essential skill and knowledge area for employed computer science graduates. Yet within the ACM CS2013 curriculum recommendation and within computing education research in general, web development has been shrinking or even disappearing all together. This paper uses an informal systematic literature review methodology to answer three research questions: what approaches are being advocated in existing web development education research, what are current trends in industry practice, and how should web development be taught in light of these current trends. Results showed a significant mismatch between the type of web development typically taught in higher education settings in comparison to web development in industry practice. Consequences for the pedagogy of web development courses, computer science curriculum in general, and for computing education research are also discussed
