It is our great pleasure to welcome you to The First Workshop on Online User Engagement Optimization -- UEO'13. The aim of UEO is to being the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of user engagement optimization, including machine learning, information retrieval, recommender systems, online experimental platforms and social network analysis. The mission of the workshop is to share latest research results and bring industrial practitioners and academic researchers together. 
 
We have accepted six high quality papers from both industrial and academic institutions, covering topics of query analysis, recommender systems, online experiments and user engagement analysis. In addition, the program includes several invited speakers which would boost the discussion further. 
 
We also encourage attendees to attend the keynote and invited talk presentations. These valuable and insightful talks can and will guide us to a better understanding of the future:
