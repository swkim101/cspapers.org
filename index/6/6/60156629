The power consumption of trains is a growing concern. Not only because of cost, but also because of pollution. It is possible to reduce train energy usage significantly, by driving the trains in an optimized way. In order to study optimized train driving, with respect to energy usage and running time, a computer program is developed by KTH from full-scale tests. By means of full-scale testing and computer simulations, a parametric study is done showing which parameters are significant and their quantitative impact on energy usage. This is the aim of this study. The study shows that energy usage is sensitive to the driver's look forward distance, the braking ratio, and the degree of coasting. By planning the driving and making use of coasting it is possible to save 10-15% in energy. If only unnecessary braking can be avoided, an energy saving of 5-7% can be achieved. Combining the studied parameters results in an even greater save in energy. The running time is only slightly affected. The results show that in Sweden, and many other countries, there is an unused potential for saving energy. This possibility should be of interest to the train operators. In this paper a review of the study is made, with conclusions.
