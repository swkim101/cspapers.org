It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 3rd International Workshop on Visualization for Computer Security -- VizSEC'06 held November 3rd, 2006 at George Mason University in conjunction the Thirteenth ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). This year's workshop continues its tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on visualization for cybersecurity. VizSEC provides researchers and practitioners the unique opportunity of a focused workshop environment to share their ideas with others from around the world interested in applying visualization techniques to the application domain of Internet security.The VizSEC'06 call-for-papers attracted 44 submissions from Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States. The program committee accepted 19 papers that cover a wide variety of topics. In addition to traditional VizSEC'06 strengths in system administration tools, traffic visualization, intrusion detection, and routing -- this year we have industry participation (3 papers and 8 members of the program committee), and papers on new topics such as wireless, encryption, and DNS. While the accepted papers are USA-centric, there are accepted papers from Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, and Switzerland. Future VizSEC'06 workshops will seek to increase international participation. This year we also introduced two new paper categories: (1) update papers on tools presented at previous VizSEC'06 workshops and (2) position papers. It is our hope these two new paper categories will provide another opportunity for communicating interesting work in future VizSEC'06workshops.
