Collaborations to solve complex tasks, which are not achievable by a single individual, are frequently observed in nature. Collaborative behaviours can be exhibited by insects who have very limited intelligence and communication abilities. Collaboration can occur on the basis of pure reactive behaviours where individuals of a team react only to their current percepts. These behaviours are usually not learned. For example, in the case of ants, they are encoded in the genome. In this paper we show that a small set of simple reactive behaviours is sufficient to enable a team of robots to complete complex collaborative tasks in a domestic environment. Our research work does not include any learning capabilities. We demonstrate an emergent complex team behaviour with two identical robots sharing the same set of basic behaviours. The two robots are able to locate and move a piece of furniture inside a room.
