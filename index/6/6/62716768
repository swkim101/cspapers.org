Algorithms of matrix multiplication are widely used in software engineering field. Application of Strassen algorithm makes a significant contribution to optimize the algorithm . Therefore, thorough study based on time complexity of matrix multiplication algorithm is very important. This paper talks about the time complexity of Strassen algorithm and general algorithm for matrix multiplication, and makes a comparison between the two algorithm routines so as to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Strassen algorithm. The rational utilization plan of matrix multiplication algorithms is also discussed. Keywords-algorithms for matrix multiplication; time complexity; Strassen algorithm I. A GENERAL ALGORITHM FOR MATRIX MULTIPLICATION Let A=(aij)m × n be an m × n matrix, and let B=(bij)n × p be an n × p matrix. Given an (m×p) matrix A with r row partitions and s column partitions and a (p×n) matrix with s row partitions and t column partitions that are compatible with the partitions of A, the matrix product C=A×B. generally we can explain the matrix multiplication through the following expression, i.e.,
