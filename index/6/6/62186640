We address the problem of how to intuitive interacts with 3D graphic system by 2D devices, and present a general interactive framework for developing human computer interaction interface for graphical system. We consider the subclass of interaction situations in which 2D devices such as mouse and windows intuitively control scene observation, select and manipulate 3D object. Based above, an object-oriented software architecture is presented to construct the virtual world, OpenGL is used to render and control 3D graphic scene and Visual C++ 6.0 platform and Windows system are combined to build the underlying structure of the software. First, compare to OpenGL select mechanism, a novel select mechanism is presented. Second, with common 2D devices, we introduced an intuitive and precise mechanism for scene observation and object manipulation. Experimental examples prove that our interactive technology is feasible and practical.
