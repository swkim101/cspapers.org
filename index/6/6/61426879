SEAMS is the leading international forum for presenting and discussing novel ideas, innovations, trends and experiences in engineering software with self-managing and self-adaptation features. These key features enable software systems to adapt at run-time so they can cope with uncertainty. This uncertainty may be due to changes in their operational environment, variability of resources, new user needs, intrusions, and faults. 
 
Solutions to complementing software systems with self-managing and self-adaptive capabilities have been proposed by researchers in many different areas, including software architecture, fault-tolerant computing, robotics, control systems, programming languages, run-time program analysis and verification, and biologically-inspired computing. This symposium focuses on software engineering aspects, covering methods, techniques, and tools that support the design and runtime operation of self-adaptive, self-protecting, self-healing, self-optimizing, and self-configuring software systems. 
 
The symposium's objective is to bring together researchers and practitioners from many of the diverse areas that have an interest in adaptive software to investigate, discuss, and examine thoroughly the fundamental principles, state of the art, and critical challenges of self-adaptive and self-managing systems.
