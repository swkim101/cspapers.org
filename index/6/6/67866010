Runestone Interactive is an open-source ebook platform designed to create and publish interactive computer science textbooks. (See http://runestoneinteractive.org). Runestone ebooks support programming in the browser, code visualizations, and a wide variety of practice activities, from multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions to Parsons Problems (drag-and-drop mixed-up code). Free textbooks have been created for CS1, CS2, and Advanced Placement (AP) CS. The presenters have several years of experience creating and using Runestone ebooks. Several studies have demonstrated good usability and positive learning and attitude impacts on students using these ebooks. Runestone ebooks can be customizable to meet the needs of individual courses and teachers. Over 20,000 people a day use Runestone ebooks. The goal of this workshop is to introduce computer science teachers (both secondary and post-secondary) to Runestone ebooks. This hands-on session will start by leading participants through use of the ebooks as if they were students. Participants will try each of the interactive features. They will also create a custom course from an existing ebook, use the instructor dashboard to review student activity, modify the course, and grade students. Participants will create their own assignments using existing active learning components. They will also be shown how to create new material for assignments, such as multiple-choice questions for a quiz. Laptop Required.
