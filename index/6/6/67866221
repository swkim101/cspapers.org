Traditionally, students are introduced to programming oriented courses by covering a series of topics and having a programming project due at the end of each topic. Assigned projects are often not connected to each other, but are rather used to expose students to a variety programming constructs and concepts. Students take the most direct approach such as trial and error to complete these projects. While this scenario utilizes projects, it approaches the use of projects as a means to assess learning rather than a means for learning. In this poster, we present results from a project-based online course in object-oriented analysis and design. We present a model for structuring project modules that provide opportunities for students to prepare, design, implement and reflect on each project module. By providing multiple points for feedback and reflection, as well as assigning projects with visual components, the course aims to promote engagement of undergraduate students, while at the same time maintaining rigor. Preliminary results from this course are encouraging, and could potentially become a model for project based learning.
