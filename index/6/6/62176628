In this paper, Finite Element technique is adopted to ta ke the numerical simulation of mining machine cutter's thermal spraying process. First, a FE model of flat particle is built to analyze the temperature distribution during the process of flat particle's heat exchange with base metal. Then, in order to simulate the temperature distribution and stress field variation with time as the molten drops deposit and solidify on base metal, the indirect coupling method, which loads previous results of temperature field on the model, is used to calculate the stress distribution in flat particle. Based on LS-DYNA module, the stress and strain distributions of spraying particle in the process of collision, deposition and deformation are analyzed, and the contour maps of stress or strain and energy curves in the collision process are obtained. Accordingly, the effect of preheating temperature of base metal on stress distributions is analyzed further. The results of this study not only provide theoretical support for the deposition and forming technique of plasma drop, but also offer a new research tool for studying spraying temperature, velocity and the optimization of coating interface.
