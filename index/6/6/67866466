Students in non-CS STEM majors often have specific difficulties with programming content in their coursework. Instructor feedback is usually limited to the results obtained and major algorithmic errors, due to the nature of coding assignments. The authors' aim is to investigate whether presenting code and receiving feedback from their peers in class makes an appreciable difference in non-CS STEM-major students' learning of programming. The poster will present data collected over two semesters from five sections of three programming-heavy chemistry, engineering and math courses taught at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. Student groups were asked to present their homework attempts to the class, their peers were asked to fill out surveys containing Yes/No questions and comments on the attempts, and this feedback was passed on to the presenting students, who were then given time to improve their work before submitting their final versions. Comparison of student performance statistics in exams, between semesters during which the study was implemented and prior semesters, is used as a tool to assess student learning. Results of the study from two semesters have shown that group composition and the type of questions asked in the survey are the two major factors at play. The poster will also discuss the enhanced design of the study during the third and final semester in spring 2019 that will take these results into account. DOI: http://doi.org/10.1145/3287324.3293820
