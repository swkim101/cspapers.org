Internships play a crucial role in helping CS undergraduate students to commit to CS degrees and computing careers. Internships also promote students' personal and professional growth. Studies have also shown that pursuing an internship is positively correlated with an improved chance of getting a full-time job offer and a higher starting salary. However, previous research has shown that only 52.1% of undergraduate students pursue an internship before they graduate. In this poster, we present findings from a cross-sectional study focused on understanding the characteristics of CS undergraduate students who have interned at one or more companies and those who have not interned. We surveyed 97 and interviewed 14 CS undergraduates. We found that 41.2% of 97 students participated in one or more internships. The key characteristics that distinguish students who successfully interned and those who did not were: 1) 95% students who interned had career goals - either to join industry or pursue graduate school after they graduate. In contrast, 21% of the students who did not intern were unsure or confused about their career goals; 2) students who interned were more likely to have participated in an undergraduate research experience or a student organization; 3) students who interned intentionally prepared for interviews, while those who did not intern were not actively preparing, not confident enough to apply, or were unsuccessful in the interview process because of lack of preparation. This poster provides insight into CS students' competitiveness for securing internships and for developing programs to support professional development.
