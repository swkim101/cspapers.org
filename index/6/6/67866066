Many great teaching techniques are presented every year at SIGCSE and other CS education conferences. Unfortunately, most of them achieve very limited adoption, with few instructors incorporating these ideas into their classrooms. There is significant literature on how to encourage instructors to adopt educational innovations in other STEM fields, but the CS education community has made only limited strides in this area. This session will feature an interactive discussion of some of the barriers that prevent the adoption of good ideas, what solutions are available, and a brief presentation of the results of an ITiCSE working group on this topic. Attendees will leave the session better equipped to promote the adoption of educational innovations, either their own or ones that they have decided to champion.
