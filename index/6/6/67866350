As more children are exposed to computer science and programming, numerous indicators have been proposed to evaluate programming learning. Because these indicators are not divided by step in a learning goal, learner's growth cannot be evaluated in detail. Our research focuses on resolving this issue in the field of programming. Herein we propose a rubric to measure the progress of programming learning for elementary school students. This rubric, which is comprised of indices, aims to evaluate learning achievement of logical skills such as logical thinking and problem solving using a unified learning goal. Furthermore, this rubric consists of 30 evaluation items in 8 categories. Then we investigate whether this rubric can be adapted to existing workshops of programming learning. The workshops occurred in 2016 and 2017. in addition, A total of 101 students between 6 and 12 years old participated in the workshops. The rubric successfully evaluates programming learning workshops as it provides a unified evaluation that covers common learning objectives in existing indicators.
