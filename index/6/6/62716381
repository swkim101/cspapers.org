In this paper, the effect of surface-active elements especially sulfur on weld pool shape has been reported. In our contribution, we analyze the influence of the weld pool chemical composition (Mn, Si, â€¦), welding energy, sulphur gradient and electromagnetic effect.The computed results are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental results, indicating the validity of the modeling approach.
