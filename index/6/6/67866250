The integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) in STEM classes has been promoted as one strategy to engage all students in CS education. This approach aims to reduce inequities in access to computing education by placing CS within compulsory science classes. The Project GUTS CS in Science curriculum supports the integration of CT-rich computer modeling and simulation activities and has been promoted to serve the dual goals of exposing students to CS in a powerful context while simultaneously promoting students' understanding of modern scientific practices. This case study follows two middle school science teachers as they implement the curriculum that integrates CS within science classrooms through the use, modification, and creation of computer models of scientific phenomena. Their implementation stories represent the range of enactments from "use-only" in which computer models are used to demonstrate the behavior of a system, to "modify/create" in which teachers support students in the using, decoding and modifying computer models that are used as experimental test beds. These cases illuminate teacher characteristics and pedagogical decisions that impact enactment of the curriculum. Evidence is provided that teacher's belief in student capabilities is a factor correlated with enactment, and that has the potential to impact students' opportunities to learn. This finding suggests that addressing CS/CT skill building, content knowledge, and pedagogy within teacher professional development (PD) programs may be necessary but not sufficient to lead to enactment of CT-rich curricula and may inform others seeking to integrate CS in K-12 education.
