Our research group has studied how Kindergarteners through second graders can be introduced to the ideas of Computational Thinking (CT) through engineer design, unplugged, and programming activities. We often found it difficult to explain the boundaries and clear definitions for CT in research, to students and their teachers. Literature provides a variety of definitions from various perspectives, but these definitions often seem like capturing smoke. We see evidence CT, indicating fire, but how hot or lasting it burns cannot be measured by smoke alone. CT is typically defined by siloed concepts and skills. Some silos describe concrete ideas, which tend to be tied to programming principles. Many describe essential ideas, but over generalized becoming hard to teach and measure and distinguish from other types of problem solving. Is there a middle ground where we can clearly observe the presence and growing maturing of CT yet not limit the ways it can manifest, particularly without requiring coding? We hope this poster inspires conversation on 1.) the intersection of CT and programming skills, 2.) the priority and order for learning those skills, and 3.) how we can promote CT in disciplines who interact with and help define computational solutions yet are never expected to learn to program. We hope to share our perspective as well as garner feedback and possibly collaboration on better refining curriculum within Computer Science as well as promoting CT in other disciplines.
