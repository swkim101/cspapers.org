There is no such thing as a standard document. Bibliographic information comes in a wide variety of formats. Existing retrieval systems handle different document styles either by creating an artificial document type or by providing different and independent data bases. Neither approach seems satisfactory. In this paper we describe a data model which we feel is more appropriate for document representation and show it can handle the multiple document type problem quite naturally.
