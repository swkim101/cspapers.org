In this work we focus on the task mapping problem for many-core real-time systems. The growing number of cores connected by a Network-on-Chip (NoC) calls for sophisticated mapping techniques to meet the growing demands of real-time applications. Hardware should be used in an efficient way such that unnecessary resource usage is avoided. Because of the NP-hardness of the problem, heuristic and meta-heuristic techniques are used to find good solutions. We further consider periodic communication between tasks and we focus on a static mapping solution.
