It is suggested new method of knowledge representation based on system analysis.The cornerstone of this method is the application of Zwicky morphological boxes to the representation of alternative processes. This gives the ability to save the information not only about existent and famous process nets but to synthesize absolutely new technologies including high technologies.According to this method the object description of the system is the result of process description and vice versa the object description can form a base to the process description of any system. This method was discussed in Russian scientific literature and practically unknown in the West countries. The areas of applications are Data-bases, Expert Systems, Computer Aided System Engineering (CASE), Computer Aided Design (CAD), Object-Oriented Programming and education in that areas. The author teachs approriate course at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.
