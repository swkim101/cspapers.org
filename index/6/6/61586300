This paper describes the design and implementation of NAOS, an active rule component in the object-oriented database system 02. The contribution of this work is related to two main aspects. The first concerns the integration of the rule concept within the 02 model, providing a way to structure applications. Rules are part of a schema and do not belong to a class. Program execution and data manipulation, including method calls, can be driven on rules. The second aspect concerns the way NAOS interacts with the kernel of the 02 system. To support a reactive capability the object manager semantics has been extended, thus providing an efficient event detection. Applications produce events and the subscribed event types react to these events. As a result, rules are triggered.
