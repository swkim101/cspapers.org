The underrepresentation of women and minorities in the field of computer science is well documented. Due to this lack of representation, efforts to broaden participation in computing abound. One manner with which to do this is through the development of culturally relevant curricula. Education literature encourages the use of culturally relevant techniques and topics to teach school content through the knowledge of diverse groups as well as teach about culturally diverse populations. In addition, partnering with the students who will learn with the curriculum is encouraged in order to co-develop ideas and learn more about students' interests and experiences. This poster describes the outcomes from a series of participatory design sessions with a diverse group of stakeholders (students, teachers, parents, and administrators) to design an intermediate computing curriculum for 5th - 7th grade students. Specifically, we examine the topics developed by the participants that are being utilized as themes for curricular units. Preliminary analysis shows that participants of all ages brainstormed and utilized themes related to both cultural heritage and contemporary culture, but more focus was placed on youth culture and pop culture topics. The poster will describe the design methods used during the participatory design sessions as well as the themes developed and an overall analysis of the categories from which the themes are drawn.
