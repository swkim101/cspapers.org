In the signal combining system of deep space network, the estimation error of time-delay between signals will reduce the effectiveness. The time-delay alignment technique based on combined output signal as the reference (CC-SUMPLE algorithm) makes use of the mutual information offered by multi-antenna and improves the alignment performance. However, it only takes ordinary cross-correlation into consideration rather than the cyclostationary of digital communication signal during calculating time-delay in the iterative process. As to this problem, this paper proposes multi-antenna signal time-delay alignment algorithm based on cyclostationary of communication signal (MCCC-SUMPLE algorithm) which reconstructs the combined reference signal and takes advantage of multi-cycle frequencies. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm will improve the estimation accuracy and time-delay alignment performance compared with CC-SUMPLE algorithm.
