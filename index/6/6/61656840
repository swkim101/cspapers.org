The present paper aims at providing experimental validation for the use of the MORET 5 code for advanced concepts of reactor involving thorium and heavy water. It therefore constitutes an opportunity to test and improve the thermal-scattering data of heavy water and also to test the recent implementation of probability tables in the MORET 5 code.
