As K-12 computer science (CS) education initiatives scale throughout the U.S., researchers seek to understand the context-specific relationships between CS instruction and student learning. Evaluation of instruction requires valid measures of curriculum implementation. We have developed measures for identifying conditions for successful implementation of an introductory high school computer science curriculum along two-dimensions: teaching quality and curriculum enactment. Additionally, we have defined three types of instructional strategies for teaching quality. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 53 teachers through surveys and interviews. Data were aggregated and integrated to derive scaled measures for the instructional strategies and curriculum adaptation, and implementation measures were correlated with student end-of-unit assessment data. We found potential factors that can enhance or impede the successful implementation of CS curriculum materials, and we have identified several broad issues associated with scaling up CS curricular implementation.
