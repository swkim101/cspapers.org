With the development of internet, we usually hope to recommender the possible interested products to the consumers through analyzing to the consumers history records, and obtain better sale records in fruits marketing system. collaborative filtering algorithm is widely used in Fruits Recommendation System, and item-based KNN collaborative filtering algorithm completes clustering and recommendation through analyzing the similarity of the items. Traditional item-based KNN collaborative filtering algorithm could not deal with huge scale fruits sale data effectively to complete recommendation work. In this paper, for the large scale data, we propose a distributed item-based KNN collaborative filtering algorithm based on MapReduce cloud computing platform. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a high speed-up, and a good expansibility.
