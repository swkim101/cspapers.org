The selection of a cost-minimizing combination of hardware and network components that satisfy requirements is a complex design problem with multiple degrees of freedom. Decisions must be made on how to distribute the computing load onto multiple computers and where to locate computers. This paper provides an overall methodology for combining hardware and network design in a single cost-minimization problem for multi-site computer systems. Costs are minimized by applying a heuristic optimization approach to a sound decomposition of the problem. Verifications consider several test cases with different computing and communication requirements. Cost reductions are evaluated by comparing the cost of methodological results with those of architectural solutions obtained by applying professional design guidelines.
