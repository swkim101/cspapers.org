Source code documentation is an important part of teaching students how to be effective programmers. But what evidence do we have to support what good documentation looks like? This study utilizes a randomized controlled trial to experimentally compare several different types of documentation, including traditional comments, self-documenting naming, and an automatic documentation generator. The results of this experiment show that the relationship between documentation and source code understanding is more complex than simply "more is better," and poorly documented code may even lead to a more correct understanding of the source code.
