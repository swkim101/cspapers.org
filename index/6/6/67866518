In computer science (CS) classes it is common to give students a large ill-defined problem and let them struggle with it. The mess of the problem forces students to identify knowledge needed to solve the problem and to learn problem-solving skills. This is the concept behind problem-based learning (PBL), a learner-centered pedagogy that has become a popular research topic in computer science. PBL in CS has 3 defining characteristics: 1) presenting students with large authentic projects, 2) enabling students to independently learn necessary concepts, and 3) enabling them to learn while working in groups. An examination of the CS PBL/project-based learning (PrBL) literature reveals that step 2, self-directed or self-regulated learning (SRL), is lacking in almost every description of PBL. However, extensive CS research literature explores effective methods of SRL, and these methods revolve around the concept of reflection. We therefore propose a new structure for PBL/PrBL that we term messy learning that explicitly incorporates large, ill-defined, authentic projects and reflective activities. We also describe our experience with using messy learning in a game development course and present some examples of how to apply messy learning.
