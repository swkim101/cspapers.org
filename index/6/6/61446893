In this paper, a fault-tolerant framework for load-balancing system is proposed. Load Balancing is widely used in the market, however, they usually cannot recover the unfinished jobs under stateful protocol such as TCP. In the practical situations, duplicating servers are commonly used to handle this problem, but the cost of the system and maintenance for those systems are expensive. In the proposed framework, we solve the problem with a contention method. Servers are grouped together and share the information of clients' connections and monitor others servers in their group. When a server in a group does not response the other members, they will elect one server to take over the job of it and the whole process is totally transparent to the user.
