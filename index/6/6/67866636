Computer science universities and colleges around the nation are experiencing large growth in enrollments. To maintain in-person interaction with students, large courses typically include multiple recitations, each led by a Teaching Assistant (TA). Students in each group struggle with various course content, and these weaknesses are best evaluated by the TAs working closely with the students. TAs, however, have only a superficial understanding of education theory, and instructors must closely monitor and evaluate the content of recitations. Existing instruction management systems can be used to organize course-wide content, but, to our knowledge, none of them operate at the granularity of recitations. This poster presents Dynamic Recitation, an open-source platform through which TAs and instructors can create and share practice problems and lesson plans tagged with the learning objectives that they cover. The poster illustrates the interface offered to the TAs for creating problems, designing lesson plans for individual sections, and submitting feedback about student progress. It shows examples of lesson plans created in the system, as well as reports that can be used to identify elements that promote desired learning objectives and refine recitations.
