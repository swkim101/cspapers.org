This paper presents a method to hide information in audio. The proposed method modifies at most one bit in a segment containing 256 samples to hide eight bits of the secret message. To increase the security of the proposed scheme, we use permutation to scramble the secret message before hiding. Experimental results show that the inserted message is inaudible and the proposed method is suitable for hiding data in audio.
