This paper presents a new multi-scale place recognition system inspired by the recent discovery of overlapping, multi-scale spatial maps stored in the rodent brain. By training a set of Support Vector Machines to recognize places at varying levels of spatial specificity, we are able to validate spatially specific place recognition hypotheses against broader place recognition hypotheses without sacrificing localization accuracy. We evaluate the system in a range of experiments using cameras mounted on a motorbike and a human in two different environments. At 100% precision, the multiscale approach results in a 56% average improvement in recall rate across both datasets. We analyse the results and then discuss future work that may lead to improvements in both robotic mapping and our understanding of sensory processing and encoding in the mammalian brain.
