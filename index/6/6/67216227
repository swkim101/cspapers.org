With the development of the air transport industry, air traffic flow increased significantly, conflict detection becomes an important part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). This paper is proposed a probabilistic conflict detection algorithm based on the 4D trajectory prediction. The relative distance of two aircraft can be represented by a Gaussian random variable and the problem of conflict probability calculation is express as tail probability of the quadratic form of Gaussian random variables, and solved by saddlepoint approximation. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated through a pairwise aircraft encounter scenario.With the development of the air transport industry, air traffic flow increased significantly, conflict detection becomes an important part of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).
