Massive enterprise data one-stop search system and method based on grid network is introduced in this paper. This paper presents the general metadata description model of heterogeneous data resource, the metadata extraction method of data resource, the service encapsulation method and registration publication mechanism of data resource, in order to standard the sharing process of large amounts of heterogeneous data resource. And then, the implement mechanism of data collection and index construction for huge amounts of data resource is given in the paper, by designing the optimized algorithm based on the map-reduce mechanism. Finally, the one-stop search mechanism is given in the paper in order to realize the data sharing and effective user of resources. All kinds of models or methods introduced in this paper, which could effectively handle the problem of data sharing and utilization brought by heterogeneous structures, enormous quantity, dispersive locations and complex contents of enterprise data under the environment of grid, are mainly used to build up unified cloud search framework of enterprise data.
