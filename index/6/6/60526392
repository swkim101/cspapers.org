This thesis combines the extraction of geometric characteristics and the neural network, which supplies a method that can define the operating conditions relatively accurately through the diagram feature parameter of the rod pumping system pump and avoids setting up and solving complex nonlinear dynamic equation while also achieving the automatic diagnosis functions of the malfunctions of oil wells. According to the analysis of the error results, we identify the accuracy and effectiveness of this model. Besides, we test the neural network which we have just set up by using the real-time data, and the test results indicate the validity of the method in this thesis.
