Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a form of computational modeling whereby a phenomenon is modeled in terms of agents and their interactions. By looking at scientific phenomenon using ABMs, students can learn to understand the micro interactions that are responsible for so many of the seemingly complex systems in the world around them. In addition, by integrating CT skills into science classrooms, we can simultaneously broaden participation in computing, provide a more authentic scientific experience for learners, and encourage deeper scientific content learning. In this hands-on workshop, we introduce participants to two parallel agent-based modeling environments: NetTango (Olson & Horn, 2011), a blocks-based language, and NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999), a text-based language. The workshop will focus on contextualizing agent-based modeling activities within high school STEM classrooms, allowing participants to explore how computer science can be integrated into existing high school STEM curricula. Over the course of the workshop, participants will gain first-hand experience with ABM and how to design ABM activities in classrooms using NetTango and NetLogo. In addition, the workshop will feature open discussions in which participants will discuss the learning trajectories and affordances of the different programming modalities, brainstorm models that could be built for student exploration, and design activities that incorporate both scientific and computer science content for existing curricula.
