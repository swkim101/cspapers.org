Over 700 distinct indigenous communities form today’s Indonesia. Their historical coming together was built upon five strategic principles, known as Pancasila. The Pancasila are collectively represented by the phrase and goal ‘Unity in Diversity’. Indonesia’s Ministry of Education directs teachers to create learning opportunities to develop a national character so that students learn how to live lives that characterize unity in diversity. Over the decades, the education system has encountered complex political influences and increased impacts of globalization. Unfortunately, a by-product of these encounters has been development of a false dichotomy: traditional cooperative values central to community daily living, relegated to personal arenas, and isolated practice evident in professional arenas. This study describes a workshop undertaken in Subang District of West Java, Indonesia, aimed to revitalize traditional cooperative values, as the basis for a professional learning community. Research promotes the engagement of various stakeholders in professional dialogue therefore the interaction of teachers, teacher educators (from Indonesia’s Education University), and the district governance was facilitated, at the workshop. Traditional community cooperation, commonly known as ‘gotong royong’ was explored for application to professional cooperation. Exploration included mentoring, transparency, and application of cooperative values within workshop activities. The teachers interacted as a community to initiate response to community identified educational problems. The teachers’ reflections describe that these grassroots interactions, focused on professional cooperation, combined with administrative support would be beneficial in developing national character, in and through education. Keywords, professional cooperation, gotong royong, teacher agency.
