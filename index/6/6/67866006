We share approaches for coordinating the use of many online educational tools within a CS2 course, including an eTextbook, automated grading system, programming practice website, diagramming tool, and debugger. These work with other commonly used tools such as a response system, forum, version control system, and our learning management system. We describe a number of approaches to deal with the potential negative effects of adopting so many tools. To improve student success we scaffold tool use by staging the addition of tools and by introducing individual tools in phases, we test tool assignments before student use, and we adapt tool use based on student feedback and performance. We streamline course management by consulting mentors who have used the tools before, starting small with room to grow, and choosing tools that simplify student account and grade management across multiple tools.
