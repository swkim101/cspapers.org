Traditionally, students learn about software testing during intermediate or advanced computing courses. However, it is widely advocated that testing should be addressed beginning in introductory programming courses. In this context, testing practices can help students think more critically while working on programming assignments. At the same time, students can develop testing skills throughout the computing curriculum. Considering this scenario, we conducted a systematic mapping of the literature about software testing in introductory programming courses, resulting in 293 selected papers. We mapped the papers to categories with respect to their investigated topic (curriculum, teaching methods, programming assignments, programming process, tools, program/test quality, concept understanding, and students' perceptions and behaviors) and evaluation method (literature review, exploratory study, descriptive/persuasive study, survey, qualitative study, experimental and experience report). We also identified the benefits and drawbacks of this teaching approach, as pointed out in the selected papers. The goal is to provide an overview of research performed in the area, highlighting gaps that should be further investigated.
