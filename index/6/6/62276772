The main target of this paper is to propose an algorithm to implement data hiding in DNA sequences to increase the confidentiality and complexity by using software point of view in cloud computing environments. By utilizing some interesting features of DNA sequences, the implementation of a data hiding is applied in cloud. The algorithm which has been proposed here is based on binary coding and complementary pair rules. Therefore, DNA reference sequence is chosen and a secret data M is hidden into it as well. As result of applying some steps, M'" is come out to upload to cloud environments. The process of identifying and extracting the original data M, hidden in DNA reference sequence begins once clients decide to use data. Furthermore, security issues are demonstrated to inspect the complexity of the algorithm. In addition, providing better privacy as well as ensure data availability, can be achieved by dividing the user's data block into data pieces and distributing them among the available SPs in such a way that no less than a threshold number of SPs can take part in successful retrieval of the whole data block. In this paper, we propose a secured cost-effective multi-cloud storage (SCMCS) model in cloud computing which holds an economical distribution of data among the available SPs in the market, to provide customers with data availability as well as secure storage.
