Media computation provides a context within which computation can more easily be learned, allowing students to be creative while learning fundamental programming building blocks (like sequencing, iteration, selection, and two-dimensional arrays). Focusing on images, students can alter a picture's appearance by selectively changing its pixels. By combining different images, students can create collages. Creativity and success in CS1 have been studied. The effect media computation and an art show might have on student satisfaction and persistence, and promotion of the department is less understood. We articulate our experiences from five years of implementing media computation in CS1, with a strong focus on an accompanying public art show held to showcase the best student work produced each semester. We implemented the art show with a goal of raising visibility of our department within the university, and to highlight the ability to be creative in a CS degree program, with the hope of attracting students. It also allows our students to showcase their work to their peers and others, while motivating them to be creative and engaged. We briefly describe how we implement media computation within CS1 and describe in full detail how we conduct the public art show. Specifics about the student image collage project that is entered into the art show, the selection process, judging, show production, and promotion are provided. We describe how things have evolved over the ten shows spread over five years to provide perspective for others considering implementation of a similar experience for their students.
