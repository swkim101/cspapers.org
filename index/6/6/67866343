At Wentworth Institute of Technology, we have advocated Externally-collaborative, Project-based, Interdisciplinary Curricula (EPIC) learning for years. EPIC learning provides opportunities for the students from different majors to work together on interdisciplinary projects, which have been proved interesting, useful and influential to the students' future career, either academia or industry. In 2016, we reported the success of applying mobile application development to biomedical education for creating a mobile health system for the students. To extend this success, we spent one year designing and teaching a new research-oriented interdisciplinary EPIC course for guiding undergraduate students to conduct research projects in biomedical field. In this talk, I will summarize our learning from this process, including (1) Why is it more difficult to teach a research-oriented EPIC course than a regular course for undergraduate students from different majors? (2) How to conquer some difficulties found in this process? (3) How to design suitable lectures and laboratory assignments to facilitate research collaboration? (4) How to motivate the undergraduate students to work on research projects? Although three out of six student teams' research work were accepted at a research conference, we believe there is a space to improve this process for this kind of research-oriented EPIC course in the future.
