Describes an updating system (UPDATA) for distributed data. UPDATA is part of the software developed for a local/tandem telephone exchange (TROPICO-RA) for up to 50000 subscribers. TROPICO-RA has a multiprocessor, distributed architecture based on Intels 80286 and 8088 processors. UPDATA was developed to update distributed data, control its consistency and supply the system with a standard way of manipulating data. UPDATA has a centralized part, called table controller responsible for all the updating operations and error recovery. It also has a distributed part which acts a slave, called main memory controller, responsible for updating data in the main memory. This distributed part is present in every program which has 'copies' of data centralized in the hard disk. >
