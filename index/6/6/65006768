Extensive research has been done to improve the comfort properties of protective clothing system worn by fire fighters. In this research, new inner-layer construction has been developed with high liquid and vapor absorption capacity that could assist in retaining the moisture and vapor away from the skin, and in addition, provide a dry microclimate close to the skin. These new inter layers were tested for mechanical and thermo-physiological properties, such as thermal and water vapor resistance. The results indicated that it is possible to improve the comfort properties of the protective clothing by the incorporation of super absorbent materials into the internal layer. However, tensile and tear strength of the final product was reduced significantly. Further investigation is required to optimize the SAF content into the inner layer fabric.
