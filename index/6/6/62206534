RayXpert has been developed to ease the access to the power and accuracy of the 3D Monte Carlo method in the field of gamma dose rate estimate. Optimization methods have been implemented to address dose calculation behind thick 3D structures. At the same time, the engineering interface makes all the preprocessing tasks (modeling, material settings,â€¦) faster using predefined tables and push button features.
