An actual gas mixer features that a single gas outlet pressure will be raised if the mixed gas output flow is smaller than the single gas output flow when mixing takes place, and if it is raised to the operating limit of flow regulator, some part of the total flow of mixed gas output will be decreased, and the flow will be decreased from the smallest input pressure among gas elements of the mixed gas. This feature causes errors in mixing proportion.
