With approximately 37,000 students entering college with an Advanced Placement CS Principles credit, students, parents, and teachers are wondering how that AP credit "counts" in college. In this panel, we will share perspectives from the College Board and higher education institutions of various pathways from CS Principles to a major in CS. While over 500 institutions have indicated they have credit and placement policies for CSP, they may vary quite a bit. (Credit gives students units of credit on their college record while placement means the AP credit can meet a particular course requirement.) For example, some institutions offer credit only, while others allow the course to count as part of a general education program, as a major elective, or even require CSP in the major. Panelists will share institutional context and reasoning behind their policies. Audience members will have a better understanding of the breadth of credit and placement options and considerations for their own institution.
