In Ad Hoc network, AODV routing protocol is an on-demand routing protocol of relative maturity and extensive application. Due to the fact that AODV routing protocol doesnâ€™t consider the residual energy and the load situation of the nodes when choosing routes, its efficiency declines sharply in the case of the high load and fast moving velocity. To solve the above problems, we propose an improved protocol Advanced-AODV (Ad-AODV) of AODV routing algorithm based on a strategy of energy model and load balancing. When Ad-AODV routing protocol performs the routing request, it will consider the residual energy and the load situation of the nodes. According to the simulation results, the Ad-AODV routing protocol improves the efficiency of Ad Hoc network, and the packet delivery ratio, lowers the average end-to-end delay and reduces the routing load.
