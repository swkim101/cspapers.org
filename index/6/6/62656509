This paper designed a high speed small target frequency multiplication detection system based on laser scanner LMS511. Use a mirror reasonable structure layout to achieve the frequency multiplication of a certain distance scanning area scanning frequency, to improve the detection probability of the high speed moving target. Through Labview human-computer interaction interface to control laser scanner, as well as the signal feature extraction, the strobe and date storage, to achieve the real-time detection and show of the moving target.
