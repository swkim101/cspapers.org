There is a lack of hands-on exercises in cryptanalysis offered at the university level for a variety of reasons. One reason is the high amount of computations needed to complete cryptanalysis attacks. However, enabling students to perform fixed prefix SHA-1 collision attacks on PDFs does not require any advanced computation power. This paper presents a hands-on exercise for university students and professionals to generate SHA-1 collisions. The exercise shows how SHA-1 is vulnerable to fixed-prefix collisions, and how students are able to leverage existing tools to create their own SHA-1 collisions between arbitrary PDF files. In our two classroom runs of the exercise, over 90% of the students who performed the exercise found it to be a useful tool to reinforce their knowledge of SHA-1 collisions. The exercise increases awareness about hash collisions and urges caution when dealing with digitally signed PDFs that utilize SHA-1 as their hashing mechanism. To our knowledge, this is the first exercise designed to introduce practical SHA-1 collisions for students in the classroom.
