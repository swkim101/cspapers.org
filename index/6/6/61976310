Probabilistic analysis and design of large-scale structures requires repeated finite-element analyses of large models, and each analysis is expensive. This paper presents a methodology for probabilistic analysis and reliability-based design optimization of large-scale structures that consists of two re-analysis methods, one for estimating the deterministic vibratory response and another for estimating the probability of the response exceeding a certain level. The deterministic re-analysis method can analyze efficiently large-scale finite-element models consisting of tens or hundreds of thousand degrees of freedom and design variables that vary in a wide range. The probabilistic re-analysis method calculates very efficiently the system reliability for different probability distributions of the random variables by performing a single Monte Carlo simulation of one design. The methodology is demonstrated on probabilistic vibration analysis and reliability-based design optimization of a realistic vehicle model. It is shown that the computational cost of the proposed re-analysis method for a single reliability analysis is about 1/20 of the cost of the same analysis using MSC/NASTRAN. Moreover, the probabilistic re-analysis approach enables a designer to perform reliability-based design optimization of the vehicle at a cost almost equal to that of a single reliability analysis. Without using the probabilistic re-analysis approach, it would be impractical to perform reliability-based design optimization of the vehicle.
