Firstly, we introduced the development of cloth simulation in recent years. Based on physical model of cloth simulation, we established the simulation system with a simplified mass-spring model. The computational efficiency is increased with this model. A modified implicit method was proposed in this paper. This method produces plausible animation, and it is easy to be realized with a stable and good real-time performance. The paper adopted AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) bounding volume approach for the detection of cloth collision, it obtains an excellent real-time effect of cloth simulation.
