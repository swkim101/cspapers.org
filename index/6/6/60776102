It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Fifth International Workshop on Cloud Data Management (CloudDB 2013). This year we continue our tradition of serving as a premier forum for researchers and practitioners to present research results and share ideas and progress in the area of data management within cloud computing infrastructure. This broad area includes work in distributed storage, parallel algorithms, data mining, serving and analytic workloads, privacy, security, green computing, social workloads, and many others. 
 
The call for papers attracted a wide range of submissions. The program committee accepted 4 papers on a variety of topics. In addition, the program includes a keynote speaker, Krishna Gade, from Twitter, speaking on Realtime Analytics at Twitter, a highly interesting topic for Cloud DB research. We hope these proceedings will serve as a valuable resource to learn about the latest and most exciting work in cloud computing. 
 
We hope that you will find this program interesting and thought provoking and that the symposium will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.
