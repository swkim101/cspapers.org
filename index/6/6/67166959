It is a pleasure to welcome you to the First Workshop on Virtualized Infrastructure Systems and Architectures. We believe virtualization of the infrastructure is an important and exciting trend that would enable lot of innovations and will bring significant efficiencies to help scale ever growing computing, storage, and communication infrastructures. We are happy to provide a forum for a discussion of technical issues and results in this new area of research. 
 
We hope that this workshop is a stepping stone to a bigger and established forum for the exchange of ideas and results in infrastructure virtualization among participants from academia and industry leading to a very fruitful partnership with all its benefits.
