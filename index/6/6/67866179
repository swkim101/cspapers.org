Computing often makes headlines for negative social impacts such as data breaches, algorithmic bias, and cyber warfare. The many ways that computing can create social good are similarly powerful but seem to get much less attention. This BoF will explore ways to incorporate the positive potential of computing for social good in undergraduate courses. The organizers are especially interested in active learning approaches where students can experience first-hand the positive social impact of computing. The discussion will allow faculty who have included computing for social good in their courses to exchange ideas and share their experiences. Faculty who are interested in this area but have not yet tried it in their courses are encouraged to join the discussion.
