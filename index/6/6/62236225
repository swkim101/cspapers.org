A method is presented to accurate face-mating point cloud registration after dealing with noise point. Point cloud registration is divided into two parts,firstly,coarse registration is applied for visual point cloud,then three local sufaces of overlap cloud region are selected to be mating calculated after denosing base on least squares fitting , at last accurate splicing parameters of translation and rotation are acquired by nonlinear least square .This algorithm is easy to deal with the denosing, has faster convergence speed and higher registration accuracy.Its feasibility is proved by samples.
