The representation of women in computer science (CS) is low in the United States and has been declining over the past few decades. Prior research has demonstrated that educators play an important role in increasing gender diversity. Not much, however, is known about their views regarding gender diversity in CS. Educators are often isolated as the only ones teaching CS in their schools, with limited opportunity to converse with each other about the underrepresentation of women in CS and other issues facing the field. Thus, to better understand educators rq questions and concerns about gender diversity, we conducted a qualitative exploratory study within an online discussion forum, Stack Exchange for CS educators. The conversations gave us insights into gender diversity issues that the forum members were interested in, such as enrollment, retention, and roles of teachers. We also analyzed the lenses through which the forum members spoke about gender representation. Results from this study suggest that researchers need to continue to examine educator perceptions so that we can design appropriate online teacher communities, teacher education courses, and professional development workshops to address equity and gender diversity issues in CS.
