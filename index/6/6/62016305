Complexity will be the science of the 21st Century. Chaotic theory as a part of complexity science gave Chaotic Logistic Population Model it describes the relation of predator-prey in a common resource. But the model cannot be used under the non-chaotic condition. So this paper will focus on the design of a new formula, which can be employed under both chaotic and non-chaotic condition. However, it only is the result of tentative and theoretic exploration and needs to be studied further, especially used in actual works and cases.
