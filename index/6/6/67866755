This lightning talk describes our experience using Discord as a platform for online tutoring at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) for the past two and a half semesters. Discord is a free online chat system that is accessible via a web browser, computer program, or mobile app. It competes with apps including Skype, Slack, and TeamSpeak. We initially pitched Discord to our students as a way to deliver online tutoring. However, once a critical mass of students joined the system they began to use it for socializing, finding study partners, and other community-building activities. Utilization has been much higher than other online communication tools we have implemented in the past. With approximately 250 majors there are currently 261 users subscribed to our server with users actively posting messages every day. Students have reported positive experiences with the platform. To further facilitate tutoring in the future we are developing a bot and web tools into the platform to make it easier to share and run snippets of code.
