We welcome you to the 7th ACM Annual International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications and Services -- MobiSys'09. This year's conference program continues the MobiSys tradition of providing a premiere forum for publication of papers that take a broad systems perspective of mobile computing. Papers appearing in this year's conference cover a range of topics from sensor and wireless systems to applications and services. Continuing the tradition of past conferences, this year's conference is preceded by a day of workshops and a PhD forum. Bruce Tuch is delivering the keynote speech this year, addressing the business and technology successes and failures that lead to product acceptance. The demonstration and poster chair, Rajesh Krishna Balan, has put together an exciting session that exhibits the best of the current work in our field. 
 
MobiSys'09 received 128 submissions, up 4% from the previous two years. The papers were reviewed in two rounds. Each paper received at least three reviews during the first round. Based on these reviews, 63 papers were selected to be reviewed in the second round, with each paper receiving two additional reviews. All told, our diligent reviewers produced 714 reviews, with the vast majority of these coming from PC members. We discussed 51 papers at an all-day PC meeting, which followed the HotMobile workshop in Santa Cruz, CA. At the meeting, 26 papers were accepted to appear in the conference program. All accepted papers were shepherded by a PC member.
