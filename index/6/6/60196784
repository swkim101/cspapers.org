The aim of this project is to develop software called Algorithm Translation Package. The main purpose of this package is to automatically convert users' edited algorithm code in Malay Language into C source code. This package also reduces the users' time consumption to translate the algorithm code into C source code manually. Besides, user also have the opportunity to learn the C programming language through the package output because the C source code is generated automatically from the algorithm code. Moreover, details of each step taken to solve the problem, which is designed by the user, can also be included in the source code. This paper will also look at the project design. Generally, this package is designed using the Object-Oriented Software Development Life Cycle. Concept compilers like syntax analysis, semantic analysis and lexical analysis are also applied in order to detect any errors associated with the algorithm coding. The package features a user friendly and easy to understand interface. This Algorithm Translation Package has many advantages and is expected to benefit the C Language programmers especially students that are new to C programming.
