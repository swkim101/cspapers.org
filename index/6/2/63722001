The WWW'14 tutorial on Concept-Level Sentiment Analysis aims to provide its participants means to efficiently design models, techniques, tools, and services for concept-level sentiment analysis and their commercial realizations. The tutorial draws on insights resulting from the recent IEEE Intelligent Systems special issues on Concept-Level Opinion and Sentiment Analysis and the IEEE CIM special issue on Computational Intelligence for Natural Language Processing. The tutorial includes a hands-on session to illustrate how to build a concept-level opinion-mining engine step-by-step, from semantic parsing to concept-level reasoning.
