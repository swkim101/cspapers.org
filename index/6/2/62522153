The capabilities and physics model implemented inside the FLUKA code are briefly described, with emphasis on hadronic interaction. Examples of the performances of the code are presented including basic (thin target) and complex benchmarks, and radiation detector specific applications. In particular the ability of FLUKA in describing existing calorimeter performances and in predicting those of future ones, as well as the use of the code for neutron and mixed field radiation detectors will be demonstrated with several examples.
