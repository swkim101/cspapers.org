In this paper we examine the entropy-based SDI metric (SDIe) presented by Olague et al. [1] This metric was developed to aid in the analysis of object-oriented software evolution within the environment of highly iterative development such as the agile methodology.

[2] Because of the dynamic quality of the agile framework, there is a need to reveal stability information for the benefit of management as well as for the development team guidance. Here we validate the SDIe metric over several different packages developed using an agile method
