In recent years, wireless sensor network have been used in many application such as disaster reservation, agriculture, environmental observation and forecasting .Coverage preservation and energy consumption are two most important issues in wireless sensor networks. To increase the network lifetime, we propose an energy efficient coverage aware routing protocol for wireless sensor network for randomly deployed sensor nodes. Some of the routing protocol is based on energy efficiency and some are based on coverage aware. The proposed routing protocol is based on both the issues i.e. coverage and energy, in which we first find the k-mean i.e. the degree of coverage, so that we can use this in the selection of cluster heads in wireless sensor network by using Genetic Algorithm for increasing network lifetime and coverage. For cluster head selection each node evaluates its k-mean and energy by internal function which used as fitness function in genetic algorithm. The proposed algorithm “Implementation of energy efficient coverage aware routing protocol for Wireless Sensor Network” is designed for homogeneous wireless sensor network. Simulations results show that proposed algorithm increases the network lifetime by reduce the energy consumption and preserve coverage. Simulation is done with MATLAB and a comparison of algorithm with benchmark algorithms is also performed.
