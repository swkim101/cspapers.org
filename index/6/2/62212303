The kinematics performance comparison of a family of 3-RPS parallel mechanisms affected by limb arrangement has been studied in this paper. Firstly, arrangement parameters of single RPS limb are identified. Based on these parameters, variant configurations of 3-RPS parallel mechanisms are enumerated. Then, the inverse kinematic problems of these different mechanisms are solved, and the kinematic performance comparison of these mechanisms is carried out. Simulation results illustrate that limb arrangement has a great influence upon kinematic performance for the 3-RPS parallel mechanisms.
