A hybrid Monte Carlo and deterministic methodology has been developed for application to active interrogation systems. The methodology consists of four steps: i) determination of neutron flux distribution due to neutron source transport and subcritical multiplication; ii) generation of gamma source distribution from (n, γ ) interactions; iii) determination of gamma current at a detector window; iv) detection of gammas by the detector. This paper discusses the theory and results of the first three steps for the case of a cargo container with a sphere of HEU in third-density water. In the first step, a response-function formulation has been developed to calculate the subcritical multiplication and neutron flux distribution. Response coefficients are pre-calculated using the MCNP5 Monte Carlo code. The second step uses the calculated neutron flux distribution and Bugle-96 (n, γ ) cross sections to find the resulting gamma source distribution. Finally, in the third step the gamma source distribution is coupled with a pre-calculated adjoint function to determine the gamma flux at a detector window. A code, AIMS (Active Interrogation for Monitoring Special-Nuclear-materials), has been written to output the gamma current for an source-detector assembly scanning across the cargo using the pre-calculated values and takes significantly less time than a reference MCNP5 calculation.
