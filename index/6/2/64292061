It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Second International Workshop on Mobile Cloud Computing and Services -- MCS'11. This year's workshop continues the tradition of the previous year's workshop of being a highly interactive venue for mobile-computing research. MCS's mission is to provide a forum for discussing the impact of cloud computing on mobile computing through presentations of new ideas, preliminary research results, and experience reports. 
 
The call for papers attracted 7 submissions from Europe and North America. The program committee accepted 5 papers that cover a variety of topics, including app privacy and energy efficiency. The program also includes two invited talks: one by Michael Kozuch from Intel Labs on testbed infrastructures for the cloud, and one by Romit Roy Choudhury from Duke University on developing mobile applications.
