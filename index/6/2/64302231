RAD is an approach to systems development that necessitates careful management; it may mean large scale cultural changes for an organisation, since it requires the empowerment of developers to make critical decisions. Development of high levels of interpersonal and cooperative working skills are essential to successful facilitation and implementation. This paper evaluates the introduction of this evolutionary approach on an undergraduate modular degree scheme. It considers the key concepts of RAD and reports on the students' response to the joint application development approach together with their ability to cope with backtracking. It discusses the students' reaction to focusing on the delivery of business functionality at the time of cut over, both as a measure of quality and course evaluation. It concludes that cultural changes may be required by an academic institution offering such a course of study and that a careful choice of tool, lecturer and assessment method are necessary prerequisites.
