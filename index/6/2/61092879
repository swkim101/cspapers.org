Microprocessor applications consultants can be faced with the design and development of embedded systems for a diverse range of applications and client requirements. Embedded systems by their nature are hardware specific and indicate a need for dedicated development tools; however a more generalised approach often leads to an overall technically superior and more cost effective solution. The author examines the role of a PC in the design and development of an embedded industrial controller for the high speed application of glue. The PC provided support for: software development, software simulation, mechanical design, circuit design, PCB design, driving test equipment, logging data, and displaying test results. >
