We present a multiple-set overlapping-domain decomposed strategy for parallelizing the Monte Carlo Synthetic Acceleration method. Monte Carlo Synthetic Acceleration methods use the Neumann-Ulam class of Monte Carlo solvers for linear systems to accelerate a fixed-point iteration sequence. Effective parallel algorithms for these methods require the parallelization of the underlying Neumann-Ulam solvers. To do this in a domain decomposed environment, we borrow strategies traditionally implemented in Monte Carlo particle transport to parallelize the problem. The parallel Neumann-Ulam and multiple-set overlapping-domain decomposition algorithms are presented along with parallel scaling data for the resulting implementation using the Titan Cray XK7 machine at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
