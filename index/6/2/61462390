The dynamics of teaching and learning in higher education are being affected by a combination of educational, social, political and economic factors, and one of the most important changes is the extent to which Learning Management Systems (LMS) are forming the basis for online teaching and learning environments. Deakin University has just completed an extensive evaluation of learning management systems (LMS) to select an enterprise level online teaching and learning system. One of the important aspects of this process is that unlike other evaluations which focused on systems comparison, this evaluation was user-centred, taking into account teaching and learning needs to determine the LMS that would best align with those needs. This paper examines the methods and results of this collection of staff and student needs in online teaching and learning.
