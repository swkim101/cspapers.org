Growth in the field of wireless communication technology has captivated the user to make use of it in recent years. The user expects more supporting services to access the best available network which satisfies user preferences and application requirements. To fulfill the requirements of the user, the next generation mobile terminals have multiple interface technologies, which allow data to be received over multiple system bearers with different characteristics. During user mobility, there is a need to have vertical handoff solution to have seamless communication. The main issue is how to select the best available network to meet requirements of user, network and application during handoff. This paper proposes an algorithm TSVHOA for Vertical Handoff decision to select the best quality network technology based on the traffic type using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). Also, the algorithm is simulated with respect to different network technologies like WiFi, WiMAX and WCDMA to select the best one. (6 pages)
