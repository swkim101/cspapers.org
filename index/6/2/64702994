The increasing cost of aging population and dependency is an unquestionable and worrying trend. But the constant progress of information technologies also provides real opportunities to improve the healthcare and assistance of dependent people. In this context, this article proposes an original proactive solution for home monitoring, by applying classification methods to this new field of study. Existing home automation and multimedia services are used as built-in sensors for the analysis of user habits; assisted living services are then proposed to the user. Firstly, an original clustering procedure is performed for activity recognition to offer self-adapting scenarios to user capabilities, based on a non-supervised classification method. A dynamic adaptation follows to adapt to the changes of user habits. The simulation show that it can help to improve user autonomy while facilitating their uses of daily services.
