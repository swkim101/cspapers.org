In this paper, an issue of the Bayer pattern color filter array (CFA) demosaicking method is explained. As most digital cameras capture only one color components at each spatial position, the rest components must be restored by interpolation approach. Therefore, our goal is to propose an algorithm to restore each color component with satisfactory subjective performance while consuming minimal computational complexity.
