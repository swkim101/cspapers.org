Selecting a configuration for a machine tool that will best suit the needs of a forecast set of requirements can be a difficulty and costly exercise. This problem can now be addressed using an integrated virtual validation system. The system includes kinematic/dynamic analysis, kinetostatic model, CAD module, FEM module, CAM module, optimization module and visual environment for simulation and collision detection of the machining and deburring. It is an integration of the parallel kinematic machines (PKM) design, analysis, optimization and simulation. In this paper, the integrated virtual system is described in a detail, a prototype of a 3-dof PKM is modeled, analyzed, optimized and remote controlled with the proposed system. Some results and simulations are also given. Its effectiveness is shown with the results obtained by NRC-IMTI during the design of the 3-dof NRC PKM.Copyright Â© 2003 by ASME
