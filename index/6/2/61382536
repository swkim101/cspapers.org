Welcome to the 27th ACM International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS), the oldest and longest running conference on high-performance computing. ICS is well known as the premier technical forum where researchers present their latest results and share with colleagues their perspectives on the state-of-the-art in the field in a focused, intimate environment. ICS 2013 continues this strong tradition with an exceptional technical program, thought-provoking keynote addresses, interesting workshops and tutorials, and opportunities for student participation. The conference rotates between the United States and international locations in Europe and Japan. This year ICS is taking place in beautiful Eugene, Oregon, the "Emerald City" of the Willamette Valley and the home of the University of Oregon. It is my pleasure to serve as the General Chair for ICS 2013 and I hope that you will find the meeting to be a rich and rewarding experience.
