Constructing large software systems is not merely a matter of programming, but also a matter of communication and coordination. Problems arise because many people work on a joint project and use each other's programs. This paper presents an integrated development and maintenance system that provides a controlling environment to insure the consistency of a software system at the module interconnection level. It assists the programmers with two facilities: Interface control and version control. Interface control establishes consistent interfaces between software modules and maintains this consistency when changes are made. Version control coordinates the generation and integration of the various versions and configurations. Both facilities derive their information from an overall system description formulated in the module interconnection language INTERCOL. A demonstration system is sketched that runs under the UNIX time-sharing system.
