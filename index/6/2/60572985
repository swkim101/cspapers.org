UbiComp 2008, the Tenth International Conference on Ubiquitous computing, is the premier forum for the presentation of research results in all areas relating to the design, implementation, deployment and evaluation of ubiquitous computing technologies. The conference brings together leading researchers, from a variety of disciplines, perspectives and geographical areas, who have been exploring the implications of computing as it moves beyond the desktop and becomes increasingly interwoven into the fabrics of our lives. 
 
A total of 226 submissions---160 full papers and 66 notes---were evaluated by our international Program Committee, composed of 31 of the leading researchers in the field of ubiquitous computing. Each submission was reviewed by two members of the program committee and two or more external reviewers, and after an online discussion phase 80 papers were chosen for consideration at a 2-day PC meeting. Each of these was evaluated by an additional PC member before the meeting. After this rigorous process, a total of 42 submissions---37 full papers and 5 notes---were accepted for publication in these proceedings, representing an overall acceptance rate of 19%. We are pleased to note that the set of accepted papers constitutes the largest number of papers accepted to a UbiComp conference to date.
