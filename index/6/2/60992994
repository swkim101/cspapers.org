At the business meeting on April 20, 1994 it was voted that SIGARCH adopt this set of guidelines to aid program chairs on matters of policy at SIGARCH sponsored conferences (e.g., ISCA, ASPLOS, and so on). Amendments to the guidelines would be voted on at SIGARCH business meetings. There are several options in these guidelines, so the program chair will report which options were selected in the chair's message that appears in the proceedings. To ensure that the guidelines are part of a tradition that is not forgotten, ACM will include them as part of the conference proceedings of the International Symposium on Computer Architecture (and thereby appear in Computer Architecture News once a year).
