Smart wells can effectivelyimprove the reservoir developing by selectively controlling flow production of the valves. In this work, we proposed an adjoint-based gradient method for the smart well control optimization within the search for optimum smart wells inflow control valves configuration. Numerical study showed that the NPV value can be increased obviously by the optimization. The displacement efficiency can also be improved.
