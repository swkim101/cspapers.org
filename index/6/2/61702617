Construction projects are faced with challenges that cannot be ignored. These projects are becoming more highly competitive, complex, and difficult to manage. They become problems that are difficult to solve using traditional management approaches. The research approach adopted in this study is based upon Soft Systems Methodology (SSM). This approach is suited to problems where there is situational complexity, and is being used increasingly in studies of knowledge and value management in the construction industry. This paper examines the benefits of applying SSM to problems of knowledge management in construction project management, especially those situations that are challenging to understand and difficult to act upon. It includes a case study that examines the tendering process in a bridge construction project where differing worldviews and the failure to draw upon tacit knowledge resulted in a less than satisfactory outcome.
