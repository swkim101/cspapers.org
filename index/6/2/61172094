The aim of this research is to produce large irregular tensegrity structures using a generative design synthesis approach. Unlike most of the form-finding methods, the approach does not require the description of the connectivity of the tensegrity structures to define the shape of the tensegrities. It uses graphs to represent the tensegrity structures, which allows a very fast generation of stable tensegrity solutions for a given design problem. The graph grammar interpreter, GraphSynth, is used to carry out graph transformations, which define different configurations for a given design problem. After generating the graphs, they are transformed into meaningful 3D shapes. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method is checked by solving a variety of test problems.Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME
