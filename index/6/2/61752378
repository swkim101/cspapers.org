We are delighted to introduce the proceedings of the 11th Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, organized under the auspices of SIGDAT, the ACL Special Interest Group for linguistic data and corpus-based approaches to NLP. 
 
This was a wonderfully fruitful year for EMNLP; we received 234 submissions, drawn from every area of language processing. Of these we were able to accept 73 papers (an acceptance rate of 31%), making for an unusually broad and exciting program. 43 of the papers were presented as talks, and 30 as posters.
