IoT technology with the 4.0 revolution in industrial technology promises to change drastically in every aspect of human life. The elderly health care industry is forecasted to grow fastly, providing a more economic and effective method for health monitoring through the utilization of IoT technology. Blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), one of the vital survival parameters, is potentially used in health monitoring on patients, elders and newborns, etc. This study focused on developing a SpO 2 wearable measurement device, which allows the real-time monitoring and prediction of human health via the Internet. In addition to building a complete, low-cost and low-power assumption prototype, the study also focused on introducing different open-source solutions for data collection and display.
