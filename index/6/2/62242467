A design methodology is presented which decreases cycle time and opportunities for error through automated execution of a consistent design procedure. The Product Design Generator (PDG) methodology is useful for existing devices with a well-established design process. Two such examples are given, the Thermomechanical In-plane Microactuator (TIM) and the micro force gauge. In both PDGs, the designer inputs a finite set of requirements which automatically updates parametric design models. The necessary analyses are then executed, and product artifacts such as a CAD file, technical document, and test procedures are generated. The application of this method reduces the opportunities for error by ten times for the TIM PDG and five times for the micro force gauge PDG. The design cycle time is reduced from hours to minutes for both devices.Â© 2003 ASME
