The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of the model development and empirical application for the alleviation of low back pain. This study was estimated to compare changes in the alleviation of low back pain for 4 months in empirical application group (n=146) versus control group(n=146). As a result, first, it verified the significance of health status on the alleviation of subjects' low back pain in the experimental group after intervention as compared to control group(t=2.85, p=.007). Second, the clinical factors after the lapse of 90 days since information intervention were a significantly lower percent in the experimental groups compared to control groups (p<.05). Therefore, information intervention for patients with low back pain was effective in improving pain control and maintaining long- term health status.
