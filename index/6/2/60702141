In this paper, the transient three-dimensional numerical simulations based on the MARS (Multi-interface Advection and Reconstruction Solver) with the non-empirical boiling and condensation model have been conducted for an isolated boiling bubble behavior in a subcooled pool. The temperature distributions formed around the subcooled pool boiling bubble departing from a heating surface obtained by the numerical simulations were investigated. As the results, it was found that several thermal plumes with different temperature were formed during the bubble departure from the heating surface by using the volume rendering visualization technique.
