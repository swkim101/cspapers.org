Many tools and techniques exist for the modeling and analysis of computer and communication systems. These tools are often complex and tailored to a narrow range of problems. The system analysis task often requires coordinated use of multiple tools and techniques which is not supported by currently available systems. The Tangram project goal is to develop an environment which makes a large set of tools and techniques readily accessible and is easily tailored to specialized applications. This system has been prototyped in an object-oriented extension to Prolog. The impact that these two paradigms, logic and objects, have had on the design is discussed. Several example applications are presented to illustrate the extensibility of the system.
