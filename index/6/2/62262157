Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Around 1% of the worldwide population has epilepsy. Approximately 30% of the patients cannot be adequately cured with anti-epileptic drugs. These patients have, so called, refractory epilepsy. Alternatively these patients can be rendered seizure free by removing the epileptogenic focus, i.e. the brain region responsible for causing the epileptic seizures. This implies the need for accurate localization of the epileptogenic focus. During the presurgical evaluation the neurologist identifies the epileptogenic focus through visual inspection of the intracranial electroencephalographic (IEEG) signals.
