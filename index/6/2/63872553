Apache Cassandra is a distributed storage system for managing very large amounts of structured data. Cassandra provides highly available service with no single point of failure. Cassandra aims to run on top of an infrastructure of hundreds of nodes possibly spread across different data centers with small and large components fail continuously. Cassandra manages the persistent state in the face of the failures which drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems. Cassandra does not support a full relational data model because it resembles a database and shares many design and implementation strategies. In this paper, discuss an implementation of Cassandra as Hotel Management System application. Cassandra system was designed to run on cheap commodity hardware. Cassandra provides high write throughput and read efficiency.
