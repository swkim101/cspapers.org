This study presents an optimum disassembly process with genetic algorithms. The disassembly sequence matrix including the interference matrix, the special connection relation and the contact matrix of a product are used to study the disassembly process. The genetic algorithms are utilized for the multi-objective function formed by the instability function, tool change function, disassembly direction function and inconvenient function due to the gravity to obtain the optimum disassembly process. The disassembly processes of a compressor are investigated and improved, and a redesigned compressor is recommended.Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME
