This article proposes a mobile and augmented reality (AR)-based e- learning model as a form of blended learning strategy customized to the learner, which can be deployed in parallel to face-to-face fieldwork learning. To this end, it looks at theoretical characteristics of such an AR learning system as well as its composition and mode of operation. The type and method of implementing the learning contents are divided into lecture-type formal learning and purely self-directed form of informal learning, and the article goes on to explain the methodology and process of designing learning contents according to each type. The article also discusses what educational potentials a mobile AR-based e-learning system has to offer, and looks at realistic ways to systematically link and integrate it with traditional pedagogy.
