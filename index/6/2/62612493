There is much emphasis in Office Information Systems on integration of interfaces, facilities and technologies. In this paper we propose a common framework for viewing data base and message sending systems. An example of facilities is outlined as provided by a prototype office information system implemented at the University of Toronto. Directions for further research are suggested.
