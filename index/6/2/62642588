the processing capacity of a server is unable to satisfy the parallel processing of mass data and also improves data transmission in storage system. This paper has adopted active storage system to transfer calculation task and management ability to data end, improving the parallel processing capability of application program and reducing the data transmission rate in the system. During processing arriving process, this research has complied with Poisson flow, and the service time for each processor is negative exponential distribution and task service rule is the mixing model of “first come, first served”. Through experiment, it is proved that the data transmission rate within MMC system is reduced by 15% than random allocation of task on average and the system speed-up ratio is improved by 2.1 than average.
