It is our great pleasure to welcome you to Indianapolis and the 2013 Dynamic Languages Symposium! This year's symposium -- the 9th in the series -- continues the tradition of communicating research results in the design, implementation, and application of dynamic languages. We are happy to report that the overall quality of this year's submissions was particularly high. Out of a total of 22 submissions, the program committee accepted 9 papers whose topics range from optimization to modularity, language semantics, and security. The program also includes an invited talk by Mario Wolczko on "VMs I Have Known And/Or Loved". Beyond the formal program, we hope this year's DLS will, like its predecessors, be a valuable forum for sharing ideas with other dynamic language researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world. Thank you for being part of this exciting community, and once again, welcome!
