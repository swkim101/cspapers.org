This chapter presents reflections on the experience of doing a study on the design and use of medical devices on an Oncology Ward. It reports on a short study, carried out over 10 days and 4 nights, conducting observations and contextual interviews. The particular issues drawn out in this chapter are: • Finding the research focus—whether to focus on the data we have access to or on the more interesting but infrequent events where we have little data; • The role of “research champions” who can unlock fruitful data; and • The reality and challenges of interacting with patients when shadowing staff.
