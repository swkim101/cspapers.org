In a multi-axis hybrid manufacturing system, it is necessary to utilize a machining process to improve surface accuracy and guarantee overall geometry after the deposition process. Due to the complexity of the multi-axis system, it is necessary to find proper orientations of cutting tools for the CNC machine to finish surface machining. This paper presents an algorithm to find collision-free surface machining toolpath for a given workpiece. The concept of the 2-D visibility map and its properties are discussed. The algorithm to compute the 2-D visibility map is presented. With the help of the 2-D visibility map, an optimal a collision free tool approaching direction can be easily decided. Also the type of the surface machining toolpath for different types of surfaces is decided based on topological information and the machining toolpath (CL data for milling tool). The developed planning scheme has been tested via machine simulations and has shown that it can be effectively applied to cutter-path generation for multi-axis surface machining.Copyright Â© 2003 by ASME
