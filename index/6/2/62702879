This paper is mainly devoted to the proof-of-principle implementation of the SERPENT code for the simulation of traveling wave reactors. The investigation of SERPENT 1.1.19 code for multiprocessor tasks with long burnup steps was performed. The investigation of SERPENT 2 code for multiprocessor tasks with long burnup steps was performed. Methods to remove the influence of the ignition zone were considered, and neutronics simulations with various fragmentations of the burnup zone were performed.
