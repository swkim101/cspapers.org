For more than 10 years now, robotic surgery has gained an increasing acceptance in all the surgical specialties. The interest has grown rapidly and the experience has increased with success, especially for advanced and complex procedures, such as hepatobiliary surgery, cardiac revascularization, valvular replacement, or difficult genitourinary resections for cancer. The new generation of surgeons is faced to this technological (r-) evolution. While it is clear that robotics is called to last in surgery, new challenges have emerged such as the training and the education of the next generation of residents and fellows.
