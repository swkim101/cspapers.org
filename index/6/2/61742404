Everyone would require to have a signature for authorization and other important tasks that needs identification. Thus, signature has become one of a method to represent its writer uniquely. Signature has many hidden features that are difficult to extract. Some of the identified features that a signature should have are slanting, baseline, proportion and size. In this proposed study, slanting is chosen to be identified in a signature. Signatures are captured using a tablet and saved in a digitized format of x and y values. A slant algorithm is created and coded into a functional system. An experiment consisting of 50 signatures are tested and the finding shows the angle and degree of the slant in every signature. The creation of this algorithm would be able to give some degree of contribution in the area of signature recognition.
