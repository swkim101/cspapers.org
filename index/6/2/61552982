Many software development companies utilize metrics to assess and improve performance of their development activities. We also used measurement concept for the same purpose. This paper describes our experience and lessons learned from applying the metrics to our organization. We defined metrics regarding our measurement goal and applied them to our nine projects. From our analysis results, we expect to improve software quality in the long run. We suggested a guideline to decide whether the development work should be more improved. Applying the guideline to the projects and improving them remains as future work.
