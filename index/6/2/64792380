The MISE workshop aims at promoting the use of models in the engineering of software systems. In particular, we are interested in the exchange of innovative technical ideas and experiences related to modeling. Engineers have used models to effectively manage complexity for centuries, and there is a growing body of work on the use of models to manage inherent problem and solution complexity in software development. The use of software models will become more prevalent as methodologies and tools that manipulate models at various levels of abstraction become available. Workshop activities will focus on analyzing successful applications of software-modeling techniques to gain insights into challenging modeling problems, including: (1) identifying, describing, and using appropriate abstractions, (2) supporting incremental, iterative development through the use of appropriate model composition, transformation and other model manipulation operators, and (3) automated analysis of possibly large, possibly incomplete models to determine the presence or absence of desired and undesired properties.
