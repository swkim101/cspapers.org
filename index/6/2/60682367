To accommodate the dual objectives of many engineering applications, one to minimize the mean compliance for the stiffest structure under normal service condition and the other to maximize the strain energy for energy absorption during excessive loadings, topology optimization with a multi-material model is applied to the design of energy absorbing structure in this paper. The effective properties of the three-phase material are derived using a spherical micro-inclusion model. The dual objectives are combined in a ratio formation. Numerical examples from the proposed method are presented and discussed.Copyright Â© 2003 by ASME
