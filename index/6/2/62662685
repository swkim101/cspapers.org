The function of constructive solid geometry is researched and implemented in the Monte Carlo code RMC. In addition, for the computing efficiency in case of reactor assembly and whole-core analysis, RMC introduces two acceleration techniques in repeated and nested geometry processing. Numerical experiment is carried out with two models, the 17x17 Daya-bay PWR assembly and the Daya-bay whole-core. Satisfying results can be obtained with the two acceleration algorithms.
