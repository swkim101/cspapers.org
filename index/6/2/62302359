Deterministic optimum designs that are obtained without consideration of uncertainty could lead to unreliable designs, which call for a reliability approach to design optimization, using a Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO) method. A typical RBDO process iteratively carries out a design optimization in an original random space (X-space) and reliability analysis in an independent and standard normal random space (U-space). This process requires numerous nonlinear mapping between X- and U-spaces for a various probability distributions. Therefore, the nonlinearity of RBDO problem will depend on the type of distribution of random parameters, since a transformation between X- and U-spaces introduces additional nonlinearity to reliability-based performance measures evaluated during the RBDO process. Evaluation of probabilistic constraints in RBDO can be carried out in two different ways: the Reliability Index Approach (RIA) and the Performance Measure Approach (PMA). Different reliability analysis approaches employed in RIA and PMA result in different behaviors of nonlinearity of RIA and PMA in the RBDO process. In this paper, it is shown that RIA becomes much more difficult to solve for non-normally distributed random parameters because of highly nonlinear transformations involved. However, PMA is rather independent of probability distributions because of little involvement of the nonlinear transformation.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
