Welcome to the 1st ACM Asia-Pacific Workshop on Systems-APSys'10, held at New Delhi, India. The main motivation of this workshop is to catalyze computer systems research in the Asia-Pacific region by bringing innovative practitioners and researchers around the world to this region to present their work and exchange ideas on all aspects of systems practice. We are excited to have a strong program with position papers spanning wide range of system topics from security to file systems, from low level operating systems issues to designing robust networked systems, from optimizing resource allocation in the cloud to optimizing performance for mobile settings. 
 
We received 21 papers and all papers were reviewed by at least three program committee members and selected external reviewers. The program committee finally accepted 10 papers after carefully discussing all the papers. These papers represent the international character of systems research with papers from Australia, India, Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, and USA.
