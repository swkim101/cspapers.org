Manufacturing processes for the fabrication of complex geometries involve multi-step processes when using conventional machining techniques with material removal processes. Additive manufacturing processes give leverage for fabricating complex geometric structures compared to conventional machining. The capability to fabricate 3D lattice structures is a key additive manufacturing characteristic. Most conventional additive manufacturing processes involve layer based curing or deposition to produce a three-dimensional model. In this paper, a three-dimensional lattice structure generator for multi-plane fused deposition modeling printing was explored. A toolpath for an input geometric model with an overhang structure was able to be generated. The input geometric model was able to be printed using a six degree of freedom robot arm platform. Experimental results show the achievable capabilities of the 3D lattice structure generator for use with the multi-plane platform.
