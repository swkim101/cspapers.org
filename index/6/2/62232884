In this paper we introduce a robust algorithm to solve the five-attitude spherical Burmester problem associated with exact linkage synthesis. The proposed algorithm solves for the unit vectors determining the four joint centers of the linkage while taking into account all redundant equations available, which enhances the robustness of the algorithm. In order to show the applicability of the proposed algorithm and to validate its robustness, two examples are included.Copyright Â© 2003 by ASME
