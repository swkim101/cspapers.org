This paper outlines a methodology for optimising the multi-domain architecture of a relatively integrated system through an appropriate level of modularisation to maximise societal value created. This method is developed through the application of real options theory and the dependency structure matrix (DSM), and illustrated using a reference example of an industrial gas turbine.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
