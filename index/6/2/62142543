The Intelligent Network (IN) concepts have a very simple objective: to allow innovative telecommunications services to be delivered quickly to end users. While there are several IN systems available today, they are really just a first step towards the overall objective. There are several areas which need to be clarified before full-specification systems can be developed, one of which is service creation (SC). The overall strategy on SC is clear: the best way to speed up software production for services is to encapsulate the capabilities of the network as an extensible set of standard building blocks, from which new services can be created at a high level of abstraction. This can perhaps be likened to the 'fourth generation language' approach to writing database queries. The authors' work on the editing of service logic programs (SLPs), or 'scripts', is targeted at the high-level, user-oriented style of description. This complements the more 'bottom-up' approach of existing analyses such as the CCITT work on service independent building blocks.
