Modelling Filament Winding technological process, means describe through mathematical equations the phenomena occur during the process. Usually, mass balance, force balance and energy balance equations are required, e.g. Springer. The strongly non linear character of the resulting system may be reduced by de coupling some of the phenomena and related variables, into sub models. The goal is the development of relationships between thermo chemical properties of resin-fibre systems, as well as the control of process parameters like, winding angle and tension, winding speed, heating rate, cure temperature, time, e.t.c. In particular, the following variables must be described as function of time and radial position: mandrel's artd composite's temperature, degree of cure of the resin and its viscosity, fibre position and tension, stress and strain on the mandrel and composite cylinder, mechanical properties of the final composite part. In order to achieve this goal, different sub models have been developed. On the basis of the theoretical models, a numerical code has been implemented in order to evaluate and compare the theoretical-numerical results with experimental data obtained during the monitored filament winding manufacturing of Carbon-Epoxy composite tubes, e.g. Brite EuRam Project.
