The objective of the paper is to propose a design for safety model in automotive software architecture focusing the context awareness features, user actions and unexpected reaction from the environment. The safety aspect in the design and development of automotive software is considered in the system level and also in the detailed software component level. The safety feature proposed in the work is achieved through a V-W software development model and a context-action-reaction safety logic is used which is satisfied using sequent calculus. The hierarchical object oriented design (HOOD) methodology is adopted in the architecture of safe software. The safety due to functionality and behavior of the critical modules like airbag control and tire pressure monitoring are considered in the work and implemented through interacting finite state machines (FSM) as per the existing system and software safety standards. The software safety based on the operational context, user actions and the system reactions in the automotive applications are considered.
