To solve the problems of consumersâ€™ security and privacy, a new RFID authentication method based on the elliptic curve is proposed. Comparing with other asymmetric cryptography, this method has stronger security, shorter key length, less computation. This scheme makes the reader and the writer being able to complete the certification process for the reader through interact with the protocol of label. Moreover, this scheme can provide anti-replay and privacy-preserving protection for tags. Keywords-elliptic curve; authentication; RFID
