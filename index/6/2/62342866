The vibration system contain 3 main parts; the frequency convertor, the driving motor and the vibrating platform. The frequency convertor allows signal input and give a specific current out to the motor. The motor’s shaft can be connected to the vibrating platform by gears as the medium of transmitting power. With the rotation of the cam, the platform will accelerate/decelerate in sine wave form up to the stated frequency as it will hurt both the machine and subject if it accelerate/ decelerate too rapid. The vibrator can generate a sine wave form peakto-peak stroke of 10 mm. In order to support up to 130 kg, the vibrator’s platform is connected to a 4 kW, 960 rpm motor with the gear ratio of 1/1.54. The motor chosen was a 4 kW, with 960 rpm. A pair of gear with 1/1.54 gear ratio was linked to the motor shaft to reduce the angular speed and increase the resulting torque and power. The vibration unit can operate at nine frequencies from 1.6 Hz to 10 Hz [1]. In the vibration unit, the lowest frequency chosen is 1.6 Hz The motor required rpm=1.6×60×1.54=147.84 rpm
