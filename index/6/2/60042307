The present invention is directed to non-hygroscopic, water-soluble sugar compositions which are prepared by grinding together in a dry, solid state, a white sugar component and a "pulverizing aid" in the form of a water-soluble maltodextrin having a measurable dextrose equivalent value not substantially above 20, said "pulverizing aid" being employed in amounts ranging from about 5 to about 20% by weight of said total composition, the resulting product having an average particle size such that 95% by weight of the composition passes through a 325 mesh, said composition being further characterized as having a ratio of weight average particle size to number average particle size of less than 2. The compositions are free-flowing powders useful in preparing icings, buttercreams and fudges.
