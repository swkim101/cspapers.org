This article describes an object-oriented environment with an associated user interface, AMK, for modelling simple Newtonian particle mechanics. It is intended for educational use, and provides a framework for modelling which generalises methodology. Physical objects are treated as logical objects, and mathematical models are formulated by linking them. The implementation is within the Windows environment using Mathematica and Visual Basic. Modelling is done by constructing objects and linking them to produce new objects. The aim is to produce an equation of motion object. The interface forces the user into a modelling cycle of constructing and linking objects, and accessing their methods. It constructs a Mathematica input automatically from information supplied by the user, and communicates with Mathematica. The combination of a generalised environment plus interface produces correct answers when modelling many specific physical systems.
