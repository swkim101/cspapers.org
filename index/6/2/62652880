For search of semantic Web services, a semantic Web services matching results ranking mechanism based on SDMM (semantic distance metric model) is proposed. The calculation of semantic similarity measure can be realized by using this three-dimensional SDMM which is for presenting the semantic relationship of objects defined in ontology, therefore, the semantic Web Service matchmaking results can be ranked in accordance with the semantic similarity measure. The approach based on SDMM significantly improves search accuracy of semantic Web service matchmaking, and enhance users experience of semantic Web services search. By a set of experiments, we demonstrate the benefits and effectiveness of our approach.
