This paper first introduces the 18650 battery, describes the importance of the battery temperature sensor, uses Ansys Workbench finite element simulation software and the mean of the combination of displacement constraint and reaction force, studies the force and the size of the change of new energy vehicle battery temperature sensor in the loading, translation and unloading of the three cases, then make the test to verify its accuracy. At last, the test results are compared with the usual maximum acceleration of the vehicle in driving which verified the sensor of the car will not fall off in the car driving process and work normally.
