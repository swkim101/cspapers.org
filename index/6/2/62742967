An operation betweenness based method to assess overloaded lines is proposed. Based on electrical network theory, firstly the branch current sharing factors are deduced; then the operation betweenness of transmission line is defined; finally, on this basis the overload vulnerability of transmission line is assessed. In the proposed method, the impacts of both topological structure and operation modes of power network on vulnerability are considered for the assessment. The physical meaning of the proposed method is determinate and conforms to actual condition of power system, and this method avoids the defect in the complicated network model that the power flows only flow along the shortest path. The correctness of the proposed assessment method is verified by simulation results of IEEE 39-bus system.
