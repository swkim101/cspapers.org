Summary form only given. Embedded DSPs and CPUs are already commonplace in board-level systems and are becoming increasingly popular on systems-on-silicon. As embedded software grows in size and complexity, real-time operating systems [(RTOSs) are required to manage the embedded processor and ensure real-time response. This tutorial will introduce the attendee to real-time operating systems for embedded computing and their use in the design of embedded software. with both basic principles and advanced practice.
