We discuss the philosophy, history and theory of window functions. Window functions (sometimes called connections) are a means to treat a relational database as a semantic whole, rather than as an arbitrary collection of relations. Simply stated, a window function maps a database state and a relation scheme to a relation over the scheme. Window functions are the basis for all existing universal scheme interfaces. We present an assumption inherent in universal scheme interfaces, the unique role assumption.Window functions have evolved along two paths, giving rise to computational definitions and weak instance definitions. We examine several examples of each type of window function, with special attention to the association-object window function of PIQUE. We then look at properties we feel a reasonable window function should satisfy, notably the containment condition and faithfulness. We also define implicit objects, which are relation schemes that a window function treats in a special manner, and which are useful for describing the behavior of window functions.
