This paper explores the task of automatic strategy detection from event-stream data collected from professional soccer matches. Concretely, we focus on discovering interesting event sequences that lead to an attempt on goal. We describe a data-driven approach for identifying patterns of movement that account for both spatial and temporal information which represent potential strategies.
