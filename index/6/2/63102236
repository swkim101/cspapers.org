This paper presents a parallel finite element method for large-scale analysis of seismic effects on geotechnical systems. A parallel form of the element-by-element modified Jacobi preconditioned conjugate gradient method is used to solve the equation system. An implicit domain decomposition scheme is proposed which divides the finite element domain into sub-domains based directly on element numbering. This obviates a lot of the graphical difficults associated with domain partitioning; at the same time, it enhances automated decomposition and balanced workload distribution. The parallel method is implemented using a message passing programming model on a PC cluster connected with high-speed network. Two numerical examples are carried out to examine the performance of the proposed decomposition scheme. The results shows that, using this parallelization method, it is possible to analyze large-scale geotechnical models, involving 4,000,000 degrees of freedom or more, with a reasonable time span on a PC cluster.
