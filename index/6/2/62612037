Parametric modeling systems are fundamentally changing the design process practiced in the industry today. Practically all commercial CAD systems combine established solid modeling techniques with constraint solving and heuristic algorithms to create, edit and manipulate solid models, while enforcing the requirement that every such solid model must maintain the validity of the prescribed geometric constraints. However, a number of fundamental (open) problems limit the functionality and performance of these parametric modeling systems. For example, the allowable parametric changes are history dependent; the number of parameters describing even relatively simple parts can quickly become prohibitively large, and commercial constraint solvers are limited today to 2-dimensional geometric constraints. Consequently, current parametric modeling systems do not support many practical design situations due to the associated theoretical and computational difficulties, as well as to the considerable organizational obstacles generated by the need to handle large parametric models. This paper investigates the current practices and limitations of parametric solid modeling systems, and explores some alternative approaches that could complement the identified limitations.Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME
