With the advancement of Mobile Computing, mobile applications can be developed and deployed for eGovernance purposes. e-Governance applications have challenges like handling of large volume of data, high number of concurrent users, security and others. In addition, the users in the Governance should be given a choice of the mobile devices they use and so this requires a high portability of the mobile application. So the objective of the paper is to study the portability of eGovernance mobile applications using Phone Gap which is the cross-platform mobile application development. The paper discusses the experiments done in developing such portable applications and shared the findings of the experiments. With the experiments, it is found that PhoneGap can be a good cross platform application development. (6 pages)
