People with common interests connect with each other as a community. Most people rely on electronic community (e-community). However such e-community services require the Internet connection to communicate among the members. With the advancement of mobile technology, it expands the accessibility of such community so called m-community. We have designed and deployed m-community platform known as Flying2U. This paper shares our experience in introducing m-community among university students. The platform allows the students to create their own m-community and communicate via short message services or multimedia message services (SMS/MMS) instantly. It also can notify the location of a private group member if the members are at the same place and time using location based service (LBS) technology which is independent from TELCO. Our experience shows that Flying2U can be benefited by any m-community member who requires instant, cheap and fast communication.
