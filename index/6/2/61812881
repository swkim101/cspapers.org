Several disk scheduling techniques have been suggested. It seems clear that the choice of an algorithm can make a significant difference in computer system performance, but which is best is still an open question. Therefore, the main contribution of the article is the detailed computational experience of three well-known schedulers, to evaluate their performances. The aim of the evaluation is to help those responsible for system operations in assessing the possibilities for improving disk performance. Finally, it is to help to choose the best scheduler suitable for a specific system with its load conditions. >
