According to the poor code quality,low render low efficiency, and limited scalability of virtual human drive mechanism and other problems, 3D rendering engine Open Scene Graph(OSG) has realized the efficient simulation and expression of virtual human action.Firstly, on the basis of the skeletal animation and spherical interpolation algorithm to achieve the virtual human motion animation.Then design the generating methods of the virtual facial expression animation related to the behavior consciousness by using three Bessel interpolation algorithm and based on deformation animation technology.Finally by using the animation technology in the OSG,the synthesis of virtual human motion and expression is realized based on the parameter control.Experience confirms that under the same number of scene nodes, using OSG engine code is more concise, and render faster.
