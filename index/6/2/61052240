Business intelligence (BI) is a broad field related to integrating, storing and analyzing data to help decision-makers in many domains (from actual business fields to administration, health and environment) make better decisions. Front-end analytics methods include reporting, on-line analytical processing (OLAP), and data mining. 
 
With the increasing success of cloud computing, cloud BI "as a service" offerings have sparkled widely, both from cloud start-ups and major BI industry vendors. Beyond porting BI features into the cloud, which already implies numerous issues (e.g., BigData/NoSQL database modeling and storage, data localization, security and privacy, performance, cost and usage models...), this trend also poses new, broader challenges for making data analytics available to small and middle-size enterprises (SMEs), non-governmental organizations, Web communities (e.g., supported by social networks), and even the average citizen; this vision presumably requiring a mixture of both private and open data. 
 
Thus, Cloud Intelligence is not only a current technological and research challenge, but also an important societal stake, since people increasingly demand open data (e.g., the Spanish indignados), which they need to access easily from the Web, to possibly mix them with private data, to analyze them with intelligible on-line tools with advanced collaborative features that enable users to share and re-use BI concepts and analyses in large scale fashion, and to share the results world-wide. 
 
The aim of the Cloud-I workshop (hopefully the first in a long series) is to become an interdisciplinary, regular exchange forum for researchers, industry and practitioners, as well as all potential users of Cloud Intelligence.
