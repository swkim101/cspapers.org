The use of discrete variables in optimal design models offers the opportunity to deal rigorously with an expanded variety of design situations, as opposed to using only continuous variables. However, complexity and solution difficulty increase dramatically and model formulation becomes very important. A particular problem arising from the design of a gear train employing four spur gear pairs is introduced and formulated in several different ways. An interesting aspect of the problem is its exhibition of three different types of discreteness. The problem could serve as a test for a variety of optimization or artificial intelligence techniques. The best known solution is included in this article, while its derivation is given in a sequel article.
