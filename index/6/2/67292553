In this work we integrate a novel capacitive tactile proximity sensor into a 2-jaw-gripper. We show that its capability for a flexible spatial resolution enables closedloop control techniques for preshaping the gripper in 6D to an object. Additionally, we show that the sensor shows good performance in a self- and mutual-capacitive configurations, meaning it can detect conducting as well as non-conducting materials.
