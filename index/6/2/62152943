This work presents a methodology to find the optimal topology of a three-dimensional structure subject to impact loads, using the approach of ground structure. The method uses of the concept of topology optimization as a material allocation problem, which has been successfully used in the past to design structures modeled with shell and solid finite elements in the automotive industry. A simple example is shown to demonstrate the method.Copyright Â© 2004 by ASME
