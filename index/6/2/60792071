This year's meeting is special. First, it the first ACL meeting to be hosted jointly with our North-American chapter, the NAACL. Second, it is also the ACL's 40th anniversary meeting: our association was created 13 June 1962, and its first meeting took place 25-26 August 1963 in Denver.Our field has expanded quite a bit since then, and so have ACL meetings. This year, our main conference program includes some 65 different refereed papers, covering most active research areas in computational linguistics. And our extended program is complementing that with 19 system demonstrations, 4 tutorials, 12 Student Research papers, and no less than 11 different pre- and post-conference workshops presenting a total of about 150 papers.
