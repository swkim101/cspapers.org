Proposes a new hierarchical service control architecture and discusses the implementation of service process control software aimed at achieving service specification independence within an experimental system. The experimental system consists of three subsystems, a network service support point (NSSP), network service control points (NSPs) and service action points (SAPs). The software defined services are mainly provided through the NSSP and NSP software, which are based on compiler/interpreter technologies and a software architecture applied abstract data type (ADT) concept. The NSSP software is the service specification definition software, which contains a service specification language (SSL) compiler. The NSP software is service process control software, which contains an interpreter for service execution instructions and SAP control operations. The SAP has several kinds of network resources, such as audio announcement machines, and audio conference machines. The new hierarchical service control architecture, and the NSP software structure are described and the NSP performance is evaluated.
