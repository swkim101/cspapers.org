It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 17th International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing -- HPDC'08. This year's symposium continues its tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research and experience at the confluence of high performance and distributed computing. 
 
The call for papers attracted 103 submissions from Asia, Canada, Europe, and the United States. The program committee accepted 18 papers (17%) that cover a variety of topics, including virtual machines, data intensive computing, reservations and leasing, security and fault tolerance, and storage and I/O to name a few. In addition, the program includes a panel on Cloud Computing, a hot topics session, poster and demo session, and keynotes by Daniel Reed of Microsoft, Peter Voshal of Amazon, and Andrew Grimshaw of the University of Virginia. The technical program was created by a rigorous review process with 3 or more reviews per paper.
