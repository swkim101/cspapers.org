The dynamic modeling method for parallel robot based on the principle of virtual work and equivalent tree structure is proposed by taking off the platform and the chains as well as degenerating parallel robot into a tree structure, the closed-form solutions for the inverse and forward dynamics models of parallel robot are derived. The method is applied on kinematics and dynamics analysis of a representative 3-RRR spherical parallel robot.
