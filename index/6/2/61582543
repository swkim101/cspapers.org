The workshop program includes oral papers, posters, and invited presentations. For the workshop, we received a total of 40 papers for review. Each of these was assessed by at least two reviewers, with a large majority of papers being assessed by three reviewers; 8 submissions were selected for oral presentation and 6 submissions for poster presentation, an acceptance rate of just around 35% (20% for oral presentation papers). These papers will be accompanied by 3 invited presentations, by Jeffrey Cohn (University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, US); Qiang Ji (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, US), and Alessandro Vinciarelli (IDIAP, Switzerland). The oral presentations, posters, and invited addresses bring together related communities to share the latest findings and ideas and pursue continuing and new collaborations in research on machine analysis of human communicative behavior. Many people helped make this workshop a reality. We are grateful to the efforts of them all. In particular we are grateful to the Program Committee members that completed the reviewing process in very short time allocated for the reviews (the complete list of PC members can be found at the workshop website: http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~maja/cvpr4hb-09.html). We would like to extend special thanks to the CVPRâ€™09 publication chairs, Pat Flynn and Eric Mortensen, for their invaluable help, assistance and support during the organization of our workshop. By papers, location, and content, this promises to be an excellent edition of the CVPR4HB workshop series. The workshop continues to provide a leading forum for cutting-edge research in video-based, audiovisual, and multimodal analysis of human communicative behavior, including affective states, social signals, sign language, and interactive behavior in HCI scenarios. We wish all delegates a most enjoyable and productive workshop.
