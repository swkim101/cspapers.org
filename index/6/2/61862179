In a project implemented by BRV Ltd, it was required to program a robot to insert several different types of components into a PCB. The high number of robot positions requiring maintenance including gripper, feeder and component positions, led to a particular method for handling the positions. The components included axial resistors, cylindrical capacitors, DIL integrated circuits and SIL connectors. The number of component positions per PCB was in excess of 300. The author describes the methods used to configure and keep control of the information required to control a robot for automatic component insertion for PCB assembly. >
