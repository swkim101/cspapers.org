We welcome you to the Workshop on Models in Software Engineering -- MiSE'08. This year's workshop continues the ideas and aims of MiSE'07 -- to promote the use of models in software engineering and to provide a forum for exchange and collaboration between the communities of the MoDELS and ICSE international conferences. The underlying goals of the software-modeling community are to improve the productivity of software developers and to improve the quality of the resulting software products. Models are useful in all phases and activities surrounding software development and deployment. Thus, workshop topics range from requirements modeling, to run-time models, to models for assessing software quality, to the pragmatics of how to manage large collections of models. 
 
This year, we received 30 submissions. Out of these, the program committee accepted 13 papers, for an acceptance rate of 43%. These papers form the basis of workshop sessions, each of which will start with short presentations of 2-3 papers, followed by discussions of issues and research opportunities raised by the papers and by the session topic in general. In addition, there will be a panel on Obstacles to MDE Adoption. 
 
New this year: the final session will be a joint session between MiSE and the ICSE workshop on the Role of Abstraction. This session will allow attendees of both workshops to explore together the role of abstraction in effective modelling.
