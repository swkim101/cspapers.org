Recommender Systems (RS) aim at suggesting to users one or several items in which they might have interest. Following the feedback they receive from the user, these systems have to adapt their model in order to improve future recommendations. The repetition of these steps defines the RS as a sequential process. This sequential aspect raises an exploration-exploitation dilemma, which is surprisingly rarely taken into account for RS without contextual information. In this paper we present an explore-exploit collaborative filtering RS, based on Matrix Factor-ization and Bandits algorithms. Using experiments on artificial and real datasets, we show the importance and practicability of using sequential approaches to perform recommendation. We also study the impact of the model update on both the quality and the computation time of the recommendation procedure.
