The Major Occupation in India is the Agriculture; the people involved in the Agriculture belong to the poor class and category. The people of the farming community are unaware of the new techniques and Agromachines, which would direct the world to greater heights in the field of agriculture. Though the farmers work hard, they are cheated by agents in todayâ€™s market. This serves as a opportunity to solve all the problems that farmers face in the current world. The eAgro crop marketing will serve as a better way for the farmers to sell their products within the country with some mediocre knowledge about using the website. This would provide information to the farmers about current market rate of agro-products, their sale history and profits earned in a sale. This site will also help the farmers to know about the market information and to view agricultural schemes of the Government provided to farmers.
