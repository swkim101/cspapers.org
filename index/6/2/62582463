The BOSS Quattro system (developed by Samtech s.a.) is an open architecture allowing to run various optimisation engines including gradient based methods (SQP, GCMMA, Conlin, MDAQ, ...), DOE and Response Surfaces, and Genetic Algorithms. This system has been used and various optimisation strategies compared for the resolution of non linear optimisation problems including crash worthiness and airbags opening simulation. Thanks to BOSS Quattro open architecture, using neutral or specific drivers so to read information from models, software like MADIMO, Pam Crash, LS-Dyna, but also NASTRAN, SAMCEF and Abaqus can been used in order to model the non linear behaviour of the optimised vehicles. One or several models were used and computation distributed by BOSS parallel architecture on network of workstations. Direct parallel mode can be used, or the tasks distributed on the network through a Task Manager like for example LSF. As a first example, the optimisation of a stiffened box is performed using one (dynamic) then two models (static but elasto-plastic/dynamic). The external software used are NASTRAN and ABAQUS. A second example deals with the optimisation of a Golf crash model using MADIMO to represent a sequence of events including opening of air bags. Mixed optimisation is performed using as design variables : the time to open a given airbag (continuous) or the type of wheel configuration (pure discrete variable). Constraints are related to safety of the passenger (sternum invasion, various criteria related to accelerations).Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
