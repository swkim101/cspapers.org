The use of formal description techniques, in particular standardised, are a prerequisite for transformation of the descriptions into other representations. These can be either a step in the development process or a way to analyse or dimensioning the qualities of the system at an early stage. The paper formulates a general (independent of description technique) methodology for performance analysis at an early stage. It is pointed out that as a side effect it is possible to do functional analysis in a real time model as well. The author presents some results in transforming SDL system specifications into SDL descriptions describing the original SDL system from a performance viewpoint. SDL (specification and description language) has been standardised by CCITT as a suitable description technique for telecommunication systems. The methodology is independent of description technique, and SDL has only been chosen as a suitable example based on experience and available tools. >
