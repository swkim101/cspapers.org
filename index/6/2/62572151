Robot operating system (ROS) is designed to promote code sharing and enable the development of open-source robotics commons. Sharing code will help the robotics community to progress faster by letting the researchers in the community replicate and extend the results of other research groups. ROS makes it easy to find the software and integrate it into robot systems. This article discusses about how sharing is facilitated by ros.org Web site. ROS contains the software stacks for everything, from building blocks such as controllers and filters to applications. ROS is making it possible for researchers around the world to work together to advance robotics.
