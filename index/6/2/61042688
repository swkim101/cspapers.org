A new visual notation is proposed for precisely expressing constraints on object-oriented models, as an alternative to mathematical logic notation used in methods such as Syntropy and Catalysis. The notation is potentially intuitive, expressive, integrates well with existing visual notations, and has a clear and unambiguous semantics. It is reminiscent of informal diagrams used by mathematicians for illustrating relations, and borrows much from Venn diagrams. It may be viewed as a generalization of instance diagrams.
