Boiler system has the characteristics of high complexity, strong simultaneity, multiple measuring points, multiple faults, and the traditional fault diagnosis method can not meet the requirements. A fault diagnosis model based on fuzzy neural network is built by the combination of fuzzy logic technology and the improved BP neural network algorithm. The model is used to fault diagnosis and it can better solve the ambiguity, simultaneity and correlation of the boiler fault.Through analyzing the fault example of high temperature superheater damage, and the diagnosis results of the application of the model are verified that they are consistent with the actual operation conditions.
