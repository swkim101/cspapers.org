This paper presents MobileSwap, a cross-device memory swapping scheme for mobile devices. It exploits the unbalanced utilization of memory resources across devices. MobileSwap achieves comparable-to-local swapping performance based on existing network infrastructure. This is realized by two novel approaches: resource dedicated swapping for fast swapping among devices and app aware swapping for network connectivity considerations. MobileSwap is implemented and deployed on real mobile devices. Experimental results show that MobileSwap can enhance app caching capability by 2x compared with no swapping, and improve performance by 2.3x compared with state-of-the-art remote swapping. More importantly, local swapping induced read-write conflicts are largely removed.
