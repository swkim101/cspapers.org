As more robots are being deployed into human environments, a human-aware navigation planner needs to handle multiple contexts that occur in indoor and outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose a tunable human-aware robot navigation planner that can handle a variety of human-robot contexts. We present the architecture of the system and discuss the features along with some implementation details. Then we present a detailed analysis of various simulated human-robot contexts using the proposed planner. Further, we show that our system performs better when compared with an exiting human-aware planner in various contexts. Finally, we show the results in a real-world scenario after deploying our system on a real robot.
