AnthroFace is a rib fracture data collection and analysis web application. Currently researchers at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) are manually collecting data using .csv files and do not have it in a centralized location. The purpose of this software is to provide researchers an efficient way to collect and record relevant data and make meaningful interpretations from the dataset. The main features of AnthroFace can broadly be placed into three categories, a quality user interface system to efficiently collect and record relevant data, a database to store collected information, and tools to help the user make meaningful interpretations from the dataset.
