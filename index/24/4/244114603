We study the complexity of proving that a sparse random regular graph on an
odd number of vertices does not have a perfect matching, and related problems
involving each vertex being matched some pre-specified number of times. We show
that this requires proofs of degree $\Omega(n / \log n)$ in the Polynomial
Calculus (over fields of characteristic $\ne 2$) and Sum-of-Squares proof
systems, and exponential size in the bounded-depth Frege proof system. This
resolves a question by Razborov asking whether the Lov\'asz-Schrijver proof
system requires $n^\delta$ rounds to refute these formulas for some $\delta >
0$. The results are obtained by a worst-case to average-case reduction of these
formulas relying on a topological embedding theorem which may be of independent
interest.
