In this paper, we address the problem of finding a correspondence, or matching, between the functions of two programs in binary form, which is one of the most common task in binary diffing. We introduce a new formulation of this problem as a particular instance of a graph edit problem over the call graphs of the programs. In this formulation, the quality of a mapping is evaluated simultaneously with respect to both function content and call graph similarities. We show that this formulation is equivalent to a network alignment problem. We propose a solving strategy for this problem based on max-product belief propagation. Finally, we implement a prototype of our method, called QBinDiff, and propose an extensive evaluation which shows that our approach outperforms state of the art diffing tools.
