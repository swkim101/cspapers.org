Face identification (FI) is ubiquitous and drives many high-stake decisions made by the law enforcement. A common FI approach compares two images by taking the cosine similarity between their image embeddings. Yet, such approach suffers from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to new types of images (e.g., when a query face is masked, cropped or rotated) not included in the training set or the gallery. Here, we propose a re-ranking approach that compares two faces using the Earth Mover's Distance on the deep, spatial features of image patches. Our extra comparison stage explicitly examines image similarity at a fine-grained level (e.g., eyes to eyes) and is more robust to OOD perturbations and occlusions than traditional FI. Interestingly, without finetuning feature extractors, our method consistently improves the accuracy on all tested OOD queries: masked, cropped, rotated, and adversarial while obtaining similar results on in-distribution images.
