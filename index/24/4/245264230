This paper describes a gain scheduled estimation method for an induction motor’s rotor flux. The gain scheduled structure is different in that it does not necessitate operating point linearization. Over, state space transformation is used to convert the motor dynamics into a linear parameter varying form. Due to the extreme dependence of stator resistance and rotational speed, that are considered as time varying parameters, the current equations in the stator reference can be presented as an LPV method. The robust quadratic stability and robust quadratic efficiency can be guaranteed across the reference trajectory of the varying parameters using the LMI based gain scheduled observer with H-infinity synthesis and polytopic formulation. The simulation results have verified the control system’s accuracy.
