Monocular 3D object detection has attracted great attention for its advantages in simplicity and cost. Due to the ill-posed 2D to 3D mapping essence from the monocular imaging process, monocular 3D object detection suffers from inaccurate depth estimation and thus has poor 3D detection results. To alleviate this problem, we propose to introduce the ground plane as a prior in the monocular 3d object detection. The ground plane prior serves as an additional geometric condition to the ill-posed mapping and an extra source in depth estimation. In this way, we can get a more accurate depth estimation from the ground. Meanwhile, to take full advantage of the ground plane prior, we propose a depth-align training strategy and a precise two-stage depth inference method tailored for the ground plane prior. It is worth noting that the introduced ground plane prior requires no extra data sources like LiDAR, stereo images, and depth information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method could achieve state-of-the-art results compared with other methods while maintaining a very fast speed.
