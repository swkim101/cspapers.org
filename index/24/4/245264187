In this paper, we propose micROS.BT, an event-driven behavior tree (BT) framework aiming at supporting swarm-robot coordination. Compared with other BT frame-works, micROS.BT implements the event-driven way under the multi-thread mode, which can effectively save computing resources. Moreover, in order to ensure swarm-robot coordination, we optimize the implementation of the traditional blackboard and propose the multi-mode blackboard, which supports inner-tree, inter-tree, and inter-robot data sharing. Furthermore, considering the limited modularity of a single tree, micROS.BT realizes a mechanism called hierarchical tree management which involves inter-tree notifying and waiting functionalities, while ensuring that each tree is independent and self-scheduled. The effectiveness of micROS.BT is verified by simulation and real-robot experiments for different system settings, showing that a substantial improvement is achieved in comparison with the traditional BT implementations.
