In the discrete-time structure, the paper presents a distributed fault detection approach for large plantwide systems. The dynamics of distributed structures of residual filter units and fault detection robustness are formulated through extended linear matrix inequalities on Hâˆž norm principle, guaranteing sensitivity, asymptotic stability of the filter units and distributed fault detection strategy. The proposed approach is illustrated by a numerical example to assess the feasibility of the technique.
