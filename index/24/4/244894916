In this work, we devote to address the challenging problem of scene parsing. It is well known that pixels in an image are highly correlated with each other, especially those from the same semantic region, while treating pixels independently fails to take advantage of such correlations. In this work, we treat each respective region in an image as a whole, and capture the structure topology as well as the affinity among different regions. To this end, we first divide the entire feature maps to different regions and extract respective global features from them. Next, we construct a directed graph whose nodes are regional features, and the bi-directional edges connecting every two nodes are the affinities between the regional features they represent. After that, we transfer the affinity-aware nodes in the directed graph back to corresponding regions of the image, which helps to model the region dependencies and mitigate unrealistic results. In addition, to further boost the correlation among pixels, we propose a region-level loss that evaluates all pixels in a region as a whole and motivates the network to learn the exclusive regional feature per class. With the proposed approach, we achieves new state-of-the-art segmentation results on PASCAL-Context, ADE20K, and COCO-Stuff consistently.
