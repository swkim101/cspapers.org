As dynamically-typed languages grow in popularity, especially among beginning programmers, there is an increased need to pinpoint their defects. Localization for novice bugs can be ambiguous: not all locations formally implicated are equally useful for beginners. We propose a scalable fault localization approach for dynamic languages that is helpful for debugging and generalizes to handle a wide variety of errors commonly faced by novice programmers. We base our approach on a combination of static, dynamic, and contextual features, guided by machine learning. We evaluate on over 980,000 diverse real user interactions across four years from the popular PythonTutor.com website, which is used both in classes and by non-traditional learners. We find that our approach is scalable, general, and quite accurate: up to 77% of these historical novice users would have been helped by our top-three responses, compared to 45% for the default interpreter. We also conducted a human study: participants preferred our approach to the baseline ($p = 0.018)$, and found it additionally useful for bugs meriting multiple edits.
