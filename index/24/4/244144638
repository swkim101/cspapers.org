With the development of information technology, VPN technology has been widely applied in many fields because it can be set up at a lower cost when compared to other security technologies. For this reason, VPN technology has been integrated on most platforms, such as computers, mobile devices, or routers. In VPN technologies, SSL-VPN, IPsec, Wireguard are considered as the three most popular ones today. This paper focuses on evaluating the performances of these VPN technologies integrated into the operating system for routers. After examining the throughput of these VPN technologies, as a simple and efficient technology, Wireguard is suitable for operating systems in routers. To do the experiment, our routers named as BK-Router were designed and built by ourselves in this work.
