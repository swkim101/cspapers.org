This paper presents a novel parametric curve-based method for lane detection in RGB images. Unlike state-of-the-art segmentation-based and point detection-based methods that typically require heuristics to either decode predictions or formulate a large sum of anchors, the curve-based methods can learn holistic lane representations naturally. To handle the optimization difficulties of existing poly-nomial curve methods, we propose to exploit the parametric BÃ©zier curve due to its ease of computation, stability, and high freedom degrees of transformations. In addition, we propose the deformable convolution-based feature flip fusion, for exploiting the symmetry properties of lanes in driving scenes. The proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the popular LLAMAS benchmark. It also achieves favorable accuracy on the TuSimple and CULane datasets, while retaining both low latency (>150 FPS) and small model size (<10M). Our method can serve as a new baseline, to shed the light on the parametric curves modeling for lane detection. Codes of our model and PytorchAutoDrive: a unified framework for self-driving perception, are available at: https://github.com/voldemortX/pytorch-auto-drive.
