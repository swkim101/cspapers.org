Research in biomechanics hypothesizes that human motion is optimal with respect to an unknown cost function that varies depending on the action and/or task. This unknown cost function is often approximated as the weighted sum of a set of features or basis cost functions. As a person performs a sequence of actions, the weights associated to each of these basis functions are likely to vary over time. Given a human demonstration and the corresponding cost weight trajectory recovered via inverse optimal control (IOC), this paper proposes an optimal control (OC) method that can generate robot motion based on human movement using time-varying cost function weights. By using time-varying weights, the proposed optimal control method can handle changing optimization criteria without segmentation. The method is evaluated both in simulation and with recorded human data. Using human demonstration data, we demonstrate the reproduction of pick-and-place motions with an average end-effector error at the pick place location within 0.82 cm, which is significantly lower than the average trajectory error, indicating that the approach correctly prioritizes reaching the pick and place locations without manual segmentation.
