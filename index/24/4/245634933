Autonomous vehicles use 3D sensors for perception. Cooperative perception enables vehicles to share sensor readings with each other to improve safety. Prior work in cooperative perception scales poorly even with infrastructure support. AUTOCAST1 enables scalable infrastructure-less cooperative perception using direct vehicle-to-vehicle communication. It carefully determines which objects to share based on positional relationships between traffic participants, and the time evolution of their trajectories. It coordinates vehicles and optimally schedules transmissions in a distributed fashion. Extensive evaluation results under different scenarios show that, unlike competing approaches, AUTOCAST can avoid crashes and near-misses which occur frequently without cooperative perception, its performance scales gracefully in dense traffic scenarios providing 2-4x visibility into safety critical objects compared to existing cooperative perception schemes, its transmission schedules can be completed on the real radio testbed, and its scheduling algorithm is near-optimal with negligible computation overhead.
