The popularization of social media generates a large amount of user-oriented data, where text data especially attracts researchers and speculators to infer user attributes (e.g., age, gender) for fulfilling their intents. Generally, this line of work casts attribute inference as a text classification problem, and starts to leverage graph neural networks for higher-level text representations. However, these text graphs are constructed on words, suffering from high memory consumption and ineffectiveness on few labeled texts. To address this challenge, we design a text-graph-based few-shot learning model for social media attribute inferences. Our model builds a text graph with texts as nodes and edges learned from current text representations via manifold learning and message passing. To further use unlabeled texts to improve few-shot performance, a knowledge distillation is devised to optimize the problem. This offers a trade-off between expressiveness and complexity. Experiments on social media datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our model on attribute inferences with considerably fewer labeled texts.
