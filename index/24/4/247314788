Serverless computing has freed developers from the burden of managing their own platform and infrastructure, allowing them to rapidly prototype and deploy applications. Despite its surging popularity, however, serverless raises a number of concerning security implications. Among them is the difﬁ-culty of investigating intrusions – by decomposing traditional applications into ephemeral re-entrant functions, serverless has enabled attackers to conceal their activities within legitimate workﬂows, and even prevent root cause analysis by abusing warm container reuse policies to break causal paths. Unfortunately, neither traditional approaches to system auditing nor commercial serverless security products provide the transparency needed to accurately track these novel threats. In this work, we propose A LASTOR , a provenance-based auditing framework that enables precise tracing of suspicious events in serverless applications. A LASTOR records function activity at both system and application layers to capture a holistic picture of each function instances’ behavior. It then aggregates provenance from different functions at a central repository within the serverless platform, stitching it together to produce a global data provenance graph of complex function workﬂows. A LASTOR is both function and language-agnostic, and can easily be integrated into existing serverless platforms with minimal modiﬁcation. We implement A LAS TOR for the OpenFaaS platform and evaluate its performance using the well-established Nordstrom Hello,Retail! application, discovering in the process that A LASTOR imposes man-ageable overheads (13.74%), in exchange for signiﬁcantly improved forensic capabilities as compared to commercially-available monitoring tools. To our knowledge, A LASTOR is the ﬁrst auditing framework speciﬁcally designed to satisfy the operational requirements of serverless platforms.
