Deep policy networks enable robots to learn behaviors to solve various real-world complex tasks in an end-to-end fashion. However, they lack transparency to provide the reasons of actions. Thus, such a black-box model often results in low reliability and disruptive actions during the deployment of the robot in practice. To enhance its transparency, it is important to explain robot behaviors by considering the extent to which each input feature contributes to determining a given action. In this paper, we present an explicit analysis of deep policy models through input attribution methods to explain how and to what extent each input feature affects the decisions of the robot policy models. To this end, we present two methods for applying input attribution methods to robot policy networks: (1) we measure the importance factor of each joint torque to re ect the influence of the motor torque on the end-effector movement, and (2) we modify a relevance propagation method to handle negative inputs and outputs in deep policy networks properly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to identify the dynamic changes of input attributions of multi-modal sensor inputs in deep policy networks online for robotic manipulation.
