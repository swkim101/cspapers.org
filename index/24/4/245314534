This paper deals with impacts study of distributed generators that is inspired from an industrial site of the international cement company (Lafargeholcim). Thus, the impacts of DG on the protection of MV grid (30 kV, 14 busbars IEEE) in the event of a short-circuit failure in different scenarios (variation in size and location of the DG) are presented. The analysis is focused on the max current protection, to set Over-current relay (OCR) and coordination time interval according to the standards. These studies have adopted a methodology that can improve the failures area protection after injection of DG.
