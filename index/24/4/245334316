This paper proposes a novel approach to object detection on drone imagery, namely Multi-Proxy Detection Network with Unified Foreground Packing (UFPMP-Det). To deal with the numerous instances of very small scales, different from the common solution that divides the high-resolution input image into quite a number of chips with low foreground ratios to perform detection on them each, the Unified Foreground Packing (UFP) module is designed, where the sub-regions given by a coarse detector are initially merged through clustering to suppress background and the resulting ones are subsequently packed into a mosaic for a single inference, thus significantly reducing overall time cost. Furthermore, to address the more serious confusion between inter-class similarities and intra-class variations of instances, which deteriorates detection performance but is rarely discussed, the Multi-Proxy Detection Network (MP-Det) is presented to model object distributions in a fine-grained manner by employing multiple proxy learning, and the proxies are enforced to be diverse by minimizing a Bag-of-Instance-Words (BoIW) guided optimal transport loss. By such means, UFPMP-Det largely promotes both the detection accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments are carried out on the widely used VisDrone and UAVDT datasets, and UFPMP-Det reports new state-of-the-art scores at a much higher speed, highlighting its advantages.
