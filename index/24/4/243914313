Graph is widely utilized as a key data structure in many applications like social network and recommendation systems. However, real-world graph construction typically involves massive random memory accesses and distance calculation, resulting in considerable processing time and energy consumptions on CPUs and GPUs. In this work, we present GCiM, a specialized processing-in-memory architecture for efficient graph construction and update. By directly deploying the computing units on the logic layer of the 3D stacked memory, GCiM benefits from memory-level parallelism and further improves the memory access efficiency with both optimized processing ordering and data layout. According to our experiments, GCiM shows 634.64X and 53.29X speedup while consuming 1470.7X and 442.56X less energy compared to CPU and GPU respectively.
