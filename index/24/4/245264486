As robotic technologies advance and robots move out of factories and labs into the real world, grip on a variety of surfaces (e.g. smooth or rough) in a variety of conditions (e.g. dry or wet) becomes increasingly important. Bioinspired "microspines" have been previously explored, but primarily for vertical climbing applications or for small-scale robots applying low forces (less than 1 N). Further, these works primarily focused on rough surfaces. To advance this area of research, we present a composite material comprising high- friction rubber and compliant nitinol microspines which can passively retract below the surface of the rubber. We show that the composite can support large loads (greater than 75 N) with a high coefficient of friction on both smooth and rough surfaces (p > 1.1), outperforming microspines alone on smooth surfaces and rubber alone on rough surfaces, especially when wet and oily. Further, due to the retraction of the microspines, the composite does not damage relatively soft, smooth surfaces, like wood flooring. We also test durability, and show that it is improved by microspine compliance, and test the effects of varying microspine diameter, angle, and tip shape. Finally, we demonstrate that a small RC car can climb steeper slopes and stop more quickly in wet conditions with microspines.
