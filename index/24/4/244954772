In generative adversarial networks, improving discriminators is one of the key components for generation performance. As image classifiers are biased toward texture and debiasing improves accuracy, we investigate 1) if the discriminators are biased, and 2) if debiasing the discriminators will improve generation performance. Indeed, we find empirical evidence that the discriminators are sensitive to the style (e.g., texture and color) of images. As a remedy, we propose feature statistics mixing regularization (FSMR) that encourages the discriminator's prediction to be invariant to the styles of input images. Specifically, we generate a mixed feature of an original and a reference image in the discriminator's feature space and we apply regularization so that the prediction for the mixed feature is consistent with the prediction for the original image. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our regularization leads to reduced sensitivity to style and consistently improves the performance of various GAN architectures on nine datasets. In addition, adding FSMR to recently-proposed augmentation-based GAN methods further improves image quality. Our code is available at https://github.com/naver-ai/FSMR.
