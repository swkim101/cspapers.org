Peptide-decorated nanosystems have demonstrated higher stability and improved cellular uptake as compared to bare NPs and appear highly promising in diagnostics and theranostics of cancer. Herein, we discuss the preparation and structural characterization of peptide-functionalized silica/PEG NPs, starting from peptide–block copolymers, prepared in turn by conjugation of the peptides to block copolymers before NP formation. This synthetic design allowed full control of density and composition of peptide surface coverage. Preliminary experiments support the low toxicity of the fluorescent peptide–NPs and their ability of cell internalization.
