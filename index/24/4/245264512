In this paper, a new robust Model Free Terminal Sliding Mode algorithm (MFTSM) is developed to control the flexion/ extension movement of the elbow. Our system is an exoskeleton in interaction with the human upper limb. In a first time, the EMG signal extraction steps were presented. Then, the modeling and the control of the considered system were developed using a model free terminal sliding mode algorithm. A stability study and a robustness analysis were done. Simulation results are provided to prove the performances and the efficiency of the proposed Model Free Terminal Sliding Mode algorithm in presence of parametric uncertainties using the EMG signal as desired trajectories.
