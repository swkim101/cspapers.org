Smart city is a concept that is implemented as a layered architecture. This paper focuses on the lowest layer which is the sensor network layer. As an IoT, this layer could lift lots of load that is put on fogs and cloud when they take decisions. This is by adopting the internet of intelligent things (IoIT) into the sensor network layer. This way, sensors act smart and they take most of the decisions on their own. In this paper, a sensor network is seen as a set of intelligent nodes. System states are modeled as fuzzy sets.
