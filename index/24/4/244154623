This paper studies the impacts of chaotic mixing sequence on the Modulated Wideband Converter blind spectrum sensing and reconstruction scheme. The Modulated Wideband Converter is a sub-Nyquist sampling scheme which comprises a multi-branch of mixer, lowpass filter and analog-to-digital converter. The mixing sequences play an important role in performance of the Modulated Wideband Converter blind spectrum sensing and reconstruction. Under the Compressed Sensing hypothesis, several approaches and the selection of chaotic mixing sequence for the Modulated Wideband Converter which is obtained from a chaotic system will be presented. This study also evaluates the Modulated Wideband Converter performance based on chaotic mixing sequences and several existing mixing sequences in the simulation.
