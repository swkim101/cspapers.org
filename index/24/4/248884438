In this work we present our results on dynamic visual servoing for the case of moving targets while also exploring the possibility of using such a controller for interaction with the environment. We illustrate the derivation of a feature space impedance controller for tracking a moving object as well as an Extended Kalman Filter based on the visual servoing kinematics for increasing the rate of the visual information and estimating the target velocity for both the cases of PBVS and IBVS with image point features. Simulations are carried out to validate the estimator performance during a Peg-in-Hole insertion task with a moving part. Experiments are also conducted on a real redundant manipulator with a low-cost wrist-mounted camera. Details on several implementation issues encountered during implementation are also discussed.
