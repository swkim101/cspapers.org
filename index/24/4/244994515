Phishing is a fraudulent attempt where attackers trick the victims into disclosing sensitive information under pretenses. This research project aims to develop a Google Chrome extension to detect phishing emails. We firstly collected a number of phishing email samples. Then we used text mining techniques to find out the words that are important in phishing emails. Next, we developed a classifier model that the Chrome extension will use to detect phishing emails using those words. The next step was to test the extension with phishing email samples and standard (non-phishing) email samples. After that, the evaluation metrics were collected. We found our extension was able to identify phishing emails and non-phishing emails with a relatively high degree of accuracy.
