Mechanical rubbing of blood clot using miniature magnetic helical robots is a potential way for thrombolysis. In this paper, we report a new strategy for this issue based on mobile coils. Previously, we proposed the concept of magnetic actuation with parallel mobile coils, in which multiple coils can move in 3D space. Enabled by mobility of the coils, additional degree-of-freedom (DOF) could be utilized for actuation performance optimization. Besides the primary helical propulsion by rotating magnetic fields, our strategy aims to optimize the coil motion to make the magnetic force contributes the most to the helical robot forward motion. For this goal, modeling of the magnetic field and force of multiple mobile coils are presented, based on which an optimization algorithm is formulated to output the best coil motion. For validation, an enhanced mobile coil system having a workspace of Φ500 mm ×150 mm is constructed based on the parallel mobile coil concept. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, whose effective workspace for a specific task can also be obtained. After implementing the proposed strategy, preliminary experiments using clot analog demonstrate that the removal speed is accelerated over 50% compared to that without coil motion optimization.
