Existing autonomous parking solutions usually require special signs, pre-built maps or accurate ranging sensors to achieve reliable perception of the parking environment, but these methods are difficult to popularize because they either require preconditions or are expensive for production cars. In this paper, we propose a vision-only autonomous parking solution based on only six cameras. Through the appropriate depth estimation algorithms, our method obtains the pixel level depth of the image, and constructs a dense point cloud, so as to realize the fine perception of the parking environment. An improved Radon transform based parking space detection method are applied for better parking space detection method. Our proposed method achieves processing speed of above 5 Hz on a intermediate level computing platform. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practicability of the proposed system in real-world parking lots.
