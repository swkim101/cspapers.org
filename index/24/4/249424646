Millimeter-wave (mmWave) imaging has been difficult to implement on handheld devices since imaging algorithms rely on millimeter-scale device self-tracking, which existing systems cannot achieve reliably. We propose CompenSAR, a handheld system which integrates a mmWave transceiver and a tracking camera, and overcomes the self-tracking limitations to enable handheld mmWave imaging.
