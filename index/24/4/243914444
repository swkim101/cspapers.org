Placement and routing are two key problems in VLSI physical design. However, there may be out of sync between the two problems with congestion and routing resources. Therefore, it is desirable to design an efficient and highly coupled placement and routing engine. This paper proposes an incremental 3D global routing engine considering cell movement and complex routing constraints to relocate cells and reroute nets. We develop an efficient movement evaluation method to find desired locations and estimated routing resources for each cell. Then, we adopt an iterative approach to move cells to reduce routing resources. To reduce the time consumption of rerouting, we propose two technologies (searching space reduction and data structure optimization) to speed up the rerouting process. Compared with the participating teams at the 2020 CAD Contest at ICCAD based on the contest benchmarks, experiment results show that our proposed algorithm achieves the best runtime and routing resources while satisfying all the routing constraints.
