The development of semiconductor devices in the millimeter-wave and sub-terahertz range and the associated development of broadband wireless standards offer a promising alternative to the state-of-the-art design of rotary transmitters with free rotation centers based on transmission technologies in the baseband. A novel approach will be used to find a way to use upcoming transmission standards to build a multi-gigabit rotary transmitter. Channel models of a so-called multi-mode wave orbit were developed to determine and optimize the key characteristics of the novel channel. A test setup has been used to measure the channel and compare it to the model. It could be shown that with the help of several optimizations, a channel can be created that provides a stable channel capacity of over 10 Gbps at a bandwidth of 1.76 GHz for diameters of 1.1m at over 100 rpm. Due to the simple construction and the possibility to use off-the-shelf components, this approach becomes interesting for a variety of rotary transmitter applications.
