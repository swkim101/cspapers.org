Scheduling under uncertainty is an area of interest in artificial intelligence. We study the problem of Dynamic Controllability (DC) of Disjunctive Temporal Networks with Uncertainty (DTNU), which seeks a reactive scheduling strategy to satisfy temporal constraints in response to uncontrollable action durations. We introduce new semantics for reactive scheduling: Time-based Dynamic Controllability (TDC) and a restricted subset of TDC, R-TDC. We present a tree search approach to determine whether or not a DTNU is R-TDC. Moreover, we leverage the learning capability of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) as a heuristic for tree search guidance. Finally, we conduct experiments on a known benchmark on which we show R-TDC to retain significant completeness with regard to DC, while being faster to prove. This results in the tree search processing fifty percent more DTNU problems in R-TDC than the state-of-the-art DC solver does in DC with the same time budget. We also observe that GNN tree search guidance leads to substantial performance gains on benchmarks of more complex DTNUs, with up to eleven times more problems solved than the baseline tree search.
