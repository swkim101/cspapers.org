The use of assistive technologies in industrial environments to improve human ergonomics and comfort in repetitive and high effort tasks have increased considerably in the last decade. Predominantly, the goal is to provide additional physical support through lightweight and wearable devices, without posing major constraints to the human body movements. Towards achieving this objective, in this work we present a novel actuation mechanism for a soft assistive device, by taking into account the human elbow torque-angle profile. The proposed design integrates a single motor coupled with an elastic bungee and a cam-spool mechanism to enable energy exchange during the elbow flexion movement, while allowing for free-motions during the extension of the joint. A cable-driven transmission with passive elastic attachments is employed to implement compliant couplings with the wearer and to achieve easy donning/doffing. Experiments are conducted on two 3D printed functional prototypes. Results suggest that the assistive elbow torque is effectively transmitted with an average 90% success for balancing a 5N payload, and the free-motion range of 108Â° is measured for both flexion and extension.
