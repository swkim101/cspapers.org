Non-cooperative game problems such as pursuit-evasion require a solution approach that takes into consideration the strategy of the opponents. To predict the strategy of an opponent in a game, its full information is required and more computation time would be spent. However, this requirement of the opponentâ€™s full information is not realistic. Also, the computation time required by the game-theoretic algorithm (GTA) could make the controller unimplementable for some systems. Conversely, Model Predictive Control (MPC) can solve the same problem using only the state information on the opponent by solving minimization or maximization cost functions. In this paper, we compared the GTA and MPC algorithm using two autonomous nonholonomic ground robots. Several simulations were conducted in the absence and presence of obstacles, using different initial conditions. The results obtained showed that the MPC algorithm can achieve similar performance.
