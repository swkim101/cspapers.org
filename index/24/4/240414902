Despite the proliferation of Android testing tools, Google Monkey has remained the de facto standard for practitioners. The popularity of Google Monkey is largely due to the fact that it is a black-box testing tool, making it widely applicable to all types of Android apps, regardless of their underlying implementation details. An important drawback of Google Monkey, however, is the fact that it uses the most naive form of test input generation technique, i.e., random testing. In this work, we present Deep GUI, an approach that aims to complement the benefits of black-box testing with a more intelligent form of GUI input generation. Given only screenshots of apps, Deep GUI first employs deep learning to construct a model of valid GUI interactions. It then uses this model to generate effective inputs for an app under test without the need to probe its implementation details. Moreover, since the data collection, training, and inference processes are performed independent of the platform, the model inferred by Deep GUI has application for testing apps in other platforms as well. We implemented a prototype of Deep GUI in a tool called Monkey++ by extending Google Monkey and evaluated it for its ability to crawl Android apps. We found that Monkey++ achieves significant improvements over Google Monkey in cases where an appâ€™s UI is complex, requiring sophisticated inputs. Furthermore, our experimental results demonstrate the model inferred using Deep GUI can be reused for effective GUI input generation across platforms without the need for retraining.
