The problem of positive filters design for the class of positive generalized systems, known as descriptor or singular systems is investigated. In fact, we propose a new positive full order filter for positive descriptor systems affected by disturbance vector. Positivity conditions for such systems is firstly given. Then, the proposed procedure is based on the unbiasedness of the filter using a Sylvester equation, where all positive filter matrices are parameterized by an unique gain matrix Z; These matrices are designed, such that the dynamics of the estimation error is positive and asymptotically stable.
