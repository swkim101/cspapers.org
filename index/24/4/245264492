The paper proposes a method for automatic multi-view dataset construction based on formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL). Although data collection and human annotation of 3D objects are labor-intensive, we automatically generate their training data and labels in the proposed multi-view dataset. To create a large-scale multi-view dataset, we employ fractal geometry, which is considered the background information of many objects in the real world. We project in a circle from the rendered 3D fractal models to construct the Multi-view Fractal DataBase (MV-FractalDB), which is then used to make a pre-trained CNN model. According to the experimental results, the MV-FractalDB pre-trained model surpasses the accuracies with self-supervised methods (e.g., SimCLR and MoCo) and is close to supervised methods (e.g., ImageNet) in terms of performance rates on multi-view image datasets. We demonstrate the potential of FDSL for multi-view image recognition.
