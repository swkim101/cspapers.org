Rolling spherical robots have been studied in the past few years as an alternative to legged and wheeled robots in unstructured environments. These systems are of uttermost interest for space exploration: fast, robust to collision and able to handle various terrain topologies. This paper introduces a novel barycentric spherical robot, dubbed the Autonomous Robotic Intelligent Explorer Sphere (ARIES). Equipped with an actuated cylindrical joint acting as a pendulum with two degrees-of-freedom (DoF), the ARIES has a continuous differential transmission to allow simultaneous rolling and steering. This mechanism allows an unprecedented mass allocation optimization, notably to provide a low center of mass. Kinematics and dynamics of this novel system are detailed. An analysis of the steering mechanism proves that it is more efficient than a more conventional 2-DoF tilting mechanism, while also retaining more space for a payload, for instance to host sensors for simultaneous localization and mapping, in the upper part of the sphere. Moreover, the kinematic input/output equations obtained significantly simplify the device's control. Finally, we present a first complete prototype with preliminary experimental tests.
