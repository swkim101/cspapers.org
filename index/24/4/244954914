Benefiting from the pioneering design of generic object detectors, significant achievements have been made in the field of face detection. Typically, the architectures of the backbone, feature pyramid layer, and detection head module within the face detector all assimilate the excellent experience from general object detectors. However, several effective methods, including label assignment and scale-level data augmentation strategy, fail to maintain consistent superiority when applying on the face detector directly. Concretely, the former strategy involves a vast body of hyperparameters and the latter one suffers from the challenge of scale distribution bias between different detection tasks, which both limit their generalization abilities. Furthermore, in order to provide accurate face bounding boxes for facial down-stream tasks, the face detector imperatively requires the elimination of false alarms. As a result, practical solutions on label assignment, scale-level data augmentation, and reducing false alarms are necessary for advancing face detectors. In this paper, we focus on resolving three aforementioned challenges that exiting methods are difficult to finish off and present a novel face detector, termed MogFace. In our Mogface, three key components, Adaptive Online Incremental Anchor Mining Strategy, Selective Scale Enhancement Strategy and Hierarchical Context-Aware Module, are separately proposed to boost the performance of face detectors. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, our MogFace is the best face detector on the Wider Face leader-board, achieving all champions across different testing scenarios.
