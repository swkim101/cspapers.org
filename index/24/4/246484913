—Many large organizations operate dedicated wide area networks (WANs) distinct from the Internet to connect their data centers and remote sites through high-throughput links. While encryption generally protects these WANs well against content eavesdropping, they remain vulnerable to trafﬁc analysis attacks that infer visited websites, watched videos or contents of VoIP calls from analysis of the trafﬁc volume, packet sizes or timing information. Existing techniques to obfuscate Internet trafﬁc are not well suited for WANs as they are either highly inefﬁcient or require modiﬁcations to the communication protocols used by end hosts. This paper presents ditto , a trafﬁc obfuscation system adapted to the requirements of WANs: achieving high-throughput trafﬁc obfuscation at line rate without modiﬁcations of end hosts. ditto adds padding to packets and introduces chaff packets to make the resulting obfuscated trafﬁc independent of production trafﬁc with respect to packet sizes, timing and trafﬁc volume. We evaluate a full implementation of ditto running on programmable switches in the network data plane. Our results show that ditto runs at 100 Gbps line rate and performs with negligible performance overhead up to a realistic trafﬁc load of 70 Gbps per WAN link.
