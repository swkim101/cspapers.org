In hate speech detection, developing training and evaluation datasets across various domains is the critical issue. Whereas, major approaches crawl social media texts and hire crowd-workers to annotate the data. Following this convention often restricts the scope of pejorative expressions to a single domain lacking generalization. Sometimes domain overlap between training corpus and evaluation set overestimate the prediction performance when pretraining language models on low-data language. To alleviate these problems in Korean, we propose APEACH that asks unspecified users to generate hate speech examples followed by minimal post-labeling. We find that APEACH can collect useful datasets that are less sensitive to the lexical overlaps between the pretraining corpus and the evaluation set, thereby properly measuring the model performance.
