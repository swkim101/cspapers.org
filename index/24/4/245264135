Recent data-driven approaches to visual servoing have shown improved performances over classical methods due to precise feature matching and depth estimation. Some recent servoing approaches use a model predictive control (MPC) framework which generalise well to novel environments and are capable of incorporating dynamic constraints, but are computationally intractable in real-time, making it difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. On the contrary, single-step methods optimise greedily and achieve high servoing rates, but lack the benefits of the MPC multi-step ahead formulation. In this paper, we make the best of both worlds and propose a lightweight visual servoing MPC framework which generates optimal control near real-time at a frequency of 10.52 Hz. This work utilises the differential cross-entropy sampling method for quick and effective control generation along with a lightweight neural network, significantly improving the servoing frequency. We also propose a flow depth normalisation layer which ameliorates the issue of inferior predictions of two view depth from the flow network. We conduct extensive experimentation on the Habitat simulator and show a notable decrease in servoing time in comparison with other approaches that optimise over a time horizon. We achieve the right balance between time and performance for visual servoing in six degrees of freedom (6DoF), while retaining the advantageous MPC formulation.
