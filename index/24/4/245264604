Handling of fabric is a crucial step in the manufacturing of garments. This task is typically performed by trained workers who manipulate one sheet at a time, thus introducing a bottleneck in the automation of the textile industry. This paper seeks to address the challenge of picking fabric up by proposing a new method of achieving ply-separation. Our approach relies on a finger-tip sized (2 cm2) electroadhesive skin to lift fabric up. A pinch-type grasp is then used to securely hold the separated sheet of fabric, enabling easy manipulation thereafter. The ability to successfully pick up and manipulate a variety of commercial fabrics with diverse materials, shapes, sizes and textures is demonstrated. The ability to handle fabrics 100s of times larger than the electroadhesive skin is unique to our approach. Additionally, we demonstrate the manipulation of non-flat fabrics, a challenge that has not been previously addressed by electroadhesive approaches. We believe that this method introduces a smarter way of handling flexible and limp materials, showing great potential towards automation of garment manufacturing.
