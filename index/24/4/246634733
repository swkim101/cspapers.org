We study covariate shift in the context of nonparametric regression. We introduce a new measure of distribution mismatch between the source and target distributions that is based on the integrated ratio of probabilities of balls at a given radius. We use the scaling of this measure with respect to the radius to characterize the minimax rate of estimation over a family of Hölder continuous functions under covariate shift. In comparison to the re-cently proposed notion of transfer exponent, this measure leads to a sharper rate of convergence and is more ﬁne-grained. We accompany our theory with concrete instances of covariate shift that illustrate this sharp difference.
