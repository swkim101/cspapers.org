Text data is highly unstructured and can often be viewed as a complex representation of different concepts, entities, events, sentiments etc. For a wide variety of computational tasks, it is thus very important to annotate text data with the associated concepts / entities, which can put some initial structure / index on raw text data. However, It is not feasible to manually annotate a large amount of text, raising the need for automatic text annotation. In this paper, we focus on concept annotation in text data from the perspective of real world users. Concept annotation is not a trivial task and its utility often highly relies on the preference of the user. Despite significant progress in natural language processing research, we still lack a general purpose concept annotation tool which can effectively serve users from a wide range of application domains. Thus, further investigation is needed from a user-centric point of view to design an automated concept annotation tool that will ensure maximum utility to its users. To achieve this goal, we created a benchmark corpus of two real world data-sets, i.e., “News Concept Data-set” and “Medical Concept Data-set”, to introduce the notion of user-oriented concept annotation and provide a way to evaluate this task. The term “user-centric” means that the desired concepts are defined as well as characterized by the users themselves. Throughout the paper, we describe the details about how we created the data-sets, what are the unique characteristics of each data-set, how these data-sets reflect real users perspective for the concept annotation task, and finally, how they can serve as a great resource for future research on user-centric concept annotation.
