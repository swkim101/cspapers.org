Lung cancer treatment management has always been at the interface of medicine, biology, and physics. Rapid progress is being made in the direction of new high-precision technology developments that emerge toward more patient- specific therapies with lower toxicity. This paper provides a complete generic framework of lung tumor targeting and patient individualization, thereby allowing a rational choice of tumor- specific dose and type of treatment. Possible comprehensive strategies including radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy drug (antiangiogenic), coupled with mathematical modeling of tumor dynamics and respiratory mechanics would bring considerable progress in the area of prediction models for treatment outcomes. The therapy becomes model-based predicted and leads to personalized radiotherapy with optimal doses, decreasing the risks of normal-tissue effects and costs as well. To maximize the success of the treatment in an individual, clinicians need to be aware of both tumor characteristics and lung tissue properties (assessed with a forced oscillation technique device).
