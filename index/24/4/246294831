Despite the broad use of ﬁxed-point iterations throughout applied mathematics, the optimal convergence rate of general ﬁxed-point problems with nonexpansive nonlinear operators has not been established. This work presents an acceleration mechanism for ﬁxed-point iterations with nonexpansive operators, contractive operators, and nonexpansive operators satisfying a H ¨ older-type growth condition. We then provide matching complexity lower bounds to establish the exact optimality of the acceleration mechanisms in the nonexpansive and contractive setups. Finally, we provide experiments with CT imaging, optimal transport, and decentralized optimization to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the acceleration mechanism.
