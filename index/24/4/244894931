Reconstructing delicate geometric details with consumer RGB-D sensors is challenging due to sensor depth and poses uncertainties. To tackle this problem, we propose a unique geometry-guided fusion framework: 1) First, we characterize fusion correspondences with the geodesic curves derived from the mass transport problem, also known as the Monge-Kantorovich problem. Compared with the depth map back-projection methods, the geodesic curves reveal the geometric structures of the local surface. 2) Moving the points along the geodesic curves is the core of our fusion approach, guided by local geometric properties, i.e., Gaussian curvature and mean curvature. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our novel geometry-guided displacement interpolation fully utilizes the meaningful geometric features of the local surface. It makes the reconstruction accuracy and completeness improved. Finally, a significant number of experimental results on real object data verify the superior performance of the proposed method. Our technique achieves the most delicate geometric details on thin objects for which the original depth map back-projection fusion scheme suffers from severe artifacts (See Fig. 1).
