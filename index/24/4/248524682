Estimating human motion from video is an active research area due to its many potential applications. Most state-of-the-art methods predict human shape and posture estimates for individual images and do not leverage the temporal information available in video. Many"in the wild"sequences of human motion are captured by a moving camera, which adds the complication of conflated camera and human motion to the estimation. We therefore present BodySLAM, a monocular SLAM system that jointly estimates the position, shape, and posture of human bodies, as well as the camera trajectory. We also introduce a novel human motion model to constrain sequential body postures and observe the scale of the scene. Through a series of experiments on video sequences of human motion captured by a moving monocular camera, we demonstrate that BodySLAM improves estimates of all human body parameters and camera poses when compared to estimating these separately.
