We propose a novel approach that integrates underparameterized RANSAC (UPRANSAC) with Hough Transform to detect vanishing points (VPs) from un-calibrated monocular images. In our algorithm, the UPRANSAC chooses one hypothetical inlier in a sample set to find a portion of the VP’s degrees of freedom, which is followed by a highly reliable brute-force voting scheme (1-D Hough Transform) to find the VP’s remaining degrees of freedom along the extension line of the hypothetical inlier. Our approach is able to sequentially find a series of VPs by repeatedly removing inliers of any detected VPs from minimal sample sets until the stop criterion is reached. Compared to traditional RANSAC that selects 2 edges as a hypothetical inlier pair to fit a model of VP hypothesis and requires hitting a pair of inliners, the UPRANSAC has a higher likelihood to hit one inliner and is more reliable in VP detection. Meanwhile, the tremendously scaled-down voting space with the requirement of only 1 parameter for processing significantly increased the performance efficiency of Hough Transform in our scheme. Testing results with well-known benchmark datasets show that the detection accuracies of our approach were higher or on par with the SOTA while running in deeply real-time zone.
