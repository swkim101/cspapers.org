We address the problem of motion control for safe physical interaction, and in particular finding new ways for impedance controller parameters’ adaptation to ensure better safety with minimum possible lose in robot performance. We propose an exteroception-based dynamically updated safety metric that takes into account current robot state and inertia as well as external objects’ mass, shape, material properties, velocity, sensor confidence and existing sampling rates. We also present how this metric can be applied to design a finite state machine of the multi-stage controller, which allows us to prioritize either safety of performance by setting different energy and power constraints with smooth transition in between free motion and interaction modes.
