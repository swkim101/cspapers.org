Simulation is a crucial task in algorithm testing for autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, simulation also helps to observe the possible errors precedent to the empirical experiment, thus optimizing the time and effort of researchers. This paper will illustrate the simulation method of Hybrid Autonomous Underwater Vehicle(AUV), a new AUV platform utilizing Robotic Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo. Gazebo will simulate 3D behaviors and movements of AUV based on calculations regarding the effect of hydrodynamic and hydrostatic force, the objective relation of the actuator as well as the sensor simulation, in which ROS is used for control algorithm development.
