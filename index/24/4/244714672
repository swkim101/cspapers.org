In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, named InstaOrder, that can be used to understand the geometrical relationships of instances in an image. The dataset consists of 2.9M annotations of geometric orderings for class-labeled instances in 101K natural scenes. The scenes were annotated by 3,659 crowd-workers regarding (1) occlusion order that identifies occluder/occludee and (2) depth order that describes ordinal relations that consider relative distance from the camera. The dataset provides joint annotation of two kinds of orderings for the same instances, and we discover that the occlusion order and depth order are complementary. We also introduce a geometric order prediction network called InstaOrderNet, which is superior to state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we propose a dense depth prediction network called InstaDepthNet that uses auxiliary geometric order loss to boost the accuracy of the state-of-the-art depth prediction approach, MiDaS [54].
