Classroom dashboards are designed to help instructors effectively orchestrate classrooms by providing summary statistics, activity tracking, and other information. Existing dashboards are generally specific to an LMS or platform and they generally summarize individual work, not group behaviors. However, CS courses typically involve constellations of tools and mix on- and offline collaboration. Thus, cross-platform monitoring of individuals and teams is important to develop a full picture of the class. In this work, we describe our work on Concert, a data integration platform that collects data about student activities from several sources such as Piazza, My Digital Hand, and GitHub and uses it to support classroom monitoring through analysis and visualizations. We discuss team visualizations that we have developed to support effective group management and to help instructors identify teams in need of intervention.
