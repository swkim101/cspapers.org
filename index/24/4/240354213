Adversarial training is the industry standard for producing models that are robust to small adversarial perturbations. However, machine learning practitioners need models that are robust to other kinds of changes that occur naturally, such as changes in the style or illumination of input images. Such changes in input distribution have been effectively modeled as shifts in the mean and variance of deep image features. We adapt adversarial training by directly perturbing feature statistics, rather than image pixels, to produce models that are robust to various unseen distributional shifts. We explore the relationship between these perturbations and distributional shifts by visualizing adversarial features. Our proposed method, Adversarial Batch Normalization (AdvBN), is a single network layer that generates worst-case feature perturbations during training. By fine-tuning neural networks on adversarial feature distributions, we observe improved robustness of networks to various unseen distributional shifts, including style variations and image corruptions. In addition, we show that our proposed adversarial feature perturbation can be complementary to existing image space data augmentation methods, leading to improved performance.
