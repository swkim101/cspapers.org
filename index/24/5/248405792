Aquatic locomotion is a classic ﬂuid-structure interaction (FSI) problem of interest to biologists and engineers. Solving the fully coupled FSI equations for incompressible Navier-Stokes and ﬁnite elasticity is computationally expensive. Optimizing robotic swimmer design within such a system generally involves cumbersome, gradient-free pro-cedures on top of the already costly simulation. To address this challenge we present a novel, fully differentiable hybrid approach to FSI that com-bines a 2D direct numerical simulation for the deformable solid structure of the swimmer and a physics-constrained neural network surrogate to capture hydrodynamic effects of the ﬂuid. For the deformable simulation of the swimmer’s body, we use state-of-the-art techniques from the ﬁeld of computer graphics to speed up the ﬁnite-element method (FEM). For the ﬂuid simulation, we use a U-Net architecture trained with a physics-based loss function to predict the ﬂow ﬁeld at each time step. The pressure and velocity ﬁeld outputs from the neural network are sampled around the boundary of our swimmer using an immersed boundary method (IBM) to compute its swimming motion accurately and efﬁciently. We demonstrate the computational efﬁciency and differentiability of our hybrid simulator on a 2D carangiform swimmer. Since both the solid simulator and the hydrodynamics model are automatically differentiable, we obtain a fully differentiable FSI simulator that can be used for computational co-design of ge-ometry and controls for rigid and soft bodies immersed in ﬂuids, such as minimizing drag, maximizing speed, or maximizing efﬁciency via direct gradient-based optimization.
