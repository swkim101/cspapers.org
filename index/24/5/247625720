Fine-tuning pre-trained language models has recently become a common practice in building NLP models for various tasks, especially few-shot tasks. We argue that under the few-shot setting, formulating fine-tuning closer to the pre-training objectives shall be able to unleash more benefits from the pre-trained language models. In this work, we take few-shot named entity recognition (NER) for a pilot study, where existing fine-tuning strategies are much different from pre-training. We propose a novel few-shot fine-tuning framework for NER, FFF-NER. Specifically, we introduce three new types of tokens,"is-entity","which-type"and bracket, so we can formulate the NER fine-tuning as (masked) token prediction or generation, depending on the choice of pre-trained language models. In our experiments, we apply FFF-NER to fine-tune both BERT and BART for few-shot NER on several benchmark datasets and observe significant improvements over existing fine-tuning strategies, including sequence labeling, prototype meta-learning, and prompt-based approaches. We further perform a series of ablation studies, showing few-shot NER performance is strongly correlated with the similarity between fine-tuning and pre-training.
