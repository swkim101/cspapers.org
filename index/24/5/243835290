In this work, we study the problem of human-object interaction (HOI) detection with large vocabulary object categories. Previous HOI studies are mainly conducted in the regime of limit object categories (e.g., 80 categories). Their solutions may face new difficulties in both object detection and interaction classification due to the increasing diversity of objects (e.g., 1000 categories). Different from previous methods, we formulate the HOI detection as a query problem. We propose a unified model to jointly discover the target objects and predict the corresponding interactions based on the human queries, thereby eliminating the need of using generic object detectors, extra steps to associate human-object instances, and multi-stream interaction recognition. This is achieved by a repurposed Transformer unit and a novel cascade detection over multi-scale feature maps. We observe that such a highly-coupled solution brings benefits for both object detection and interaction classification in a large vocabulary setting. To study the new challenges of the large vocabulary HOI detection, we assemble two datasets from the publicly available SWiG and 100 Days of Hands datasets. Experiments on these datasets validate that our proposed method can achieve a notable mAP improvement on HOI detection with a faster inference speed than existing one-stage HOI detectors.
