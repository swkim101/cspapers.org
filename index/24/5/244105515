In this paper, we propose a novel solution for object-matching based semi-supervised video object segmentation, where the target object masks in the first frame are provided. Existing object-matching based methods focus on the matching between the raw object features of the current frame and the first/previous frames. However, two issues are still not solved by these object-matching based methods. As the appearance of the video object changes drastically over time, 1) unseen parts/details of the object present in the current frame, resulting in incomplete annotation in the first annotated frame (e.g. view/scale changes). 2) even for the seen parts/details of the object in the current frame, their positions change relatively (e.g. pose changes/camera motion), leading to a misalignment for the object matching. To obtain the complete information of the target object, we propose a novel object-based dynamic memory network that exploits visual contents of all the past frames. To solve the misalignment problem caused by position changes of visual contents, we propose an adaptive object alignment module by incorporating a region translation function that aligns object proposals towards templates in the feature space. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on latest benchmark datasets DAVIS 2017 ($\mathcal{J}$ of 81.4% and $\mathcal{F}$ of 87.5% on the validation set) and YouTube-VOS (the overall score of 82.7% on the validation set) with a very efficient inference time (0.16 second/frame on DAVIS 2017 validation set).
