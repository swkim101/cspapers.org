The rise of metaverse has driven the burst of 3D Web apps to provide immersive experience across heterogeneous devices. However, loading 3D models in Web apps is usually slow especially on mobile devices with limited computation capability and dynamic network condition, harming the experience of 3D mobile Web apps. In this paper, we propose an approach called 3Dispatcher to reducing the 3D model loading time by adaptively compressing the 3D models. Preliminary results show that 3Dispatcher can speed up the 3D model load by 15%-41% in different scenarios.
