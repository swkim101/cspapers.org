This paper tackles a new photometric stereo task, named universal photometric stereo. Unlike existing tasks that assumed specific physical lighting models; hence, drastically limited their usability, a solution algorithm of this task is supposed to work for objects with diverse shapes and materials under arbitrary lighting variations without assum-ig any specific models. To solve this extremely challenging task, we present a purely data-driven method, which eliminates the prior assumption of lighting by replacing the recovery of physical lighting parameters with the extraction of the generic lighting representation, named global lighting contexts. We use them like lighting parameters in a calibrated photometric stereo network to recover surface normal vectors pixelwisely. To adapt our network to a wide variety of shapes, materials and lightings, it is trained on a new synthetic dataset which simulates the appearance of objects in the wild. Our method is compared with other state-of-the-art uncalibrated photometric stereo methods on our test data to demonstrate the significance of our method.
