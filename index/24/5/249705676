Visually impaired people face many daily encumbrances. Traditional visual enhancements do not suffice to navigate indoor environments. In this paper, we explore path finding algorithms such as Dijkstra and A* combined with graph coloring to find a safest and shortest path for visual impaired people to navigate indoors. Our mobile application is based on a database which stores the locations of several spots in the building and their corresponding label. Visual impaired people select the start and destination when they want to find their way, and our mobile application will show the appropriate path which guarantees their safety.
