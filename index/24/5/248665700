Model robustness is vital for the reliable deployment of machine learning models in real-world applications. Recent studies have shown that data augmentation can result in model over-relying on features in the low-frequency domain, sacrificing performance against low-frequency corruptions, highlighting a connection between frequency and robustness. Here, we take one step further to more directly study the frequency bias of a model through the lens of its Jacobians and its implication to model robustness. To achieve this, we propose Jacobian frequency regularization for models' Jacobians to have a larger ratio of low-frequency components. Through experiments on four image datasets, we show that biasing classifiers towards low (high)-frequency components can bring performance gain against high (low)-frequency corruption and adversarial perturbation, albeit with a tradeoff in performance for low (high)-frequency corruption. Our approach elucidates a more direct connection between the frequency bias and robustness of deep learning models.
