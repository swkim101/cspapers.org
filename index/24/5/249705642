The goal of this research is to model the spatio-temporal dependencies of radon gas generation and movement underground. In this regard, we have embarked upon an interdisciplinary research effort that involves studying the dependencies of radon gas emanation with soil and environmental parameters. To this end we design, implement and deploy an innovative real-time sensor network, OpenRadon Lab, to develop a radon prediction model that maps its distribution along space and time. This network constitutes a soil-to-cloud wireless computing framework to enable machine learning assisted soil radon prediction, and optimized data offloading to conserve computing resources on the sensing devices.
