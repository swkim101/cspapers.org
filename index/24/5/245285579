Non-contact manipulation technology has extensive application in the manipulation and fabrication of micro/nanomaterials. However, the manipulation devices are often precise and complex, operated only by professionals and subject to site constraints. We propose a simple optoelectronic tweezer platform, which can be controlled remotely and simply for the manipulation of microparticles at different scales, based on the novel manipulation technique called optically-induced dielectrophoresis. In this work, we design and set up the optoelectronic tweezer manipulation platform and develop the full-function human-computer interactive control interface and graphics rendering system to simplify the micro-operation process. Using Qt5.0 development environment, an experimental image processing system with multi-thread characteristics is developed, and the information interaction requirements needed in the experimental operation of optoelectronic tweezers are integrated into a control system to achieve unified information management and data analysis. Combined with cloud computing technology, the system realizes local/remote synchronous linkage operation, with cross-platform operation capability of various portable operating terminals like laptop and iPad.
