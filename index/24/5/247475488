In this demo, we describe Sonica, an open-source NB-IoT prototype platform. Both radio access and core network components are designed and implemented with the features and characteristics of NB-IoT into account. With its eNB and core network (EPC) components, Sonica can function as an NB-IoT testbed which interacts with commercial off-the-shelf NB-IoT devices. Moreover, Sonica provides a flexible framework that supports quick prototyping for MAC/PHY layers.
