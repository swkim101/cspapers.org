Casting manipulation has been studied to expand the robotâ€™s movable range. In this manipulation, the robot throws and reaches the end effector to a distant target. Usually, a special casting manipulator, which consists of rigid arm links and specific flexible linear objects, is constructed for an effective casting manipulation. However, the special manipulator cannot perform normal manipulations, such as picking and placing, grasping, and operating objects. We propose that the normal robot arm, which can perform normal tasks, picks up an unknown string in the surrounding environment and realizes casting manipulation with it. As the properties of the string are not provided in advance, it is crucial how to reflect it in casting manipulation. This is realized by the motion generation of the robot arm with the simulation of string movement, actual string manipulation by the robot arm, and string parameter estimation from the actual string movement. After repeating these three steps, the simulated string movement approximates the actual to realize casting manipulation with the unknown string. We confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments. The try of this study will lead to enhancement of the performance of home service robot, exploration robot, rescue robot and entertainment robot.
