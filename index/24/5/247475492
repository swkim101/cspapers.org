In this demonstration, we present an end-to-end assistive method for human body temperature screening system starting from collecting raw data using a thermal camera to identify the suspected individual for combating communicable infectious diseases. We deploy a lightweight MobileNet v2 in resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4B to detect the human's head and body from the thermal image and use a classifier to determine the temperature from the raw temperature data. The experiments show that although the detection accuracy is not very high, we can reduce the bottleneck from screening time and reduce the exposure for the individuals because of the reduced bottleneck.
