This demonstration presents a working prototype of TEO, a new model of device ownership that divides traditional owners into "admin" and "ephemeral owners". TEO addresses the challenge that users have no say in how their data are managed when the device is controlled by third parties, such as in rental and shared spaces. We design a complete protocol suite to address several practical issues, including preserving data ownership after users stop using the device, minimizing trusts with untrusted storage providers, enabling access control and revocation, and supporting groups of owners. Our cross-platform prototype implementation enables us to demonstrate the operational flow for managing ephemeral ownership of TEO-enabled devices in a representative setup with mobile phones, embedded devices, and Linux servers.
