Online controlled experiments are commonly used to measure how much value new features deployed to the products bring to the users. Although the experiment design is straightforward in theory, running large-scale online experiments can be quite complex. An essential step to run a rigorous experiment is to validate the balance between the buckets (a.k.a. the random samples) before it proceeds to the A/B phase. This step is called A/A validation and it serves to ensure that there is no pre-existing significant difference between the test and control buckets. In this paper, we propose a new matching algorithm to assign users to buckets and improve A/A balance. It has the capability to deal with massive user size and shows improved performance compared to existing methods.
