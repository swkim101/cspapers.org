Quantum error correction (QEC) is the central building block of fault-tolerant quantum computation but the design of QEC codes may not always match the underlying hardware. To tackle the discrepancy between the quantum hardware and QEC codes, we propose a synthesis framework that can implement and optimize the surface code onto superconducting quantum architectures. In particular, we divide the surface code synthesis into three key subroutines. The first two optimize the mapping of data qubits and ancillary qubits including syndrome qubits on the connectivity-constrained superconducting architecture, while the last subroutine optimizes the surface code execution by rescheduling syndrome measurements. Our experiments on mainstream superconducting architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synthesis framework. Especially, the surface codes synthesized by the proposed automatic synthesis framework can achieve comparable or even better error correction capability than manually designed QEC codes.
