Despite achieving remarkable performance, previous knowledge-enhanced works usually only use a single-source homogeneous knowledge base of limited knowledge coverage. Thus, they often degenerate into traditional methods because not all dialogues can be linked with knowledge entries. This paper proposes a novel dialogue generation model, MSKE-Dialog, to solve this issue with three unique advantages: (1) Rather than only one, MSKE-Dialog can simultaneously leverage multiple heterogeneous knowledge sources (it includes but is not limited to commonsense knowledge facts, text knowledge, infobox knowledge) to improve the knowledge coverage; (2) To avoid the topic conflict among the context and different knowledge sources, we propose a Multi-Reference Selection to better select context/knowledge; (3) We propose a Multi-Reference Generation to generate informative responses by referring to multiple generation references at the same time. Extensive evaluations on a Chinese dataset show the superior performance of this work against various state-of-the-art approaches. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to use the multi-source heterogeneous knowledge in the open-domain knowledge-enhanced dialogue generation.
