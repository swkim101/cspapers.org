The wide adoption and application of Masked language models (MLMs) on sensitive data (from legal to medical) necessitates a thorough quantitative investigation into their privacy vulnerabilities. Prior attempts at measuring leakage of MLMs via membership inference attacks have been inconclusive, implying potential robustness of MLMs to privacy attacks.In this work, we posit that prior attempts were inconclusive because they based their attack solely on the MLMâ€™s model score. We devise a stronger membership inference attack based on likelihood ratio hypothesis testing that involves an additional reference MLM to more accurately quantify the privacy risks of memorization in MLMs. We show that masked language models are indeed susceptible to likelihood ratio membership inference attacks: Our empirical results, on models trained on medical notes, show that our attack improves the AUC of prior membership inference attacks from 0.66 to an alarmingly high 0.90 level.
