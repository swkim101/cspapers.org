This work aims to transfer a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) pre-trained on one image domain to another domain referred to as few as just one reference image. The challenge is that, under limited supervision, it is extremely difficult to synthesize photo-realistic and highly diverse images while retaining the representative characters of the target domain. Different from existing approaches that adopt the vanilla fine-tuning strategy, we design two lightweight modules in the generator and the discriminator respectively. We first introduce an attribute adaptor in the generator and freeze the generatorâ€™s original parameters, which can reuse the prior knowledge to the most extent and maintain the synthesis quality and diversity. We then equip the well-learned discriminator with an attribute classifier to ensure that the generator with the attribute adaptor captures the appropriate characters of the reference image. Furthermore, considering the very limited diversity of the training data (i.e., as few as only one image), we propose to constrain the diversity of the latent space through truncation in the training process, alleviating the optimization difficulty. Our approach brings appealing results under various settings, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives, especially in terms of synthesis diversity. Noticeably, our method works well even with large domain gaps and robustly converges within a few minutes for each experiment. Code and models are available at https://genforce.github.io/genda/.
