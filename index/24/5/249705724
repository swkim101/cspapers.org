In this MobiSys demo we show a low-cost earphone based system that can screen for hearing loss with a cost of $10. Our system is designed to detect otoacoustic emissions (OAE) which are sounds generated when the outer hair cells move in a healthy cochlea and provide information about their function. OAE testing is commonly used as part of universal infant hearing screening protocols in high-income countries [1]. OAE equipment however is expensive hindering early hearing screening in developing countries that bear the disproportionate brunt of disabling hearing loss. Our design sends two pure tones through each of the headphone's ear-buds and records the distortion-product OAEs generated by the cochlea using a microphone. By running algorithms on a smartphone connected to the earphones using its headphone jack, we can detect distortion-product OAEs. Our device has been validated in a clinical study on 201 pediatric ears at oto-laryngology, hearing, and craniofacial clinics, across three different sites and achieved accuracies comparable to a commercial OAE device. In our demo, users will be encouraged to perform this quick test by listening to some tones in their ear through our device to check for the presence of OAEs in their ears.
