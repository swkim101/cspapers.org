Chewing Side Preference (CSP) is a dental habit that causes one to consistently and predominantly chew on only one side of the mouth, potentially causing jawbone joint disorders. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art solutions are limited in continuously monitoring the CSP in potential patients. Hence, we present EarChew, which utilizes an earable worn on the patient's ear to be able to identify the chewing side - i.e., left or right. EarChew utilizes the microphone embedded in the earable to capture the minute but inherent vibrations caused by each chewing action to be able to identify the chewing side. We present a preliminary evaluation with a participant chewing on almonds and demonstrate a promising preliminary result of 96% average accuracy.
