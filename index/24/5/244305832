Causally-taken images often suffer from flare artifacts, due to the unintended reflections and scattering of light inside the camera. However, as flares may appear in a variety of shapes, positions, and colors, detecting and removing them entirely from an image is very challenging. Existing methods rely on predefined intensity and geometry priors of flares, and may fail to distinguish the difference between light sources and flare artifacts. We observe that the conditions of the light source in the image play an important role in the resulting flares. In this paper, we present a deep framework with light source aware guidance for single-image flare removal (SIFR). In particular, we first detect the light source regions and the flare regions separately, and then remove the flare artifacts based on the light source aware guidance. By learning the underlying relationships between the two types of regions, our approach can remove different kinds of flares from the image. In addition, instead of using paired training data which are difficult to collect, we propose the first unpaired flare removal dataset and new cycle-consistency constraints to obtain more diverse examples and avoid manual annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show that our model can be applied to flare effect manipulation (e.g., adding or changing image flares).
