Recently, the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and industrial networks poses new challenges and issues on the QoS requirements such as adaptation, real time, reliability, and energy efficiency. It is expected that important or urgent data need to be delivered in real time with higher reliability than ordinary data. To cope with that, we propose an Adaptive Collision Avoidance Scheduling based on Traffic and Priority (ACASTP) for IoT sensor networks. Our proposed solution employs data prioritizing and traffic adaptive scheme at MAC layer to ensure that higher-priority packets have more privileged access to shared channels. We have also evaluated the developed solution performance using numerical experiments on OMNeT++. The obtained results imply that, comparing to conventional approach, i.e., Timeout Multi-priority-based MAC (TMPQ MAC) protocol, the proposed scheduling scheme improves the network performance significantly.
