We aim to overcome the lack of diversity in responses of current dialogue systems and to develop a dialogue system that is engaging as a conversational partner. We propose a generator-evaluator model that evaluates multiple responses generated by a response generator and selects the best response by an evaluator. By generating multiple responses, we obtain diverse responses. We conduct human evaluations to compare the output of the proposed system with that of a baseline system. The results of the human evaluations showed that the proposed system’s responses were often judged to be better than the baseline system’s, and indicated the effectiveness of the proposed method.
