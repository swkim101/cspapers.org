Mobile cloud gaming enables high-end games on constrained devices by streaming the game content from powerful servers through mobile networks. Mobile networks suffer from highly variable bandwidth, latency, and losses that affect the gaming experience. This paper introduces , an end-to-end cloud gaming framework to minimize the impact of network conditions on the user experience. relies on an end-to-end distortion model adapting the video source rate and the amount of frame-level redundancy based on the measured network conditions. As a result, it minimizes the motion-to-photon (MTP) latency while protecting the frames from losses. We fully implement and evaluate its performance against the state-of-the-art techniques and latest research in real-time mobile cloud gaming transmission on a physical testbed over emulated and real wireless networks. consistently balances MTP latency (<140 ms) and visual quality (>31dB) even in highly variable environments. A user experiment confirms that maximizes the user experience with high perceived video quality, playability, and low user load.
