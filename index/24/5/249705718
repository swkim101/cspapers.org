Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology is emerging as the most promising candidate to support a wide range of applications with high data rate demand. However, due to the high directivity of mmWaves, its links are highly susceptible to barriers from walls and the movement of people. To address these issues, this paper introduces a low-cost and reconfigurable metasurface placed in the environment to reshape and resteer mmWave beams. The metasurface consists of many unit-cells, each acting as a phase shifter for signals going through it. By encoding the phase shifting values, the metasurface can reshape and resteer mmWave beams, thereby enabling a fast mmWave beam relay through the wall or redirects the beam power to another direction when a human body blocks the line-of-sight path. Preliminary simulated results show our designed metasurface can perform accurate beam steering within a field-of-view of [-60°, 60°]. And even with the small-size prototype (16 × 16 array of unit-cells), the metasurface enables up to 10.8 dB signal strength improvement.
