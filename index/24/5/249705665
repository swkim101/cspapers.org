Software Defined Radios (SDRs) combine a universal radio frontend with flexible processing. The radio frontend can be tuned to capture various wireless signals, while software processing allows quick and scalable deployment for diverse applications. SDRs seem like a good fit for the ever-evolving needs of today's spectrum usage: SDRs can be deployed today, then managed and upgraded with software to support the needs of tomorrow. However, the prevailing architecture of SDRs prevent real-time observation of wideband RF signals due to backhaul and processing resource constraints.
