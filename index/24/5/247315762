The emergence of fake media that can be easily created by technology has the potential to generate potent misinformation causing harm to both society and individuals. To tackle the issue, we have organized the Trusted Media Challenge (TMC) to explore how Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies could be leveraged to combat fake media. To enable further research, we are releasing the dataset from the TMC, consists of 4,380 fake and 2,563 real videos, with various video and audio manipulation methods employed to produce different types of fake media. We have also carried out a user study to demonstrate the quality of the TMC dataset and to compare the performance of humans and AI models. The results show that the TMC dataset can fool human participants in many cases. The TMC dataset is available for research purposes upon request via tmc-dataset@aisingapore.org.
