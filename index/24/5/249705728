As the electric (e-) scooter market grows rapidly, e-scooter thefts are becoming a major issue. To mitigate this problem, we design, implement and evaluate BEAS, a Battery-Enabled Authentication System to provide e-scooters with an additional layer of anti-theft protection. Installed on commodity e-scooters as an add-on module, BEAS allows users to customize their passwords for activating e-scooters in the form of pre-defined on/off patterns of the scooter lamp, authenticates users by examining the password based on the thus-generated voltage, and immobilizes e-scooters based on the authentication results by controlling the battery output power. Compared to other existing/potential anti-theft solutions for e-scooters, BEAS has the advantages of being resistant to wireless hacking (i.e., a well-known cyber vulnerability of car keys/keyfobs) and convenient as users are not required to (un)install BEAS every time the e-scooter is parked or carry any additional tokens. We will demonstrate a proof-of-concept prototype of BEAS in this demo.
