We propose a theoretical framework of multi-way similarity to model real-valued data into hypergraphs for clustering via spectral embedding.
 For graph cut based spectral clustering, it is common to model real-valued data into graph by modeling pairwise similarities using kernel function.
 This is because the kernel function has a theoretical connection to the graph cut.
 For problems where using multi-way similarities are more suitable than pairwise ones, it is natural to model as a hypergraph, which is generalization of a graph.
 However, although the hypergraph cut is well-studied, there is not yet established a hypergraph cut based framework to model multi-way similarity.
 In this paper, we formulate multi-way similarities by exploiting the theoretical foundation of kernel function.
 We show a theoretical connection between our formulation and hypergraph cut in two ways, generalizing both weighted kernel k-means and the heat kernel, by which we justify our formulation.
 We also provide a fast algorithm for spectral clustering.
 Our algorithm empirically shows better performance than existing graph and other heuristic modeling methods.
