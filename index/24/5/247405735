Web applications and services are increasingly important in a distributed internet filled with diverse cloud services and applications, each of which enable the completion of narrowly defined tasks. Given the explosion in the scale and diversity of such services, their composition and integration for achieving complex user goals remains a challenging task for end-users and requires a lot of development effort when specified by hand. We present a demonstration of the Goal Oriented Flow Assistant (GOFA) system, which provides a natural language solution to generate workflows for application integration. Our tool is built on a three-step pipeline: it first uses Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) to parse utterances; it then uses a knowledge graph to validate candidates; and finally uses an AI planner to compose the candidate flow. We provide a video demonstration of the deployed system as part of our submission.
