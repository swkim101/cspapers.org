Remote coaching for sports is challenged by the lack of 3D spatial communication. While athletes send live or recorded videos to their coaches, these 2D representations fail to capture the spatial relationships of the body, limiting the ability to understand timing, weight distribution, and smoothness in an athletic movement. This demonstration presents Augmented Coach, an AR sports coaching platform for coaches to remotely view, manipulate, and annotate athletic movements in 3D augmented space. Also, this demonstration provides an adaptive platform to study real-time efficient volumetric data transmission between remotely connected devices, including over 5G cellular networks.
