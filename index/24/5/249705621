5G networks are being deployed rapidly across the world and have opened door to many uplink-oriented, bandwidth-intensive applications such as Augmented Reality and Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV). However, the roll-out is still in the early phase and the nature of deployment also varies across different geographic regions of the world. In this demo, we present NextG-UP, an open-source Android-based tool designed to help understand the performance and evolution of 5G networks around the world. The crowd-sourcing mobile app collects various cellular network metrics and runs a short uplink throughput/latency test.
