In this work, a modified perturbs and observes (P&O) technique is used in the hybrid power generation system with power management. There are several algorithms for extracting the maximum power point (MPP) provided from the PV generator; P & O algorithm has a good performance, ease of implementation by analog and digital electronics. However, this algorithm has disadvantages because it oscillates at the point of maximum power and has a relatively long convergence time; therefore, a modification is made to the P & O algorithm in order to reduce setup time and oscillations in the MPP. The proposed system allows optimal use of the photovoltaic (PV) system and the DFIG wind proves its efficiency under variable load conditions. The model is implemented in the MATLAB / Simulink platform.
