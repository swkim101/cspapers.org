The rapid growth of i-memory computing powered by data-intensive applications has increased demand for DRAM in servers. However, a DRAM-based system can be limiting for modern workloads because of its capacity, cost, and power consumption characteristics. Hybrid memory systems, which consist of different types of memory, such as DRAM and persistent memory, can help address many of these limitations. One promising direction that has been explored in the recent literature involves introducing persistent memory devices as a second memory tier that is directly exposed to the CPU. The resulting tiered memory design must address the fundamental challenge of placing the right data in the right memory tier at the right time while minimizing overhead. We present MULTI -CLOCK, an efficient, low-overhead hybrid memory system that relies on a unique page selection technique for tier placement. MULTl-CLOCKâ€™s page selection captures both page access recency and frequency, and enables moving pages to appropriate tiers at the right time within hybrid memory systems. We implemented a Linux-based, NUMA-aware version of MULTI-CLOCK that is entirely transparent and backward compatible with any existing application. Our evaluation with diverse real-world applications such as graph processing and key-value stores shows that MULTI -CLOCK can improve the average throughput by as much as 352% when compared with several state-of-the-art techniques for tiered memory.
