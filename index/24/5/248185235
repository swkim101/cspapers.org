Despite active privacy research on sophisticated web tracking techniques (e.g., fingerprinting, cache collusion, bounce tracking, CNAME cloaking), most tracking on the web is basic “stateful” tracking enabled by classical browser storage policies sharing per-site storage across all HTTP contexts. Alternative, privacy-preserving storage policies, especially for third-party contexts, have been proposed and even deployed, but these can break websites that presume traditional, non-partitioned storage. Such breakage discourages privacy-preserving experimentation, cementing the dismal status quo. Our work measures the privacy vs. compatibility trade-offs of representative third-party storage policies to enable design of browsers that are both compatible and privacy respecting. Our contributions include web-scale measurements of page behaviors under multiple third-party storage policies inspired by production browsers. We define metrics for measuring aggregate effects on web privacy and compatibility, including a novel system for quantitatively estimating aggregate website breakage under different policies. We find that making third-party storage partitioned by first-party, and lifetimes by site-session achieves the best privacy and compatibility trade-off. We provide complete measurement datasets and storage policy implementations.
