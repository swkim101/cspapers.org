Augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) headsets have attracted millions of users and gained predictable popularity. However, long-period usage of immersive technology may lead to health issues (e.g., cybersickness, anxiety). In this poster, we design a low-cost and personalized healthcare monitoring system grounded on vital sign tracking (i.e., breathing and heartbeat rate tracking), by exploiting built-in AR/VR motion sensors. The key insight is that the conductive vibrations induced by chest and heart movements can propagate through the user's cranial bones, thereby vibrating the AR/VR headset mounted on the user's head. To realize this system, we design signal processing techniques to cancel the human motions and derive the periods of breathing and heartbeat through frequency-domain analyses. We further design a user identification scheme based on respiratory and cardiac biometrics, which works with vital sign monitoring to provide personalized healthcare recommendations. Our experiment shows that the proposed scheme can achieve less than 5.7% error rate on breathing/heartbeat rate estimation and 95% accuracy on user identification.
