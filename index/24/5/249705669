This paper presents the first real-world demonstration of a vision-aided 28 GHz mmWave transmission with a joint Tx-Rx beam tracking for 5G communications. This demonstration employs the architecture of the joint Tx-Rx beam tracking which is designed to update Tx and Rx beams simultaneously based on computer vision with deep learning model. For the demonstration setup, we build a complete end-to-end real-time 5G 28 GHz system testbed. Through this demonstration, we showcase how the presented vision-aided mmWave transmission can effectively sustain a high-throughput link despite Tx-Rx misalignment induced by user mobility.
