The short lifespan of conventional smartphone batteries leads to toxic waste and increases replacement costs. In addition, contemporary devices require reliable electrical infrastructure which remains unavailable in major parts of the developing world. To address these problems, we propose a BAttery-free Mobile Interactive device (BaMbI), which aims to offer a scaled down set of smartphone features. BaMbI is based around an ARM Cortex M33 module with integrated LTE-M. In place of a battery, BaMbI uses a solar panel and an array of super-capacitors that offer sustainable operation and that can be fully charged in under one minute when mains power becomes available.
