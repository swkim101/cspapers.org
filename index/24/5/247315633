Guidance robots that can guide people and avoid various obstacles, could potentially be owned by more visually impaired people at a fairly low cost. Most of the previous guidance robots for the visually impaired ignored the human response behavior and comfort, treating the human as an appendage dragged by the robot, which can lead to imprecise guidance of the human and sudden changes in the traction force experienced by the human. In this paper, we propose a novel quadruped guidance robot system with a comfort-based concept. We design a controllable traction device that can adjust the length and force between human and robot to ensure comfort. To allow the human to be guided safely and comfortably to the target position in complex environments, our proposed human motion planner can plan the traction force with the force-based human motion model. To track the planned force, we also propose a robot motion planner that can generate the specific robot motion command and design the force control device. Our system has been deployed on Unitree Laikago quadrupedal platform and validated in real-world scenarios. (Video11Video demonstration: https://youtu.be/gd-RcYOqGuo.)
