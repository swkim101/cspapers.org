Video deblurring has achieved remarkable progress thanks to the success of deep neural networks. Most methods solve for the deblurring end-to-end with limited information propagation from the video sequence. However, different frame regions exhibit different characteristics and should be provided with corresponding relevant information. To achieve fine-grained deblurring, we designed a memory branch to memorize the blurry-sharp feature pairs in the memory bank, thus providing useful information for the blurry query input. To enrich the memory of our memory bank, we further designed a bidirectional recurrency and multi-scale strategy based on the memory bank. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods while keeping the model complexity and inference time low.
