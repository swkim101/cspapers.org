Traditional forms of cyber security education mainly focus on knowledge transmission, which means that knowledge is perceived as a tangible object being transferred from an expert (i.e., the teacher) to a beginner. When practiced well, the learner may acquire such knowledge, but not the resilience to apply it in various contexts [1], [2]. This is especially troubling for the cyber security domain, given the dynamic and constantly changing nature of the field and the environments in which it is required. We therefore need forms of education that aim at understanding the interdisciplinary nature of the field of cyber security as well as at the development of joint action in context: being able to quickly analyse and understand evolving and possibly previously unseen situations and take collaborative action to prevent, detect and recover from incidents.
