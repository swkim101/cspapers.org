A multi-agent system modeling language (MAS-ML) that extends the UML (Unified Modeling Language) is proposed here based on a conceptual framework (metamodel) called TAO (Taming Agents and Objects). The most important difference between our approach and others presented in the literature is our clear definition and representation of the abstractions and behavioral features that compose MASs. Extensive experimentation is being used to access the expressiveness of models represented in MAS-ML and the ease to implement a multi-agent system from a specification expressed in our notation.
