Adapting to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is an inevitable shift due to stable quantum computers getting closer to fruition. As our lives are getting more entangled with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, a quantum computer attack will be even more devastating. In this work, we evaluate the performance of PQC algorithms on IoT devices. Our empirical results show that PQC algorithms, besides their tolerance against quantum computer attacks, have the potential to be on par with typical asymmetric encryption algorithms from the TLS protocol.
