To enhance anti-theft protection of vehicles, we present Battery Sleuth (Bleuth), a novel "physical" vehicle immobilizer that is immune to the common cyber-attack vectors of car keys/keyfobs. Bleuth uses the common 12V vehicle batteries to authenticate the driver with encrypted power-line communication and then control the vehicle's drivability by regulating the battery output power based on the authentication results, hence (im)mobilizing the vehicle without requiring drivers to carry any additional token.
