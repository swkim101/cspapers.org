RAN Intelligent Control (RIC) has developed in parallel with Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) as a means of utilizing newly available interfaces. Focus has been largely on non-realtime (non-RT: > 1 sec) dealing with RAN management and offline training, and near-realtime (near-RT: 10 ms to 1 sec) dealing with UE load balancing and RAN configuration. We contend that the true power of RIC can be unleashed only with realtime (RT: < 100 μs) measurement, optimization, and control of RAN resources, corresponding to the cellular transmission time interval (TTI: 125 μs to 1 ms).
