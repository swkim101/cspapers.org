Measurement-based WCET methods are reliable as long as we know all the application behaviors at design-time. In particular, we need to observe all the possible execution time behaviors before the actual system run-time to get a reliable estimation. This is, unfortunately, difficult to achieve. In this work, we propose an online monitoring framework with the goal to detect, at run-time, unexpected application behaviors and trigger the probabilistic-WCET re-estimation when needed. The online monitoring and estimation framework allows dealing with unexpected situations, such as never-seen applications, faults, or incorrect offline estimations. The proposed approach is tested with simulated and real data.
