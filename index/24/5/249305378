We present D ONAR , a system enabling anonymous VoIP with good quality-of-experience (QoE) over Tor. No individual Tor link can match VoIP networking requirements. D ONAR bridges this gap by spreading VoIP trafﬁc over several links. It combines active performance monitoring, dynamic link selection, adaptive trafﬁc scheduling, and redundancy at no extra bandwidth cost. D ONAR enables high QoE: latency remains under 360 ms for 99% of VoIP packets during most (86%) 5-minute and 90-minute calls.
