To prevent tracking a Wi-Fi device based on its MAC address, several operating systems have adopted MAC address randomization to conceal its factory-assigned address. This feature benefits users when their devices scan for networks, but a flaw arises when timing between transmissions stays consistent despite MAC address randomization in use. We present a defense mechanism, implemented with the Netlink library, against a time correlation attack for probe request packets on Wi-Fi devices. We show how adding random jitter to probe request transmissions renders a timing correlation attack infeasible to track devices during network discovery.
