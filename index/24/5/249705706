This demonstration shows a working prototype of IDEA, Intelligent Divine Eye on Air through multi-UAV collaborative inference, to improve the throughput and accuracy of onboard object detection. Different from most existing UAV airborne object detection systems relying single UAV to run the convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based inference independently, IDEA leverages the abundant resources of multiple UAVs in a swarm, and collaboratively executes the inference task. Specifically, IDEA divides the CNN model into multiple submodels (each consisting of several successive layers), and distributes each submodel to a UAV, where the execution sequence of the submodels is coordinated to output the final prediction. The prominent advantage of IDEA lies in that, it can not only run highly accurate complex CNN models, but also perform the object detection tasks in a pipeline manner, which thus boosts high detection accuracy and frame rate. IDEA prototype with three self-constructed real-world UAVs shows ~2.6Ã— frame rate improvement over that with one single UAV, while achieving higher detection accuracy.
