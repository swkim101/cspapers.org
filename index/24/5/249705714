In this paper, a novel Edge-IoT framework is proposed which interconnects the user's smartphones with the robotic system for human-robot interaction. The user sends speech commands using mobile application which is processed by the framework and sent to the robotic system. The robotic system executes the task and sends a completion message to the user through the framework. Preliminary experiments conducted by sending multiple requests to the framework to perform a robotic task showed that the framework is able to handle multiple requests, send commands to the robotic system to perform the robotic task and send completion messages to the user efficiently.
