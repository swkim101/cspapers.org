We demonstrate Nuberu. The scenario consists of a DU under test (DuT), and one or more DUs sharing computing resources. A dashboard lets us control (𝑖) the type of DuT: “Baseline”, implemented with a legacy full-fledged eNB, or Nuberu; (𝑖𝑖) the number of competing vDUs; and (𝑖𝑖𝑖) their SNR. A second screen shows real-time metrics: (𝑖) the processing latency of the TBs from each vDU instance; (𝑖𝑖) the throughput performance of DuT; (𝑖𝑖𝑖) the processing latency of DU jobs from DuT; and (𝑖𝑣) the ratio of latency constraint violations of DuT jobs. We show how the throughput attained by the baseline DU approach collapses upon sufficiently high computing interference from the competing DUs. Conversely, we show that the DU design introduced in [3] preserves reliability irrespective of the computing interference.
