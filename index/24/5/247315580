Human group detection, which splits crowd of people into groups, is an important step for video-based human social activity analysis. The core of human group detection is the human social relation representation and division. In this paper, we propose a new two-stage multi-head framework for human group detection. In the first stage, we propose a human behavior simulator head to learn the social relation feature embedding, which is self-supervisely trained by leveraging the socially grounded multi-person behavior relationship. In the second stage, based on the social relation embedding, we develop a self-attention inspired network for human group detection. Remarkable performance on two state-of-the-art large-scale benchmarks, i.e., PANDA and JRDBGroup, verifies the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Benefiting from the self-supervised social relation embedding, our method can provide promising results with very few (labeled) training data. We will release the source code to the public.
