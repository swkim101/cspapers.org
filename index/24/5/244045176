The partitioned scheduling of periodic and sporadic task systems upon multiprocessor platforms (both identical and heterogeneous) is considered. The computational complexity of a large number of such partitioned schedulability problems is examined. New lower and upper bounds on complexity are presented for several problems. Some problems are pigeonholed into their precise complexity classes in this way. A list of problems for which exact classification remains open is compiled.
