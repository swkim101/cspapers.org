Coarse-grained reconfigurable accelerators (CGRAs) are a promising accelerator design choice that strikes a balance between performance and adaptability to different computing patterns across various applications domains. Designing a CGRA for a specific application domain involves enormous software/hardware engineering effort. Recent research works explore loop transformations, functional unit types, network topology, and memory size to identify optimal CGRA designs given a set of kernels from a specific application domain. Unfortunately, the impact of functional units with different precision support has rarely been investigated. To address this gap, we propose ASAP - a hardware/software co-design framework that automatically identifies and synthesizes optimal precision-aware CGRA for a set of applications of interest. Our evaluation shows that ASAP generates specialized designs 3.2X, 4.21X, and 5.8X more efficient (in terms of performance per unit of energy or area) than non-specialized homogeneous CGRAs, for the scientific computing, embedded, and edge machine learning domains, respectively, with limited accuracy loss. Moreover, ASAP provides more efficient designs than other state-of-the-art synthesis frameworks for specialized CGRAs.
