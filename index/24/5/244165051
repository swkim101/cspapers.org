This paper utilizes IEEE 802.11aa GCR Block Ack and TXOP-Bursting for lossless groupcast of computer data. Both mechanisms are mainly for audiovisual communications. We adopt them for computer data groupcast. We propose a dynamic control method of EDCA parameters to allow TXOP-Bursting without interfering with other traffic. We perform a computer simulation to evaluate the required time for lossless transmission. As a result, we show that GCR Block Ack using TXOP-Bursting with the dynamic control of the EDCA parameters can shorten the time needed for lossless transmission.
