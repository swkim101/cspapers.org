Motion planning for complex dynamic systems such as helicopters is a challenging problem due to non-holonomic and nonlinear differential constraints. Approaches for optimal kinodynamics motion planning have only been demonstrated for simple dynamic systems such as Dubins car or linear systems. In this paper we present Closed-loop FMT* (CL-FMT*) which is an extension of FMT* [7] that uses closed-loop prediction. With closed-loop prediction the computationally intense two-point-boundary-value steering procedure can be avoided. We describe the effectiveness of CL-FMT* compared to CL-RRT*. We then demonstrate the use of CL-FMT* for helicopter landing trajectory planning with realistic dynamics constrains.
