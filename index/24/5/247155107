This article presents our generative model for rhythm action games together with applications in business operation. Rhythm action games are video games in which the player is challenged to issue commands at the right timings during a music session. The timings are rendered in the chart, which consists of visual symbols, called notes, flying through the screen. We introduce our deep generative model, GenéLive!, which outperforms the state-of-the-art model by taking into account musical structures through beats and temporal scales. Thanks to its favorable performance, GenéLive! was put into operation at KLab Inc., a Japan-based video game developer, and reduced the business cost of chart generation by as much as half. The application target included the phenomenal "Love Live!", which has more than 10 million users across Asia and beyond, and is one of the few rhythm action franchises that has led the online era of the genre. In this article, we evaluate the generative performance of GenéLive! using production datasets at KLab as well as open datasets for reproducibility, while the model continues to operate in their business. Our code and the model, tuned and trained using a supercomputer, are publicly available.
