While datasets with single-label supervision have propelled rapid advances in image classification, additional annotations are necessary in order to quantitatively assess how models make predictions. To this end, for a subset of ImageNet samples, we collect segmentation masks for the entire object and 18 informative attributes. We call this dataset RIVAL10 (RIch Visual Attributes with Localization), consisting of roughly 26k instances over 10 classes. Using RIVAL10, we evaluate the sensitivity of a broad set of models to noise corruptions in foregrounds, backgrounds and attributes. In our analysis, we consider diverse state-of-the-art architectures (ResNets, Transformers) and training procedures (CLIP, SimCLR, DeiT, Adversarial Training). We find that, somewhat surprisingly, in ResNets, adversarial training makes models more sensitive to the background compared to foreground than standard training. Similarly, contrastively-trained models also have lower relative foreground sensitivity in both transformers and ResNets. Lastly, we observe intriguing adaptive abilities of transformers to increase relative foreground sensitivity as corruption level increases. Using saliency methods, we automatically discover spurious features that drive the background sensitivity of models and assess alignment of saliency maps with foregrounds. Finally, we quantitatively study the attribution problem for neural features by comparing feature saliency with ground-truth localization of semantic attributes.
