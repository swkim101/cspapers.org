A standard practice of deploying deep neural networks is to apply the same architecture to all the input instances. However, a fixed architecture may not be suitable for different data with high diversity. To boost the model capacity, existing methods usually employ larger convolutional kernels or deeper network layers, which incurs prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing Differentiable Dynamic Wirings (DDW), which learns the instance-aware connectivity that creates different wiring patterns for different instances. 1) Specifically, the network is initialized as a complete directed acyclic graph, where the nodes represent convolutional blocks and the edges represent the connection paths. 2) We generate edge weights by a learnable module, Router, and select the edges whose weights are larger than a threshold, to adjust the connectivity of the neural network structure. 3) Instead of using the same path of the network, DDW aggregates features dynamically in each node, which allows the network to have more representation power.To facilitate effective training, we further represent the network connectivity of each sample as an adjacency matrix. The matrix is updated to aggregate features in the forward pass, cached in the memory, and used for gradient computing in the backward pass. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with several mainstream architectures, including MobileNetV2, ResNet, ResNeXt, and RegNet. Extensive experiments are performed on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection, which demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization ability of our approach.
