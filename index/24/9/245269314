Hydrostatic transmission has shown promising results for enabling the manipulator to achieve low effective inertia, high stiffness, and high torque density. However, the incompressibility of fluid causes the lack of compliance, so that it could not provide intrinsic safety. Thus, it would be advantageous to introduce series compliance on the hydrostatic manipulator for adjusting stiffness depending on the situation. Here, we developed a safe and high-performance hydrostatic actuator based on the switchable stiffness mechanism implemented with an air spring and solenoid valve. The hydrostatic transmission is implemented with rolling diaphragms to attain zero fluid leakage and low seal friction. Air spring is serially connected to hydraulic lines for achieving compliance. Its modes (i.e., stiff and compliant modes) can be rapidly switched by modulating water flow via the solenoid valve. Block stiffness experiment shows that the stiffness of stiff mode is 9.63 times stiffer than one of compliant mode at 100 kPa. We experimentally demonstrated that compliant mode could mitigate the impact force to the level that a tangerine would not be crushed. The stiffness was switched within 12 ms; hence it is fast enough to be used for feedback application with vision or tactile sensors. As a result, the developed actuator can ensure safety without sacrificing the dynamic performance, owing to the simple and rapidly switchable stiffness mechanism.
