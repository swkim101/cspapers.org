Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicles to Infrastructure (V2I) are key communication technologies for intelligent transportation system (ITS) to exchange the transparent information such as GPS positions, velocities, traffic status and environment conditions between vehicles as well as between vehicles and infrastructure on the road. These technologies support preventing accidents by releasing a warning as well as reducing traffic congestion. In this paper, design and implementation of a small-size WiFi-based prototype of a V2V-V2I communication unit for low speed vehicles is presented. WiFi, a popular wireless communication technique, was chosen since it is not only a cost-effective choice, but it is also suited for low-speed vehicles like motorbikes, bikes, tracking UAVs, and ground robots. This work analyzes and implements essential use cases and related algorithms to demonstrate the efficiency of V2V and V2I communication using WiFi technology. The results demonstrate the proposed unitâ€™s technological feasibility in real-world vehicles.
