Research output related to digital nudging has increased ten-fold over the last five years. Nudging in the digital realm differs from its analog counterpart in important ways. For instance, online, choice architectures can be interconnected and personalized using real time data. In the face of this development, it is crucial to understand the current state of the literature and to map out possible research gaps. This paper addresses this issue and provides a systematic review of empirical studies where digital nudges have been evaluated. The systematic review covers 73 peer-reviewed papers containing 109 separate studies where 231 digital nudges have been evaluated. Our results lead to nine open research questions to be addressed in the future by the research community.
