The ongoing expansion and addition of new features in software development bring inefficiency and vulnerabilities into programs, resulting in an increased attack surface with higher possibility of exploitation. Creating customized software systems that contain just-enough features and yet satisfy specific user needs is currently an extremely slow, build-to-order process. In this paper, we propose MORPH, an Interactive Program Feature Customization framework to provide broad capabilities for automated program feature identification and feature customization. Our preliminary results show that MORPH can identify program features at an average accuracy of 92.7% and swiftly generate variations of self-contained, customized programs in an unsupervised fashion.
