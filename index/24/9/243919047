The modern FPGA placement problem has become much more challenging than ever with various emerging design constraints, such as the location (including relative location (RLOC) and location range) and chain constraints, which have not been considered in the literature. In this paper, we propose a combinatorial algorithm for FPGA legalization with location and chain constraints. We first identify a virtual range to cluster an instance with the RLOC constraint and formulate minimum cost integer linear programming. Besides, we use an adaptive algorithm to deal with the chain-aware legalization problem for better quality and runtime trade-offs. Finally, a legalization algorithm based on minimum cost maximum flow (MCMF) is used to improve the solution quality further. Compared with the state-of-the-art work, experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve respectively 4.4% and 4.9% smaller average and maximum movements, 1.7% smaller routed wirelength, and 7.6% shorter routing runtime
