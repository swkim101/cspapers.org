Event cameras attract researchers' attention due to their low power consumption, high dynamic range, and extremely high temporal resolution. Learning models on event-based object classification have recently achieved massive success by accumulating sparse events into dense frames to apply traditional 2D learning methods. Yet, these approaches necessitate heavy-weight models and are with high computational complexity due to the redundant information introduced by the sparse-to-dense conversion, limiting the potential of event cameras on real-life applications. This study aims to address the core problem of balancing accuracy and model complexity for event-based classification models. To this end, we introduce a novel graph representation for event data to exploit their sparsity better and customize a lightweight voxel graph convolutional neural network (EV-VGCNN) for event-based classification. Specifically, (1) using voxel-wise vertices rather than previous point-wise inputs to explicitly exploit regional 2D semantics of event streams while keeping the sparsity; (2) proposing a multi-scale feature relational layer (MFRL) to extract spatial and motion cues from each vertex discriminatively concerning its distances to neighbors. Comprehensive experiments show that our model can advance state-of-the-art classification accuracy with extremely low model complexity (merely 0.84M parameters).
