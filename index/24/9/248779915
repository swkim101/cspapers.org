LM-BFF (CITATION) achieves significant few-shot performance by using auto-generated prompts and adding demonstrations similar to an input example. To improve the approach of LM-BFF, this paper proposes LM-BFF-MSâ€”better few-shot fine-tuning of language models with multiple soft demonstrations by making its further extensions, which include 1) prompts with multiple demonstrations based on automatic generation of multiple label words; and 2) soft demonstration memory which consists of multiple sequences of globally shared word embeddings for a similar context. Experiments conducted on eight NLP tasks show that LM-BFF-MS leads to improvements over LM-BFF on five tasks, particularly achieving 94.0 and 90.4 on SST-2 and MRPC, respectively.
