Analyzing microblogs where we post what we experience enables us to perform various applications such as social-trend analysis and entity recommendation. To track emerging trends in a variety of areas, we want to categorize information on emerging entities ( e.g., Avatar 2) in microblog posts according to their types ( e.g., Film). We thus introduce a new entity typing task that assigns a ﬁne-grained type to each emerging entity when a burst of posts containing that entity is ﬁrst observed in a microblog. The challenge is to perform typing from noisy microblog posts without relying on prior knowledge of the target entity. To tackle this task, we build large-scale Twitter datasets for English and Japanese using time-sensitive distant supervision. We then propose a modular neural typing model that encodes not only the entity and its contexts but also meta information in multiple posts. To type ‘homo-graphic’ emerging entities ( e.g., ‘Go’ means an emerging programming language and a classic board game), which contexts are noisy, we devise a context selector that ﬁnds related contexts of the target entity. Experiments on the Twitter datasets conﬁrm the effectiveness of our typing model and the context selector.
