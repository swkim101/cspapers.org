Automatic product description generation for e-commerce has witnessed significant advancement in the past decade. Product copy- writing aims to attract users' interest and improve user experience by highlighting product characteristics with textual descriptions. As the services provided by e-commerce platforms become diverse, it is necessary to adapt the patterns of automatically-generated descriptions dynamically. In this paper, we report our experience in deploying an E-commerce Prefix-based Controllable Copywriting Generation (EPCCG) system into the JD.com e-commerce product recommendation platform. The development of the system contains two main components: 1) copywriting aspect extraction; 2) weakly supervised aspect labelling; 3) text generation with a prefix-based language model; and 4) copywriting quality control. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed EPCCG. In addition, we introduce the deployed architecture which cooperates the EPCCG into the real-time JD.com e-commerce recommendation platform and the significant payoff since deployment.
