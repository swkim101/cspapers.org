Deep learning and symbolic reasoning are complementary techniques for an intelligent system. However, principled combinations of these techniques are typically limited in scalability, rendering them ill-suited for real-world applications. We pro-pose Scallop, a system that builds upon probabilistic deductive databases, to bridge this gap. The key insight underlying Scallop is a provenance framework that introduces a tunable parameter to specify the level of reasoning granularity. Scallop thereby i) generalizes exact probabilistic reasoning, ii) asymptotically reduces computational cost, and iii) provides relative accuracy guarantees. On synthetic tasks involving mathematical and logical reasoning, Scallop scales signiﬁcantly better without sacriﬁcing accuracy compared to DeepProbLog, a principled neural logic programming approach. Scallop also scales to a newly created real-world Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark that requires multi-hop reasoning, achieving 84.22% accuracy and outperforming two VQA-tailored models based on Neural Module Networks and transformers by 12.42% and 21.66% respectively.
