The relationships that exist between entities can be a reliable indicator for classifying sensitive information, such as commercially sensitive information. For example, the relation person-IsDirectorOf-company can indicate whether an individual’s salary should be considered as sensitive personal information. Representations of such relations are often learned using a knowledge graph to produce embeddings for relation types, generalised across different entity-pairs. However, a relation type may or may not correspond to a sensitivity depending on the entities that partic-ipate to the relation. Therefore, generalised relation embeddings are typically insufﬁcient for classifying sensitive information. In this work, we propose a novel method for representing entities and relations within a single embedding to better capture the relationship between the entities. Moreover, we show that our proposed entity-relation-entity embedding approach can signiﬁcantly improve (McNemar’s test, p < 0 . 05 ) the effectiveness of sensitivity classiﬁcation, compared to classiﬁcation approaches that leverage relation embedding approaches from the literature (0.426 F 1 vs 0.413 F 1 ).
