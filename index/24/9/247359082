In the paper, we study the underdamped Langevin diffusion (ULD) with stronglyconvex potential consisting of finite summation of N smooth components, and propose an efficient discretization method, which requires O(N + d 1 3N 2 3 /ε 2 3 ) gradient evaluations to achieve ε-error (in √ E∥·∥2 distance) for approximating d-dimensional ULD. Moreover, we prove a lower bound of gradient complexity as Ω(N + d 1 3N 2 3 /ε 2 3 ), which indicates that our method is optimal in dependence of N , ε, and d. In particular, we apply our method to sample the strongly-log-concave distribution and obtain gradient complexity better than all existing gradient based sampling algorithms. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data show that our new method consistently outperforms the existing ULD approaches.
