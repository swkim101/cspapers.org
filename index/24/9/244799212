Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) produce state-of-the-art view synthesis results, but are slow to render, requiring hundreds of network evaluations per pixel to approximate a volume rendering integral. Baking NeRFs into explicit data structures enables efficient rendering, but results in large memory footprints and, in some cases, quality reduction. Additionally, volumetric representations for view synthesis often struggle to represent challenging view dependent effects such as distorted reflections and refractions. We present a novel neural light field representation that, in contrast to prior work, is fast, memory efficient, and excels at modeling complicated view dependence. Our method supports rendering with a single network evaluation per pixel for small baseline light fields and with only a few evaluations per pixel for light fields with larger baselines. At the core of our approach is a ray-space embedding network that maps 4D ray-space into an intermediate, interpolable latent space. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on dense forward-facing datasets such as the Stanford Light Field dataset. In addition, for forward-facing scenes with sparser inputs we achieve results that are competitive with NeRF-based approaches while providing a better speed/quality/memory trade-off with far fewer network evaluations.
