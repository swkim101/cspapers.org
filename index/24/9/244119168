Discourse analysis has long been known to be fundamental in natural language processing. In this research, we present our insight on discourse-level topic chain (DTC) parsing which aims at discovering new topics and in-vestigating how these topics evolve over time within an article. To address the lack of data, we contribute a new discourse corpus with DTC-style dependency graphs annotated upon news articles. In particular, we ensure the high reliability of the corpus by utilizing a two-step annotation strategy to build the data and ﬁltering out the annotations with low conﬁdence scores. Based on the annotated corpus, we introduce a simple yet robust system for automatic discourse-level topic chain parsing.
