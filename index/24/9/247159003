Providing low latency to end-users while maximizing server utilization and system throughput is crucial for cloud ML servers. NVIDIA's recently announced Ampere GPU architecture provides features to "reconfigure" one large, monolithic GPU into multiple smaller "GPU partitions". Such feature provides cloud ML service providers the ability to utilize the reconfigurable GPU not only for large-batch training but also for small-batch inference with the potential to achieve high resource utilization. We study this emerging GPU architecture with reconfigurability to develop a high-performance multi-GPU ML inference server, presenting a sophisticated partitioning algorithm for reconfigurable GPUs combined with an elastic scheduling algorithm tailored for our heterogeneously partitioned GPU server.
