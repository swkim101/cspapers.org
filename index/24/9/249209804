We apply a novel framework for decomposing and reasoning about free space in an environment to a multi-agent persistent monitoring problem. Our decomposition method represents free space as a collection of ellipsoids associated with a weighted connectivity graph. The same ellipsoids used for reasoning about connectivity and distance during high level planning can be used as state constraints in a Model Predictive Control algorithm to enforce collision-free motion. This structure allows for streamlined implementation in distributed multi-agent tasks in 2D and 3D environments. We illustrate its effectiveness for a team of tracking agents tasked with monitoring a group of target agents. Our algorithm uses the ellipsoid decomposition as a primitive for the coordination, path planning, and control of the tracking agents. Simulations with four tracking agents monitoring fifteen dynamic targets in obstacle-rich environments demonstrate the performance of our algorithm.
