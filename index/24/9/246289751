Uplift modeling is an important task for online advertising and marketing. Advertisers rely on accurate modeling of the uplift effect to formulate, plan and implement their advertising and marketing strategies. Therefore, the capability of effective and efficient uplift modeling is essential for advertising platforms to attract and satisfy their customers (i.e., advertisers). In practical advertising applications, uplift modeling focuses on the estimation of the uplift effect caused by ad exposure. It is not a trivial task to estimate such causal impact of ad exposure at the individual level. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach for explicit uplift modeling, using data collected from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) in large-scale real-world advertising platforms. More specifically, we first introduce the Explicit Uplift Effect Network (EUEN) to explicitly model the uplift effect and demonstrate its advantages in uplift modeling. Then for the exposure uplift effect modeling, we further propose the Explicit Exposure Uplift Effect Network (EEUEN), which can correct the exposure bias for uplift modeling. We evaluate our proposed approach with both public data sets as well as data sets collected from our advertising platform. The significant improvements with respect to various performance metrics demonstrate the advantages of our approach.
