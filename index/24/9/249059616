With the goal of improving security, companies like Apple have moved from requiring 4-digit PINs to 6-digit PINs in contexts like smartphone unlocking. Users with a 4-digit PIN thus must “upgrade” to a 6-digit PIN for the same device or account. In an online user study ( n = 1010), we explore the security of such upgrades. Participants used their own smart-phone to ﬁrst select a 4-digit PIN. They were then directed to select a 6-digit PIN with one of ﬁve randomly assigned justiﬁcations. In an online attack that guesses a small number of common PINs (10–30), we observe that 6-digit PINs are, at best, marginally more secure than 4-digit PINs. To understand the relationship between 4-and 6-digit PINs, we then model targeted attacks for PIN upgrades. We ﬁnd that attackers who know a user’s previous 4-digit PIN perform signiﬁcantly better than those who do not at guessing their 6-digit PIN in only a few guesses using basic heuristics (e.g., appending digits to the 4-digit PIN). Participants who selected a 6-digit PIN when given a “device upgrade” justiﬁcation selected 6-digit PINs that were the easiest to guess in a targeted attack, with the attacker successfully guessing over 25% of the PINs in just 10 attempts, and more than 30% in 30 attempts. Our re-sults indicate that forcing users to upgrade to 6-digit PINs offers limited security improvements despite adding usability burdens. System designers should thus carefully consider this tradeoff before requiring upgrades.
