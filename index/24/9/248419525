Service design has gained tractions in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as an approach to deal with changes of technology design scopes. In the meantime, there are confusions around definitions of service design and its relevance to HCI. Despite the co-existence of interests and confusions, little research has been done for a comprehensive overview of how HCI interprets and adopts service design. This research performed a systematic literature review on extant HCI publications that claim to use service design. The review findings from the 179 publications revealed varying dimensions of service design taken up in HCI, relations between service design scopes and emerging technologies, as well as unclarity to service design in HCI and HCI's current tendency to use service design for the interaction level rather than the system level. We discuss future design and research opportunities for HCI by integrating the system level dimensions of service design.
