User experience (UX) summarizes user perceptions and responses resulting from the interaction with a product, system, or service. The User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) is one standardized instrument for measuring UX. With six scales, it identifies areas in which product improvements will have the highest impact. In this paper, we evaluate the reliability and validity of this questionnaire. The data of N = 1, 121 participants who interacted with one of 23 products indicated an acceptable to good reliability of all scales. The results show, however, that the scales were not independent of each other. Combining perspicuity, efficiency, and dependability to pragmatic aspects as well as novelty and stimulation to hedonic aspects of UX improved the model fit significantly. The systematic variations of product properties and correlations with the System Usability Scale (SUS) in a second experiment with N=499 participants supported the validity of these two factors. Practical implications of the results are discussed.
