Recently, sponsored search has become one of the most lucrative channels for market-ing. As the fundamental basis of sponsored search, relevance modeling has attracted in-creasing attention due to the tremendous prac-tical value. Most existing methods solely rely on the query-keyword pairs. However, keywords are usually short texts with scarce semantic information, which may not precisely reﬂect the underlying advertising intents. In this paper, we investigate the novel problem of advertiser-aware relevance modeling, which leverages the advertisers’ information to bridge the gap between the search intents and advertising purposes. Our motivation lies in incorporating the unsupervised bidding behaviors as the complementary graphs to learn desirable advertiser representations. We further propose a B idding- G raph augmented T riple-based R elevance model BGTR with three towers to deeply fuse the bidding graphs and semantic textual data. Empirically, we evaluate the BGTR model over a large industry dataset, and the experimental results consis-tently demonstrate its superiority.
