We study reachability and shortest paths problems in dynamic directed graphs. Whereas algebraic dynamic data structures supporting edge updates and reachability/distance queries have been known for quite a long time, they do not, in general, allow reporting the underlying paths within the same time bounds, especially against an adaptive adversary. In this paper we develop the first known fully dynamic reachability data structures working against an adaptive adversary and supporting edge updates and path queries for two natural variants: (1) point-to-point path reporting, and (2) single-source reachability tree reporting. For point-to-point queries in DAGs, we achieve O(n1.529) worst-case update and query bounds, whereas for tree reporting in DAGs, the respective worst-case bounds are O(n1.765). More importantly, we show how to lift these algorithms to work on general graphs at the cost of increasing the bounds to n1+5/6+o(1) and making the update times amortized. On the way to accomplishing these goals, we obtain two interesting subresults. We give subquadratic fully dynamic algorithms for topological order (in a DAG), and strongly connected components. To the best of our knowledge, such algorithms have not been described before. Additionally, we provide deterministic incremental data structures for (point-to-point or single-source) reachability and shortest paths that can handle edge insertions and report the respective paths within subquadratic worst-case time bounds. For reachability and (1+є)-approximate shortest paths in weighted directed graphs, these bounds match the best known dynamic matrix inverse-based randomized bounds for fully dynamic reachability [v.d.Brand, Nanongkai and Saranurak, FOCS’19]. For exact shortest paths in unweighted graphs, the obtained bounds in the incremental setting polynomially improve upon the respective best known randomized update/distance query bounds in the fully dynamic setting.
