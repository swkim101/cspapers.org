This paper is concerned with the robust state-feedback stabilization of nonlinear dynamic systems described as uncertain and disturbed Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy bilinear models. By means of the parallel distributed compensation concept, quadratic Lyapunov approach, and Hâˆž synthesis criterion, sufficient global asymptotic stability conditions are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities. A continuous stirred-tank reactor process is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.
