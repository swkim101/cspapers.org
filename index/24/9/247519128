Graph representation learning has attracted tremendous attention due to its remarkable performance in many real-world applications. However, prevailing supervised graph representation learning models for specific tasks often suffer from label sparsity issue as data labeling is always time and resource consuming. In light of this, few-shot learning on graphs (FSLG), which combines the strengths of graph representation learning and few-shot learning together, has been proposed to tackle the performance degradation in face of limited annotated data challenge. There have been many studies working on FSLG recently. In this paper, we comprehensively survey these work in the form of a series of methods and applications. Specifically, we first introduce FSLG challenges and bases, then categorize and summarize existing work of FSLG in terms of three major graph mining tasks at different granularity levels, i.e., node, edge, and graph. Finally, we share our thoughts on some future research directions of FSLG. The authors of this survey have contributed significantly to the AI literature on FSLG over the last few years.
