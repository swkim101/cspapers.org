Large pre-trained language models such as BERT have been the driving force behind recent improvements across many NLP tasks. However, BERT is only trained to predict missing words – either through masking or next sentence prediction – and has no knowledge of lexical, syntactic or semantic information beyond what it picks up through un-supervised pre-training. We propose a novel method to explicitly inject linguistic information in the form of word embeddings into any layer of a pre-trained BERT. When injecting counter-ﬁtted and dependency-based embeddings, the performance improvements on multiple semantic similarity datasets indicate that such information is beneﬁcial and cur-rently missing from the original model. Our qualitative analysis shows that counter-ﬁtted embedding injection is particularly beneﬁcial, with notable improvements on examples that require synonym resolution.
