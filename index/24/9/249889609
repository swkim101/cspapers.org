I study a class of verifiable disclosure games where the sender's preferences are state independent and the receiver's optimal action depends solely on the expected state. In such games, the receiver's preferred equilibria are relatively well studied, but other equilibria are less so. This paper characterizes the sender's preferred equilibria and equilibrium payoff set in this class of games.
