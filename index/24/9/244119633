We introduce and study a problem variant of sentiment analysis, namely the “same sentiment classiﬁcation problem”, where, given a pair of texts, the task is to determine if they have the same sentiment, disregarding the actual sentiment polarity. Among other things, our goal is to enable a more topic-agnostic sentiment classiﬁcation. We study the problem using the Yelp business review dataset, demon-strating how sentiment data needs to be pre-pared for this task, and then carry out sequence pair classiﬁcation using the BERT language model. In a series of experiments, we achieve an accuracy above 83% for category subsets across topics, and 89% on average.
