Point cloud scene flow estimation is of practical importance for dynamic scene navigation in autonomous driving. Since scene flow labels are hard to obtain, current methods train their models on synthetic data and transfer them to real scenes. However, large disparities between existing synthetic datasets and real scenes lead to poor model transfer. We make two major contributions to address that. First, we develop a point cloud collector and scene flow annotator for GTA-V engine to automatically obtain diverse realistic training samples without human intervention. With that, we develop a large-scale synthetic scene flow dataset GTA-SF. Second, we propose a mean-teacher-based domain adaptation framework that leverages self-generated pseudo-labels of the target domain. It also explicitly incorporates shape deformation regularization and surface correspondence refinement to address distortions and misalignments in domain transfer. Through extensive experiments, we show that our GTA-SF dataset leads to a consistent boost in model generalization to three real datasets (i.e., Waymo, Lyft and KITTI) as compared to the most widely used FT3D dataset. Moreover, our framework achieves superior adaptation performance on six source-target dataset pairs, remarkably closing the average domain gap by 60%.
