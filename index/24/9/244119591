There has been a signiﬁcant progress in the ﬁeld of extractive question answering (EQA) in the recent years. However, most of them rely on annotations of answer-spans in the corresponding passages. In this work, we address the problem of EQA when no annotations are present for the answer span, i.e., when the dataset contains only questions and corresponding passages. Our method is based on auto-encoding of the question that performs a question answering (QA) task during encoding and a question generation (QG) task during decoding. Our method performs well in a zero-shot setting and can provide an additional loss to boost performance for EQA.
