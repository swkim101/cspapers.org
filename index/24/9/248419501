We present Patch-O, a novel deformable interface devised as a woven patch that enables diverse movement-based interactions adaptive to garments or on-skin wearing. Patch-O interfaces are uniquely detachable and relocatable soft actuation units that can be sewn or attached to clothing or skin at various locations. To optimize the morphing effect while preserving a slim form factor, we introduce a construction approach that integrates actuators at a structural level and varies the texture and stiffness of the woven substrate locally. We implement three basic actuation primitives, including bending, expanding, and shrinking, and experiment with aggregation parameters to exhaustively extend the design space. A final workshop study inviting textile practitioners to create personalized designs of Patch-O provides insights into the expressiveness of the approach for wearable interactions. We conclude with three applications inspired by usersâ€™ designs and showcase the aesthetic and functional usages enabled by the deformable woven patches.
