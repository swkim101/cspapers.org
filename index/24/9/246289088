Recommending sets of items that include both personalized and compatible items is crucial to personalized styling programs such as Amazonâ€™s Personal Shopper. There is both an extensive literature on learning generic fashion compatibility and also on personalization in fashion. However, recommending pairs of items that the customer would like to wear together is still less studied as it involves learning a compatibility metric personalized to each customer. We propose a new framework (PSA-Net) to learn compatibility that is personalized to the customer - a customer dependent subspace learning framework where attention weights of subspaces are learnt using customer representations. We evaluate our approach on compatibility data provided directly by customers. Our approach outperforms the non-personalized approach in predicting compatibility preferences of customers. In other words, an approach that learns a common compatibility metric for all customers. In addition, we compare the significance of feedback collected directly from customers to that of data collected from human stylists in predicting compatibility for Amazon customers.
