Sememes are deﬁned as the atomic units to describe the semantic meaning of concepts. Due to the difﬁculty of manually annotating sememes and the inconsistency of annotations between experts, the lexical sememe prediction task has been proposed. However, previous methods heavily rely on word or character embeddings, and ignore the ﬁne-grained information. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-training method which is designed to better incorporate the internal information of Chinese character. The G lyph enhanced C hinese C haracter representation ( GCC ) is used to assist sememe prediction. We experiment and evaluate our model on HowNet, which is a fa-mous sememe knowledge base. The experimental results show that our method outperforms existing non-external information models.
