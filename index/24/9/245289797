A mobile robot that follows behind humans in structured environments has to face the challenge of full occlusion caused by the walls when the target person makes a turn at the corridor intersections. This may result in short-term, even a permanent loss of the target from the field of view of the Human-Following Robots (HFRs). Concerning this issue, a novel side-by-side following method for HFRs is addressed. In this paper, HFRs detect the legs of target person and different types of corridor intersections using the onboard laser scanner at first. Then, we provide a corridor detector method to cluster the geometric structure constraint between the target and corridor intersections. At last, a Side-by-side Following Leg Tracker (SFLT) is designed by integrating the laser information, in order to increase the visible time of the target person, while the target is turning at the corridor intersections. The corridor detector method and SFLT method have been simulated in MATLAB. Moreover, the approach of side-by-side following has been implemented in the Robot Operating System (ROS) of real-life robots in the corridor environment. The results from simulation and practical experiment show that, by using our method, HFRs were able to successfully follow the human92.0% while a mobile robot meeting potential occlusions at corridor intersections.
