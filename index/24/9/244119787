Online tenant reviews of multifamily residen-tial properties present a unique source of information for commercial real estate investing and research. Real estate professionals frequently read tenant reviews to uncover property-related issues that are otherwise difﬁcult to detect, a process that is both biased and time-consuming. Using this as motiva-tion, we asked whether a text classiﬁcation-based approach can automate the detection of four carefully deﬁned, major quality-of-life issues: severe crime, noise nuisance, pest bur-den, and parking difﬁculties. We aggregate 5.5 million tenant reviews from ﬁve sources and use two-stage crowdsourced labeling on 0.1% of the data to produce high-quality labels for subsequent text classiﬁcation. Follow-ing ﬁne-tuning of pretrained language models on millions of reviews, we train a multi-label reviews classiﬁer that achieves a mean AUROC of 0.965 on these labels. We next use the model to reveal temporal and spatial patterns among tens of thousands of multifamily properties. Collectively, these results highlight the feasibility of automated analysis of housing trends and investment opportunities using tenant-perspective data.
