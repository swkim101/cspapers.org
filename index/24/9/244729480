Variational quantum algorithm (VQA), which is comprised of a classical optimizer and a parameterized quantum circuit, emerges as one of the most promising approaches for harvesting the power of quantum computers in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, the deployment of VQAs on contemporary NISQ devices often faces considerable system and time-dependant noise and prohibitively slow training speeds. On the other hand, the expensive supporting resources and infrastructure make quantum computers extremely keen on high utilization. In this paper, we propose a virtualized way of building up a quantum backend for variational quantum algorithms: rather than relying on a single physical device which tends to introduce ever-changing device-specific noise with less reliable performance as time-since-calibration grows, we propose to constitute a quantum ensemble, which dynamically distributes quantum tasks asynchronously across a set of physical devices, and adjusts the ensemble configuration with respect to machine status. In addition to reduced machine-dependant noise, the ensemble can provide significant speedups for VQA training. With this idea, we build a novel VQA training framework called EQC - a distributed gradient-based processor-performance-aware optimization system - that comprises: (i) a system architecture for asynchronous parallel VQA cooperative training; (ii) an analytical model for assessing the quality of a circuit output concerning its architecture, transpilation, and runtime conditions; (iii) a weighting mechanism to adjust the quantum ensemble's computational contribution according to the systems' current performance. Evaluations comprising 500K times' circuit evaluations across 10 IBMQ NISQ devices using a VQE and a QAOA applications demonstrate that EQC can attain error rates very close to the most performant device of the ensemble, while boosting the training speed by 10.5X on average (up to 86X and at least 5.2x).
