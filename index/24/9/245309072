This paper focuses on the efficient control of a photovoltaic device's voltage. Under irradiation variation and constant load, a robust controller is proposed. The second-order sliding mode controller for buck converter based on super twisting algorithm is designed to ensure both the reliability and robustness of the global system. The proposed control strategy's reliability is demonstrated by experimental results using dSpace 1104.
