In this paper, we present a computational analysis of the problem of attacking sign prediction, whereby the aim of the attacker (a network member) is to hide from the defender (an analyst) the signs of a target set of links by removing the signs of some other, non-target, links. The problem turns out to be NP-hard if either local or global similarity measures are used for sign prediction. We propose a heuristic algorithm and test its effectiveness on several real-life and synthetic datasets.
