Role of node is defined on structural similarity or local connective pattern, describing the functions of node in the network. In real-world situation, it can denote personâ€™s identity and status. It has been studied over the past decades, and learning role-based network representations is crucial to many downstream tasks. In this field, the important step for is extracting some measurements to evaluate structural similarity. Although some methods have been developed to capture the role features to learn the structural similarities between nodes, they all design the features of fixed types, such as global, local, and higher-order features. These features can only discover single type of roles, and simply combing them may cause damage to performance. It is very difficult to model the complex relationship between different scale features in the field of role-based network embedding. Therefore, we propose a novel adversarial framework to generate structural node representations via higher-order features and adversarial learning (SHOAL). We leverage the Auto-Encoder on higher-order features and some GNNs on its outputs to aggregate local neighbors. We believe that higher-order and local features can denote roles, and effectively integrating them will help for role discovery. So we consider the GNNs as the generator and design an adversarial game between these features, which can also improve the robustness. The experiments on real-world networks demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our model, and the results also prove the effectiveness of integrating higher-order and local features.
