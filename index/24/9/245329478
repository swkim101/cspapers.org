Deep learning based trajectory similarity computation holds the potential for improved efficiency and adaptability over traditional similarity computation. However, existing learning-based trajectory similarity learning solutions prioritize spatial similarity over temporal similarity, making them suboptimal for time-aware analyses. To this end, we propose ST2Vec, a representation learning based solution that considers fine-grained spatial and temporal relations between trajectories to enable spatio-temporal similarity computation in road networks. Specifically, ST2Vec encompasses two steps: (i) spatial and temporal modeling that encode spatial and temporal information of trajectories, where a generic temporal modeling module is proposed for the first time; and (ii) spatio-temporal co-attention fusion, where two fusion strategies are designed to enable the generation of unified spatio-temporal embeddings of trajectories. Further, under the guidance of triplet loss, ST2Vec employs curriculum learning in model optimization to improve convergence and effectiveness. An experimental study offers evidence that ST2Vec outperforms state-of-the-art competitors substantially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, while showing low parameter sensitivity and good model robustness. Moreover, similarity involved case studies including top-k querying and DBSCAN clustering offer further insight into the capabilities of ST2Vec.
