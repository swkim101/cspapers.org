The Gaussian reconstruction kernels have been proposed by Westover (1990) and studied by the computer graphics community back in the 90s, which gives an alternative representation of object 3D geometry from meshes and point clouds. On the other hand, current state-of-the-art (SoTA) differentiable renderers, Liu et al. (2019), use rasterization to collect triangles or points on each image pixel and blend them based on the viewing distance. In this paper, we propose VoGE, which utilizes the volumetric Gaussian reconstruction kernels as geometric primitives. The VoGE rendering pipeline uses ray tracing to capture the nearest primitives and blends them as mixtures based on their volume density distributions along the rays. To efficiently render via VoGE, we propose an approximate closeform solution for the volume density aggregation and a coarse-to-fine rendering strategy. Finally, we provide a CUDA implementation of VoGE, which enables real-time level rendering with a competitive rendering speed in comparison to PyTorch3D. Quantitative and qualitative experiment results show VoGE outperforms SoTA counterparts when applied to various vision tasks, e.g., object pose estimation, shape/texture fitting, and occlusion reasoning.
