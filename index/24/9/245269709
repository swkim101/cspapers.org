This work proposes a novel distributed control framework in which a team of pursuer agents equipped with a radio jamming device cooperate in order to track and radio-jam a rogue target in 3D space, with the ultimate purpose of disrupting its communication and navigation circuitry. The target evolves in 3D space according to a stochastic dynamical model and it can appear and disappear from the surveillance area at random times. The pursuer agents cooperate in order to estimate the probability of target existence and its spatial density from a set of noisy measurements in the presence of clutter. Additionally, the proposed control framework allows a team of pursuer agents to optimally choose their radio transmission levels and their mobility control actions in order to ensure uninterrupted radio jamming to the target, as well as to avoid the jamming interference among the team of pursuer agents. Extensive simulation analysis of the systemâ€™s performance validates the applicability of the proposed approach.
