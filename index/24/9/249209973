 Abstract — Early identification of on-site hazards is crucial for accident prevention in the construction industry. Currently, the construction industry relies on experienced safety advisors (SAs) to identify site hazards and generate mitigation measures to guide field workers. However, more than half of the site hazards remain unrecognized due to the lack of field experience or site-specific knowledge of some SAs. To address these limitations, this study proposed an Extended Reality (XR)-augmented visual assistance framework, including Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), that enables capturing and transferring subconscious inspection strategies between workers or workers/machines for a construction safety inspection. The purpose is to enhance SA’s training and real-time situational awareness for identifying on-site hazards while reducing their mental
