Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect new objects based on few anno-1 tated samples. To alleviate the impact of few samples, enhancing the generalization 2 and discrimination abilities of detectors on new objects plays an important role. 3 In this paper, we explore employing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to 4 boost both the generalization and discrimination abilities. In speciﬁc, we propose 5 a novel method, namely, SVD-Dictionary enhancement, to build two separated 6 spaces based on the sorted singular values. Concretely, the eigenvectors corre-7 sponding to larger singular values are used to build the generalization space in 8 which localization is performed, as these eigenvectors generally suppress certain 9 variations (e.g., the variation of styles) and contain intrinsical characteristics of 10 objects. Meanwhile, since the eigenvectors corresponding to relatively smaller sin-11 gular values may contain richer category-related information, we can utilize them 12 to build the discrimination space in which classiﬁcation is performed. Dictionary 13 learning is further leveraged to capture high-level discriminative information from 14 the discrimination space, which is beneﬁcial for improving detection accuracy. In 15 the experiments, we separately verify the effectiveness of our method on PASCAL 16 VOC and COCO benchmarks. Particularly, for the 2-shot case in VOC split1, our 17 method signiﬁcantly outperforms the baseline by 6.2%. Moreover, visualization 18 analysis shows that our method is instrumental in doing FSOD. 19
