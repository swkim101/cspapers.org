Crosstalk is one of the major types of noise in quantum computers. To design high-fidelity quantum gates and large-scale quantum computers, effectively suppressing crosstalk is becoming increasingly important. Previous approaches to mitigate crosstalk rely on either hardware strategies, which are only applicable on limited platforms, or software techniques, which, however, cannot fully explore instruction parallelism. To address the above challenges, we propose a commutativity based compile-time instruction reordering approach. We first propose a complete set of generalized commutativity rules for main types of quantum gates, and then we design a two-level bidirectional reordering algorithm to reorder gates according to these rules for effective crosstalk mitigation. Our approach can not only capture both forward and backward instruction correlations but also reduce the effect of decoherence. We evaluate our approach with 117 quantum programs. Compared with the state-of-the-art, our approach can improve program fidelity by up to 120% (18% on average).
