Mining feature evolvable streams has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, most existing approaches are designed for stationary data streams (i.e., data streams without concept drifts) and often work with high time complexity due to the time-consuming optimization procedure. The two deficiencies thus largely limit its applications to real-world data stream scenarios. In this paper, we consider a more difficult but practical streaming setting: a data stream with both concept drifts and evolvable features. To this end, we propose a general framework for mining concept-drifting data streams with evolvable features, called FEMC, based on an efficient Feature Evolvable streaming learning and dynamic Micro-Clusters maintenance. Specifically, we derive a closed-form solution to preserve the information in vanished features by learning a weight vector on survival features. The evolving concepts, are further learnt by dynamically maintaining a set of micro-clusters with varying feature space on-the-fly. Empirical results on real-world data sets have demonstrated the benefits of the proposed framework on both clustering and classification tasks by comparing with state-of-the-art algorithms.
