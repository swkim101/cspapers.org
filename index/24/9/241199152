In this paper, we present The gEoSpatial Language Annotator (TESLA)--a tool which supports human annotation of geospatial language corpora. TESLA interfaces with a GIS database for annotating grounded geospatial entities and uses Google Earth for visualization of both entity search results and evolving object and speaker position from GPS tracks. We also discuss a current annotation effort using TESLA to annotate location descriptions in a geospatial language corpus.
