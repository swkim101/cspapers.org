Memory leak is a notorious issue. Despite the extensive efforts, addressing memory leaks in large production cloud systems remains challenging. Existing solutions incur high overhead and/or suffer from high inaccuracies. This paper presents R ESIN , a solution designed to holistically address memory leaks in production cloud infrastructure. R ESIN takes a divide-and-conquer approach to tackle the challenges. It performs a low-overhead detection ﬁrst with a robust bucketization-based pivot scheme to identify suspicious leaking entities. It then takes live heap snapshots at appropriate time points in carefully sampled leak entities. R ESIN analyzes the collected snapshots for leak diagnosis. Finally, R ESIN automatically mitigates detected leaks. R ESIN has been running in production in Microsoft Azure for 3 years. It reports on average 24 leak tickets each month with high accuracy and low overhead, and provides effective diagnosis reports. Its results translate into a 41 × reduction of VM reboots caused by low memory.
