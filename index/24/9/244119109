Many existing works have demonstrated that language is a helpful guider for image under-standing by neural networks. We focus on a language-shaped learning problem in a few-shot setting, i.e., using language to improve few-shot image classiﬁcation when language descriptions are only available during training. We propose a data-efﬁcient method that can make the best usage of the few-shot images and the language available only in training. Experimental results on dataset ShapeWorld and Birds show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines in language-shaped few-shot learning area, especially when training data is more severely limited. Therefore, we call our approach data-efﬁcient language-shaped learning (DF-LSL).
