Remote Attestation ( RA ) is a basic security mechanism that detects malicious presence on various types of computing components, e.g., IoT devices. In a typical IoT setting, RA involves a trusted Veriﬁer that sends a challenge to an untrusted remote Prover , which must in turn reply with a fresh and authentic evidence of being in a trustworthy state. However, most current RA schemes assume a central Veriﬁer , which represents a single point of failure. This feature is problematic when mutually suspicious stakeholders are involved. Furthermore, scalability issues arise as the number of IoT devices ( Provers ) grows. Although some RA schemes allow peer Provers to act as Veriﬁers , they involve unrealistic (for IoT devices) requirements, such as time synchronization and synchronous communication. Moreover, they incur heavy memory, computation, and communication burdens, while not considering sleeping or otherwise disconnected devices. Motivated by the need to address these limitations, we construct S calable C ollective R emote A ttestation for P ub-S ub ( SCRAPS ), a novel collective RA scheme. It achieves scalability by outsourcing Ver-iﬁer duties to a smart contract and mitigates DoS attacks against both Provers and Veriﬁers . It also removes the need for synchronous communication. Furthermore, RA evidence in SCRAPS is publicly veriﬁable, which signiﬁcantly reduces the number of attestation evidence computations, thus lowering Prover burden. We report on SCRAPS prototype implemented over Hyperledger Sawtooth (a blockchain geared for IoT use-cases) and evaluate its performance, scalability, and security aspects.
