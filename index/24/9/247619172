Pedestrian counting is a fundamental tool for under-standing pedestrian patterns and crowd flow analysis. Existing works (e.g., image-level pedestrian counting, cross-line crowd counting et al.) either only focus on the image-level counting or are constrained to the manual annotation of lines. In this work, we propose to conduct the pedes-trian counting from a new perspective - Video Individual Counting (VIC), which counts the total number of individual pedestrians in the given video (a person is only counted once). Instead of relying on the Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) techniques, we propose to solve the problem by decomposing all pedestrians into the initial pedestrians who existed in the first frame and the new pedestrians with separate identities in each following frame. Then, an end-to-end Decomposition and Reasoning Network (DRNet) is designed to predict the initial pedestrian count with the density estimation method and reason the new pedestrian's count of each frame with the differentiable optimal transport. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets with congested pedestrians and diverse scenes, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method over baselines with great superiority in counting the individual pedestrians.
