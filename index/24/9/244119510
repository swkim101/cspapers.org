Numeracy plays a key role in natural language understanding. However, existing NLP ap-proaches, either traditional word2vec approach or contextualized transformer-based language models, fail to learn numeracy. As the result, the performance of these models is limited when they are applied to number-intensive applications in clinical and ﬁnancial domains. In this work, we propose a simple number embedding approach based on knowledge graph. We construct a knowledge graph consisting of number entities and magnitude relations. Knowledge graph embedding method is then applied to obtain number vectors. Our approach is easy to implement, and experiment results on vari-ous numeracy-related NLP tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our method.
