Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has achieved unprece-dented view synthesis quality using coordinate-based neu-ral scene representations. However, NeRF's view depen-dency can only handle simple reflections like highlights but cannot deal with complex reflections such as those from glass and mirrors. In these scenarios, NeRF models the virtual image as real geometries which leads to inaccurate depth estimation, and produces blurry renderings when the multi-view consistency is violated as the reflected objects may only be seen under some of the viewpoints. To over-come these issues, we introduce NeRFReN, which is built upon NeRF to model scenes with reflections. Specifically, we propose to split a scene into transmitted and reflected components, and model the two components with separate neural radiance fields. Considering that this decomposition is highly under-constrained, we exploit geometric priors and apply carefully-designed training strategies to achieve reasonable decomposition results. Experiments on various self-captured scenes show that our method achieves high-quality novel view synthesis and physically sound depth es-timation results while enabling scene editing applications.
