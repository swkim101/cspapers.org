Cohen-Addad, Filtser, Klein and Le [FOCS’20] constructed a stochastic embedding of minor-free graphs of diameter D into graphs of treewidth $O_{\epsilon}(\log n)$ with expected additive distortion $+\epsilon D$. Cohen-Addad et al. then used the embedding to design the first quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme (QPTAS) for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. Filtser and Le [STOC’21] used the embedding (in a different way) to design a QPTAS for the metric Baker’s problems in minor-free graphs. In this work, we devise a new embedding technique to improve the treewidth bound of Cohen-Addad et al. exponentially to $O_{\epsilon}(\log \log n)^{2}$. As a corollary, we obtain the first efficient PTAS for the capacitated vehicle routing problem in minor-free graphs. We also significantly improve the running time of the QPTAS for the metric Baker’s problems in minor-free graphs from $n^{O_{\epsilon}(\log (n))}$ to $n^{O_{\epsilon}(\log \log (n))^{3}}$. Applying our embedding technique to planar graphs, we obtain a deterministic embedding of planar graphs of diameter D into graphs of treewidth $\left.O\left((\log \log n)^{2}\right) / \epsilon\right)$ and additive distortion $+\epsilon D$ that can be constructed in nearly linear time. Important corollaries of our result include a bicriteria PTAS for metric Baker’s problems and a PTAS for the vehicle routing problem with bounded capacity in planar graphs, both run in almost-linear time. The running time of our algorithms is significantly better than previous algorithms that require quadratic time. A key idea in our embedding is the construction of an (exact) emulator for tree metrics with treewidth $O(\log \log n)$ and hop-diameter $O(\log \log n)$. This result may be of independent interest.
