Cursor-based tele-operation interfaces for manipulators can enable widely available and accessible control of robots to make many near term applications possible. However, their efficiency is restricted by the challenge of controlling 6 Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) with 2D input from the cursor. Existing interfaces make use of different strategies to tackle this challenge, including viewpoint constraints, mode switching, and visual overlays, but it is unclear how these strategies impact the efficiency and accessibility of the interface. In this paper we characterize the design space of cursor-based robot control interfaces and compare alternatives in two user studies. Study 1 (N=216) compares nine alternative interfaces focusing on control of 3 DoFs to understand the differences of the interfaces at the basic level and examine the impact of task parameters on efficiency. Study 2 (N=60) compares a subset of the interfaces integrated into a system that allows full control of a robot manipulator from three orthogonal views. We also present a framework for heuristically evaluating accessibility of these interfaces and discuss the efficiency and accessibility trade-off with recommendations.
