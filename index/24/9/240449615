Recent events that revolve around fake news indicate that humans are more susceptible than ever to mental manipulation by powerful technological tools. In the future these tools may become autonomous. One crucial property of autonomous agents is their potential ability to deceive. From this research we hope to understand the potential risks and benefits of deceptive artificial agents. The method we propose to study deceptive agents is by making them interact with agents that detect deception and analyse what emerges from these interactions given multiple setups such as formalisations of scenarios inspired from historical cases of deception.Â
