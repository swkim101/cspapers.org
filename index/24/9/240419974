We propose the framework of Series Elastic End Effectors in 6D (SEED), which combines a spatially compliant element with visuotactile sensing to grasp and manipulate tools in the wild. Our framework generalizes the benefits of series elasticity to 6-dof, while providing an abstraction of control using visuotactile sensing. We propose an algorithm for relative pose estimation from visuotactile sensing, and a spatial hybrid force-position controller capable of achieving stable force interaction with the environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on tools that require regulation of spatial forces. Video link: https://youtu.be/2-YuIfspDrk.
