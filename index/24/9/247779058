Pooling multiple neuroimaging datasets across institutions often enables improvements in statistical power when evaluating associations (e.g., between risk factors and disease outcomes) that may otherwise be too weak to detect. When there is only a single source of variability (e.g., different scanners), domain adaptation and matching the distributions of representations may suffice in many scenarios. But in the presence of more than one nuisance variable which concurrently influence the measurements, pooling datasets poses unique challenges, e.g., variations in the data can come from both the acquisition method as well as the demographics of participants (gender, age). Invariant representation learning, by itself, is illsuited to fully model the data generation process. In this paper, we show how bringing recent results on equivariant representation learning (for studying symmetries in neural networks) instantiated on structured spaces together with simple use of classical results on causal inference provides an effective practical solution. In particular, we demonstrate how our model allows dealing with more than one nuisance variable under some assumptions and can enable analysis of pooled scientific datasets in scenarios that would otherwise entail removing a large portion of the samples.
