The diffusion of rumors on social media generally follows a propagation tree structure, which provides valuable clues on how an original message is transmitted and responded by users over time. Recent studies reveal that rumor verification and stance detection are two relevant tasks that can jointly enhance each other despite their differences. For example, rumors can be debunked by cross-checking the stances conveyed by their relevant posts, and stances are also conditioned on the nature of the rumor. However, stance detection typically requires a large training set of labeled stances at post level, which are rare and costly to annotate. Enlightened by Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) scheme, we propose a novel weakly supervised joint learning framework for rumor verification and stance detection which only requires bag-level class labels concerning the rumor's veracity. Specifically, based on the propagation trees of source posts, we convert the two multi-class problems into multiple MIL-based binary classification problems where each binary model is focused on differentiating a target class (of rumor or stance) from the remaining classes. Then, we propose a hierarchical attention mechanism to aggregate the binary predictions, including (1) a bottom-up/top-down tree attention layer to aggregate binary stances into binary veracity; and (2) a discriminative attention layer to aggregate the binary class into finer-grained classes. Extensive experiments conducted on three Twitter-based datasets demonstrate promising performance of our model on both claim-level rumor detection and post-level stance classification compared with state-of-the-art methods.
