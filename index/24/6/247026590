Automated lab assistant and automated grading tools are commonly used to help manage student work in Computer Science lab sections. These tools can ease routine grading tasks and provide rapid and consistent feedback to inform student progress. However, we found their application lacking in our mid-level systems courses. To address this, we present a command-line interface (CLI) driven lab assistant and assessment tool designed specifically for this environment. We provide insights into our design choices and provide context and comparison of this system to other similar tools. Then we present results from using the tool since 2019. By easing routine tasks and common challenges, students and instructors both report uniformly positive reviews. At the same time, grading time is consistently lower than other similar courses while maintaining a humanized and personal student connection.
