Despite the important and long overdue increase in the number of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in Computer Science, these efforts tend to be focused on diversity in terms of race, gender, socioeconomic status, etc. and run the risk of overlooking the needs of students living with disabilities, who may also feel underrepresented and marginalized in our field. More specifically, few of these endeavors are targeted toward students living with diagnosed mental illness despite the current mental health crisis, which is already having an effect on the field of computing. This session seeks to explore ways in which current DEI efforts in Computer Science can be expanded to be more inclusive of students living with diagnosed mental illness. Rather than serving as a critique of the shortcomings of existing DEI practices, we seek to create a space for a constructive and open conversation. We will discuss how current outreach efforts, recruitment and retention strategies, mentorship opportunities, community building, career advancement, etc. can be broadened and modified to meet the unique needs of students living with mental illness, while at the same time seeking to erase any stigma and misconceptions that may cause others to marginalize and exclude these students. In this timely and important session, participants will have an opportunity to discuss issues that affect CS students living with mental illness, share resources that are available for both students and educators, and describe efforts to create and foster a culture of understanding and support for neurodiverse communities within computing.
