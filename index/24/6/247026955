This project aims to improve LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer) representation in the University of Utah's discrete mathematics course. Many practice problems in the course textbook rely on heteronormative and/or cisnormative premises. We developed alternatives that maintained the original mathematical content while including minority identities, and then deployed them in a homework assignment. Students also completed a survey on their opinions of the new questions. Most students were open to the inclusion of LGBTQ representation in their homework, and many applauded it. However, students also suggested that subtle wording was preferable, and that affirming problems should be sprinkled across the course rather than concentrated in one assignment. Our experience provides an example of framing mathematical content to support an inclusive classroom climate, and we expect that our lessons learned can inform assignments that affirm minority identities throughout the CS curriculum.
