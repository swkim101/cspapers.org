Request latency is a crucial concern for modern cloud providers. Due to various causes in hosts and networks, requests can suffer from request latency anomalies (RLAs), which may violate the Service-Level Agreement for tenants. However, existing performance monitoring tools have incomplete coverage and inconsistent semantics for monitoring requests, resulting in the difficulty to accurately diagnose RLAs. This paper presents BufScope , a high-coverage request event monitoring system, which aims to capture most RLA-related events with consistent request-level semantics in the end-to-end datapath of request. BufScope models the datapath of request as a buffer chain and defines RLA-related events based on different properties of buffers, so as to end-to-end monitor the root causes of RLA. To achieve consistent semantics for captured events, BufScope designs a concise request-level semantic injection mechanism to make events captured in networks have the victim requestsâ€™ ID, and offloads the realization to SmartNICs for low overhead . We have implemented BufScope on commodity SmartNICs and programmable switches. Evaluation results show that BufScope can diagnose 95% RLAs with <0.07% network bandwidth overhead and <1% application throughput decline.
