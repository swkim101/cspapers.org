In data mining, estimating the number of distinct values (NDV) is a fundamental problem with various applications. Existing methods for estimating NDV can be broadly classified into two categories: i) scanning-based methods, which scan the entire data and maintain a sketch to approximate NDV; and ii) sampling-based methods, which estimate NDV using sampling data rather than accessing the entire data warehouse. Scanning-based methods achieve a lower approximation error at the cost of higher I/O and more time. Sampling-based estimation is preferable in applications with a large data volume and a permissible error restriction due to its higher scalability. However, while the sampling-based method is more effective on a single machine, it is less practical in a distributed environment with massive data volumes. For obtaining the final NDV estimators, the entire sample must be transferred throughout the distributed system, incurring a prohibitive communication cost when the sample rate is significant. This paper proposes a novel sketch-based distributed method that achieves sub-linear communication costs for distributed sampling-based NDV estimation under mild assumptions. Our method leverages a sketch-based algorithm to estimate the sample's frequency of frequency in the distributed streaming model, which is compatible with most classical sampling-based NDV estimators. Additionally, we provide theoretical evidence for our method's ability to minimize communication costs in the worst-case scenario. Extensive experiments show that our method saves orders of magnitude in communication costs compared to existing sampling- and sketch-based methods.
