This special session furthers the work associated with SIGCSE Reads and the growing community of SIGCSE members who connect to each other through science fiction. This session extends the experiences of earlier sessions by incorporating a new ethical framework, capability ethics, that supports analysis at a societal level rather than a personal level. Updated materials will be available so that the exercise can be translated to other classrooms. Building on an initial description of ethical frameworks and how they have been used with earlier SIGCSE Reads stories, the exercise will be followed by discussion about new stories that provide additional challenges to both teachers and students, with the goal of better preparing students to consider their computing degrees and careers in a pluralistic, global, equitable and just context.
