Different health-monitoring techniques were considered in the literature to enhance the safety and stability of Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) platoons. The health-monitoring processes include fault detection, localization, and mitigation. It is evident that mitigating these faults is faster and more reliable if the fault structure is known. To this end, we consider classifying the fault class using supervised machine learning. We first model a heterogeneous CAV platoon with three different common faults separately. These faults are bounded actuator disturbances (namely, engine bearing knock), False Data Injection (FDI) attack, and communication time delay. We consider two supervised machine learning classifiers, the first classifier determines whether the fault is bounded disturbances or communication delay, and the second classifier determines whether the disturbances are in the physical or cyber layer. We have compared four machine learning techniques for each classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Quadratic Discriminant (QD), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The classifiers are trained firstly on the simulation model, then are tested on a different set of observations and tested experimentally on a platoon of three autonomous robots. The highest accuracy was achieved by considering SVM for the first classifier and QD for the second classifier. The overall classification accuracy achieved is 96.8% for the simulation test and 92.1% for the experiment.
