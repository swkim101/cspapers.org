In this paper, we present a new large-scale dataset for the video panoptic segmentation task, which aims to assign semantic classes and track identities to all pixels in a video. As the ground truth for this task is difficult to annotate, previous datasets for video panoptic segmentation are limited by either small scales or the number of scenes. In contrast, our large-scale VIdeo Panoptic Segmentation in the Wild (VIPSeg) dataset provides 3,536 videos and 84,750 frames with pixel-level panoptic annotations, covering a wide range of real-world scenarios and categories. To the best of our knowledge, our VIPSeg is the first attempt to tackle the challenging video panoptic segmentation task in the wild by considering diverse scenarios. Based on VIPSeg, we evaluate existing video panoptic segmentation approaches and propose an efficient and effective clip-based baseline method to analyze our VIPSeg dataset.
