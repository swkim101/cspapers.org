Recursion is often cited as both an essential and problematic topic for students to learn, though often without justifications for these claims. The goals of this research are focused on forming a framework from which to evaluate how students' form effective mental models for recursion, including the role of misconceptions, teaching strategies and experiences in the formation of these mental models. As a preliminary step in this research, a systematic literature review was performed to better understand the existing literature on the teaching and learning of recursion. The review consists of a total of 224 papers from several sources, including the ACM Digital Library, IEEE, ScienceDirect, Taylor & Francis, and Wiley. The literature review was designed to answer the following research question: What methods for teaching recursion have been evaluated and have been determined to be effective? The results show that while many methods for teaching recursion have been developed, there is a surprising lack of evidence for the effectiveness of many of the methods presented, with many articles simply presenting the teaching method without providing any evidence for the method's efficacy.
