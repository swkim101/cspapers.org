Many university computing and engineering departments rely on transfer student enrollment from community colleges, but these students often face unique barriers to academic and social integration. These challenges can be compounded for students from underrepresented racial backgrounds. Using institutional and survey data, correlations among social and academic factors were calculated to measure the impact of a Post Transfer Pathways program on GPA and persistence. While findings indicate that participation has significant positive impacts, URM students may be more vulnerable to disruptions in social and academic factors than non-URM students.
