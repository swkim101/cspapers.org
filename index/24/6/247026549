Culturally responsive pedagogy (CRP) has gained prominence in computer science education since it can effectively reach traditionally marginalized populations, which has led to new efforts toward broadening participation in computer science (CS). The CS Pathways Researcher-Practitioner Partnership (RPP) project developed and delivered a community-centered professional development (PD) model to build middle school teachers' capacity in teaching computer science and digital literacy (CSDL) and eventually have students make apps for social good. The study examined how the project utilized professional learning activities and community support to achieve two goals: 1) build middle school teachers' capacity of teaching CS curriculum by using culturally responsive pedagogy (CRP), and 2) support the implementation of CRP in their CS classrooms. Qualitative data were collected through the year-long bi-weekly PD meetings including answers to prompt questions and discussion, along with end-of-year interviews with the teachers. The results demonstrated that by utilizing a community-centered PD model, the project was able to 1) enhance teachers' cognitive development of CRP; 2) facilitate teachers' interaction, sharing of knowledge and resources, as well as exchange of best practices; 3) successfully collaborate with teachers to implement a CRP and address their questions along the way. This paper discussed the potential model for a community-centered professional development to prepare and support teachers' culturally responsive teaching in CS education, aiming to contribute to PD research.
