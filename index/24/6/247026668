Traditionally, education in computer science focuses on stakeholders like teachers, undergraduate students, and employers. However researchers also educate themselves about recent results and new subject matters. An important vehicle in this informal, self-education process is reading peer-reviewed academic papers---papers that are also used in the curriculum of graduate-level research courses. Technical writing skills are important in this domain, as well as engaging the reader with interesting text. This paper is a study of academic writing. We study in depth the first sentence used by researchers in opening their academic papers and how this sentence operates to draw the reader in. We use a corpus of 379 papers from a top-tier cybersecurity conference and use qualitative analysis (coding from grounded theory) to create a taxonomy of 5 general types and 14 sub-types of opening sentences. In this paper, we define and illustrate each type through examples, and reflect on what we learned about writing after examining all of these sentences.
