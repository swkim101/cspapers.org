Since the mid 90s, the study of the complexity of classic network design problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP), the Steiner tree problem (ST), or the k-MST problem on metric spaces such as low-dimensional Euclidean spaces, doubling metrics, planar or minor-free graphs, has led to major improvements of our understanding of the structure of both these important metric spaces, and the underlying problems. In their celebrated work, Arora and Mitchell gave quasi polynomial-time approximation schemes (QPTAS) for several network design problems in Euclidean space, that have later been improved to polynomial and (near-)linear in some cases. Arora and Mitchell’s QPTAS result has been extended by Talwar [STOC’04] to doubling metrics showing that the Euclidean embedding is not a necessary condition to design approximation schemes for network design problems. In the case of planar and more broadly minor-free graphs, the picture is much less satisfactory. For example, nothing better than the general case is known for k-MST, an open question that has thus been repeatedly asked. Even when approximation schemes are known for the planar case, generalizing them to the minor-free setting is often a major challenge because most of the topological properties are lost. Therefore, one of the most important question of the field is whether we can bypass these topological arguments to obtain a general framework for network design problems in minor-free graphs, similar to Arora, Mitchell and Talwar’s? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a framework for network design problems in minor-free graphs. We give the first approximation schemes, with quasi-polynomial running time, for k-MST, Steiner tree, and Steiner forest in minor-free graphs. The result on k-MST was not known before even for the planar case, and obtaining approximation schemes for Steiner tree on minor-free graphs has been a major open problem.cczc
