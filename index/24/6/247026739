Current computing education efforts do an excellent job of designing engaging curricula for middle school students through block-based platforms and multimedia project-based content. However, the programming concepts covered are notably and understandably simpler than those covered in college-level AP CS or CS1. In this paper, we present a new position that today's college-level CS1 curricula can and should be taught to middle school and early high school students. We discuss our efforts in teaching Python programming to this age group by adapting the pedagogical techniques of the CS1 course offered at a public university. Preliminary observations from an 8-week summer pilot study involving 7th - 10th grade students suggest that these students can learn CS1 concepts in depth when memory diagrams, extensive practice, and engaging reviews are relied upon.
