This panel is the evolution of a Technology that Educators of Computing Hail (TECH) Birds of a Feather session held at SIGCSE for seven years, grew into popular panels for many years, and served as a springboard for a regular column in ACM Inroads. It will provide a chance for seasoned middle school, high school, and university educators to showcase the technologies they can't live without, what problems they solve, and how to use them. This year, we asked our panelists to highlight any technology in particular that helped them survive (and possibly even thrive!) during their remote teaching.
