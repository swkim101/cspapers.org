The issues related to a lack of diversity, equity, and inclusion in computing are, in part, due to a lack of understanding of identity (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender, class, ability, and sexuality), intersectionality, and their impact on both technology consumers and creators from minoritized groups. Identity-inclusive computing (IIC) explores how identity impacts and is impacted by computing. This growing area of research blends social science with computer science to infuse topics related to identity, intersectionality, racism, bias, and discrimination throughout the discipline. IIC has the potential to transform computing to create not only more equitable and inclusive environments for people from diverse identities, but also reduce development of biased/harmful technologies. This transformation requires a community of educators who are working to (un)learn topics related to identity and apply this knowledge to curricula, training, research, policy, and other department initiatives. This Birds of a Feather session convenes educators, advocates, and graduate students to discuss activities and lessons learned from the past year, strategies for beginning/sustaining this work, and future opportunities. The session will directly contribute to a growing community of practice dedicated to creating systemic change across university computing departments worldwide through IIC education, while also providing opportunities for attendees to remain connected outside of SIGCSE
