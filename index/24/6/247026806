Data scientists - practitioners, researchers, and educators - often disagree on the definition of data science. Data science courses are taught by faculty in departments of computer science, statistics, and business analytics as well allied fields. Some data scientists create scalable dashboards, others employ and (hopefully) explain machine learning models, most (but not all) demand data wrangling and visualization skills, and some require theoretical knowledge to develop novel algorithmic and/or analytic techniques. How, then, do we determine what content should be covered in an introductory college-level data science course? Some serve as prerequisites while others are terminal experiences for non-majors (who we secretly hope to entice into the field). Some courses require prior knowledge of statistical methods, databases, or programming, uniting heterogeneous populations of students and demanding flexibility regarding programming language(s) utilized or allowed. Realistically, we often make expeditious choices because competing demands leave us hard-pressed to keep up-to-date with current skills and practices. BoF participants will share their decision processes and choices about content for an introductory data science course. Information will be shared, from participants and disseminated material, on resources and curriculum guides from various professional organizations. We welcome new and experienced data science instructors, educators planning on or interested in teaching such a course, and industrial practitioners experienced in working with or hiring undergraduates.
