Domain Adaptation aims to transfer the knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain whose data distributions are different. However, the training data in source domain required by most of the existing methods is usually unavailable in real-world applications due to privacy preserving policies. Recently, Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) has drawn much attention, which tries to tackle domain adaptation problem without using source data. In this work, we propose a novel framework called SFDA-DE to address SFDA task via source Distribution Estimation. Firstly, we produce robust pseudo-labels for target data with spherical k-means clustering, whose initial class centers are the weight vectors (anchors) learned by the classifier of pretrained model. Furthermore, we propose to estimate the class-conditioned feature distribution of source domain by exploiting target data and corresponding anchors. Finally, we sample surrogate features from the estimated distribution, which are then utilized to align two domains by minimizing a contrastive adaptation loss function. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple DA benchmarks, and even outperforms traditional DA methods which require plenty of source data.
