Against a backdrop of relatively high failure rates in introductory programming courses and a persistent lack of diversity, computer science education (or CSEd) still has substantial room for improvement. Central to that effort is determining which theories of learning are most appropriate to CSEd and how best to apply them. One prominent theory -- constructivism (hereafter C*)-- is frequently referenced in the research literature. This ongoing project explores the use of C* in CSEd research using citation analysis of journal articles and proceedings published in the wake of Ben-Ari's foundational work on the topic. Using a novel Python tool to parse BibTex data, this project explores trends in the use of C* in CSEd research. There were 536 articles in the data set. All articles included C* in their text, with 9% including C* as a keyword and 3% including it in the title. Preliminary findings include the observation that the use of C* has been roughly stable over time and tends to be linked to topics such as pedagogy, active learning, and visualization. Future work could incorporate the text of the article itself into the analysis to achieve a more finely grained view of how C* functions in CSEd research. Another useful data set for analysis would be the hundreds of articles that cite Ben-Ari's paper, especially in light of his recent statement that "constructivism is either nonsense or trivial."
