As K-12 computer science (CS) initiatives bring CS into elementary classrooms, the administrators of each local US school district are facing questions of whether and how to create and implement elementary computer science (ECS) programs. This study reports the initial results of a case study investigating a small school district's choice to create an ECS program. The preliminary results of this study suggest that the process of creating this ECS program was complex, multi-stepped, and influenced by factors both inside and outside the school district.
