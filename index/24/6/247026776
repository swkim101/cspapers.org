The benefits of near-peer mentoring models in computing education contexts are well known, but research on near-peer mentor training best practices is limited. This research evaluates the impact of a 3-week instructor training on undergraduate CS majors' confidence and preparedness to teach and lead K-12 informal computing programs across a 12-week summer period. This poster presents features of the training that were beneficial to near-peer undergraduate instructors as they performed their summer teaching duties and factors that could be improved or further developed in the future.
