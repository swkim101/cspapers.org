This paper presents a method for Bayesian multi-robot peer-to-peer data fusion where any pair of autonomous robots hold non-identical, but overlapping parts of a global joint probability distribution, representing real world inference tasks (e.g., mapping, tracking). It is shown that in dynamic stochastic systems, filtering, which corresponds to marginalization of past variables, results in direct and hidden dependencies between variables not mutually monitored by the robots, which might lead to an overconfident fused estimate. The paper makes both theoretical and practical contributions by providing (i) a rigorous analysis of the origin of the dependencies and (ii) a conservative filtering algorithm for heterogeneous data fusion in dynamic systems that can be integrated with existing fusion algorithms. This work uses factor graphs as both the analysis tool and the inference engine. Each robot in the network maintains a local factor graph and communicates only relevant parts of it (a sub-graph) to its neighboring robot. We discuss the applicability to various multi-robot robotic applications and demonstrate the performance using a multi-robot multi-target tracking simulation, showing that the proposed algorithm produces conservative estimates at each robot.
