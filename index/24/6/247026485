As greater emphasis has been placed on computer science in K-12 education, states, districts and schools are under pressure to increase course offerings and student enrollment in computer science courses. This increases pressure and demand to either hire computer science teachers or train existing teachers to teach computer science. Studies have been done to determine the effects of different routes to licensure on many fields of teachers. Studies with specific emphasis on Career and Technology Education teachers have been completed, but studies have not yet evaluated the effects of licensureon Computer Science teachers specifically. Information regarding the different routes to licensure in the United States is reported along with suggestions for improvement. Use of this information can help states to make changes necessary to support computer science teachers and programs in the United States.
