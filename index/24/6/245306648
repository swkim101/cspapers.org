Large workspace localization of magnetic robots is important for medical applications. This paper presents a novel localization strategy to achieve simultaneous localization and actuation of magnetic robots using hall-effect sensors. We integrate 25 sensors into a sensing probe and mount it on to the mobile-coil system, which realizes accurate sensing and actuation of magnetic devices within a cylindrical workspace of ϕ500 mm×150 mm. Simulation results show the average localization error using the proposed method is 1.7 mm. A verification experiment is conducted to prove the design advantages; Another two experiments are conducted to demonstrate the simultaneous actuation and localization of a torque-driven robot and a force-driven floating robot respectively. For the force-driven floating robot, the average variation between the localization results and the desired trajectory is less than 2 mm.
