Effective teaching pedagogy is important for the success of students. Basically, it involves various techniques such as face-to-face instruction, group work, problem solving, active learning and individual activity. The goal is to develop higher order thinking and enable meta-cognition, and to create an atmosphere to promote discussion and participation. In this study, students' view on a teaching pedagogy is presented in the context of a graduate-level course. This course is designed by incorporating a range of teaching methods so that students can pay attention throughout a class and comprehend subject matters easily. According to this study, in-class problem solving becomes the most popular among students. The study also shows that students prefer face-to-face classes compared to online or hybrid classes.
