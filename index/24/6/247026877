This lightning talk describes a burgeoning effort to develop a CSE-based set of games and subsequent research studies. The games act as an entry point to learning classifier behaviors in a way that is accessible and adaptable to K-12 students; the associated research will seek to understand the manipulation of cognitive structures, state space search, and metacognition as mediated by using these games. These games will build on the long history of educational games and will make use of common formats: card-based games & computer-based games. The card-based format will be tailored to grades K-4, while the computer-based format will be tailored to both 5-8 and 9-12. Both formats will have similar tasks and goals; the games will present players with a constrained domain classifier and inputs (guesses) that they must use to identify the behavior of the classifier. For the card-based format, the role of the classifier will be played by a human, whereas in the computer-based format, students interact with models using Google's Teachable Machine. The goal of the game is to identify the classifier behavior in the fewest guesses. As the foundations of this work are still being laid, I welcome feedback pertaining to potential theoretical frameworks to use, knowledge of existing approaches worth investigating, as well as any interest in collaboration throughout the design and implementation processes.
