As mobile devices and cellular networks become ubiquitous, first apps for popular P2P video streaming networks emerge. We have observed that when these applications operate in cellular networks, they don't upload video traffic back to other peers. This paper presents a reason for this behavior and proposes a viable solution to exploit the uplink capacity of mobile devices more efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to propose the usage of Raptor codes to increase the upload throughput of mobile P2P applications.
