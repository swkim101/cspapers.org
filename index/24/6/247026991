We present an overview of a "Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence" course that is part of a large online course platform for upper second level students. We take a novel approach to teaching fundamental AI concepts that does not require code, and assumes little prior knowledge including only basic mathematics. The design ethos is for students to gain an understanding of how algorithms can "learn". Many misconceptions exist about this term with respect to AI and can lead to confusion and more serious misconceptions, particularly for students who engage with AI-enabled tools regularly. This approach aims to provide insights into how AI actually works, to demystify and remove barriers to more advanced learning, and to emphasize the important roles of ethics and bias in AI. We took several steps to engage students, including videos narrated by a final-year second-level student (US 12th grade). We present design and logistics particulars on this course which is currently being taken by ~7,000 students in Ireland. We believe this will be of value to other educators and the wider community.
