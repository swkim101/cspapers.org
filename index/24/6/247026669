We present the major changes to computer science education in Wales, UK, as part of wider school (K-12) curriculum, qualifications and system-level reforms. The new Curriculum for Wales, published in January 2020 to phase in from September 2022 for all learners aged 3-16, offers significant changes to the discipline of computer science as part of a new interdisciplinary Science & Technology "area of learning and experience", alongside the repositioning of digital competence as a statutory cross-curricular skill. We introduce the key features of this new bilingual national curriculum, its underlying rationale and wider Welsh education policy context, as well as what this means for school level computer science education, pedagogy and practice in Wales as the curriculum is implemented.
