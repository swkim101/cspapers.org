The literature concerning how participation in organizations for students of color (SoC) relates to computer science grades does not focus on clubs for SoC in computing (SoCiC). This poster concerns a DePauw University organization called Computing Opportunities for Students of Color (COSOC). The organization's components include: intense mentoring by the club's sponsors and upper-level students, visits to industries and graduate schools, talks by alumni of color, social activities, workshops, tutoring, and similar activities. In this poster, the authors demonstrate that grades for Black students who took the first course (Computer Science I or CS1) after COSOC formed differ significantly from those of Black students who took CS1 before COSOC started. Because the sizes of the experimental groups are small, future work will explore qualitative methods.
