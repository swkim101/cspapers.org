Event-based video frame interpolation is promising as event cameras capture dense motion signals that can greatly facilitate motion-aware synthesis. However, training existing frameworks for this task requires high frame-rate videos with synchronized events, posing challenges to collect real training data. In this work we show event-based frame interpolation can be trained without the need of high frame-rate videos. This is achieved via a novel weakly supervised framework that 1) corrects image appearance by extracting complementary information from events and 2) supplants motion dynamics modeling with attention mechanisms. For the latter we propose subpixel attention learning, which supports searching high-resolution correspondence efficiently on low-resolution feature grid. Though trained on low frame-rate videos, our framework outperforms existing models trained with full high frame-rate videos (and events) on both GoPro dataset and a new real event-based dataset.
