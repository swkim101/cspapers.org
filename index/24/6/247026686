As technology continues to integrate into the classroom, educational data analysis becomes increasingly accessible and important. Educators face new obstacles today that make the student learning process less transparent. Learning analytics presents a solution as it can take advantage of the growth of available educational data and assist educators in understanding how students approach questions. This paper presents an interactive tool with a new approach towards the visualization of student learning. By representing progressions of student answers to fill-in-the-blank and short answer questions as a network, a flexible model is created to visualize data in an intuitive format. Salient features of the network visualization include visual feedback, interactive filters, and animated manipulation. This approach empowers educators to examine how student understanding progresses, identify students who need the most help, and make data-informed adjustments to their instruction.
