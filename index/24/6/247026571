The effort to learn and the regulation of learning are key to successful learning. Voluntary practice has been shown to improve learning and is associated with having generally good self-regulated learning. At the same time, procrastination often slows the learning process and is associated with less than ideal regulation of learning. In this paper, we present the results of a study exploring the impact of voluntary practice and procrastination on the learning outcomes of novice programmers. We used data from an introductory programming course (CS1) at a large university and found that most students engaged in voluntary practice. However, students with higher prior performance and non-procrastinators were more likely to participate in the voluntary practice. We also found that participating in the voluntary practice did not have a significant impact on course performance. Furthermore, the study showed a weak negative correlation between procrastination and time spent on the homework and a weak negative correlation between procrastination and distributed practice. Finally, we found that non-procrastinators performed significantly better than procrastinators on the majority of homeworks.
