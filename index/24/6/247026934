The session will present an overview of findings of a recently funded NSF workshop that set out to examine the pressing issues for computing education research for the next 15 years. Based on dialogs for scholars working in this area, the workshop participants developed a series of themes and topics that they felt should become the focus of computing education research efforts for the next 15 years. Main themes that emerged and will be discussed in this session include: diversity, equity, inclusion, ethics, broadening participation, teaching, learning, K-12, research to practice, computing's connection to other fields, and computing education research disciplinary issues. The session will focus on interesting research questions from each of these areas that are ripe to be explored as well as enablers and blockers to the progress of this work.
