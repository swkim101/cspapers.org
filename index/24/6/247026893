The New Mexico teaching workforce does not mirror the demographics of the student population. 60% of NM teachers are white, 34% are Hispanic, and only 3% are Native American, while 61% of NM students are Hispanic, 25% are white, and 11% are Native American, almost guaranteeing that students will not be taught by someone that shares their background and experiences. A potential remedy of this mismatch is for teachers to embrace culturally responsive pedagogy. The goal of this BoF session is to promote a collaborative conversation about mechanisms to expand the under- standing of culturally responsive pedagogy among K-12 computer science teachers and other relevant stakeholders.
