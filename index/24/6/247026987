Previous studies have shown that non-native English speakers (NNES) have lower confidence levels at the beginning of the term and higher academic expectations for themselves throughout the term. Additionally, although non-native English speakers study for longer hours compared to native English speakers (NES), there were not any differences in their grades. To better understand the experiences of NNES learning Computer Science in a U.S university, we examined possible factors that may contribute to differences in stress and sense of belonging between NES and NNES. From our investigation using weekly surveys, we did not find any significant difference in the stress level reported by NES and NNES. However, we found differences in the factors that contribute to the stress level of NES and NNES. Factors such as 'personal life' and 'requirements for other classes' were major factors that contributed towards the stress level of NES, whereas 'embarrassment asking for help' and 'self doubt' were more common among NNES. As for sense of belonging, we found no significant difference between NES and NNES. Additionally, we found that the number of classmates that NES feel comfortable reaching out to is not a factor affecting their sense of belonging in an introductory computer science class. \endabstract
