Many efforts are underway to have computing curricula prepare students to anticipate adverse social impacts of computing. Much of the attention currently focuses on introductory CS courses and machine learning courses, often framed around bias that arises around algorithmic decision-making systems. The presenters on this panel have instead focused on ways to weave responsible-computing content into data structures and introductory algorithms courses. They have done so at different levels, ranging from second-semester introductory courses (so-called CS2) up through upper-undergraduate or early graduate courses. Each panelist will describe their perspective on how responsible computing fits into their course and present an illustrative assignment or lecture from their course. The goal of the session is to inspire other CS faculty to work similar content into corresponding courses at their own institutions, while also fostering a community of practice for responsible computing in core CS courses beyond machine learning.
