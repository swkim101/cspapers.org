Oral proficiency exams implemented in introductory programming courses at a public, research, minority-serving university provide a way to connect with students one-on-one, keep students accountable on the course material to improve their learning, and help improve feelings of belongingness in the learning environment. This study analyzes data disaggregated based on majority and underrepresented demographic groups by gender, race/ethnicity, and parental education level, to investigate the following three research themes across all groups: (1) to determine the impact of the oral exams on student motivation for independent learning; (2) to compare student stress levels related to the oral exams; and (3) to compare belongingness and final course performance. Student survey data was collected and analyzed following the oral exam intervention. For research theme (1), students across nearly all demographic groups reported that oral exams improved their understanding of the material and encouraged them to do more independent work. For research theme (2), students in some underrepresented groups reported higher stress levels than their majority group peers, and all groups reported a reduction in stress level after completing the oral exam. For research theme (3), students in some underrepresented groups reported lower sense of belonging and had lower final course performance than their majority group peers.
