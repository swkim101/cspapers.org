Attitudes play an important role in students' academic achievement and retention, yet quality tools to measure them are not readily available in the new field of data science. Through funding from the National Science Foundation, we are developing instruments that measure attitudes toward data science in the context of an introductory, college-level course. This talk focuses on preliminary work to develop the Student Survey of Motivational Attitudes toward Data Science (S-SOMADS), which includes construct development, item creation involving content experts from numerous disciplines, pilot testing, and item refinement. Along with the student instrument, we intend to develop an instructor attitude instrument as well as an environment inventory to capture instructor attitudes and course characteristics that may be associated with attitudes. This family of instruments, based on Expectancy-Value Theory, will enable data science education researchers to evaluate pedagogical innovations, create course assessments, and measure instructional effectiveness relating to student attitudes. We invite instructors of data science courses to participate in this project to discuss data science topics, serve as subject matter experts, or to collect pilot data from themselves and their students.
