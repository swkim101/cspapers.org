We report results of a study of student experiences (anonymous survey: n=90, interviews: n=4) in a fully online, synchronous CS1 class taught during the COVID-19 pandemic. Half the class sessions were held in Zoom and half were held in Gather.Town, an online platform that supports proximity chat and spatially designated private spaces. Students expressed strong preferences for the Gather.Town class setting due to its support for peer socializing, sense of place, agency, engagement, and fluid interactions.
