Students' attention and retention to the course videos is crucial for asynchronous classes. This poster reports our pilot study on evaluating the effectiveness of using short animation videos as the replacement of regular lecture recordings to improve students' engagement in an asynchronous undergraduate-level machine learning class. We showed that while short animation videos can help students quickly grasp core ideas and visually memorize concepts, various improvements can still be made to make the video more capable of explaining complex details, thus additional work need to be done before it can be used as a replacement of regular recordings. We pointed out future direction of studying key factors that improve effective explanation of detailed materials, and how short animation videos can be jointly used with other content as a more effective method for asynchronous teaching.
