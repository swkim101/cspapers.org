As proposed by Linda B. Nilson in Specifications Grading: Restoring Rigor, Motivating Students, and Saving Faculty Time, Specifications Grading is an assessment paradigm that relies on pass/fail grading of assignments and assessments, the structuring of course content into modules linked to learning outcomes, and the bundling of assignments and assessments within those modules. One intention of this type of course grading construct is to align assessment more closely with student attainment of intended learning outcomes. While there has been very visible work in incorporating Specifications Grading in some academic areas (e.g., in mathematics), examples of the use of Specifications Grading in computer science courses are less common. The goal of this workshop is to introduce the concepts of Specifications Grading and explain how to apply these concepts to a wide range of computing courses and class sizes. Each participant should leave the workshop with the ability to revise their course syllabus and assignments to incorporate Specifications Grading. Access to many examples and resources will be provided.
