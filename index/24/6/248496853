We study settings in which agents with incomplete

preferences need to make a collective decision. We

focus on a process of majority dynamics where issues

are addressed one at a time and undecided

agents follow the opinion of the majority. We assess

the effects of this process on various consensus

notions—such as the Condorcet winner—and show

that in the worst case, myopic adherence to the majority

damages existing consensus; yet, simulation

experiments indicate that the damage is often mild.

We also examine scenarios where the chair of the

decision process can control the existence (or the

identity) of consensus, by determining the order in

which the issues are discussed.
