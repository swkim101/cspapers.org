The approximate degree of a Boolean function f∶{0,1}n→{0,1} is the minimum degree of a real polynomial p that approximates f pointwise: |f(x)−p(x)|≤1/3 for all x∈{0,1}n. For any δ>0, we construct DNF and CNF formulas of polynomial size with approximate degree Ω(n1−δ), essentially matching the trivial upper bound of n. This fully resolves the approximate degree of constant-depth circuits (AC0), a question that has seen extensive research over the past 10 years. Prior to our work, an Ω(n1−δ) lower bound was known only for AC0 circuits of depth that grows with 1/δ (Bun and Thaler, FOCS 2017). Furthermore, the DNF and CNF formulas that we construct are the simplest possible in that they have constant width. Our result gives the first near-linear lower bounds on the bounded-error communication complexity of polynomial-size DNF and CNF formulas in the challenging k-party number-on-the-forehead model and two-party quantum model: Ω(n/4kk2)1−δ and Ω(n1−δ), respectively, where δ>0 is any constant. Our lower bounds are essentially optimal. Analogous to above, such lower bounds were previously known only for AC0 circuits of depth that grows with 1/δ.
