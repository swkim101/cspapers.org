Learning is a social and emotional activity. Unfortunately, most instructors find that they lack the time and resources to focus on student affect during lectures, and student well-being is consigned to activities outside the lecture hall. As we see a rise in mental health issues in university students, there is a need for integrated approaches to support student well-being. Practices that are brief and easy to implement can be integrated into lecture sessions to help students, without detracting from learning outcomes or placing undue burden on course instructors. In this session, we will first make a case for lightweight practices, and then present and demonstrate some simple practices that can be used to support students' emotional engagement. The practices that will be presented are evidence-based and have been used in a variety of computing courses.
