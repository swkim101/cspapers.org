Novel biohybrid homo-polyelectrolyte-based nanocarriers were formed by the complexation of insulin (INS) with a biocompatible and cationic polyelectrolyte, namely, poly(vinyl benzyl trimethylammonium chloride) (PVBTMAC). According to light-scattering techniques, the hydrophilic PVBTMAC homo-polyelectrolyte forms single chains in aqueous media. The resulting biohybrid PVBTMAC/INS nanocarriers were formed via electrostatic co-assembly. The effects of polyelectrolyte structure and content on the characteristics of the formed PVBTMAC/INS complexes were studied. A significant aggregation tendency of the PVBTMAC/INS complexes was observed, based on the physicochemical results, especially at high protein concentration, corroborating the effective electrostatic interaction of INS with the cationic polyelectrolyte. The physicochemical properties of the formed PVBTMAC/INS nanocarriers depended on the concentration of the stock polymer and INS solutions. A neat PVBTMAC homo-polymer and PVBTMAC/INS nanocarriers demonstrated good serum stability in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) proteins. Fluorescence spectroscopy (FS) studies revealed no INS conformational changes after its complexation with the cationic PVBTMAC polyelectrolyte. The obtained PVBTMAC/INS complexes demonstrated considerable and promising characteristics for potential use as insulin delivery systems.
