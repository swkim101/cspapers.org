Cybersecurity ranges allow students to explore challenges in realistic system conditions and often play a central role in related courses. The pre-built scenarios also serve well in "capture the flag'' competitions. Existing ranges are typically built using server equipment that is difficult to transport or are hosted as virtual machines. We have created a mobile cyber range by porting existing exercises to Raspberry Pis. Apart from the mobility advantage, our range requires hardware that is significantly more affordable for institutions. Since existing range images depend on specific x86 binaries and architectural features, we present the methodology through which we overcame such challenges as well as preliminary results.
