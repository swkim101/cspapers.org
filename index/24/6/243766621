Android applications are extremely popular, as they are used for banking, social media, e-commerce, etc. However, several malicious applications have recently carried out data leaks and spurious credit card charges by abusing the Android Permissions granted initially to them by unaware users in good faith. To alleviate this pressing concern, we present DyPolDroid, a dynamic, semi-automated security framework that builds upon Android Enterprise, a device-management framework for organizations, allowing for users to design and enforce custom Counter-Policies, effectively protecting against such malicious applications without requiring advanced security and/or technical expertise.
