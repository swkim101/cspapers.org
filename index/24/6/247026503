A Joint Task Force of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers~-~Computer Society (IEEE-CS), and Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) was constituted in early 2021 to begin the decennial process of revising the Computer Science curricular guidelines, which were last released as Computer Science Curricula 2013 (CS2013). This special session will present the first draft of the revised curricular guidelines, currently referred to as CS202X, and solicit feedback. The CS202X draft will include revisions to CS2013 Knowledge Areas, a proposed competency model being incorporated into the curricular guidelines, and other updates. Targeted towards educators, administrators and others interested in Computer Science curricular issues, this session will be led by the co-chairs and members of the CS202X Steering Committee as part of their process to engage the community and solicit feedback.
