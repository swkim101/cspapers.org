Computing professions are increasingly accessible through alternate educational pathways in addition to traditional undergraduate Computer Science bachelor's degrees (CSBach). In particular, coding bootcamps (CBC) are now widespread. In 2020, 42% of entry-level technology professionals entered the USA job market through the CBC pathway (25K CBC vs 34K CSBach). Despite the influx of CBC graduates, current literature lacks insight into technology professionals' retrospective thoughts on their chosen educational paths. In particular, what paths might a bootcamp graduate have taken with respect to their undergraduate degree? Would a CSBach graduate choose a CBC instead? During semi-structured interviews, a group of similar age, gender balanced CSBach (N=12) and CBC (N=19) graduates currently working in the technology industry were asked if they would have skipped college for a CBC. Upon reflection, the CSBach participants would repeat their undergraduate degrees and majors. Of the fourteen bootcamp graduates who also held non-CS bachelor's degrees, eight reported that they would not have forgone their undergraduate experience but would have instead majored in CS (N=7) or taken CS classes (N=1). Of the remaining six bootcamp graduates who completed college, three would have bypassed college in lieu of a CBC and three were unsure. Finally, the five CBC graduates who did not attend (N=2) or complete (N=3) college would still not obtain any bachelor's degree. Regardless of current considerations, however, CBC graduates felt no more unprepared than their CSBach peers.
