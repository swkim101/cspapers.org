Frame-Based Editing (FBE) is a novel programming style which encompasses the good features of both Block and Text based editing. Moreover, FBE is designed as a middle step between Block and Text based editing, in order to ease the transition from the first to the latter. Strype is a new online editor which implements the FBE idea for Python and is used for programming the micro:bit. This demo will showcase the unique characteristics of Strype and demonstrate its use. Also, this demo will introduce Strype, and FBE generally, to the educational community in order to initiate fruitful discussions, get feedback and also promote its adoption to the educational community.
