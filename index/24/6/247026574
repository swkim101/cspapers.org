StoryQ is a web-based machine learning and text mining tool that allows young learners (Grade 6-12) to engage in machine learning practices and work with unstructured text data without coding. StoryQ features dynamically linked data representations that promote meaningful inquiries across tables, graphs, and texts--a unique user experience that makes machine learning models transparent, explainable, and fun to explore. This demo provides a brief tutorial on how to use StoryQ to train, test, and troubleshoot text classification models using both standard feature extractors (e.g., N-grams) and special feature extraction tools and visualizations designed to support young learners and non-computing teachers. This demo also includes sample learning activities designed for high school English Language Arts classes to showcase how machine learning concepts and practices can be introduced in non-computing classes. This work is supported by an NSF I-TEST project (DRL-1949110).
