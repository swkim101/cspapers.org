Instruction selection, whereby input code represented in an intermediate representation is translated into executable instructions from the target platform, is often the most target-dependent component in optimizing compilers. Current approaches include pattern matching, which is brittle and tedious to design, or search-based methods, which are limited by scalability of the search algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that first abstracts the target platform instructions into high-level uber-instructions, with each uber-instruction unifying multiple concrete instructions from the target platform. Program synthesis is used to lift input code sequences into semantically equivalent sequences of uber-instructions and then to lower from uber-instructions to machine code. Using 21 real-world benchmarks, we show that our synthesis-based instruction selection algorithm can generate instruction sequences for a hardware target, with the synthesized code performing up to 2.1x faster as compared to code generated by a professionally-developed optimizing compiler for the same platform.
