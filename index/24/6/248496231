The success of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) has reshaped the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Yet, it is not easy to obtain high-performing models and deploy them online for industrial practitioners. To bridge this gap, EasyNLP is designed to make it easy to build NLP applications, which supports a comprehensive suite of NLP algorithms. It further features knowledge-enhanced pre-training, knowledge distillation and few-shot learning functionalities for large-scale PTMs, and provides a unified framework of model training, inference and deployment for real-world applications. Currently, EasyNLP has powered over ten business units within Alibaba Group and is seamlessly integrated to the Platform of AI (PAI) products on Alibaba Cloud. The source code of our EasyNLP toolkit is released at GitHub (https://github.com/alibaba/EasyNLP).
