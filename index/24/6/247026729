Providing learners with authentic interdisciplinary experiences is one strategy to foster positive perceptions of CS as a discipline that supports a breadth of applications. We designed a high school mini course using climate science as an interdisciplinary context, since it is of interest to today's youth and provides opportunities to engage with authentic applications of computing that leverage real data to examine issues. The course was designed to engage students in climate change, data visualization, distributed computing, and motivate the use of advanced data abstractions and practices. We used NetsBlox, an extension of Snap! that makes real datasets & Web services accessible through easy-to-use blocks. A paleoclimatologist led climate science discussions and research questions with students. Post-survey responses to questions probing insights students gained shed light on the positive impact on students' perceptions of CS through this interdisciplinary experience, and how it expanded their horizons for future STEM inquiry using data and computing. We share curricular details for use in high schools and takeaways to help promote rich programming experiences that improve students' perceptions of computing.
