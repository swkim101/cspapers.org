As computer science educators, many of us share the common challenge of assessing students' programming skills. While a number of commercial services have popped up to fill this need, numerous members of the CS-Education community develop and maintain their own in-house tools. Commercial services may increase the costs to institutions and students, while instructor-developed tools are usually tailored to their own use cases; as a result, new instructors often, in turn, build their own highly-specialized solutions. This BOF is intended to spark a conversation about how we as a community can address this challenge by working together. In particular, we will discuss the availability of current open source tools and how they can be generalized, with a focus on editors, compilers, questionnaires, and scoring systems for assessments, including web-based and local-software solutions. Looking forward, we will discuss possible avenues to unite platforms and code bases, coordinate, and collaborate in the future-including student involvement as part of their coursework (e.g., capstone projects) to further develop platforms. Finally, by providing a dedicated session, we hope to advertise and disseminate the open source availability of these projects for those who seek a low- or no-cost solution for their students.
