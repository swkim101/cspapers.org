From March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic imposed "emergency remote teaching" across education globally, leading to the closure of institutions across all settings. The resulting shift to online learning, teaching and assessment (LT&A) has placed significant challenges on practitioners, especially their mental health and wellbeing. Building on previous work, this poster presents preliminary results drawn from international computer science practitioners (n=779), extracted from a wider sample of university academics (N=2,628). We highlight widespread disciplinary concerns relating to transitioning to remote online working; deprioritisation of research; and wider impact on marginalised communities within computer science. These results offer valuable insight into the emerging impact of COVID-19 on computer science practitioners, especially as we start to move towards a new post-COVID (ab)normal.
