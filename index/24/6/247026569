Engaging teachers in research has been shown to increase their self-efficacy and other factors related to increasing students' learning and growth. In this project, we partnered education researchers with computer science (CS) middle school teachers in the U.S. to develop a set of equity-focused teacher practice briefs that address a problem of practice that the teachers experience in their classrooms. Using a prescribed development process previously developed by Bell and Rhinehart (2016) for creating these briefs, teacher involved in the process saw their self-efficacy, professional networks and pedagogical content knowledge with respect to equity increase. The process allowed educators to reflect on their understanding of their particular problems of practice, while also collaboratively with expert researchers in the field to interpret previously published research results. The teachers and researcher teams created three briefs for the broader community to use. Throughout this four-month process, we learned how to improve the format for our particular needs, which included ensuring all voices were heard and equity was at the forefront of the work. In this experience report, we detail the process we used and report on lessons learned about the process from the teachers and researchers who participated. We also provide recommendations for others interested in using this method to engage in-service or pre-service teachers.
