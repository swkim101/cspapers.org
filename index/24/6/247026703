A qualitative study of 34 young technology professionals (average age 29.6 yo) indicates that most had misunderstandings about the Computer Science field before they began their Computer Science education. During interviews with both traditional Computer Science graduates (N=16) and bootcamp graduates (N=18), the most common misconception reported was an overstatement of the role of mathematics in the field (31/34). In addition, about a third (11/34; 8 female, one male) anticipated barriers ("inaccessible", "male-dominated") and most (31/34) believed coding was difficult or held other negative associations. Finally, many reported not having an understanding of Computer Science at all (18/34:7 college; 11 bootcamp) College graduates reported having other experiences (coding, mentors) that offset this general lack of understanding and negative connotations. These findings suggest that these misunderstandings are a barrier for many when considering a college major. Debunking these myths earlier may decrease perceived barriers for those without counter-balancing experiences.
