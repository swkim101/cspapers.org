Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, computing instructors have adapted their teaching to meet the needs of students in this ever-changing paradigm. These adaptations include the acquisition of new infrastructure, evolving expectations, revised course development strategies and the adoption of new modes of course delivery. Last year, an ITiCSE Working Group, led by Siegel and Zarb, explored the ways in which higher education computing faculty responded to this dramatic shift in the (educational) world [1]. Based on a survey of computing faculty worldwide, the work explored what the academic landscape might look like beyond the impacts of COVID-19. We will explore these results and discuss lessons learned along with the evolution that has taken place since the survey data was collected. Recognizing that it is unlikely that we return completely to pre-pandemic norms, our goal is to identify practices within computing that have newly formed or improved throughout the pandemic, giving extra weight to those that we might hope to keep as we move into a post-pandemic future.
