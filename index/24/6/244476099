An event camera detects the scene radiance changes and sends a sequence of asynchronous event streams with high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, and low latency. However, the spatial resolution of event cameras is limited as a trade-off for these outstanding properties. To reconstruct high-resolution intensity images from event data, we propose EvIntSR-Net that converts Event data to multiple latent Intensity frames to achieve Super-Resolution on intensity images in this paper. EvIntSR-Net bridges the domain gap between event streams and intensity frames and learns to merge a sequence of latent intensity frames in a recurrent updating manner. Experimental results show that EvIntSR-Net can reconstruct SR intensity images with higher dynamic range and fewer blurry artifacts by fusing events with intensity frames for both simulated and real-world data. Furthermore, the proposed EvIntSR-Net is able to generate high-frame-rate videos with super-resolved frames.
