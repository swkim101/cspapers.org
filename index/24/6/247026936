Our current moment, where our global public health, race, and educational crises are converging, requires us to engage in a deep interrogation of our computer science (CS) and tech communities into the ways we uphold anti-Blackness. The increased weaponizing of data and surveillance against Black people, racial inequities in tech (e.g., access and opportunity for Black people), ousting of Dr. Timnit Gebru from Google, and continued examples of racial bias and algorithmic harms all point to a need to address how tech and computer science fields mimic the negative impacts of anti-Blackness in our classrooms, processes, and thinking. In addition to upholding the harms of anti-Blackness our computer science and tech spaces need a more concerted effort to make more space for Black people, especially Black girls and women in CS computer science and tech, not rest on our laurels. This BOF aims to open discussion about what is anti-Blackness, how it is embedded in our practices and processes in computer science and tech, and what we can collectively do as a community to make more room that bravely embraces the full humanity of Black people, especially Black girls and women.
