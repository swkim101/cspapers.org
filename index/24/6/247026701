Instructors in computing live with constant change in our discipline along with evolution of teaching modes and methods. These changes lead many instructors to adjust their teaching and also seem to impact self-perception and identity of faculty as instructors. This BoF will discuss instructor identity in computing and ways that identity changes over time. The organizers have observed identity change among instructors who have begun to employ open source software for social good as a vehicle for student learning. The BoF is an invitation to discuss this identity change in a broader context. It seems likely, for example, that the pandemic may have changed instructor self-perceptions. The on-going high rate of change in computing may also impact instructors. The BoF ogranizers would like to discuss other instances of change in identity of computing faculty, and discuss how this phenomenon might be investigated. Faculty interested in an exploration of this area as a research project are particularly encouraged to join the BoF.
