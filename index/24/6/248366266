We introduce an interactive image segmentation and visualization framework for identifying, inspecting, and editing tiny objects (just a few pixels wide) in large multi-megapixel high-dynamic-range (HDR) images. Detecting cosmic rays (CRs) in astronomical observations is a cum-bersome workflow that requires multiple tools, so we developed an interactive toolkit that unifies model inference, HDR image visualization, segmentation mask inspection and editing into a single graphical user interface. The feature set, initially designed for astronomical data, makes this work a useful research-supporting tool for human-in-the-loop tiny-object segmentation in scientific areas like biomedicine, materials science, remote sensing, etc., as well as computer vision. Our interface features mouse-controlled, synchronized, dual-window visualization of the image and the segmentation mask, a critical feature for locating tiny objects in multi-megapixel images. The browser-based tool can be readily hosted on the web to provide multi-user access and GPU acceleration for any device. The toolkit can also be used as a high-precision annotation tool, or adapted as the frontend for an interactive machine learning framework. Our open-source dataset, CR detection model, and visualization toolkit are available at https://github.com/cy-xu/cosmic-com.
