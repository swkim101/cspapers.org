The technology sector remains one of the fastest growing industries across the nation and continues to rapidly permeate all facets of society. The next generation of the computing workforce must be equipped with the skills to examine how existing systems exacerbate inequities, while developing the competencies to build new, more equitable innovations. To enable this shift, computer science (CS) instruction needs to develop not only students' computing identities and computational thinking, but also critical thinking and ethical reasoning. Educators are key to this transformation, yet little is known about the landscape of K-12 CS educators and how equipped they are to provide equitable CS instruction. To understand the challenges that CS educators face and identify the supports and resources to more effectively equip them to serve a diverse student body, these panelists launched a national landscape survey. This panel of experts from the Kapor Center and the Computer Science Teachers Association will reflect on the survey findings and lead a discussion with the audience about the implications of the data on the future of educational policy, practice, and research to better support CS educators to build more equitable classroom spaces.
