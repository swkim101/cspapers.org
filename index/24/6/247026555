In recent years, Academic Integrity (AI) cases in the Computer Science (CS) discipline are on the rise, with students often being unaware of what constitutes a violation and its potential consequences. This prompted us to develop an AI module that aims to educate CS undergraduate students to recognize misconduct in academic scenarios, their potential consequences, and recall strategies/resources to avoid misconduct in the CS context. We have deployed this module in eight CS courses in UNC Charlotte. In this poster, we present our motivation, design guidelines, deployment details, and the results of a study based on data collected in Spring and Fall 2021.
