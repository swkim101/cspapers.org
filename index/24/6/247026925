Talladega County Schools (Talladega) is working to design and implement an inclusive K-12 computing pathway in their district as part of a larger Research Practice Partnership (RPP). This poster describes the reflections of a district leader in Talladega who led an inclusivity in computing initiative related to the pathway. The Talladega committee reflected on their pathway within the context of their district equity goal and centered conversations around how to support young women and students from low socio-economic households to participate in computing. After reflecting and discussing, the group designed equity-centered formative assessment tools for the three overarching competencies: Algorithmic Thinking; Data Collection and Analysis; and Creating Models and Simulations. This work builds on literature about designing equitable computing learning environments for students.
