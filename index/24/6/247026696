In order to increase empathy and foster conversation around accessibility, we created three games, simulating disabilities, that are geared towards engaging beginner CS and non-CS students to learn about accessibility. Each game has four rounds: game mode, simulation mode, game+accessibility mode, and simulation+accessibility mode. We tested the games on 113 students from two universities and report on performance and survey results that show that playing our games induced student empathy towards people with disabilities and motivated them towards accessible design.
