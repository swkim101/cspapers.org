One notable part of the academia-industry gap is the deficiency in computing ecosystem literacy, which may result in college graduates exhibiting little technical knowledge of software development tools and practices commonly used in industry. This paper presents our experience developing and teaching "The Missing CS Class," the student-led 1-unit course that we created at our university to address computing ecosystem literacy. This course primarily targets lower-division students and, based on our observations as peer tutors, covers four common but crucial gaps in technical knowledge: (1) Unix-like command-line environments and tools, (2) Software testing and debugging, (3) Scripting, and (4) Version control. Based on the collected feedback from two consecutive offerings of this course during the winter and spring quarters of 2021, most surveyed students reported having increased their self-efficacy on all course topics and incorporated them into their software development workflow. To benefit the community at large, we have published all the lecture materials online at https://missing.cs.ucdavis.edu.
