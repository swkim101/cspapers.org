This lightning talk describes our current efforts to isolate and identify potential threshold concepts and threshold capabilities which are experienced by intermediate computer science undergraduate students. We are utilizing the theoretical framework as described by Meyer, Land, Bowden, and Baillie. Two of the key identifiable characteristics surrounding a threshold concept are (1) the transformation one undergoes as a result of incorporating the concept into their knowledge and (2) the state of uncertainty (liminality) experienced as the learner develops this understanding. As a result of this transformation and the resultant traversal of a liminal state, elements of an identity are often developed. For the computer science undergraduate, we hypothesize that advanced computational thinking skills are developed along with these transformations leading to the development of a computer scientist identity. Through identification of the threshold concepts/capabilities experienced by intermediate students the potential corollary concepts behind computational thinking may be uncovered as well. The overall project intends to integrate elements of threshold concepts, liminality, and transformative learning to produce a framework through which computational thinking can be probed and students' progression can be better assessed and supported. These efforts are only beginning - curious faculty and students are invited to attend our presentation and consider potential collaborative participation in our endeavors.
