We have implemented a novel framework called CryptoScratch for teaching cryptography using the widely available Scratch platform. CryptoScratch enables K-12 students to learn how to use cryptographic algorithms such as AES, RSA, and SHA2 and combine these algorithms to build complex modern cryptographic schemes such as Digital Signatures and Pretty Good Privacy. CryptoScratch implements the algorithms as intuitive visual blocks abstracting away the mathematical and technical details of the algorithms. This poster discusses the implementation of CryptoScratch and how using these blocks can help students develop and understand the importance of cryptography in their digital lives.
