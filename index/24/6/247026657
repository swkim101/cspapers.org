Long-term collaborative team projects can be challenging, and our students often run into problems relating to team dynamics and team member participation. The CoLab.online web application is designed to give instructors the data and support they need to help their students develop the skills necessary for success in team projects. Its feature set includes weekly self- and peer-assessment with interactive charts, a point-based system using team members' traits to optimize for diverse group composition, groupwork simulations and a gamified collaborative reading activity. This presentation will demonstrate the functionality and usage of the CoLab.online web application.
