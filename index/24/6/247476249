Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) are introduced by the semantic web community as small-sized user-centric knowledge graphs (KGs). PKGs fill the gap of personalised representation of user data and interests on the top of big, well-established encyclopedic KGs, such as DBpedia [21]. Inspired by the widely recent usage of PKGs in the medical domain to represent patient data, this PhD proposal aims to adopt a similar technique in the educational domain in e-learning platforms by deploying PKGs to represent users and learners. We propose a novel PKG development that relies on ontology and interlinks to Linked Open Data. Hence, adding the dimension of personalisation and explainability in usersâ€™ featured data while respecting privacy. This research design is developed in two use cases: a collaborative search learning platform and an e-learning platform. Our preliminary results show that e-learning platforms can get benefited from our approach by providing personalised recommendations and more user and group-specific data.
