In order to transfer problem solving knowledge effectively across tasks, students must be able to identify when two problems can be solved in similar ways. As instructors, it is helpful to know how well students can identify such similarities. Unfortunately, current efforts to understand how students categorise similar problems are laborious and time-consuming, involving intensive data collection and analysis. Our own prior work on analysing student categorisations of simple algorithmic patterns involved 35 hour-long interviews and time-consuming open coding of the resulting transcripts. It is clear that traditional approaches to elicit such knowledge are not scalable or reproducible. We propose a method of automatically analysing student classification of simple problems which examines digitally collected quantitative data from online card sorting exercises. We compare the results of this automated analysis with our own prior work which examined qualitative data and find that both analyses reveal similar insights. Research in this area is new; however, quantitative analysis of card sorting data provides an effective and scalable method of quickly identifying how students view problem similarities. The method proposed in this paper seems promising for a wide range of topics and exercises including formative and summative assessment.
