Many computer science departments have chosen to hire faculty to teach in teaching-track positions that parallel the standard tenure-track position, providing the possibility of promotion, longer-term contracts, and higher pay for excellence in teaching and service. This birds-of-a-feather is designed to gather educators, both experienced and new to teaching track positions, who are currently in such a position to share their experiences as members of the faculty of their departments and schools, and to provide opportunities for schools considering such positions to gather information. This year, we plan on discussing challenges we face in continuing- / post-COVID-19 classrooms, and lessons-learned from over a year of pandemic teaching. We will also celebrate our teaching and career successes from the past two years of teaching.
