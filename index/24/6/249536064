We prove that Graph Isomorphism and Canonization in graphs excluding a fixed graph H as a minor can be solved by an algorithm working in time f(H)Â· nO(1), where f is some function. In other words, we show that these problems are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the size of the excluded minor, with the caveat that the bound on the running time is not necessarily computable. The underlying approach is based on decomposing the graph in a canonical way into unbreakable (intuitively, well-connected) parts, which essentially provides a reduction to the case where the given H-minor-free graph is unbreakable itself. This is complemented by an analysis of unbreakable H-minor-free graphs, which reveals that every such graph can be canonically decomposed into a part that admits few automorphisms and a part that has bounded treewidth.
