Culturally Responsive Teaching (CRT) is a pedagogical strategy that aims to engage culturally and linguistically diverse students in the classroom, to validate and to empower them (Scott, Sheridan, & Clark, 2014; Gay, 2010). Five commonly described aspects of culturally responsive instruction include: (1) helping students to value the perspectives of others, (2) affirming a sense of belonging, (3) validating students' cultural identities, (4) educating students about the diversity of the world around them, (5) supporting students to develop an awareness the impactful social structures. Research has shown repeatedly that CRT increases the academic success of ethnically diverse communities (Gay, 2018; Ladson-Billings, 1995). This talk will provide examples of how CRT has been incorporated into a Scratch-based, upper-elementary computational thinking curriculum that was developed specifically for English language learners. Learning activities include cultural content, diverse role models in the computer science field, and student reflection.
