State-of-the-art fully intrinsic network for non-rigid shape matching are unable to disambiguate between shape inner symmetries. Meanwhile, recent advances in the functional map framework allow to enforce orientation preservation using a functional representation for tangent vector field transfer, through so-called complex functional maps. Using this representation, we propose a new deep learning approach to learn orientation-aware features in afully unsupervised setting. Our architecture is built on DiffusionNet, which makes our method robust to discretization changes, while adding a vector-field-based loss, which promotes orientation preservation without using (often unstable) extrinsic descriptors.
