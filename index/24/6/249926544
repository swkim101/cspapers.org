Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) are imperceptible, image-agnostic vectors that cause deep neural networks (DNNs) to misclassify inputs with high probability. In practical attack scenarios, adversarial perturbations may undergo transformations such as changes in pixel intensity, scaling, etc. before being added to DNN inputs. Existing methods do not create UAPs robust to these real-world transformations, thereby limiting their applicability in practical attack scenarios. In this work, we introduce and formulate UAPs robust against real-world transformations. We build an iterative algorithm using probabilistic robustness bounds and construct such UAPs robust to transformations generated by composing arbitrary sub-differentiable transformation functions. We perform an extensive evaluation on the popular CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC 2012 datasets measuring our UAPs' robustness under a wide range common, real-world transformations such as rotation, contrast changes, etc. We further show that by using a set of primitive transformations our method can generalize well to unseen transformations such as fog, JPEG compression, etc. Our results show that our method can generate UAPs up to 23% more robust than state-of-the-art baselines.
