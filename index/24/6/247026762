Enrollments in computer science courses and majors are at or exceeding capacity at the college level. This context drives local innovations that may benefit individuals across the SIGCSE community. The panelists will share how, in the context of booming enrollments and COVID, they strive to protect faculty time, engage students in larger classes, take advantage of scale, improve student-TA interactions, motivate faculty to teach larger classes, and better monitor students in large classes. During the panel Q&A, attendees will be invited to share additional strategies live on Course.Care, which will then be disseminated through CSTeachingTips.org.
