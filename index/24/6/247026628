We established ExCITE (Excellence in Computing and Information Technology Education), a college-level service-learning program with a mission to broaden participation in computer science. It engages minority students in community service projects that include designing and implementing educational robots, conducting workshops for K-12 students, and restoring computers. We created 1) an exciting curriculum that integrates research, pedagogy training, and leadership development into community service; 2) a unique model of hybrid service learning. The preliminary results include: 1) success in engaging and retaining female, Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino college students; 2) positive feedback from the ExCITE students and the K-12 students they served.
