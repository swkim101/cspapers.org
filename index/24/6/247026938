The 2019 ABET computer science criteria requires that all computing students learn parallel and distributed computing (PDC) as undergraduates, and CS2013 recommends at least fifteen hours of PDC in the undergraduate curriculum. Consequently, many educators are looking for easy ways to integrate PDC into courses at their institutions. This hands-on workshop introduces Message Passing Interface (MPI) basics in Python or C/C++ using clusters of Raspberry Pi single-board computers. MPI is a multi-language, platform independent, industry-standard library for PDC. Raspberry Pis are an inexpensive and engaging hardware platform for studying PDC as early as CS1. Participants will experience how to teach distributed computing essentials with MPI by means of reusable, effective "parallel patterns," including single program multiple data (SPMD) execution, send-receive message passing, and parallel loop patterns. No prior experience with MPI, PDC, or the Raspberry Pi is expected; participants will explore short programs designed to help students understand MPI basics, plus longer "exemplar" programs that use MPI to solve significant applied problems. The workshop includes: (i) personal experience with the Raspberry Pi (clusters provided); (ii) instructions on how to deploy Raspberry Pi clusters quickly in the classroom; (iii) self-paced hands-on experimentation with MPI programs; and (iv) a discussion of how to use Raspberry Pi clusters to align courses with CS2013 and ABET. All materials from this workshop are available from CSinParallel.org; participants should bring a laptop to access materials and connect to the Raspberry Pi clusters.
