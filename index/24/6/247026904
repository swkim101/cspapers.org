CS courses often use a variety of learning activities to assist students while learning concepts. These activities' levels of engagement can be categorized through the ICAP framework as Interactive, Constructive, Active, and Passive respectfully. For this work, we categorize learning activities from an online professional development course and analyzed the probabilities of transitioning between ICAP modalities on a week-by-week basis. This poster presents our analysis on which ICAP modes students visited during each week of the course. We found the majority of students would review Passive materials before Interactive activities, then repeating this process. The second most common transition followed the ICAP Framework, selecting activities with increasing levels of engagement. Contrary to our assumptions, students primarily worked on 'new' materials, rather than 'review' previous activities.
