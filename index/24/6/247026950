Row Hammer is a fault-injection attack in which rapid activations to a single DRAM row causes bit-flips in nearby rows. Several recent defenses propose tracking aggressor-rows and applying mitigating action on neighboring victim rows by refreshing them. However, all such proposals using victim-focused mitigation preserve the spatial connection between victim and aggressor rows. Therefore, these proposals are susceptible to access patterns causing bit-flips in rows beyond the immediate neighbor. For example, the Half-Double attack causes bit-flips in the presence of victim-focused mitigation. We propose Randomized Row-Swap (RRS), a novel mitigation action that breaks the spatial connection between the aggressor and victim DRAM rows. This enables RRS to provide robust defense against even complex Row Hammer access patterns. RRS is an aggressor-focused mitigation that periodically swaps aggressor-rows with other randomly selected rows in memory. This limits the possible damage in any one locality within the DRAM memory. While RRS can be used with any tracking mechanism, we implement it with a Misra-Gries tracker and target a Row Hammer Threshold of 4.8K activations (similar to the state-of-the-art attacks). Our evaluations show that RRS has negligible slowdown (0.4% on average) and provides strong security guarantees for avoiding Row Hammer bit flips even under several years of continuous attack.
