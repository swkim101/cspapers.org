Recently, vision-language joint representation learning has proven to be highly effective in various scenarios. In this paper, we specifically adapt vision-language joint learning for scene text detection, a task that intrinsically involves cross-modal interaction between the two modalities: vision and language, since text is the written form of language. Concretely, we propose to learn contextualized, joint representations through vision-language pretraining, for the sake of enhancing the performance of scene text detectors. Towards this end, we devise a pre-training architecture with an image encoder, a text encoder and a cross-modal encoder, as well as three pretext tasks: image-text contrastive learning (ITC), masked language modeling (MLM) and word-in-image prediction (WIP). The pretrained model is able to produce more informative representations with richer semantics, which could readily benefit existing scene text detectors (such as EAST and PSENet) in the down-stream text detection task. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed paradigm can significantly improve the performance of various representative text detectors, outperforming previous pre-training approaches. The code and pre-trained models will be publicly released.
