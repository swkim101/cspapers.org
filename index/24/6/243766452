Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are increasingly deployed in datacenters due to their inherent flexibility over ASICs or GPUs that makes them an ideal processing unit for emerging and dynamic area of deep learning and other techniques and algorithms that are rapidly evolving. To maximize their utilization in the cloud, researchers have proposed the spatial multi-tenant deployment model, where the FPGA fabric is simultaneously shared among mutually distrusting tenants. This is enabled by leveraging the partial reconfiguration capability of FPGAs. In this paper, we systematize the research work on multi-tenant FPGAs in cloud computing settings and highlight their adversary models, security guarantees, as well as their fundamental security and privacy related shortcomings. We further categorize existing research works that demonstrate a new class of remotely-exploitable physical attacks on multi-tenant FPGAs by malicious tenants sharing physical resources with the victims. Through investigating end-to-end multi-tenant FPGA deployment comprehensively, we reveal that these attacks represent only one dimension of the problem, while various open security and privacy challenges remain unaddressed. We conclude with our insights on future research challenges and open opportunities.
