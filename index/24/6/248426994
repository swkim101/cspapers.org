We propose factor graph optimization for simultaneous planning, control, and trajectory estimation for collision-free navigation of autonomous systems in environments with moving objects. The proposed online probabilistic motion planning and trajectory estimation navigation technique generates optimal collision-free state and control trajectories for autonomous vehicles when the obstacle motion model is both unknown and known. We evaluate the utility of the algorithm to support future autonomous robotic space missions.
