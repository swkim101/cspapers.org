Computer science (CS) education is an important subject for K-12 students in an increasingly computational world. However, common CS education practices may not be inclusive of all learners. Culturally responsive computing (CRC) initiatives aim to center and empower learners from diverse and historically excluded backgrounds. With a sudden shift to online learning, virtual educational experiences have been developed. We describe three main findings from running three iterations of an online synchronous CRC camp for middle school girls, which are: (1) Integration of power, identity, and CS concepts, (2) Participation in CS vs. power and identity activities based on learners' backgrounds, and (3) Adjusting instructor expectations about learner engagement to be more open-ended.
