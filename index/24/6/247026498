Many initiatives for introducing computer science and computational thinking to young students are enriched by the usage of physical computing and makerspaces. These makerspaces offer exposure to a wide range of tools and activities guided by equitable approaches to help break down barriers of entry to computer science fields. To build upon this work, Georgia Institute of Technology has recently started a dedicated K-12 makerspace on its campus and is piloting a two-year program with the National Center for Women & Information Technology to expose women and gender non-conforming high-school students of all backgrounds to programming and collegiate-level research in STEM areas. Using Project GUTS as a base curriculum, we focus on physical and on-screen activities that explore the concept of complex adaptive systems as physical representations within the real-world. Two research directions for the project are, first, studying how learning gains are impacted when incorporating physical representations of complex systems to the curriculum as opposed to relying purely on online simulations, and second, studying how a makerspace supports learning about complex systems in general. We are currently in the first stage of the program, working with a group of high-school students in the 2021/2022 school year. We are excited to share our ongoing process with other researchers and educators to discuss how we may improve this program for future iterations.
