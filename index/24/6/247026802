This poster reports on undergraduate computer science (CS) majors' experiences as near-peer instructional leaders in informal K-12 computing programs during a 12-week summer period. We analyze how the undergraduates' prior experiences in computing and their intersectional computing identities influence their self-perceptions as mentors and instructors. Case study analyses of the undergraduates revealed that their journeys in computing (e.g., their level of access to computing education courses or their exposure to influential role models) directly influenced their mentor and instructor identity development. This poster provides evidence for the need for more intersectional approaches to near-peer mentoring models.
