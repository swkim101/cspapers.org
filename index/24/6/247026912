Academic computing departments are seeking ways to broaden participation in computing (BPC), and many are encouraging individual faculty, staff, and students to attend diversity-oriented conferences, like the Tapia and STARS Celebrations of Diversity in Computing and Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. The purpose of the STARS Ignite Workshop is to provide faculty and staff with a framework including the tools and knowledge needed to make such conference attendance beneficial both to the students attending the conference and to the sponsoring faculty and their department. In this workshop, participants will learn to recruit and lead a BPC purpose-driven student conference cohort and the implementation of a BPC event or program. Participants will be provided with opportunities to adapt sample materials (recruitment emails, applications, etc.) to their own needs, assess the BPC needs at their institutions, and learn how to determine if their BPC efforts are successful. A laptop and Google account are required for this event. Interested attendees should be willing to commit to leading a student conference cohort to a diversity-oriented computing conference and then implementing a BPC event or program with these students.
