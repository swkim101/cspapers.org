Demand for computer science teaching faculty is skyrocketing. In response, many colleges and universities are beginning to advertise for and hire teaching candidates without a PhD. In this panel, we discuss our experiences as faculty in this position and explore how we can promote and support the important contributions that non-PhD faculty have on students. Throughout this interactive panel, we will engage in-person and virtual participants from all levels of higher education to discuss the experiences surrounding teaching track faculty without a PhD. Additionally we will reflect and envision how our community can systematically support and create alternative paths within academia that will allow potential faculty to earn a terminal Master's degree and learn how to be effective teachers at the same time.
