In order to advance broadening participation in computing (BPC) efforts, research and practice projects should implement a board (advisory or strategic) that specifically focuses on equity. In light of the murder of George Floyd, the impact of COVID-19 on minoritized communities, and the historical (and continual) erasure of diverse voices within the computing and technology fields, it is important that networks, alliances, and the broader computer science community engage with stakeholders with critical expertise in areas of diversity, equity, and inclusion. In this panel, Expanding Computing in Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance Executive Board members will discuss the need for equity-centered conversations, specifically when it comes to BPC. Panelists and audience members will engage in dialogue around the necessity for, and value of, creating spaces where diverse voices are elevated and supported.
