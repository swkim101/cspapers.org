As Computer Science (CS) is moving into K-12 education, we are facing a severe shortage of CS teachers and two-thirds of teachers do not have a solid CS background in the States. CS is an ever-changing field that makes it harder for updating teachers' knowledge. To produce CS teachers, universities will have to create or revise their teacher education programs to accommodate CS. In addition to the need for certified CS teachers, one additional aspect has reached a critical need situation: the professional development (PD) of existing CS teachers, who are typically non-CS graduates or certified in non-CS subjects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to build new programs and start a community and update knowledge of both the latest technology and teaching pedagogies. For example, information security has become a national concern, and data analytics with machine learning is prevalent due to big data collected daily and maturity of artificial intelligence. Yet little curriculum is developed based on the aforementioned two important subjects for K-12 CS curriculum, and often teachers' lack of knowledge in these subjects. There is a demand about the particular learning needs of existing CS teachers in these areas. Well-established curriculum and well-trained teachers will be critical as the CS teaching work force expands significantly in coming years. In this project, we report and share our experience in recruiting, developing programs, and retaining K-12 CS teachers.
