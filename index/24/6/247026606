Motivated by the need to develop equitable and just computer science education, we implemented a resubmission policy. We ran a large-scale, end-of-term survey of all students across two large introductory CS courses asking about their reasons for resubmission. Though some students were motivated primarily by grades, many responses suggested intrinsic motivation. We interviewed 9 students and found that in our competitive program, resubmissions take the pressure off the need to submit work that earns a perfect grade the first time. However, our findings suggest that resubmissions alone can't create space for equity and belonging.
