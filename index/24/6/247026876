The Doane University Center for Computing in the Liberal Arts (CCLA) provides a collaborative and supportive environment for Doane students, faculty, and staff, who are interested in incorporating computing into their schoolwork, projects, or research. Our operating analogy is that the CCLA is like a Writing Center, but for computing instead of prose. Ultimately, the CCLA aims to foster a culture of computing at Doane -- all of Doane. Therefore, the CCLA supports any academic discipline on campus: STEM disciplines, Business, Art, Social Sciences, Theater, and so on. Likewise, the CCLA supports a wide range of computing skills, from spreadsheets and word processing through databases and programming and into more advanced technologies such as machine learning and high-performance computing. The CCLA's mission is to be available to help any student, faculty, or staff member with any computer-related problem-solving task. Creating this culture of computing at the university will help equip our students with the computing skills necessary to become outstanding contributors and leaders in both the public and private sectors.
