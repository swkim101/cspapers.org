If states are to foster an environment in which all students have opportunities to thrive in computer science (CS), policy action will help create the conditions for success. Interviews with 20 individuals involved in the CS education policy process help to illuminate several factors that have facilitated California's recent policy successes, including: 1) support from influential stakeholders, including "CS champions" and diverse coalitions, 2) exposure to information for policymakers, and 3) alignment of CS education with policymaker values. The interviews also suggest three lessons learned about shaping CS education policy moving forward. First, the availability of funding for CS education plays a powerful role in supporting or inhibiting policy progress. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted CS education growth, but it also presents opportunities for progress if educators can foster understanding of and commitment to what CS entails. Finally, work to build and sustain stakeholder support for CS education policy efforts will shape the future success of those efforts.
