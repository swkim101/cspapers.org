This poster describes a CUNY wide project that offered faculty "mini-grants" to update and/or create courses that included content in Public Interest Technology. All content created was shared as Open Educational Resources. Sixteen faculty projects involving 24 faculty members across six City University of New York (CUNY) campuses were involved in creating PIT curricula. To date, 45 pieces of curricula have been deposited into CUNY's OER repository. Curricula spanned a wide breadth of topics, including physics, organic chemistry, engineering for public good, to name a few. PIT OER was downloaded 2,200 times across 96 countries.
