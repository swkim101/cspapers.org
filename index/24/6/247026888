GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovations) has been used in network research and education for more than a decade. However, because GENI lacks Graphic User Interface (GUI) and customized VM images, very few institutions utilize virtual machines (VM) deployed on GENI for generalized computer education. Additionally, connecting VMs on GENI requires complex configuration, which is time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we introduce EdGENI, an educational experiment solution built on top of GENI. EdGENI introduces a desktop environment to the GENI VM and allows users to save, duplicate, and share VM environments with other users. Furthermore, EdGENI also introduces a client application, PuTTY Connect, to simplify the process of making VM connections. These features improve the user experience and extend the user base of GENI, thus delivering a generalized experiment platform for computer education. We also developed a series of labs in EdGENI, covering topics of cybersecurity and blockchain. These labs are suitable for a wide range of students, from entry-level students who are unfamiliar with command-line interface to advanced students who are interested in sophisticated network attacks and preventions. The paper also provides an empirical support on the potential of EdGENI in helping students learning and developing skills in the cybersecurity field.
