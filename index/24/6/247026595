In introductory computer science courses (CS1), students who are programming for the first time will inevitably need help in order to overcome programming challenges. To accommodate large course sizes, most CS1 courses provide this help in the form of office hour sessions led by undergraduate teaching assistants (TAs). However, we have little understanding of how students go about seeking help during office hours, and what help they receive in return. In this poster, we present current findings from a grounded theory analysis of eight different CS1 office hours observations, and 16 interviews with the students and TAs who participated in them.
