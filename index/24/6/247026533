The goal of this work is to motivate and reward students for engaging in activities that we believe are important for lifelong learners. We are interested in activities that do not follow the simple, closed-form pattern that is common in most college-level assignments. Instead, we draw inspiration from "achievements" in video games, which encourage players to approach situations in new and interesting ways. Just as a videogame achievement might get a player to do something they otherwise wouldn't, we want to encourage our students to stretch into new experiences. We integrated achievements into a required sophomore-level course for Computer Science majors. Each week, in addition to their normal coursework, students can complete an achievement for course credit. Achievements cover a wide variety of themes and topics. Some are tied to course content, encouraging students to re-read texts and reflect on mistakes. Others build community, having students interview seniors about their capstone experiences or attend colloquia. Professional development is encouraged by attending the campus career fair or going to the tutoring center. A student can create their own tailored experience by choosing three or four achievements for course credit that match their interests, goals, and motivations. Our experience with achievements has been mostly positive. Students appreciate the variety of options and can generally find something that interests them. Of course, this same variety of options is intimidating to other students. We have been using achievements since 2013 and have experimented with various methods of articulating and awarding them, including peer review.
