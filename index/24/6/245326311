Air pollution monitoring needs a high spatiotemporal resolution for better estimation of ambient air quality. Nowadays systems based on low-cost gas sensors (E-noses) are able to quantify the main pollutant gases. They may provide an important complement to densify the actual air pollution monitoring network. These systems suffer from an important drift of gas sensors over the time, making necessary frequent recalibrations to maintain high accuracy. The calibration process of an E-nose is time consuming and expensive. Meanwhile, calibration transfer techniques may be a solution to avoid a full calibration. In our previous work, we studied calibration transfer techniques such as standardization applied on data collected in laboratory to obtain a unique calibration model for several identical systems. In this paper, we consider data collected on field to analyze the effectiveness of this standardization method to preserve the same calibration model during several months in spite of gas sensor drifts for electronic nose placed close to a highway, in Metz area. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one that addresses the standardization approach using data collected in field with gas sensors under real environment conditions. Results show that the standardization can efficiently correct data, which allows accurate outdoor estimation of the nitrogen dioxide concentrations by using the same calibration model for a six-month period.
