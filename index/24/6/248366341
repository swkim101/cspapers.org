In this paper, by introducing Generalized Bernstein condition, we propose the first O(√p over n∈ ) high probability excess population risk bound for differentially private algorithms under the assumptions G-Lipschitz, L-smooth, and Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition, based on gradient perturbation method. If we replace the properties G-Lipschitz and L-smooth by α-Hölder smoothness (which can be used in non-smooth setting), the high probability bound comes to O(n-α over 1+2α) w.r.t n, which cannot achieve O (1/n) when α ∈(0,1]. To solve this problem, we propose a variant of gradient perturbation method, max1,g -Normalized Gradient Perturbation (m-NGP). We further show that by normalization, the high probability excess population risk bound under assumptions α-Hölder smooth and Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition can achieve O (√p over n∈), which is the first O (1/n) high probability excess population risk bound w.r.t n for differentially private algorithms under non-smooth conditions. Moreover, experimental results show that m-NGP improves the performance of the differentially private model over real datasets.
