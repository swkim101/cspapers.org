Mathematics instruction in computer science goes beyond prescribed topic coverage. It should build proficiency and willingness to engage in mathematical thought whenever appropriate: knowledge retention (across multiple years), and knowledge transfer across multiple application/course contexts. This evergreen subject has seen significant changes recently: the CS enrollment explosion; on-line instruction; active learning; greater diversity in background, interests, and goals among students; and expanded use of lookup technology for student work. Additionally, mainstream software development now encompasses mathematical ideas such as functional programming; cryptography; statistical inference; and mathematical certification of software. Retention and transfer (and their relative, "mathematical maturity") can be supported by well-considered and well-timed instructional action, supplementing the student realizations that may happen naturally. Cultivating authentic student engagement can help seeing course activity as building mathematical understanding for career use rather than an ephemeral game played for points. BoF participants will collaboratively discuss observations, reactions, thorny situations, and suggested practices for knowledge retention and transfer, in order to establish understanding for future directions.
