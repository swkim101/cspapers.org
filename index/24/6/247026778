In this paper, we analyze 32,000 Java programming assessments submitted to the CodeRunner platform by introductory programming students. We identify common sequences of errors and link these patterns with observations of code that compiles but still contains logical errors. We establish reoccurring errors and common error pathways through a Markov chain analysis of attempts and use Association Rule Mining to link common error patterns with logical errors that occur later in the attempts. As a result, we provide a number of suggestions for instructors of introductory Java courses regarding how to potentially navigate these issues in their teaching practice and discuss possible pedagogical interventions on the basis of our observations.
