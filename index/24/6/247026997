Adaptive learning exercises intended for mastery learning are performed until the learner reaches the intended mastery level. But how to grade them if all passing students reach the same mastery at the end? Our goal was to calculate grades from the number of wrong steps and correct steps while solving the last questions in the exercise. This approach is implemented in an intelligent tutoring system and its behavior was observed during the system's evaluation. The faster the students learned, the higher were their grades. This technique can be used to grade students directly using the results of solving problems in the training system without separate summative tests. This lets students receive feedback on how well they are learning without performing more exercises.
