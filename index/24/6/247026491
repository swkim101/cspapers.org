Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms like Stack Overflow enable gamified and moderated community-driven knowledge creation. We report on our experiences of introducing Stack Overflow in our Computer Science BSc programme and explore whether these platforms can (1) reduce the workload of lecturers in answering questions in large-scale classrooms, and (2) create a community of learners in the large-scale setting of ~1600 students.
