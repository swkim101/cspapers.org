What additional supports do instructors in Computer Science programs need to effectively teach neurodiverse students? Many neurodiverse students (e.g., with ADHD, autism) are enrolled in CS programs, but few graduate. These students often struggle to communicate their needs to instructors, who themselves are often untrained to support neurodiverse students' needs. This can result in instructors unintentionally using practices that are detrimental to student success, lowering students' sense of belonging in CS. Likewise, this can make teaching frustrating for instructors who are unprepared for students' needs. This BoF will provide a platform for instructors and neurodiverse graduates from CS programs to discuss major topics relating to instructor and student needs, such as: experiences working with neurodiverse students, successful strategies, and instructors' professional development needs. Instructors attending will learn more about other instructors' experiences and teaching practices, as well as an NSF-funded participatory design study on training instructors to improve neurodiverse students' retention in undergraduate CS. Participants will be invited to stay up-to-date on the project's progress after the conference, with free access to tools and curriculum as they are developed. Notes and recordings from this discussion will be included as data in our study to support future instructors.
