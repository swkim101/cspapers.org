To accelerate the adoption of computational thinking (CT), we have developed TuneScope, an online platform for introducing novices to programming in the context of music. TuneScope combines a sound analysis & synthesis tool with Snap!, a computing language developed at the University of California, Berkeley. This demo explores CT concepts such as decomposition, patterns, abstraction, and algorithms in TuneScope while also exploring the creation of four cascading musical components from (1) sequences of notes, (2) musical chords, (3) sampled sounds, and (4) synthesized sounds. The challenge is to design activities that include authentic music learning as well as genuine computational thinking. In this demo, we show concepts around sequence (the order in which musical notes appear in time; and the order of statements in a computer program) and repetition (includes repeats as well as the structure of melodies; and computing loops and recursion). The instructional activities in this demo have been piloted three times in an associated course at the University of Virginia. Data collected from the course suggest a positive effect on both the understanding of CT concepts and the comprehension of music.
