Testing Tutor is a web-based platform that helps instructors support software testing pedagogy by automatically diagnosing the fundamental testing concepts (e.g., boundary value) not covered in students' test suite and subsequently helping students initiate their own learning process about those concepts and systematically improve their test suites. The platform's differentiating features include 1) customizable feedback engine which allows instructors to scaffold the level of feedback (varying from conceptual to detailed), 2) a built-in repository of problems instructors can use, 3) access to digital learning content and 4) modes (learning and development) so instructors can scaffold the level of problems. This demo provides a brief overview of the platform and a walkthrough of two example use cases that illustrate the power of Testing Tutor from the perspectives of an instructor and a student. The two use cases will (1) demonstrate using Testing Tutor at different course levels by walking through the steps for an instructor to configure an assignment and the feedback engine and (2) demonstrate the student's experience submitting an assignment and receiving feedback.
