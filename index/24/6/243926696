Maximizing profits while minimizing risk in a technologically advanced silicon industry has motivated the globalization of the fabrication process and electronic hardware supply chain. However, with the increasing magnitude of successful hardware attacks, the security of many hardware IPs has been compromised. Many existing security works have focused on resolving a single vulnerability while neglecting other threats. This motivated to propose a novel approach for securing hardware IPs during the fabrication process and supply chain via logic obfuscation by utilizing emerging spin-based devices. Our proposed dynamic obfuscation approach uses reconfigurable logic and interconnects blocks (RIL-Blocks), consisting of Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM)-based Look Up Tables and switch boxes flexibility and resiliency against state-of-the-art SAT-based attacks and power side-channel attacks while incurring a small overhead. The proposed Scan Enabled Obfuscation circuitry obfuscates the oracle circuitâ€™s responses and further fortifies the logic and routing obfuscation provided by the RIL-Blocks, resembling a defense-in-depth approach. The empirical evaluation of security provided by the proposed RIL-Blocks on the ISCAS benchmark and common evaluation platform (CEP) circuit shows that resiliency comes with reduced overhead while providing resiliency to various hardware security threats.
