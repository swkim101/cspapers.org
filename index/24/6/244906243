State-of-the-art object detection approaches typically rely on pre-trained classification models to achieve better performance and faster convergence. We hypothesize that classification pre-training strives to achieve translation invariance, and consequently ignores the localization aspect of the problem. We propose a new large-scale pre-training strategy for detection, where noisy class labels are available for all images, but not bounding-boxes. In this setting, we augment standard classification pre-training with a new detection-specific pretext task. Motivated by the noise-contrastive learning based self-supervised approaches, we design a task that forces bounding boxes with high-overlap to have similar representations in different views of an image, compared to non-overlapping boxes. We redesign Faster R-CNN modules to perform this task efficiently. Our experimental results show significant improvements over existing weakly-supervised and self-supervised pre-training approaches in both detection accuracy as well as fine-tuning speed.
