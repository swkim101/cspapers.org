The INSPIRE pilot project provides core evidence on key interventions and CPD needs to enable a 4IR (Fourth Industrial Revolution) curriculum within secondary education. Across the UK, there is currently no systematic pedagogical design or evaluation to support interdisciplinary teaching and learning to include 4IR skills and knowledge. There is also no clear national strategy for schools and FE colleges to follow in how to embed 4IR, including Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Internet of Things tools, skills and understanding into their teaching. Such a lack of an evidence-based research study impacts our young students in particular and education system in general, and further discriminates against disadvantaged and digitally excluded groups. We applied a design-based research methodology framework and worked with two London based schools to co-design and deliver a series of workshops to 13-14-year-old students introducing them to 4IR skills through engaging practical activities. Within the pilot study we engaged with both co-designers and students to capture opinion, understanding, learning and enjoyment before, during and after the workshops. The significance of this paper is twofold; to identify lessons learnt in developing 4IR skills and knowledge within the curriculum and to share the insights of the adults and young learners throughout the project.
