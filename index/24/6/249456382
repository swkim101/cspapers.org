There has been considerable discussion and controversy over the meaning and value of the concept “microprogramming”.
 We believe that courses in Computer Science should emphasize the implementation of purposeful, efficient and economical systems through the intelligent use of whatever technology is employed. As considered above, microprogramming becomes merely one of a number of systematic techniques to be used in implementing systems.
 Central to this approach is the understanding that a successfully implemented system neither requires, encourages, nor, in some cases, even allows its users to know that it is constructed of an array of modules; some hardware, some software and some microcode.
