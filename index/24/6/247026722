Changing the language used to teach the AP Computer Science A course is an expensive, time-consuming, and ultimately controversial endeavor. However, it is worth raising the question from time to time to determine if such a change may now be appropriate. This panel offers a set of speakers specifically chosen to provide a diverse set of viewpoints and experiences (high school teacher, curriculum developer, exam reader, exam development committee member, university credit-granting administrator) on the question of whether the language in the AP CS A exam should be switched to Python in the near future.
