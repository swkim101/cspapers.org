We introduce LilNetX, an end-to-end trainable technique for neural networks that enables learning models with specified accuracy-rate-computation trade-off. Prior works approach these problems one at a time and often require post-processing or multistage training which become less practical and do not scale very well for large datasets or architectures. Our method constructs a joint training objective that penalizes the self-information of network parameters in a reparameterized latent space to encourage small model size while also introducing priors to increase structured sparsity in the parameter space to reduce computation. We achieve up to 50% smaller model size and 98% model sparsity on ResNet-20 while retaining the same accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset as well as 35% smaller model size and 42% structured sparsity on ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet, when compared to existing state-of-the-art model compression methods.
