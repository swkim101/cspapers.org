Data representation is an important topic in the Computer Science curriculum. This paper introduces a set of tutorial tools for students to practice binary basics, two's complement representation and arithmetic, and IEEE 754 floating-point representation. These tools are created for student self-paced practice outside of the classroom and follow the same design scheme to generate problems randomly and provide instant feedback. The goals are to support students who need help on math-related concepts and to mitigate some common mistakes students make. Student usage data and feedback on the effectiveness of the tools are presented and discussed.
