We introduce XDesign, a web-based interactive platform that guides learners through a multi-stage design process for creating user-centered explanations of AI models. Results from a course deployment show that students were able to identify concrete user needs in interacting with explanations, highlight user tasks to support the needs, and design a user interface that aids the tasks.
