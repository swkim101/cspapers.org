The term "double-edged sword" refers to something that may have both favorable and unfavorable consequences. We posit that allowing students to post anonymously in a CS course forum may fit this metaphor with regard to gender and belongingness. In this work, we test a theory that patterns of anonymous posting in a course forum for a CS1 class may reinforce gender stereotypes even as the underlying patterns of interaction debunk those stereotypes. We examine forum interactions from a CS1 class with an even gender split and find that women engage in anonymous posting more often than men; thus, a student's view of the class's gender distribution is different from the actual distribution. We hypothesize this is a missed opportunity to combat stereotypes of gender in computer science. Possible solutions and further work are discussed.
