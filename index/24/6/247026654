CS2013, the latest version of the ACM/IEEE Computer Society curricula is approaching its 10th anniversary. The CS202x Task Force, whose charge is to update this important document, began its work in Spring 2021. The aim of this BoF session is to seek feedback from the SIGCSE community on a draft recommendation from the Data Management knowledge area (CS2013 terminology) subcommittee. The area of Data Management has not remained static this past decade as new topics have emerged and previously minor topics have grown in popularity. These include distributed and replicated databases, the expanding role of non-relational databases, the now ubiquitous association between "back-end development" and data management services, and the elephant in any investigation of data management; Big Data. In this light, we seek to gather as many diverse views and voices as possible to help shape the curricular recommendations from the Data Management subcommittee. Additionally, we hope to enlist participants to remain engaged in this process as a guiding community to the Data Management subcommittee.
