The Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) Professional Development (PD) committee is responsible for curating a list of PD opportunities for dissemination to CS teachers. The committee developed and revised a research-based rubric and has used it to accredit PD programs that meet a baseline of quality. This paper reports on the process of accreditation and trends in CS teacher PD, as well as recommendations to PD providers based on trends in the data collected by the committee. This paper is a story of the evolution of the accreditation process and the tool used to measure quality PD. PD providers are encouraged to adopt best practices in supporting teacher growth.
