This work presents the rationale behind tools and a guideline for the Universal Design of Jupyter notebooks containing programs, explanations, graphics, algorithms, and proofs, all of which may have mathematical symbols. The tools qualitatively improve accessibility and ease the authoring of such notebooks at the same time. The tools and guidelines are currently being used for a course on concurrent system design and a course on formal languages and compiler construction at McMaster University.
