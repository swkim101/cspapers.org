In this Birds of a Feather (BoF) session, we aim to create and foster a safe and open environment that allows participants to get feedback on research-in-progress and share experiences and issues with being a graduate student in CSEd research. We invite genuine and honest conversations about the challenges facing rising academics and professionals in this area. We have three goals: (1) to foster a community of support among CSEd grad students from around the world, (2) to connect students with new opportunities and ways of thinking about CSEd, and (3) to cultivate mentorship among participants to send them off with potential collaborators, supporters and advocates.
