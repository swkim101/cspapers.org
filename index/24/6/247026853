Teaming is increasingly a core aspect of professional software engineering and most undergraduate computer science curricula. At NC State University, we teach communication and project-management skills explicitly through a junior-level software engineering course. However, some students may have a dysfunctional team experience that imperils their ability to learn these skills. Identifying these teams during a team project is important so the teaching staff can intervene early and hopefully alleviate the issues. We propose a weekly reflection survey to help the course teaching staff proactively identify teams that may not be on track to learn the course outcomes. The questions on the survey focus on team communication and collaboration over the previous week. We evaluate our survey on two semesters of the undergraduate software engineering course by comparing teams with poor end-of-project grades or peer evaluations against teams flagged on a weekly basis through the surveys. We find that the survey can identify most teams that later struggled on the project, typically by the half-way mark of the project, and thus may provide instructors with an actionable early-warning about struggling teams. Furthermore, a majority of students (64.4%) found the survey to be a helpful tool for keeping their team on track. Finally, we discuss future work for improving the survey and engaging with student teams.
