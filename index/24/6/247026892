RoboScape Online is a robotics simulation platform designed to reduce the barriers to entry for teachers to use robots as an educational tool in their classrooms. With simulated robots in a shared virtual 3D environment, students can be provided with "hardware" at no cost, no maintenance required, and free for them to "take home" while simultaneously collaborating with peers anywhere in the world. The environment supports remote, hybrid and in- person learning equally well. Programming support is provided through NetsBlox, a block-based programming environment, creating a novice-friendly experience while providing strong distributed computing and collaboration tools. Existing curricula focused on computational thinking and cybersecurity in NetsBlox have been used with physical robots for several years. These activities have been recreated with virtual robots, and the exact same code works in the simulated environment as well. However, virtual robots and their environments aren't limited to only the same experiences as before. New robots can be designed equipped with sensors and actuators previously infeasible for classroom use, giving students more interesting "missions" to work on solutions to. The software is open source, with free servers available, and tools are also provided to create new scenarios and environments. Handouts explaining the basics of the RoboScape environment will be provided. A computer with a web browser is required to use the software.
