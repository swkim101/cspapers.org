Computer scientists should be aware that their work may have an impact on society. In an effort to integrate ethics and justice with technical content in CS education, we designed a novel CS1 activity. Our goals were: to leave typical CS1 learning goals unchanged, to include open-ended questions while meeting the constraints of a large CS1 course, and to pose challenging questions that students perceive as relevant to their computing practice and personal life. In this poster, we discuss the details of the activity we designed, which includes a coding portion where students write code to plot admissions data and a discussion portion centered around the story behind the data and its limits.
