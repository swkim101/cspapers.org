Pandemic afforded many CS faculty to record instructional videos to be used in remote settings. Now there is an opportunity to use pre-recorded videos in in-person and/or remote classes. In a study conducted at Rutgers University, over 73% of the students preferred an instructor curated video collection to aid their learning. Curation of a video collection involves adding searchability, self-assessment quizzes, engagement prompts, and Q&A to actively engage students as they watch videos. The increased video engagement produces large amounts of video interaction data that can be used to understand student engagement and comprehension. More importantly, instructors can use real-time data to adjust instructions, identify struggling students, and help increase student outcomes. In this workshop, we will demonstrate how quickly, efficiently, and effectively one can curate existing videos using free CUbits platform (https://www.cubits.ai), integrate with existing infrastructure (Canvas/CAS), deploy and measure student engagement. Using real-time dashboards, clever scheduled access techniques, embedded questions, active Q&A, we will show how to increase student engagement with curated videos. We will share data from courses at Rutgers and Princeton to demonstrate how curated videos helped create active learning environments and scale learning in large CS courses. The student engagement methods and real-time data visualization techniques learned in this workshop may also be applicable to participants preferred video delivery platform or environment.
