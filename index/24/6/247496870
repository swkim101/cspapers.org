In recent years, oblivious pseudorandom functions (OPRFs) have become a ubiquitous primitive used in cryptographic protocols and privacy-preserving technologies. The growing interest in OPRFs, both theoretical and applied, has produced a vast number of different constructions and functionality variations. In this paper, we provide a systematic overview of how to build and use OPRFs. We first categorize existing OPRFs into essentially four families based on their underlying PRF (Naor-Reingold, Dodis-Yampolskiy, Hashed Diffie-Hellman, and generic constructions). This categorization allows us to give a unified presentation of all oblivious evaluation methods in the literature, and to understand which properties OPRFs can (or cannot) have. We further demonstrate the theoretical and practical power of OPRFs by visualizing them in the landscape of cryptographic primitives, and by providing a comprehensive overview of how OPRFs are leveraged for improving the privacy of internet users. Our work systematizes 15 years of research on OPRFs and provides inspiration for new OPRF constructions and applications thereof.
