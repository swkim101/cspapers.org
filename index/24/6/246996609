Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) meth-ods face a curse of dimensionality in the policy and value function representations as the number of agents increases. The development of distributed or parallel training techniques is also hindered by the global coupling among the agent dynamics, requiring simultaneous state transitions. This paper introduces Distributed multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with One-hop Neighbors (DARLIN). DARLIN is an off-policy actor-critic MARL method that breaks the curse of dimensionality and achieves distributed training by restricting the agent interactions to one-hop neighborhoods. Each agent optimizes its value and policy functions over a one-hop neighborhood, reducing the representation complexity, yet maintaining expressiveness by training with varying numbers and states of neighbors. This structure enables the key contribution of DARLIN: a distributed training procedure in which each compute node simulates the state transitions of only a small subset of the agents, greatly accelerating the training of large-scale MARL policies. Comparisons with state-of-the-art MARL methods show that DARLIN significantly reduces training time without sacrificing policy quality as the number of agents increases.
