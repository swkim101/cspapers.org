By almost any measure, mobile apps are growing part of the modern computing infrastructure. This workshop is designed to help CS educators integrate mobile apps into their classrooms by by sharing lessons learned from five years of teaching mobile application development as well as hands-on instruction to build two mobile apps - a basic stopwatch and a to-do task manager. We will also provide participants with several other assignments that can used in the classroom. We will build these apps using Google's Flutter framework so these apps can be deployed on both iOS and Android devices. We will walk through the structure of the Flutter framework and its key components, as well as provide an overview of the Dart programming language that Flutter is built upon. This workshop requires a laptop running the current version of Visual Studio Code. To save app data, we will use Google's Firebase, a cloud-based solution popular in mobile app development. To run apps in an iOS environment, the most recent version of Xcode is required; for Android
