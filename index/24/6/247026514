The television anthology series Black Mirror uses speculative fiction about technology to comment on contemporary social issues, often exploring the ethics of current technologies. Based on the structure of that show, the "Black Mirror Writers Room" is a teaching exercise designed to help students creatively speculate about future harms and consequences of current technologies, and has been used by dozens of instructors in classes related to computing ethics and society, as well as technical computing classes. We interviewed 12 instructors in the university setting who have used this or similar exercises in their classrooms about their experiences and student reactions. We describe benefits and challenges of using creative speculation in the classroom (and beyond) for exploring ethics, justice, and related issues in computing.
