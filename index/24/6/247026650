To promote inclusion of students with marginalized identities, districts need to develop comprehensive inclusive computing pathways across grade levels. Working in a Research Practice Partnership (RPP), we have co-designed a district-facing toolkit to support the creation of these pathways. In this poster, we present both the CT Pathways Toolkit and results from four districts piloting it. We examine the experiences of the pilot districts and analyze trends in the toolkit's use. This work expands knowledge about building inclusive computing pathways and computational thinking (CT) integration within K-12 schools.
