In this poster, we describe our experience with the adoption of Open Educational Resources (OER) in a C Programming course. Our motivation was to promote diversity, equity and inclusion by addressing the high cost of textbooks, particularly its detrimental effect on students from underrepresented groups or disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Although adopting OER required significant effort, our preliminary results indicate that these were adequate for students to complete their coursework. Furthermore, student achievement was comparable to previous offerings of the course that used traditional textbooks.
