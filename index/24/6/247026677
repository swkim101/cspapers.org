Randomly assigning seating is an effective way to prevent exam cheating. Our software tool, LupSeat, is a seating chart generator which is packed with features and can handle large classrooms. Based on a simple, textual representation of the classroom and a CSV-formatted student roster, the tool algorithmically ensures that students are assigned to random seats and get evenly spaced out. It can also account for other factors in the seating assignment, such as accommodating accessible seating needs or hand dominance, and it offers highly customizable, graphical output charts. LupSeat provides both command line and graphical user interfaces for all major platforms and is available at https://gitlab.com/luplab/lupseat.
