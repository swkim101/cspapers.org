A significant part of the recently published ACM and IEEE-CS report "Computing Curricula 2020: Paradigms for Global Computing Education" [1] was the development of visualizations of any computing degree and the comparison with the ACM and IEEE-CS approved curricula. This visualization covers discipline areas that have approved curricula: Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Systems, Information Technology and Cyber Security. The CC2020 report developed a "Landscape of Computing Knowledge" table (see table 1) aggregating all the topic areas of all six approved curricula into 34 topic areas and then assigned a minimum and maximum value for each of topic areas. As part of the visualizations project an online application has been developed (see Figure 1) where stakeholders can assign a minimum and maximum value to each of the topic areas that are required in their degree program and then that program can be matched against the current ACM/IEEE-CS approved curricula and other degree programs globally. This will have significant importance for educators and other stakeholders of computing degree programs.
