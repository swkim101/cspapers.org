Is quantitative data collected by CS education researchers objective? If we combine data from a set of studies that measure the same type of intervention, will that really show us the strength of that intervention? Are qualitative studies really less rigorous than quantitative because the number of participants may be as low as one? In this panel, we will first present the different types of studies that are most common in CS education research and provide a working definition for what we mean by various types of research methodologies (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods). Drawing upon our experiences in the field of studying computing education, we will then explore some of the myths surrounding data, highlighting where evidence presented through research data is rigorous and, when not, how we (as researchers) can mitigate the risks of collecting and sharing data that is unsound in publications. We encourage you to attend. After all, this panel has been recommended by four out of five computer science education researchers.
