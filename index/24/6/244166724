In-band full-duplex (FD) operation mode represents a key solution in achieving the performance required by the next-generation communications system, especially in terms of spectral efficiency. Therefore, the research interest in the development of enhanced self-interference cancellation (SIC) techniques has grown exponentially. In this paper, we propose an experimental approach relying on software-defined radio (SDR) technology and GNU Radio, which aims at evaluating the performance of the newly proposed SIC solutions under realistic conditions. Additionally, the interference cancellation capacity of a digital SIC method based on recursive adaptive filtering is tested in a point-to-point configuration.
