We have found that giving top-performing students in CS1 courses personalized feedback increases their intentions to persist in computing, especially among students who are women. This personalized feedback also appears to improve students' course experience and increases the likelihood that women apply to be CS1 TAs. Yet despite these benefits, giving personalized feedback may seem too impractical and time-intensive for faculty members to adopt in their own classrooms. In this workshop, we will reduce the burden of giving students personalized feedback by: 1) giving instructors empirically validated email templates to use in their own courses, and 2) guiding faculty how to send emails at-scale. We will also discuss how self-assessments influence students' career choices, how gender stereotypes bias self-assessments, and what faculty can do to counteract biased self-assessments of computing ability.
