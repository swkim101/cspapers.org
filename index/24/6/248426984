Spiking neural network (SNN), as a brain-inspired energy-efficient neural network, has attracted the interest of researchers. While the training of spiking neural networks is still an open problem. One effective way is to map the weight of trained ANN to SNN to achieve high reasoning ability. However, the converted spiking neural network often suffers from performance degradation and a considerable time delay. To speed up the inference process and obtain higher accuracy, we theoretically analyze the errors in the conversion process from three perspectives: the differences between IF and ReLU, time dimension, and pooling operation. We propose a neuron model for releasing burst spikes, a cheap but highly efficient method to solve residual information. In addition, Lateral Inhibition Pooling (LIPooling) is proposed to solve the inaccuracy problem caused by MaxPooling in the conversion process. Experimental results on CIFAR and ImageNet demonstrate that our algorithm is efficient and accurate. For example, our method can ensure nearly lossless conversion of SNN and only use about 1/10 (less than 100) simulation time under 0.693x energy consumption of the typical method.
