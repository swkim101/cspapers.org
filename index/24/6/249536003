This paper studies the fundamental task of establishing routing paths in distributed networks. We prove the existence of compact routing tables that store in each network-node few simple forwarding rules tracing out hop-constrained and oblivious routing paths for any pair of nodes. For any collection of pairs the congestion of these paths is almost-optimal, i.e., competitive with the globally optimal solution up to a sub-polynomial factor. The key to this result is the algorithmic theory of hop-constrained expanders and expander decompositions developed in this paper. Informally, we say a graph is an h-hop φ-expanders iff for any set of node-pairs, in which each node is paired to O(deg(v)) nodes at hop-distance O(h), there exists an (h)-hop path between each pair such that any edge is used at most (1/φ) often. An h-hop φ-expander is basically a regular (φ)-expander when h = Ω(logn/φ). For shorter path lengths h ≪ 1/φ, however, h-hop expanders become interesting, powerful, and fundamentally different. We prove that every graph can be decomposed into h-hop (boundary-linked) φ-expanders by cutting at most an O(φ logn)-fraction of its edges. We also provide efficient constructions for almost-optimal h-hop expander decompositions and our compact routing tables. These are parallel algorithms with almost-linear work and sub-polynomial depth that also have highly-efficient implementations in CONGEST, the standard model for distributed message-passing algorithms. As major implication this gives novel CONGEST algorithms for a large class of important optimization problems, including minimum-spanning tree, (1+є)-min-cut, (1+)-shortest paths. Our algorithms solve these problems in sub-polynomial rounds on any network, as long as a sub-polynomial-round distributed algorithm exists for this network. This strong optimality guarantee is closely related to the notion of universal optimality.
