We derive computed tomography (CT) of a time-varying volumetric scattering object, using a small number of moving cameras. We focus on passive tomography of dynamic clouds, as clouds have a major effect on the Earthâ€™s climate. State of the art scattering CT assumes a static object. Existing 4D CT methods rely on a linear image formation model and often on significant priors. In this paper, the angular and temporal sampling rates needed for a proper recovery are discussed. Spatiotemporal CT is achieved using gradient-based optimization, which accounts for the correlation time of the dynamic object content. We demonstrate this in physics-based simulations and on experimental real-world data.
