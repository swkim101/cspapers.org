With the shift to online delivery, instructors looked to provide comparable help supports for students, especially for first-year learners who need timely assistance the most. Our work aims to understand student help seeking behavior and perception of getting help in an online CS2 course. First, we analyze how much students ask for help and perceive to get help in several help support components: lectures, labs, instructor office hours, and on the discussion board. We find that while students take advantage of all help resources, the discussion board is predominantly the main source of help, while instructor office hours run into scalability problems. Secondly, we explore whether asking for and getting help are correlated with grades and find an inverted-U quadratic relationship in both cases. This indicates that low-performing and high-performing students ask for the least help and perceive to get the least help in each of the help support components. Finally, in each help context, we investigate which categories of questions students seek help the most with, and who students rely on most for help. Our analysis is intended to help educators better understand how to support first-year students in an online course and we hope that our findings are also useful for help support planning once in-person learning resumes.
