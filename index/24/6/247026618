In this paper, we present our experience with the use of breakout rooms in a second year undergraduate Software Design course at a large North American institution. Following the switch to remote instruction during the coronavirus pandemic, we revamped our in-person Software Design course to be delivered as a flipped online course, making extensive use of in-lecture exercises completed during breakout rooms. We report on the structure and logistics of this lecture design (for a large class of 300+ students). To gain insights into the impact of the use of breakout rooms on student experience, we conducted weekly student surveys asking for feedback on the lectures and specifically on the use of breakout rooms. Although many students had positive feelings regarding the use of breakout rooms, a significant percentage of students (an average of 47% of the survey responses each week) expressed negative feelings toward them. In an end-of-term survey, we specifically asked students about what they felt worked best for breakout rooms in terms of group size and pre-assigned versus randomized groups, and if there were any other areas that they felt needed improvement. Some of the patterns we observed were that most students liked smaller groups (2-5 people), preferred staying in the same group throughout the semester, and enjoyed the use of breakout rooms as long as others in their room were active participants. We share the details of these survey results as well as the tips and lessons that we learned through this experience.
