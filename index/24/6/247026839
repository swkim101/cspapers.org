Have you ever frozen-not knowing what to say-when you heard a biased comment from a student or colleague? It is challenging to interrupt microaggressions and respond to biased beliefs in the moment, but practice helps people become more comfortable and confident. In this special session, teams from the CSTA Equity Fellowship and CSTeachingTips.org will demonstrate an activity that invites participants to discuss how they would respond to different tricky situations related to bias. Participants will directly engage in the activity and learn how they can use it in ongoing professional development for K-12 computer science teachers.
