Autograders have become an invaluable tool for instructors of computer programming courses. They not only ease the burden of manually grading many assignments, but more importantly provide students with a way to receive immediate feedback about their work giving them opportunities to revise and resubmit. However, autograder messages suffer from the same problem as compiler messages; they are often confusing and unhelpful to the students they are trying to help. This is particularly true for novice programmers. By anticipating the mistakes that novice programmers often make, we can develop test suites that when run within an autograder will provide failure messages that are understandable even to novice programmers. This workshop demonstrates the strategies that we use in our courses taught in both Python and Java. Attendees should bring a computing device and be prepared to work on writing tests.
