Code plagiarism is an unfortunate problem which often plagues introductory level programming courses. In this poster, we study the relationship between plagiarism and student engagement using Submitty, our open-source course management, homework submission, and autograding system. We measure student participation through responses to live-lecture polls, posts in the course discussion forum, and daily and weekly office hours attendance patterns. While our assignments have strict deadlines, students are empowered to adapt deadlines by using penalty-free "late day" deadline extensions. Students who regularly participate in lecture polls are rewarded with additional late days. Submitty includes an open-source plagiarism detection module, Lichen, that detects software similarity that suggests academic dishonesty. Our implementation can be configured to examine every version of the assignment submitted by students and search for similarities between any version for any other student. We leverage the advantages of having a single, unified platform that combines submission timestamp data, course participation metrics, and code similarity data. Having many types of data stored in the same place allows us to effectively identify at-risk students earlier. We will present an exploration and analysis of data from an introductory level computer science course.
