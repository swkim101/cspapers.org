University curricula have the foundation subjects at the basic undergraduate students and the application subjects at the advanced undergraduate students. The basic undergraduate students are difficult to keep the motivation and imagine the connection with the applications in the real world because almost all CS course curricula cover them in the application subjects. Although syllabi and curriculum maps are a common approach for finding relevant subjects, the materials used in the lecture are suitable for the student to refer to the relevant and concrete subjects. Providing the relevant pages based on the page of the learning material, on which a student just focuses, helps the one in the basic undergraduate to enhance the one's motivation and the one in the advanced undergraduate to deepen the one's understandings. In addition, professors who improve the curriculum could leverage the relationships between all the subjects. In this study, I use TF-IDF to discover the relevant pages and apply the following to them: introduction of the chronological order, normalization of the TF-IDF score, removal of the title-only pages, and the term weighting method. TF-IDF can discover the characteristic terms on a page and mingle them into other natural language processing methods. This paper conducts an experiment using the materials available at Stanford University CS courses' website and shows the characteristic results and the feasibility of my proposal.
