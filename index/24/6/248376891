Semantic-descriptor-based Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) poses challenges in recognizing novel classes in the test phase. The development of generative models enables current GZSL techniques to probe further into the semantic-visual link, culminating in a two-stage form that includes a generator and a classifier. However, existing generation-based methods focus on enhancing the generator's effect while neglecting the improvement of the classifier. In this paper, we first analyze of two properties of the generated pseudo unseen samples: bias and homogeneity. Then, we perform variational Bayesian inference to back-derive the evaluation metrics, which reflects the balance of the seen and unseen classes. As a consequence of our derivation, the aforementioned two properties are incorporated into the classifier training as seen-unseen priors via logit adjustment. The Zero-Shot Logit Adjustment further puts semantic-based classifiers into effect in generation-based GZSL. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves state-of-the-art when combined with the basic generator, and it can improve various generative Zero-Shot Learning frameworks.
