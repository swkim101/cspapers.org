This poster reports on a workshop to help elementary school teachers integrate culturally relevant computer science (CS) learning opportunities into their classrooms. Findings highlight the importance of facilitators to help teachers discuss cultural competence and the value of co-developed rubrics to evaluate lessons. The presentation will discuss results and share artifacts from the workshop.
