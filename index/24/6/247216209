An implementation ﬂaw in LTE control plane protocols at end-user devices directly leads to severe security threats. In order to uncover these ﬂaws, conducting negative testing is a promising approach, whose test case only contains invalid or prohibited messages. Despite its importance, the cellular standard mostly focuses on positive test cases, producing many implementation vulnerabilities unchecked, as evidenced by many existing vulnerabilities. To ﬁll this gap, we present D O LTE ST , a negative testing framework, which can comprehensively test an end-user device. Enumerable test cases with a deterministic oracle produced from detailed speciﬁcation analysis make it suitable to be used as a standard to ﬁnd implementation vulnerabilities. We uncovered 26 implementation ﬂaws from 43 devices from 5 different baseband manufacturers by using D O LTE ST , demonstrating its effectiveness.
