In this poster we present ITT, and Interactive Tutoring Tool that allows teachers of a Compiler Design course to interactively guide the learning from the implementation of the main theoretical concepts on lexical, syntactic analysis, and syntax-directed translation. With the help of ITT, our students interact with the visualization of the automata underlying the implementation obtained by the compiler-writing tools. Preliminary results show the benefits of using ITT to improve their understanding of theoretical concepts from the interactive execution of the implementation, deepening and reinforcing the understanding of theory in relation to the code.
