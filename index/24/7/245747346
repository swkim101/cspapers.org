 This paper discusses the design of axisymmetric structures with self-supporting features that can be additively manufactured without requiring internal support structures. This is motivated by wire-fed additive manufacturing processes, many of which can fabricate designs with enclosed pores that inherently exist in many axisymmetric structures, such as double walled pressure vessels. Although enclosed pores are possible, features that rise at shallow angles from the build plate typically cannot be fabricated without the use of support structures, which require removal and thus are unfavorable in such applications. In this paper, an overhang constraint is applied to ensure that all designed features rise at a designer-prescribed self-supporting angle to eliminate the need for such support structures. This is achieved by coupling the projection-based overhang constraint approach with topology optimization and axisymmetric finite elements whose stiffness is interpolated using Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP). Gradients are computed with the adjoint method and the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) is employed as the gradient-based optimizer. Two numerical examples related to a canonical pressure vessel and an optical mirror support structure are used to demonstrate the approach. Solutions are shown to satisfy minimum feature size requirements and designer-prescribed (process dependent) overhang constraint angles, while providing clear and crisp representations of topology. As observed in past works on overhang constraints, a clear trade-off is illustrated between the magnitude of the overhang constraint angle and the structural performance (mass or stiffness), with more strict requirements producing designs with lower performance.
