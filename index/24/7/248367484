The prevalence of graph structures attracts a surge of investigation on graph data, enabling several downstream tasks such as multi-graph classification. However, in the multi-graph setting, graphs usually follow a long-tailed distribution in terms of their sizes, i.e., the number of nodes. In particular, a large fraction of tail graphs usually have small sizes. Though recent graph neural networks (GNNs) can learn powerful graph-level representations, they treat the graphs uniformly and marginalize the tail graphs which suffer from the lack of distinguishable structures, resulting in inferior performance on tail graphs. To alleviate this concern, in this paper we propose a novel graph neural network named SOLT-GNN, to close the representational gap between the head and tail graphs from the perspective of knowledge transfer. In particular, SOLT-GNN capitalizes on the co-occurrence substructures exploitation to extract the transferable patterns from head graphs. Furthermore, a novel relevance prediction function is proposed to memorize the pattern relevance derived from head graphs, in order to predict the complements for tail graphs to attain more comprehensive structures for enrichment. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.
