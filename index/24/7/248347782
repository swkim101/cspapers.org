The Instacart KG is a central data store which contains facts regarding grocery products, ranging from taxonomic classifications to product nutritional information. With a view towards providing reliable and complete information for downstream applications, we propose an automated system for providing these facts with a score based on their reliability. This system passes data through a series of contextualized unit tests; the outcome of these tests are aggregated in order to provide a fact with a discrete score: reliable, questionable, or unreliable. These unit tests are written with explainability, scalability, and correctability in mind.
