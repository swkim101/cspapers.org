Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has attracted a surge of attention due to its superior performance for learning node/graph representations without labels. However, in practice, the underlying class distribution of unlabeled nodes for the given graph is usually imbalanced. This highly imbalanced class distribution inevitably deteriorates the quality of learned node representations in GCL. Indeed, we empirically find that most state-of-the-art GCL methods cannot obtain discriminative representations and exhibit poor performance on imbalanced node classification. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled GCL framework on Imbalanced node classification (ImGCL), which automatically and adaptively balances the representations learned from GCL without labels. Specifically, we first introduce the online clustering based progressively balanced sampling (PBS) method with theoretical rationale, which balances the training sets based on pseudo-labels obtained from learned representations in GCL. We then develop the node centrality based PBS method to better preserve the intrinsic structure of graphs, by upweighting the important nodes of the given graph. Extensive experiments on multiple imbalanced graph datasets and imbalanced settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which significantly improves the performance of the recent state-of-the-art GCL methods. Further experimental ablations and analyses show that the ImGCL framework consistently improves the representation quality of nodes in under-represented (tail) classes.
