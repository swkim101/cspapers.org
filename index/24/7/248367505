Click models are widely used for user simulation, relevance inference, and evaluation in Web search. Most existing click models implicitly assume that users’ relevance judgment and behavior patterns are homogeneous. However, previous studies have shown that different users interact with search engines in rather different ways. Therefore, a unified click model can hardly capture the heterogeneity in users’ click behavior. To shed light on this research question, we propose a Click Model Personalization framework (CMP) that adaptively selects from global and local models for individual users. Different adaptive strategies are designed to personalize click behavior modeling only for specific users and queries. We also reveal that capturing personalized behavior patterns is more important than modeling personalized relevance assessments in constructing personalized click models. To evaluate the performance of the proposed CMP framework, we build a large-scale practical Personalized Web Search (PWS) dataset, which consists of the search logs of 1,249 users from a commercial search engine over six months. Experimental results show that the proposed CMP framework achieves significant performance improvements than the non-personalized click models in click prediction.
