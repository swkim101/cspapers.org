Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems have been extensively developed and widely deployed in various social websites, promoting products or services to the users of interest. Meanwhile, work has been attempted at poisoning attacks to CF recommender systems for distorting the recommend results to reap commercial or personal gains stealthily. While existing poisoning attacks have demonstrated their effectiveness with the offline social datasets, they are impractical when applied to the real setting on online social websites. This paper develops a novel and practical poisoning attack solution toward the CF recommender systems without knowing involved specific algorithms nor historical social data information a priori. Instead of directly attacking the unknown recommender systems, our solution performs certain operations on the social websites to collect a set of sampling data for use in constructing a surrogate model for deeply learning the inherent recommendation patterns. This surrogate model can estimate the item proximities, learned by the recommender systems. By attacking the surrogate model, the corresponding solutions (for availability and target attacks) can be directly migrated to attack the original recommender systems. Extensive experiments validate the generated surrogate model's reproductive capability and demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack upon various CF recommender algorithms.
