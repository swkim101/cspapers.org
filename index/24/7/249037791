Despite the widespread adoption of encrypted communication for mobile apps, adversaries can still identify apps or infer selected user activities of interest from encrypted mobile trafﬁc via app ﬁngerprinting (AF) attacks. However, most existing AF techniques only work under the closed-world as-sumption, thereby suffering potential precision decline when faced with apps unseen during model training. Moreover, serious privacy leakage often occurs when users conduct some sensitive operations, which are closely associated with speciﬁc UI components. Unfortunately, existing AF techniques are too coarse-grained to acquire such ﬁne-grained sensitive information. In this paper, we take the ﬁrst step to identify method-level ﬁne-grained user action of Android apps in the open-world setting and present a systematic solution, dubbed FOAP, to address the above limitations. First, to effectively reduce false positive risks in the open-world setting, we propose a novel metric, named structural similarity, to adaptively ﬁlter out trafﬁc segments irrelevant to the app of interest. Second, FOAP achieves ﬁne-grained user action identiﬁcation via synthesizing trafﬁc and binary analysis. Speciﬁcally, FOAP identiﬁes user actions on speciﬁc UI components through inferring entry point methods correlated with them. Extensive evaluations and case studies demonstrate that FOAP is not only reasonably accurate but also practical in ﬁne-grained user activity inference and user privacy analysis.
