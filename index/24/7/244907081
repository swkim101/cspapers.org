We propose a novel loss weighting algorithm, called loss scale balancing (LSB), for multi-task learning (MTL) of pixelwise vision tasks. An MTL model is trained to estimate multiple pixelwise predictions using an overall loss, which is a linear combination of individual task losses. The proposed algorithm dynamically adjusts the linear weights to learn all tasks effectively. Instead of controlling the trend of each loss value directly, we balance the loss scale — the product of the loss value and its weight — periodically. In addition, by evaluating the difficulty of each task based on the previous loss record, the proposed algorithm focuses more on difficult tasks during training. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional weighting algorithms for MTL of various pixelwise tasks. Codes are available at https://github.com/jaehanlee-mcl/LSB-MTL.
