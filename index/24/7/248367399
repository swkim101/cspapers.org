During the last three decades, the Web has been growing considerably in terms of number of available resources, traffic, types of media, usages, etc. In parallel, with 30+ editions, the WebConf series (ex. WWW, soon-to-be ACM WebConf) has witnessed how academia has been dealing with the Web as an object of research. In this study, we focus on the small story within the great one of the Web. In particular, by analysing the WebConf’s accepted papers and yearly events, we review how the conference has evolved across these decades and “driven” the evolution of the Web.
