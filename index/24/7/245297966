This paper deals with modeling of position servo actuators built around Permanent Magnet Direct Current (PMDC) motors which are utilized in low cost robotics and mechanisms.More specifically, two simplified models are proposed: first a static ideal model and then a dynamic realistic one.Through the proposed dynamic model, this paper attempts to capture the observed behavior of some position servoes in real life practice. In a first time it is shown that Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control and Proportional (P) one are able to global regulate shaft positioning of PMDC motors under disturbances free situations. This is the main argument to justify the P dominant feedback control approach at the core of most position servo actuators.
