While Autonomous Systems (ASes) are crucial for routing Internet traffic, organizations that own them are little understood. Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) inconsistently collect, release, and update basic AS organization information (e.g., website), and prior work provides only coarse-grained classification. Bootstrapping from RIR WHOIS data, we build ASdb, a system that uses data from established business intelligence databases and machine learning to accurately categorize ASes at scale. ASdb achieves 96% coverage of ASes, and 93% and 75% accuracy on 17 industry categories and 95 sub-categories, respectively. ASdb creates a more rich, accurate, comprehensive, and maintainable dataset cataloging AS-owning organizations. This system, and resulting dataset, will allow researchers to better understand who owns the Internet, and perform new forms of meaningful analysis and interpretation at scale.
