Internet video providers rely on alerting workflows to identify and remedy incidents that can impact users (e.g., outages or buggy players). There is growing evidence for the need for viewership-based analytics---detecting and diagnosing incidents that manifest through changes in viewership patterns but not in other (e.g., QoE) metrics. However, both detection and diagnosis of viewership anomalies is challenging due to the contextual nature of anomalies, non-stationarity of viewership, and complex dependencies between the structure of events and how they impact different subpopulations of viewers. We present Proteas, an alerting framework for video viewership anomalies that tackles these challenges. Proteas builds on key spatiotemporal structural insights. First, across different sub-populations of viewers and days of the week, we find that the shape of the viewership curve remains invariant over multiple weeks, thus enabling anomaly detection. Second, we use the hierarchy of viewership groups to produce compact alerts. Finally, we find that common anomalies manifest with spatiotemporal signatures, which enables us to classify anomalies to produce actionable alerts. We evaluate Proteas using 3 months of real viewership data (including the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic) and show that Proteas is accurate with over 80% True Positive Rate, average precision of over 86% (i.e., few false positives) and doesn't miss any major events. In addition, we find that approximately half of Proteas's alerts refer to events not caught by other alerting workflows, thus adding value to operators' existing toolkit.
