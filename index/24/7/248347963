Digital solutions are being sought increasingly in the care sector for making services more efficient and to be prepared for demographic change and the future care service and staff shortage. One possibility here is the implementation of a digital care platform that is target group-oriented and built according to the needs of the individual stakeholders. To build this platform successfully, it is also necessary to take a closer look at the business model. This paper examines the mentioned points by applying a human-centered design approach that focuses on all perspectives and allows a deep understanding of the opportunities and challenges of a digital care platform in a smart city environment. A digital care platform was found to be promising for various involved stakeholders due to the value proposition. Consequently, the stakeholders benefit from e.g. the simplification of processes and data management, less bureaucratic effort and intensified care services for the elderly.
