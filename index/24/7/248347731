The trend of urbanization has started over two centuries ago and is no longer limited to high-income countries. As a result, city population growth has led to the emergence of applications that manage complex processes within cities by utilizing recent technological advances, thereby transforming them into smart cities. Besides automating complex processes within a city, technology also enables a simplified integration of citizens into identifying problems and creating corresponding solutions. This paper discusses an approach that enables citizens to design and later execute their own services within a smart city environment by employing conceptual modeling and microservices. The overall aim is to establish the role of a citizen developer. The proposed approach is then discussed within our proof of concept environment based on a drone tour guide case.
