Continual graph learning is rapidly emerging as an important role in a variety of real-world applications such as online product recommendation systems and social media. While achieving great success, existing works on continual graph learning ignore the information from multiple modalities (e.g., visual and textual features) as well as the rich dynamic structural information hidden in the ever-changing graph data and evolving tasks. However, considering multimodal continual graph learning with evolving topological structures poses great challenges: i) it is unclear how to incorporate the multimodal information into continual graph learning and ii) it is nontrivial to design models that can capture the structure-evolving dynamics in continual graph learning. To tackle these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel Multimodal Structure-evolving Continual Graph Learning (MSCGL) model, which continually learns both the model architecture and the corresponding parameters for Adaptive Multimodal Graph Neural Network (AdaMGNN). To be concrete, our proposed MSCGL model simultaneously takes social information and multimodal information into account to build the multimodal graphs. In order for continually adapting to new tasks without forgetting the old ones, our MSCGL model explores a new strategy with joint optimization of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Group Sparse Regularization (GSR) across different tasks. These two parts interact with each other reciprocally, where NAS is expected to explore more promising architectures and GSR is in charge of preserving important information from the previous tasks. We conduct extensive experiments over two real-world multimodal continual graph scenarios to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MSCGL model. Empirical experiments indicate that both the architectures and weight sharing across different tasks play important roles in affecting the model performances.
