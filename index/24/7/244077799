Earables (ear wearable) are rapidly emerging as a new platform to enable a variety of personal applications. The traditional authentication methods thus become less applicable and inconvenient for earables due to their limited input interface. Earables, however, often feature rich around the head sensing capability that can be leveraged to capture new types of biometrics. In this work, we propose ToothSonic that leverages the toothprint-induced sonic effect produced by a user performing teeth gestures for user authentication. In particular, we design several representative teeth gestures that can produce effective sonic waves carrying the information of the toothprint. To reliably capture the acoustic toothprint, it leverages the occlusion effect of the ear canal and the inward-facing microphone of the earables. It then extracts multi-level acoustic features to represent the intrinsic acoustic toothprint for authentication. The key advantages of ToothSonic are that it is suitable for earables and is resistant to various spoofing attacks as the acoustic toothprint is captured via the private teeth-ear channel of the user that is unknown to others. Our preliminary studies with 20 participants show that ToothSonic achieves 97% accuracy with only three teeth gestures.
