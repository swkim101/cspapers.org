We design and evaluate VICTOR, an easy-to-apply module on top of a recommender system to mitigate misinformation. VICTOR takes an elegant, implicit approach to deliver fake-news verifications, such that readers of fake news can continuously access more verified news articles about fake-news events without explicit correction. We frame fake-news intervention within VICTOR as a graph-based question-answering (QA) task, with Q as a fake-news article and A as the corresponding verified articles. Specifically, VICTOR adopts reinforcement learning: it first considers fake-news readersâ€™ preferences supported by underlying news recommender systems and then directs their reading sequence towards the verified news articles. To verify the performance of VICTOR, we collect and organize VERI, a new dataset consisting of real-news articles, user browsing logs, and fake-real news pairs for a large number of misinformation events. We evaluate zero-shot and few-shot VICTOR on VERI to simulate the never-exposed-ever and seen-before conditions of users while reading a piece of fake news. Results demonstrate that compared to baselines, VICTOR proactively delivers 6% more verified articles with a diversity increase of 7.5% to over 68% of at-risk users who have been exposed to fake news. Moreover, we conduct a field user study in which 165 participants evaluated fake news articles. Participants in the VICTOR condition show better exposure rates, proposal rates, and click rates on verified news articles than those in the other two conditions. Altogether, our work demonstrates the potentials of VICTOR, i.e., combat fake news by delivering verified information implicitly.
