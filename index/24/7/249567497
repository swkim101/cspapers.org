This paper extends the methodology described in Johnson & Wilson[l], which described the teaching of the concept of software walkthroughs to students in an undergraduate computing science and information systems degree course. This paper will outline extending this teaching strategy throughout such a course. The main aspect of this teaching strategy involves re-engineering the way students tackle the practical assignments in subjects throughout their course. This involves replacing each assignment or practical piece of work by multiple assignments, thus mirroring commercial reality in that no task is performed more than once, and providing an effective foundation for walkthroughs. It will be shown that this strategy can be applied across a wide range of assessment tasks and subject material. Integral to this approach are many of the foundation issues of software engineering that in current teaching environments are difficult to apply effectively, e.g. the crucial nature of standards, rather than standards by decree The paper will then discuss benefits that can accrue from this strategy in regard to quality of the students' work, communication skills, reduction of face-to-face teaching and the opportunity to cheat.
