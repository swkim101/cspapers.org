Event cameras, which output events by detecting spatio- temporal brightness changes, bring a novel paradigm to image sensors with high dynamic range and low latency. Previous works have achieved impressive performances on event-based video reconstruction by introducing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, intrinsic locality of convolutional operations is not capable of modeling long-range dependency, which is crucial to many vision tasks. In this paper, we present a hybrid CNN- Transformer network for event-based video reconstruction (ET-Net), which merits the fine local information from CNN and global contexts from Transformer In addition, we further propose a Token Pyramid Aggregation strategy to implement multi-scale token integration for relating internal and intersected semantic concepts in the token-space. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on multiple real-world event datasets.
