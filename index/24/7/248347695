Citations are crucial in scientific works as they help position a new publication. Each citation carries a particular intent, for example, to highlight the importance of a problem or to compare against results provided by another method. The authorsâ€™ intent when making a new citation has been studied to understand the evolution of a field over time or to make recommendations for further citations. In this work, we address the task of citation intent prediction from a new perspective. In addition to textual clues present in the citation phrase, we also consider the citation graph, leveraging high-level information of citation patterns. In this novel setting, we perform a thorough experimental evaluation of graph-based models for intent prediction. We show that our model, GraphCite, improves significantly upon models that take into consideration only the citation phrase. Our code is available online1.
