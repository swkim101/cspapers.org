Visual question answering is the task of answering questions about images. We introduce the VizWiz-VQA-Grounding dataset, the first dataset that visually grounds answers to visual questions asked by people with visual impairments. We analyze our dataset and compare it with five VQA-Grounding datasets to demonstrate what makes it similar and different. We then evaluate the SOTA VQA and VQA-Grounding models and demonstrate that current SOTA algorithms often fail to identify the correct visual evidence where the answer is located. These models regularly struggle when the visual evidence occupies a small fraction of the image, for images that are higher quality, as well as for visual questions that require skills in text recognition. The dataset, evaluation server, and leader-board all can be found at the following link: https://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/answer-grounding-for-vqa/.
