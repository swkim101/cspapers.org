In the fraud graph, fraudsters often interact with a large number of benign entities to hide themselves. So, there are not only the homophilic connections formed by the same label nodes (similar nodes), but also the heterophilic connections formed by the different label nodes (dissimilar nodes). However, the existing GNN-based fraud detection methods just enhance the homophily in fraud graph and use the low-pass filter to retain the commonality of node features among the neighbors, which inevitably ignore the difference among neighbor of heterophilic connections. To address this problem, we propose a Graph Neural Network-based Fraud Detector with Homophilic and Heterophilic Interactions (H2-FDetector for short). Firstly, we identify the homophilic and heterophilic connections with the supervision of labeled nodes. Next, we design a new information aggregation strategy to make the homophilic connections propagate similar information and the heterophilic connections propagate difference information. Finally, a prototype prior is introduced to guide the identification of fraudsters. Extensive experiments on two real public benchmark fraud detection tasks demonstrate that our method apparently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.
