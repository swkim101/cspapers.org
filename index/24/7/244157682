This paper studies the physical layer security of four reactive relay selection methods (optimum relay selection, opportunist relay selection enhancement, suboptimal relay selection enhancement and partial relay selection enhancement) in a cooperative cognitive radio network including one pair of primary users, one eavesdropper, multiple relays and secondary users with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) at receivers. In addition, we consider existing a direct link from a secondary source (S) to secondary destination receivers (D) and eavesdroppers (E). The secrecy outage probability, outage probability, intercept probability and reliability are calculated to verify the four relay selection methods with the fading channels by using Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the loss of secrecy outage probability when remaining direct links from S to D and S to E. Additionally, the results also show that the trade-off between secrecy outage probability and the intercept probability and the optimum relay selection method outperforms other methods.
