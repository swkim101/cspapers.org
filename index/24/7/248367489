Signed network embedding (SNE) has received considerable attention in recent years. A mainstream idea of SNE is to learn node representations by estimating the ratio of sampling densities. Though achieving promising performance, these methods based on density ratio estimation are limited to the issues of confusing sample, expected error, and fixed priori. To alleviate the above-mentioned issues, in this paper, we propose a novel dual-branch density ratio estimation (DDRE) architecture for SNE. Specifically, DDRE 1) consists of a dual-branch network, dealing with the confusing sample; 2) proposes the expected matrix factorization without sampling to avoid the expected error; and 3) devises an adaptive cross noise sampling to alleviate the fixed priori. We perform sign prediction and node classification experiments on four real-world and three artificial datasets, respectively. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that DDRE not only significantly outperforms the methods based on density ratio estimation but also achieves competitive performance compared with other types of methods such as graph likelihood, generative adversarial networks, and graph convolutional networks.
