Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance for semi-supervised node classiﬁcation on graphs, as a result of their ability to exploit node features and topological information. However, most GNNs implicitly assume that the labels of nodes and their neighbors in a graph are the same or consis-tent, which does not hold in heterophilic graphs, where the labels of linked nodes are likely to differ. Moreover, when the topology is non-informative for label prediction, ordinary GNNs may work signiﬁcantly worse than simply applying multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) on each node. To tackle the above problem, we propose a new p -Laplacian based GNN model, termed as p GNN, whose message passing mechanism is derived from a discrete regularization framework and can be theoretically explained as an approximation of a polynomial graph ﬁlter deﬁned on the spectral domain of p -Laplacians. The spectral analysis shows that the new message passing mechanism works as low-high-pass ﬁlters, thus rendering p GNNs effective on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Empirical studies on real-world and synthetic datasets validate our ﬁndings and demonstrate that p GNNs signiﬁcantly outperform several state-of-the-art GNN architectures on heterophilic benchmarks while achieving competitive performance on homophilic benchmarks. Moreover, p GNNs can adaptively learn aggregation weights and are robust to noisy edges.
