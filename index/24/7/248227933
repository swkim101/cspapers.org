Active learning is a promising alternative to alleviate the issue of high annotation cost in the computer vision tasks by consciously selecting more informative samples to label. Active learning for object detection is more challenging and existing efforts on it are relatively rare. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach to address this problem, where the instance-level uncertainty and diversity are jointly considered in a bottom-up manner. To balance the computational complexity, the proposed approach is designed as a two-stage procedure. At the first stage, an Entropy-based Non-Maximum Suppression (ENMS) is presented to estimate the uncertainty of every image, which performs NMS according to the entropy in the feature space to remove predictions with redundant information gains. At the second stage, a diverse prototype (DivProto) strategy is explored to ensure the diversity across images by progressively converting it into the intra-class and inter-class diversities of the entropy-based class-specific prototypes. Extensive experiments are conducted on MS COCO and Pascal VOC, and the proposed approach achieves state of the art results and significantly outperforms the other counter-parts, highlighting its superiority.
