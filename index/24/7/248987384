We study a canonical flexible-learning model in which an agent chooses from a finite set of alternatives, the benefits from which depend on a stochastic state. Before making her decision, the agent chooses what signal to acquire about this state. Learning comes at a cost, which the agent subtracts from the expected benefit she derives from her final decision. After choosing her information, the agent observes a signal realization and takes an action.
