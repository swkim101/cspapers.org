High Level Synthesis (HLS) speeds hardware development and opens the door to non-expert designers, focusing on functionality rather than implementation. The expense and rigidity of commercial electronic design automation (EDA) tool-chains can be an obstacle for these users. LSOracle is an opensource logic synthesis tool which leverages multiple underlying data structures, including and-inverter graphs (AIGs), majority-inverter graphs (MIGs), and xor-and graphs (XAGs) to automatically optimize circuits using the best representation for each region of a design, without manual intervention. The use of MIGs and XAGs gives particularly strong performance in arithmetic logic, cryptography cores, and machine-learning accelerators; applications which may be of particular interest for HLS users. Here we present an overview of the approach and demonstrate an open-source HLS-to-GDS II workflow using LSOracle, Bambu, and OpenROAD. We test the integration on a small benchmark suite and show a reduction in delay of up to 31%.
