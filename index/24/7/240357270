This corrigendum corrects and extends our results on the benefit of peer locking in mitigating the propagation of route leaks on the Internet, originally published in [2]. The updated results show even higher benefits of peer locking than originally reported, and an extended analysis covering additional peer locking deployment scenarios shows partial deployments also yield significant reduction in propagation of leaked routes.
