In this work, we develop a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for the problem of personalized visualization recommendation. The GNN-based framework first represents the large corpus of datasets and visualizations from users as a large heterogeneous graph. Then, it decomposes a visualization into its data and visual components, and then jointly models each of them as a large graph to obtain embeddings of the users, attributes (across all datasets in the corpus), and visual-configurations. From these user-specific embeddings of the attributes and visual-configurations, we can predict the probability of any visualization arising from a specific user. Finally, the experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of using graph neural networks for automatic and personalized recommendation of visualizations to specific users based on their data and visual (design choice) preferences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such work to develop and leverage GNNs for this problem.
