This paper proposes the extension and the application of the robust identification approach, entitled unknown but bounded error (UBBE), to multivariable nonlinear systems using reduced complexity MISO Volterra model on independent generalized orthonormal bases. To overcome the handicap due to the parametric and structural complexity of the MISO Volterra model, each Volterra’s kernel is expanded on GOBs in order to obtain the new black-box nonlinear MISO-GOB-Volterra model. From this model we reformulate the concept of the UBBE approach in the multivariable nonlinear case to easily update the parameter uncertainty set (PUS) which is often a convex polytope. Because of the polytope’s complexity, this last can be approximate by a simpler geometric form as ellipsoid with outer bounding (EOB). Then the ellipsoidal PUS algorithm is considered which will be studied and validated on an experimental Communicating Two Tank System (CTTS) from the evaluation of the parametric identification performances.
