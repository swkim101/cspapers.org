Face reconstruction and tracking is a building block of numerous applications in AR/VR, human-machine interac-tion, as well as medical applications. Most of these applications rely on a metrically correct prediction of the shape, especially, when the reconstructed subject is put into a metrical context (i.e., when there is a reference object of known size). A metrical reconstruction is also needed for any application that measures distances and dimensions of the subject (e.g., to virtually ﬁt a glasses frame). State-of-the-art methods for face reconstruction from a single image are trained on large 2D image datasets in a self-supervised fashion. However, due to the nature of a perspective projection they are not able to reconstruct the actual face dimensions, and even predicting the average human face outperforms some of these methods in a metrical sense. To learn the actual shape of a face, we argue for a supervised training scheme. Since there exists no large-scale 3D dataset for this task, we annotated and uniﬁed small- and medium-scale databases. The resulting uniﬁed dataset is still a medium-scale dataset with more than 2k identities and training purely on it would lead to overﬁtting. To this end, we take advantage of a face recognition network pretrained on a large-scale 2D image dataset, which provides distinct features for different faces and is robust to expression, illumination, and camera changes. Using these features, we train our face shape estimator in a supervised fashion, inheriting the robustness and generalization of the face recognition network. Our method, which we call MICA (MetrIC fAce), outperforms the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods by a large margin, both on current non-metric benchmarks as well as on our metric benchmarks ( 15% and 24% lower average error on NoW, respec-tively).
