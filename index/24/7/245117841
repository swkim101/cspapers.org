Recent studies have shown that adversarial examples handcrafted on one white-box model can be used to at-tack other black-box models. Such cross-model transferability makes it feasible to perform black-box attacks, which has raised security concerns for real-world DNNs applications. Nevertheless, existing works mostly focus on investigating the adversarial transferability across different deep models that share the same modality of input data. The cross-modal transferability of adversarial perturbation has never been explored. This paper investigates the transferability of adversarial perturbation across different modalities, i.e., leveraging adversarial perturbation generated on white-box image models to attack black-box video models. Specifically, motivated by the observation that the low-level feature space between images and video frames are similar, we propose a simple yet effective cross-modal attack method, named as Image To Video (I2V) attack. I2V generates adversarial frames by minimizing the cosine similarity between features of pretrained image models from adversarial and benign examples, then combines the generated adversarial frames to perform black-box attacks on video recognition models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that I2V can achieve high attack success rates on different black-box video recognition models. On Kinetics-400 and UCF-101, I2V achieves an average attack success rate of 77.88% and 65.68%, respectively, which sheds light on the feasibility of cross-modal adversarial attacks.
