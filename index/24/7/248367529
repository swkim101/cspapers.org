Machine learning is widely used in e-commerce to analyze clickstream sessions and then to allocate marketing resources. Traditional neural learning can model long-term dependencies in clickstream data, yet it ignores the different shopping phases (i. e., goal-directed search vs. browsing) in user behavior as theorized by marketing research. In this paper, we develop a novel, theory-informed machine learning model to account for different shopping phases as defined in marketing theory. Specifically, we formalize a tailored attentive deep Markov model called ClickstreamDMM for predicting the risk of user exits without purchase in e-commerce web sessions. Our ClickstreamDMM combines (1) an attention network to learn long-term dependencies in clickstream data and (2) a latent variable model to capture different shopping phases (i. e., goal-directed search vs. browsing). Due to the interpretable structure, our ClickstreamDMM allows marketers to generate new insights on how shopping phases relate to actual purchase behavior. We evaluate our model using real-world clickstream data from a leading e-commerce platform consisting of 26,279 sessions with 250,287 page clicks. Thereby, we demonstrate that our model is effective in predicting user exits without purchase: compared to existing baselines, it achieves an improvement by 11.5 % in AUROC and 12.7 % in AUPRC. Overall, our model enables e-commerce platforms to detect users at the risk of exiting without purchase. Based on it, e-commerce platforms can then intervene with marketing resources to steer users toward purchasing.
