Bloom filter is an efficient data structure for filtering negative keys (keys not in a given set) with substantially small space. However, in real-world applications, there widely exist vulnerable negative keys, which will bring high costs if not being properly filtered, especially when positive keys are added/deleted dynamically. To address the problem, we propose SeeSaw Counting Filter (SSCF), which is innovated with encapsulating the vulnerable negative keys into a unified counter array named seesaw counter array, and dynamically modulating (or varying) the applied hash functions to guard the encapsulated keys from being misidentified. Moreover, we propose ada-SSCF to handle the scenarios where the vulnerable negative keys cannot be obtained in advance. We extensively evaluate our SSCF, which shows that SSCF outperforms the cutting-edge filters by 3 Ã— on averages regarding accuracy while ensuring a low operation latency. All source codes are in [2].
