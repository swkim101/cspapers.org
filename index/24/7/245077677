Intersections are critical elements of urban traffic management and are identified as bottlenecks prone to traffic congestion and accidents. Intelligent intersection management plays a significant role in improving traffic efficiency and safety determining, among other metrics, the waiting time that vehicles incur when crossing an intersection. This work presents a preliminary analysis of the worst-case response time of intersection management protocols that handle mixed traffic with autonomous and human-driven vehicles. We deduce theoretical bounds for such time considered as the interval between the injection of a vehicle in the road system and its departure from the intersection, considering different intersection management protocols for mixed traffic, namely the Synchronous Intersection Management Protocol (SIMP) and several configurations of the conventional Round-Robin (RR) policy. Simulation results validate the analytical bounds partially. Ongoing work addresses the queue dynamics and its reliable detection by traffic simulators.
