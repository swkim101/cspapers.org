We propose a novel weakly supervised approach for 3D semantic segmentation on volumetric images. Unlike most existing methods that require voxel-wise densely labeled training data, our weakly-supervised CIVA-Net is the first model that only needs image-level class labels as guidance to learn accurate volumetric segmentation. Our model learns from cross-image co-occurrence for integral region generation, and explores inter-voxel affinity relations to predict segmentation with accurate boundaries. We empirically validate our model on both simulated and real cryo-ET datasets. Our experiments show that CIVA-Net achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art models trained with stronger supervision.
