Real noisy-clean pairs on a large scale are costly and difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, supervised denoisers trained on synthetic data perform poorly in practice. Self-supervised denoisers, which learn only from single noisy images, solve the data collection problem. However, self-supervised denoising methods, especially blindspot-driven ones, suffer sizable information loss during input or network design. The absence of valuable information dramatically reduces the upper bound of denoising performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient approach called Blind2Unblind to overcome the information loss in blindspot-driven denoising methods. First, we introduce a global-aware mask mapper that enables global perception and accelerates training. The mask mapper samples all pixels at blind spots on denoised volumes and maps them to the same channel, allowing the loss function to optimize all blind spots at once. Second, we propose a revisible loss to train the denoising network and make blind spots visible. The denoiser can learn directly from raw noise images without losing information or being trapped in identity mapping. We also theoretically analyze the convergence of the revisible loss. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to previous work.
