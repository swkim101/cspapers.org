A µ-biased Max-CSP instance with predicate ψ:{0,1}r → {0,1} is an instance of Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) where the objective is to find a labeling of relative weight at most µ which satisfies the maximum fraction of constraints. Biased CSPs are versatile and express several well studied problems such as Densest-k-Sub(Hyper)graph and SmallSetExpansion. In this work, we explore the role played by the bias parameter µ on the approximability of biased CSPs. We show that the approximability of such CSPs can be characterized (up to loss of factors in arity r) using the bias-approximation curve of Densest-k-SubHypergraph (DkSH). In particular, this gives a tight characterization of predicates which admit approximation guarantees that are independent of the bias parameter µ. Motivated by the above, we give new approximation and hardness results for . In particular, assuming the Small Set Expansion Hypothesis (SSEH), we show that with arity r and k = µ n is NP-hard to approximate to a factor of Ω(r3µr−1log(1/µ)) for every r ≥ 2 and µ < 2−r. We also give a O(µr−1log(1/µ))-approximation algorithm for the same setting. Our upper and lower bounds are tight up to constant factors, when the arity r is a constant, and in particular, imply the first tight approximation bounds for the Densest-k-Subgraph problem in the linear bias regime. Furthermore, using the above characterization, our results also imply matching algorithms and hardness for every biased CSP of constant arity.
