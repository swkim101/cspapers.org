Modern recommender systems have evolved rapidly along with deep learning models that are well-optimized for overall performance, especially those trained under Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). However, a recommendation algorithm that focuses solely on the average performance may reinforce the exposure bias and exacerbate the “rich-get-richer” effect, leading to unfair user experience. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that such performance gap among various user groups is enlarged by an ERM-trained recommender in the long-term. To mitigate such amplification effects, we propose to optimize for the worst-case performance under the Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) framework, with the goal of improving long-term fairness for disadvantaged subgroups. In addition, we propose a simple-yet-effective streaming optimization improvement called Streaming-DRO (S-DRO), which effectively reduces loss variances for recommendation problems with sparse and long-tailed data distributions. Our results on two large-scale datasets suggest that (1) DRO is a flexible and effective technique for improving worst-case performance, and (2) Streaming-DRO outperforms vanilla DRO and other strong baselines by improving the worst-case and overall performance at the same time.
