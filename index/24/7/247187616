We present a novel framework for floor plan-based, full six degree-of-freedom LiDAR localization. Our approach relies on robust ceiling and ground plane detection, which solves part of the pose and supports the segmentation of vertical structure elements such as walls and pillars. Our core contribution is a novel nearest neighbour data structure for an efficient look-up of nearest vertical structure elements from the floor plan. The registration is realized as a pair-wise regularized windowed pose graph optimization. Highly efficient, accurate and drift-free long-term localization is demonstrated on multiple scenes.
