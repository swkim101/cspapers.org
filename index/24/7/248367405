Recommendation is prevalently studied for implicit feedback recently, but it seriously suffers from the lack of negative samples, which has a significant impact on the training of recommendation models. Existing negative sampling is based on the static or adaptive probability distributions. Sampling from the adaptive probability receives more attention, since it tends to generate more hard examples, to make recommender training faster to converge. However, item sampling becomes much more time-consuming particularly for complex recommendation models. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Sampling method based on Importance Resampling (AdaSIR for short), which is not only almost equally efficient and accurate for any recommender models, but also can robustly accommodate arbitrary proposal distributions. More concretely, AdaSIR maintains a contextualized sample pool of fixed-size with importance resampling, from which items are only uniformly sampled. Such a simple sampling method can be proved to provide approximately accurate adaptive sampling under some conditions. The sample pool plays two extra important roles in (1) reusing historical hard samples with certain probabilities; (2) estimating the rank of positive samples for weighting, such that recommender training can concentrate more on difficult positive samples. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that AdaSIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of sampling efficiency and effectiveness.
