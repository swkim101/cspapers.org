In many scenarios, 1) data streams are generated in real time; 2) labeled data are expensive and only limited labels are available in the beginning; 3) real-world data is not always i.i.d. and data drift over time gradually; 4) the storage of historical streams is limited. This learning setting limits the applicability and availability of many Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. We generalize the learning task under such setting as a semi-supervised drifted stream learning with short lookback problem (SDSL). SDSL imposes two under-addressed challenges on existing methods in semi-supervised learning and continuous learning: 1) robust pseudo-labeling under gradual shifts and 2) anti-forgetting adaptation with short lookback. To tackle these challenges, we propose a principled and generic generation-replay framework to solve SDSL. To achieve robust pseudo-labeling, we develop a novel pseudo-label classification model to leverage supervised knowledge of previously labeled data, unsupervised knowledge of new data, and, structure knowledge of invariant label semantics. To achieve adaptive anti-forgetting model replay, we propose to view the anti-forgetting adaptation task as a flat region search problem. We propose a novel minimax game-based replay objective function to solve the flat region search problem and develop an effective optimization solver. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
