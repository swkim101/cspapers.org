In this paper, we focus on improving the resilience of distributed real-time applications for Cyber Physical Systems. To guarantee the safety related resilience, fault-tolerant techniques, e.g., task re-execution and active replica, are leveraged to tolerate faults in task executions. To provide security related resilience, cryptography is deployed to resist confidentiality attack on messages delivered over the communication media. We analyze the impact of task's fault tolerance on secure message communication, and then formulate the design problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, i.e., to minimize the failure probability and security vulnerability of the application while subject to given fault-tolerant constraints, execution constraints and deadline constraints. We propose an improved multi-objective optimization algorithm, called Decomposition-based Security and Fault tolerance Co-Optimization (DeSFCO) algorithm, to search for the optimal Pareto solutions of security and reliability harden assignments for messages and tasks. Two preliminary experiments evaluate efficiency of our approach.
