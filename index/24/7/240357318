Public cloud platforms are vital in supporting online applications for remote learning and telecommuting during the COVID-19 pandemic. The network performance between cloud regions and access networks directly impacts application performance and users' quality of experience (QoE). However, the location and network connectivity of vantage points often limits the visibility of edge-based measurement platforms (e.g., RIPE Atlas). We designed and implemented the CLoud-based Applications Speed Platform (CLASP) to measure performance to various networks from virtual machines in cloud regions with speed test servers that have been widely deployed on the Internet. In our five-month longitudinal measurements in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we found that 30-70% of ISPs we measured showed severe throughput degradation from the peak throughput of the day.
