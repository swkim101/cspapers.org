Internet of things to applications have the potential to improve the quality of life, especially for elderly and disabled people. A smart home has been a beneficial system for elderly and disabled people. However, there are many innovative gaps to design, develop, install, and plugins for improving an intelligent home system. Basic activities should be initially concerned, such as electronic control systems, human movement detection, and environment monitor system. There are many issues in designing an intelligent home system, such as what the devices need to integrate into the system and designing a thin system. This paper explores the design and development of the automated light system in a smart home using the Internet of things and Mosquitto server. This research aims to design the workflow overview of the automatic light system based on sensors, devices, components, and servers. The system achieves the light control manually and automatically. MQTT server accomplishes to control and modify any devices in the IoT network system flexibly. The system's functionalities achieve, and the motion sensor capability is a concern of the sensing range covering the area.
