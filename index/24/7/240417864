Comprehensive testing is of high importance to ensure the reliability of software systems, especially for systems with high stakes such as FinTech systems. In this paper, we share our observations of the Ant Groupâ€™s status quo in testing their financial services, specifically on the importance of properly transforming relevant external environment settings and prioritizing input object fields for mutation during automated fuzzing. Based on these observations, we propose FinFuzzer, an automated fuzz testing framework that detects and transforms relevant environmental settings into system inputs, prioritizes input object fields, and mutates system inputs on both environment settings and high-priority object fields. Our evaluation of FinFuzzer against four FinTech systems developed by the Ant Group shows that FinFuzzer can outperform a state-of-the-art approach in terms of line coverage in much shorter time.
