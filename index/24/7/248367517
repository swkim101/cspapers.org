Given a sequence of sets with timestamps, where each set includes an arbitrary number of elements, temporal sets prediction aims to predict elements in the consecutive set. Indeed, predicting temporal sets is much more complicated than the conventional predictions of time series and temporal events. Recent studies on temporal sets prediction follow the same pipeline that only learns from each userâ€™s own sequence, which fails to discover the collaborative signals among the sequences of different users. In this paper, we propose a novel element-guided temporal graph neural network to tackle the above issue in temporal sets prediction. Specifically, we first connect sequences of different users via a temporal graph, where nodes contain users and elements, and edges represent user-element interactions with time information. Then, we devise a new message aggregation mechanism to improve the model expressive ability via adaptively learning element-specific representations for each user with the guidance of elements. By performing the element-guided message aggregation among multiple hops, collaborative signals latent in high-order user-element interactions are explicitly encoded. Finally, we present a temporal information utilization module to capture both the semantic and periodic patterns in user sequential behaviors. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach could not only outperform the existing methods with a significant margin but also capture the collaborative signals.
