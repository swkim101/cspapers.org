Modern processors expose software to information leakage through shared microarchitectural state. One of the most severe leakage channels is cache contention, exploited by attacks referred to as PRIME+PROBE, which can infer fine-grained memory access patterns while placing only limited assumptions on attacker capabilities. In this work, we strengthen the cache contention channel with a near-optimal time resolution. We propose PRIME+SCOPE, a cross-core cache contention attack that performs back-to-back cache contention measurements that access only a single cache line. It offers a time resolution of around 70 cycles (25ns), while maintaining the wide applicability of PRIME+PROBE. To enable such a rapid measurement, we rely on the deterministic nature of modern replacement policies and their (non-)interaction across cache levels. We provide a methodology to, essentially, prepare multiple cache levels simultaneously, and apply it to Intel processors with both inclusive and non-inclusive cache hierarchies. We characterize the resolution of PRIME+SCOPE, and confirm it with a cross-core covert channel (capacity up to 3.5 Mbps, no shared memory) and an improved attack on AES T-tables. Finally, we use the properties underlying PRIME+SCOPE to bootstrap the construction of the eviction sets needed for the attack. The resulting routine outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by two orders of magnitude. Ultimately, our work shows that interference through cache contention can provide richer temporal precision than state-of-the-art attacks that directly interact with monitored memory addresses.
