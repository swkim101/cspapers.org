We present a self-learning approach for synthesizing programs from integer
sequences. Our method relies on a tree search guided by a learned policy. 
Our system is tested on the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.
There, it discovers, on its own, solutions for 27987 sequences starting from 
basic operators and without human-written training examples.
