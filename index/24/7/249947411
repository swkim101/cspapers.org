Without access to the training data where a black-box victim model is deployed, training a surrogate model for black-box adversarial attack is still a struggle. In terms of data, we mainly identify three key measures for effective surrogate training in this paper. First, we show that leveraging the loss introduced in this paper to enlarge the inter-class similarity makes more sense than enlarging the inter-class diversity like existing methods. Next, unlike the approaches that expand the intra-class diversity in an implicit model-agnostic fashion, we propose a loss function specific to the surrogate model for our generator to enhance the intra-class diversity. Finally, in accordance with the in-depth observations for the methods based on proxy data, we argue that leveraging the proxy data is still an effective way for surrogate training. To this end, we propose a triple-player framework by introducing a discriminator into the traditional data-free framework. In this way, our method can be competitive when there are few semantic overlaps between the scarce proxy data (with the size between 1 k and 5k) and the training data. We evaluate our method on a range of victim models and datasets. The extensive results witness the effectiveness of our method. Our source code is available at https://github.com/xuxiangsun/ST-Data.
