In the growing elderly population globally, patients with severe movement disorders account for a large proportion. Moreover, the development of intelligent service equipment can better assist them in their daily. This paper proposes a new service robot control system. The brain-computer interface (BCI) based on Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) is used to acquire and process electroencephalogram(EEG) signals and output various control commands accordingly. Then, considering the visual fatigue of SSVEP-BCI, we added an object detection method based on Yolov3-tiny and saliency prediction to identify the patientâ€™s selection intention intelligently. The results show that the subject can successfully complete the object delivery task with an average accuracy of 90.3%. The proposed control system can help the patients control a service robot in a more intelligent and friendly way to realize some daily tasks.
