Joint aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) and rating prediction (RP) is a newly proposed task (namely ASAP) that integrates the characteristics of both fine-grained and coarse-grained sentiment analysis. However, the prior joint models for the ASAP task only consider the shallow interaction between the two granularities. In this work, we gain the inspiration from human intuition, presenting an innovative from-fine-to-coarse reasoning framework for better joint task performance. Our system advances mainly in three aspects. First, we additionally make use of the category label text features, co-encoding them with the input document texts, allowing to accurately capture the key clues of each category. Second, we build a fine-to-coarse hierarchical label graph, modeling the aspect categories and the overall rating as a hierarchical structure for full interaction of the two granularities. Third, we propose to perform global iterative reasoning with a cross-collaboration between the hierarchical label graph and the context graphs, enabling sufficient communication between categories and review contexts. Based on the ASAP dataset, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by large margins. Further in-depth analyses prove that our method is effective on addressing both the unbalanced data distribution and the long-text issue.
