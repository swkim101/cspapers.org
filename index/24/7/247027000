How do we design mentoring programs that effectively support CS learners? This workshop draws upon our expertise in mentoring and inclusive design as well as our experience in the academic and industry spaces to help participants maximize the impact of a mentoring program. Participants will work with field-tested open-source toolkits which share modules rooted in effective and inclusive pedagogy. The Tech Resilience Mentoring Toolkit was created to strengthen problem-solving and collaboration skills that apply both in and out of the classroom. This 7-week program was piloted during the 2020-21 academic year to bring Microsoft mentors (remotely) to cohorts of over 1000 college students across 100+ institutions. The Educator Toolkit offers curricular modules curated from an inclusive academic peer mentorship program with published evidence of its ability to effectively prepare mentors and support improved retention in major-prep courses. This adaptable toolkit has been used to prepare TAs, lab assistants and graders by emphasizing the relevance of learning strategies. Participants will walk through a sample lesson before starting to customize a toolkit for their campus/organization. We'll field questions that arise as participants consider different aspects of their mentoring program, such as modality (in-person or remote) and ratios (1:1 or cohort-based). Participants should bring their laptops and can expect to walk away with new materials for mentoring.
