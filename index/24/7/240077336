Shape analysis has been playing an important role in early diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s diseases (AD). However, obtaining effective shape representations remains challenging. This paper proposes to use the Alexandrov polyhedra as surface-based shape signatures for cortical morphometry analysis. Given a closed genus-0 surface, its Alexandrov polyhedron is a convex representation that encodes its intrinsic geometry information. We propose to compute the polyhedra via a novel spherical optimal transport (OT) computation. In our experiments, we observe that the Alexandrov polyhedra of cortical surfaces between pathology-confirmed AD and cognitively unimpaired individuals are significantly different. Moreover, we propose a visualization method by comparing local geometry differences across cortical surfaces. We show that the proposed method is effective in pinpointing regional cortical structural changes impacted by AD.
