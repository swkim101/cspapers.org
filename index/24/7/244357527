 Card sorting is one method that can be used to solicit meaningful insight from end users on the design and assessment of technologies. The objective of this paper is to present methods for and results from a card sorting activity exploring the social impacts experienced by households that have adopted improved cookstoves in peri-urban and rural Uganda. Using a framework consisting of eleven social impacts (population change, family, gender, education, stratification, employment, health and well-being, human rights, networks and communication, conflict and crime, and cultural identity/heritage), households were asked to sort the cards into most, somewhat, and least impacted categories with conversations facilitated around each card placement. Results from this activity reaffirmed positive impacts for family, gender, health and well-being, and education that have been well documented in the literature while also identifying social impacts often overlooked in the sector such as changes in networks and communication, cultural identity and heritage, and human rights. Reflections on these results in terms of cookstove design as well as improvements that could be made in future card sorting activities are discussed.
