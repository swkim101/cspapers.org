Traditional Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) state machine replication protocols assume a partial synchrony model, leading to a design where a leader replica drives the protocol and is replaced after a timeout. Recently, we witnessed a surge of asynchronous BFT protocols that use randomization to remove the assumptions of bounds on message delivery times, making them more resilient to adverse network conditions. However, these protocols still fall short of being practical across a broad range of scenarios due to their cubic communication costs, use of expensive primitives, and overall protocol complexity. In this paper, we present Alea-BFT, the first asynchronous BFT protocol to achieve quadratic communication complexity, allowing it to scale to large networks. Alea-BFT brings the key design insight from classical protocols of concentrating part of the work on a single designated replica, and incorporates this principle in a two stage pipelined design, with an efficient broadcast led by the designated replica followed by an inexpensive binary agreement. We evaluated our prototype implementation across 10 sites in 4 continents, and our results show significant scalability gains from the proposed design.
