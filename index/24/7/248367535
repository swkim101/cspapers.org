This paper studies the task of detecting bots for online mobile games. Considering the fact of lacking labeled cheating samples and restricted available data in the real detection systems, we aim to study the finger operations captured by screen sensors to infer the potential bots in an unsupervised way. In detail, we introduce a Transformer-style detection model, namely FingFormer. It studies the finger operations in the format of graph structure in order to capture the spatial and temporal relatedness between the two hands’ operations. To optimize the model in an unsupervised way, we introduce two contrastive learning strategies to refine both finger moving patterns and players’ operation habits. We conduct extensive experiments under different experimental environments, including the synthetic dataset, the offline dataset, as well as the large-scale online data flow from three mobile games. The multi-facet experiments illustrate the proposed model is both effective and general to detect the bots for different mobile games.
