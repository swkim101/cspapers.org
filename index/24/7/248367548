Satellite imagery depicts the earth’s surface remotely and provides comprehensive information for many applications, such as land use monitoring and urban planning. Existing studies on unsupervised representation learning for satellite images only take into account the images’ geographic information, ignoring human activity factors. To bridge this gap, we propose using Point-of-Interest (POI) data to capture human factors and design a contrastive learning-based framework to consolidate the representation of satellite imagery with POI information. Also, we design an attention model that merges the representations from the geographic and POI perspectives adaptively. On the basis of real-world datasets collected from Beijing, we evaluate our method for predicting socioeconomic indicators. The results show that the representation containing POI information outperforms the geographic representation in estimating commercial activity-related indicators. Our proposed framework can estimate the socioeconomic indicators with an R2 of 0.874 and outperforms the baseline methods.
