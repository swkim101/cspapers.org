This paper proposes the permuton-induced Chinese restaurant process (PCRP), a stochastic process on rectangular partitioning of a matrix. This distribution is suitable for use as a prior distribution in Bayesian nonparametric relational model to ﬁnd hidden clusters in matrices and network data. Our main contribution is to introduce the notion of permutons into the well-known Chinese restaurant process (CRP) for sequence partitioning: a permuton is a probability measure on [0 , 1] × [0 , 1] and can be regarded as a geometric interpretation of the scaling limit of permutations. Speciﬁcally, we extend the model that the table order of CRPs has a random geometric arrangement on [0 , 1] × [0 , 1] drawn from the permuton. By analogy with the relationship between the stick-breaking process (SBP) and CRP for the inﬁnite mixture model of a sequence, this model can be regarded as a multi-dimensional extension of CRP paired with the block-breaking process (BBP), which has been recently proposed as a multi-dimensional extension of SBP. While BBP always has an inﬁnite number of redundant intermediate variables, PCRP can be composed of varying size intermediate variables in a data-driven manner depending on the size and quality of the observation data. Experiments show that PCRP can improve the prediction performance in relational data analysis by reducing the local optima and slow mixing problems compared with the conventional BNP models because the local transitions of PCRP in Markov chain Monte Carlo inference are more ﬂexible than the previous models.
