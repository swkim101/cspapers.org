The growing number of vehicles has put a lot of pressure on the transportation system. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) faces a great challenge of traffic congestion. Traffic density displays the congestion of current traffic which reflects explicitly about traffic status. With the development of communication technology, people use mobile stations (MSs) at any time and cellular signals are everywhere. Different from traditional traffic information estimation methods based global positioning system (GPS) and vehicle detector (VD), this paper resorts to Cellular Floating Vehicle Data (CFVD) to estimate the traffic density. In this paper, Hand over (HO) and call arrival (CA) cellular signals are essentials to estimate traffic flow and traffic speed. In addition, mixture probability density distribution generator is adopted to assist estimating the probabilities HO and CA events. Through accurate traffic flow and traffic speed estimations, precise traffic density is achieved. In the simulation experiments, the proposed method achieves estimation MAPEs 11.92%, 13.97% and 16.47% for traffic flow, traffic speed and traffic density, respectively.
