A medical imaging model is usually explored for the diagnosis of a single disease. However, with the expanding demand for multi-disease diagnosis in clinical applications, multi-function solutions need to be investigated. Previous works proposed to either exploit different disease labels to conduct transfer learning through fine-tuning, or transfer knowledge across different domains with similar diseases. However, these methods still cannot address the real clinical challenge - a multi-disease model is required but annotations for each disease are not always available. In this paper, we introduce the task of transferring knowledge from single-disease diagnosis (source domain) to enhance multi-disease diagnosis (target domain). A category-invariant cross-domain transfer (CCT) method is proposed to address this single-to-multiple extension. First, for domain-specific task learning, we present a confidence weighted pooling (CWP) to obtain coarse heatmaps for different disease categories. Then, conditioned on these heatmaps, category-invariant feature refinement (CIFR) blocks are proposed to better localize discriminative semantic regions related to the corresponding diseases. The category-invariant characteristic enables transferability from the source domain to the target domain. We validate our method in two popular areas: extending diabetic retinopathy to identifying multiple ocular diseases, and extending glioma identification to the diagnosis of other brain tumors.
