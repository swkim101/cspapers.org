We present an approach for radar-inertial odometry which uses a continuous-time framework to fuse measurements from multiple automotive radars and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Adverse weather conditions do not have a significant impact on the operating performance of radar sensors unlike that of camera and LiDAR sensors. Radarâ€™s robustness in such conditions and the increasing prevalence of radars on passenger vehicles motivate us to look at the use of radar for ego-motion estimation. A continuous-time trajectory representation is applied not only as a framework to enable heterogeneous and asynchronous multi-sensor fusion, but also, to facilitate efficient optimization by being able to compute poses and their derivatives in closed-form and at any given time along the trajectory. We compare our continuous-time estimates to those from a discrete-time radar-inertial odometry approach and show that our continuous-time method outperforms the discrete-time method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a continuous-time framework has been applied to radar-inertial odometry.
