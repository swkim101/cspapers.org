We present an integrated open-source framework to develop, deploy, and use event-driven distributed enclaved applications across heterogeneous Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Our framework strives for strong application authenticity and integrity guarantees, and optionally confidentiality and availability, while minimizing the run-time Trusted Computing Base (TCB). For software developers, our framework provides a high level of abstraction over the platform-specific TEE layer that provides isolation, attestation and secure communication amongst distributed application components, allowing developers to focus of application logic. We provide a notion of event-driven programming to develop distributed enclave applications in Rust and C for heterogeneous TEEs, including Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone and the open-source Sancus. This heterogeneity makes our framework uniquely suitable for a broad range of use cases which combine cloud processing, mobile and edge devices, and lightweight sensing and actuation.
