The hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising has been widely utilized to improve HSI qualities. Recently, learning-based HSI denoising methods have shown their effectiveness, but most of them are based on synthetic dataset and lack the generalization capability on real testing HSI. Moreover, there is still no public paired real HSI denoising dataset to learn HSI denoising network and quantitatively evaluate HSI methods. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to produce realistic dataset for learning and evaluating HSI denoising network. On the one hand, we collect a paired real HSI denoising dataset, which consists of short-exposure noisy HSIs and the corresponding long-exposure clean HSIs. On the other hand, we propose an accurate HSI noise model which matches the distribution of real data well and can be employed to synthesize realistic dataset. On the basis of the noise model, we present an approach to calibrate the noise parameters of the given hyperspectral camera. The extensive experimental results show that a network learned with only synthetic data generated by our noise model performs as well as it is learned with paired real data.
