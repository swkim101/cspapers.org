Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) embedding has been a prevalent approach to learn representations off semantically-rich heterogeneous networks. Most HIN embedding methods exploit meta-paths to retain high-order structures, yet, their performance is conditioned on the quality of the (generated/manually-defined) meta-paths and their suitability for the specific label set. Whereas other methods adjust random walks to harness or skip certain heterogeneous structures (e.g. node type(s)), in doing so, the adjusted random walker may casually omit other node/edge types. Our key insight is with no domain knowledge, the random walker should hold no assumptions about heterogeneous structure (i.e. edge types). Thus, aiming for a flexible and general method, we utilize network schema as a unique blueprint of HIN, and propose SchemaWalk, a random walk to uniformly sample all edge types within the network schema. Moreover, we identify the starvation phenomenon which induces random walkers on HINs to under- or over-sample certain edge types. Accordingly, we design SchemaWalkHO to skip local deficient connectivity to preserve uniform sampling distribution. Finally, we carry out node classification experiments on four real-world HINs, and provide in-depth qualitative analysis. The results highlight the robustness of our method regardless to the graph structure in contrast with the state-of-the-art baselines.
