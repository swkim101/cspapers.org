Automatically identifying the discourse relations can help many downstream NLP tasks such as reading comprehension. It can be categorized into explicit and implicit discourse relation recognition (EDRR and IDRR). Due to the lack of connectives, IDRR remains to be a big challenge. In this paper, we take the first step to exploit the knowledge distillation (KD) technique for discourse relation analysis. Our target is to train a focused single-data single-task student with the help of a general multi-data multi-task teacher. Specifically, we first train one teacher for both the top and second level relation classification tasks with explicit and implicit data. We then transfer the feature embeddings and soft labels from the teacher network to the student network. Extensive experimental results on the popular PDTB dataset proves that our model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance. We also show the effectiveness of our proposed KD architecture through detailed analysis.
