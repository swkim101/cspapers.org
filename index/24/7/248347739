A group of academic researchers and developers from the computer music industry have joined forces for over a year to propose a new version of Web Audio Modules, an open source framework facilitating the development of high-performance Web Audio plugins (instruments, realtime audio effects and MIDI processors). While JavaScript and Web standards are becoming increasingly flexible and powerful, C, C++, and domain-specific languages such as FAUST or Csound remain the prevailing languages used by professional developers of native plugins. Fortunately, it is now possible to compile them in WebAssembly, which means they can be integrated with the Web platform. Our work aims to create a continuum between native and browser based audio app development and to appeal to programmers from both worlds. This paper presents our proposal including guidelines and implementations for an open Web Audio plugin standard - essentially the infrastructure to support high level audio plugins for the browser.
