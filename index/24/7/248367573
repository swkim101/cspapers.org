Nowadays, the large online systems are constructed on the basis of microservice architecture. A failure in this architecture may cause a series of failures due to the fault propagation. Thus, the large online systems need to be monitored comprehensively to ensure the service quality. Even though many anomaly detection techniques have been proposed, few of them can be directly applied to a given microservice or cloud server in industrial environment. To settle these challenges, this paper presents SLA-VAE, a semi-supervised learning based active anomaly detection framework using variational auto-encoder. SLA-VAE first defines anomalies based on feature extraction module, introduces semi-supervised VAE to identify anomalies in multivariate time series, and employs active learning to update the online model via a small number of uncertain samples. We conduct experiments on the cloud server data from two different types of game business in Tencent. The results show that SLA-VAE significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and is suitable for wide deployment in large online business system.
