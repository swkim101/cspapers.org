Since the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, peer-reviewed biomedical repositories have experienced a surge in chemical and disease related queries. These queries have a wide variety of naming conventions and nomenclatures from trademark and generic, to chemical composition mentions. Normalizing or disambiguating these mentions within texts provides researchers and data-curators with more relevant articles returned by their search query. Named entity normalization aims to automate this disambiguation process by linking entity mentions onto their appropriate candidate concepts within a biomedical knowledge base or ontology. We explore several term embedding aggregation techniques in addition to how the termâ€™s context affects evaluation performance. We also evaluate our embedding approaches for normalizing term instances containing one or many relations within unstructured texts.
