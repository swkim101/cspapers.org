Face image super resolution (face hallucination) usu-ally relies on facial priors to restore realistic details and preserve identity information. Recent advances can achieve impressive results with the help of GAN prior. They ei-ther design complicated modules to modify the fixed GAN prior or adopt complex training strategies to finetune the generator. In this work, we propose a generative and controllable face SR framework, called GCFSR, which can re-construct images with faithful identity information without any additional priors. Generally, GCFSR has an encoder-generator architecture. Two modules called style modu-lation and feature modulation are designed for the multi-factor SR task. The style modulation aims to generate real-istic face details and the feature modulation dynamically fuses the multi-level encoded features and the generated ones conditioned on the upscaling factor. The simple and elegant architecture can be trained from scratch in an end-to-end manner. For small upscaling factors (â‰¤8), GCFSR can produce surprisingly good results with only adversar-ialloss. After adding L1 and perceptual losses, GCFSR can outperform state-of-the-art methods for large upscalingfac-tors (16, 32, 64). During the test phase, we can modulate the generative strength via feature modulation by changing the conditional upscaling factor continuously to achieve various generative effects.
