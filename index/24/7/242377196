In a modern logistics network, high-performance automation of inventory tracking and package management calls for a reliable, high-throughput and long range RFID localization system. We present RF-Chord, the first RFID localization system that simultaneously meets all these requirements. RF-Chord features a one-shot multisine-constructed wideband design that can process the RF signal with a 200 MHz bandwidth in real-time to facilitate one-shot localization at scale. In addition, multiple SINR enhancement techniques are designed for range extension. Finally, we propose a kernel-layer-based near-field localization and a multipath-suppression algorithm that reduces the 99% long-tail errors.
