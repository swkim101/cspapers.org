Social recommendation, which leverages social connections to construct Recommender Systems (RS), plays an important role in alleviating information overload. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received increasing attention due to their great capacity for graph data. Since data in RS is essentially in the structure of graphs, GNN-based RS is flourishing. However, existing works lack in-depth thinking of social recommendations. These methods contain implicit assumptions that are not well analyzed in practice. To tackle these problems, we conduct statistical analyses on widely used social recommendation datasets. We design metrics to evaluate the social information, which can provide guidance about whether and how we should use this information in the RS task. Based on these analyses, we propose a Distillation Enhanced SocIal Graph Network (DESIGN). We train a model that integrates information from the user-item interaction graph and the user-user social graph and train two auxiliary models that only use one of the above graphs respectively. These models are trained simultaneously, where the knowledge distillation technique restricts the training process and makes them learn from each other. Our extensive experiments show that our model significantly and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors on real-world datasets.
