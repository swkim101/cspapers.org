 The operating conditions for, and requirements of, a product may change in unexpected ways while it is in service. Products incapable of meetings these new requirements lose value. This reduction in value diminishes the user experience or product replacement occurs. Previous studies in the literature have investigated principles of design flexibility, modularity, excess, and margins as they apply to the redesign of an existing product as a means of keeping it in service. Design tools, such as Design Structure Matrices (DSMs) and change propagation techniques, give the engineer insight into managing the redesign process. However, there is limited data about perceptions of the redesign process and the challenges that arise. This paper explores the redesign of a single system with particular focus on the design objective, the utility offered by existing design tools, and the perception of excess. A pod-based coffee maker is redesigned as the pod carrying the coffee grounds has been discontinued. Three conceptual redesign solutions are generated by the co-author who also wrote reflections discussing her perspectives and experiences throughout the redesign process. The reflections from the co-author highlight questions about how designers identify valuable system attributes when redesigning a system (already in service) to meet new requirements. The co-authorâ€™s experience also provides evidence that (1) there is a relationship between design tool and redesign strategy, (2) that it was easier to conceptualize redesign work with excess around functional requirements than spatial interfaces, and (3) that the perceived amount of excess in a system influences the chosen design strategy.
