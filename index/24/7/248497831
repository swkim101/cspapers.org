Mapillary Vistas pre-training. Our experiment with ResNet-38 on the Cityscapes Test set involves pre-training on Mapillary Vistas. In particular, we adopt the same data loading protocol (random mirror, scaling and color jittering), crop size (1024 × 1024) and base learning rate (3 × 10−7) as training on Cityscapes. Since Mapillary Vistas in general contains larger images than Cityscapes, we adjust the scale factor to be within [0.5, 1.5] instead of [0.5, 2.0]. The total number of training iterations is set to 500K.
