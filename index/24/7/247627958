Recently, significant progress has been made on image denoising with strong supervision from large-scale datasets. However, obtaining well-aligned noisy-clean training image pairs for each specific scenario is complicated and costly in practice. Consequently, applying a conventional supervised denoising network on in-the-wild noisy inputs is not straightforward. Although several studies have challenged this problem without strong supervision, they rely on less practical assumptions and cannot be applied to practical situations directly. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel and powerful self-supervised denoising method called CVF-SID based on a Cyclic multi-Variate Function (CVF) module and a self-supervised image disentangling (SID) framework. The CVF module can output multiple decomposed variables of the input and take a combination of the outputs back as an input in a cyclic manner. Our CVF-SID can disentangle a clean image and noise maps from the input by leveraging various self-supervised loss terms. Unlike several methods that only consider the signal-independent noise models, we also deal with signal-dependent noise components for real-world applications. Furthermore, we do not rely on any prior assumptions about the underlying noise distribution, making CVF-SID more generalizable toward realistic noise. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CVF-SID achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised image denoising performance and is comparable to other existing approaches.
