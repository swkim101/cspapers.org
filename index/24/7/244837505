We study a cache network under arbitrary adversarial request arrivals. We propose a distributed online policy based on the online tabular greedy algorithm. Our distributed policy achieves sublinear (1-1/e)-regret, also in the case when update costs cannot be neglected. Numerical evaluation over several topologies supports our theoretical results and demonstrates that our algorithm outperforms state-of-art online cache algorithms.
