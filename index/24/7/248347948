Organizations that focus on maximizing satisfaction, a consistent and seamless experience throughout the entire customer journey are the ones who dominate the market. Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a widely accepted metric to measure the customer experience, and the most common way to calculate it to date is by conducting a survey. But this comes with a bottleneck. The whole process can be costly, low-sample, responder-biased, and issues could be limited to the questionnaire used for the survey. We have devised a mechanism to approximate it implicitly from the mentions extracted from the four major social media platforms - Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Our Data Cleaning pipeline discards the viral and promotional content (from brands, sellers, marketplaces, or public figures), and the Machine Learning pipeline captures the different customer journey nodes specific to e-commerce (like discovery, delivery, pricing) with their appropriate sentiment. Since the framework is generic and relies only on publicly available social media data, any organization can estimate its NPS after making suitable adjustments depending on the industry and geography. Our NPS model has a Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.9%, Pearson correlation of 79%, and enables us to understand the actual drivers at the weekly level.
