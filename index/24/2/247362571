Cereal grains are a vital part of human diets and are important commodities for people's livelihood and international trade. Grain Appearance Inspection (GAI) serves as one of the crucial steps for the determination of grain quality and grain stratification for proper circulation, storage and food processing, etc. GAI is routinely performed manually by qualified inspectors with the aid of some hand tools. Automated GAI has the benefit of greatly assisting inspectors with their jobs but has been limited due to the lack of datasets and clear definitions of the tasks. In this paper we formulate GAI as three ubiquitous computer vision tasks: fine-grained recognition, domain adaptation and out-of-distribution recognition. We present a large-scale and publicly available cereal grains dataset called GrainSpace. Specifically, we construct three types of device prototypes for data acquisition, and a total of 5.25 million images determined by professional inspectors. The grain samples including wheat, maize and rice are collected from five countries and more than 30 regions. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark based on semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning techniques. To the best of our knowledge, GrainSpace is the first publicly released dataset for cereal grain inspection, https://github.com/hellodfan/GrainSpace.
