Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) operating in unlicensed frequency bands or employing battery-less devices, require a Duty Cycle (DC) limit to ensure fair spectrum access or limit energy consumption. However, in multi-hop networks, it is up to the network protocol to ensure that all devices comply with such DC restrictions. We therefore developed a distributed DC adherence algorithm that limits the DC of all devices without introducing any additional packet overhead. This paper presents a brief description of the algorithm and evaluates its performance through simulation. Our results show that the algorithm can limit the DC of all devices to ensure no devices must switch off. Our algorithm therefore provides a solution for WSNs where nodes must operate below a DC limit.
