Computation on sparse data is becoming increasingly important for many applications. Recent sparse computation accelerators are designed for specific algorithm/application, making them inflexible with software optimizations. This paper proposes SparseCore, the first general-purpose processor extension for sparse computation that can flexibly accelerate complex code patterns and fast-evolving algorithms. We extend the instruction set architecture (ISA) to make stream or sparse vector first-class citizens, and develop efficient architectural components to support the stream ISA. The novel ISA extension intrinsically operates on streams, realizing both efficient data movement and computation. The simulation results show that SparseCore achieves significant speedups for sparse tensor computation and graph pattern computation.
