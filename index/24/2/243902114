FPGAs are being virtualized to improve resource utilization in data centers. Memory access performance is essential to FPGA hypervisors for shared-memory FPGA platform, where accelerators access memory spontaneously. DMA remapping with IOMMU provides a handy solution; however, fixed IOMMU can not benefit from the reconfigurability of FPGAs. In this work, we propose MEGATRON, a hybrid address translation service consisting of a hardware TLB and a software page table walker. By integrating MEGATRON into an existing FPGA hypervisor, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of link performance of a multi-link CPU-FPGA platform, and demonstrate the competitiveness of the customizable translation service.
