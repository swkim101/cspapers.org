Backscattering tags transmit passively without an on-board active radio transmitter. Almost all present-day backscatter systems, however, rely on active radio receivers. This presents a significant scalability, power and cost challenge for backscatter systems. To overcome this barrier, recent research has empowered these passive tags with the ability to reliably receive backscatter signals from other tags. This forms the building block of passive networks wherein tags talk to each other without an active radio on either the transmit or receive side. For wider functionality, accurate localization of such tags is critical. All known backscatter tag localization techniques rely on active receivers for measuring and characterizing the received signal. As a result, they cannot be directly applied to passive tag-to-tag networks. This paper overcomes the gap by developing a localization technique for such passive networks based on a novel method for phase-based ranging in passive receivers. This method allows pairs of passive tags to collaboratively determine the inter-tag channel phase while effectively minimizing the effects of multipath and noise in the surrounding environment. Building on this, we develop a localization technique that benefits from large link diversity uniquely available in a passive tag-to-tag network. We evaluate the performance of our techniques with extensive micro-benchmarking experiments in an indoor environment using fabricated prototypes of tag hardware. We show that our phase-based ranging performs similar to active receivers, providing median 1D ranging error <1 cm and median localization error also <1 cm. Benefiting from the large-scale link diversity our localization technique outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques that use active receivers.
