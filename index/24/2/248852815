As state-of-the-art quantum computers are capable of running increasingly complex algorithms, the need for automated methods to design and test potential applications rises. Equivalence checking of quantum circuits is an important, yet hardly automated, task in the development of the quantum software stack. Recently, new methods have been proposed that tackle this problem from widely different perspectives. However, there is no established baseline on which to judge current and future progress in equivalence checking of quantum circuits. In order to close this gap, we conduct a detailed case study of two of the most promising equivalence checking methodologies---one based on decision diagrams and one based on the ZX-calculus---and compare their strengths and weaknesses.
