As intelligence is moving from data centers to the edges, intelligent edge devices such as smartphones, drones, robots, and smart IoT devices are equipped with the capability to altogether train a deep learning model on the devices from the data collected by themselves. Despite its considerable value, the key bottleneck of making on-device distributed training practically useful in real-world deployments is that they consume a significant amount of training time under wireless networks with constrained bandwidth. To tackle this critical bottleneck, we present Mercury, an importance sampling-based framework that enhances the training efficiency of on-device distributed training without compromising the accuracies of the trained models. The key idea behind the design of Mercury is to focus on samples that provide more important information in each training iteration. In doing this, the training efficiency of each iteration is improved. As such, the total number of iterations can be considerably reduced so as to speed up the overall training process. We implemented Mercury and deployed it on a self-developed testbed. We demonstrate its effectiveness and show that Mercury consistently outperforms two status quo frameworks on six commonly used datasets across tasks in image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
