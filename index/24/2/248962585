Detecting cyberbullying from memes is highly challenging, because of the presence of the implicit affective content which is also often sarcastic, and multi-modality (image + text). The current work is the first attempt, to the best of our knowledge, in investigating the role of sentiment, emotion and sarcasm in identifying cyberbullying from multi-modal memes in a code-mixed language setting. As a contribution, we have created a benchmark multi-modal meme dataset called MultiBully annotated with bully, sentiment, emotion and sarcasm labels collected from open-source Twitter and Reddit platforms. Moreover, the severity of the cyberbullying posts is also investigated by adding a harmfulness score to each of the memes. The created dataset consists of two modalities, text and image. Most of the texts in our dataset are in code-mixed form, which captures the seamless transitions between languages for multilingual users. Two different multimodal multitask frameworks (BERT+ResNET-Feedback and CLIP-CentralNet) have been proposed for cyberbullying detection (CD), the three auxiliary tasks being sentiment analysis (SA), emotion recognition (ER) and sarcasm detection (SAR). Experimental results indicate that compared to uni-modal and single-task variants, the proposed frameworks improve the performance of the main task, i.e., CD, by 3.18% and 3.10% in terms of accuracy and F1 score, respectively.
