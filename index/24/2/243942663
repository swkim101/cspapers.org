It has been established that interfacing Terahertz (THz) band signals with protein molecules excites their resonant modes. In this work, we develop a model that bridges the mechanical system of proteins, modeled as harmonic oscillators, and the probability of protein conformal changes. We deploy the Langevin stochastic equation under the influence of an external force to capture the protein dynamics. The average energy driving the protein to alter its conformation is derived and used to determine the probability of protein folding. Our numerical analysis results show that the energy transferred from the nanoantenna and stored in the protein is capable of inducing a conformal change in the protein. This illustrates the power of THz waves in enabling protein interactions with high selectivity. It also sheds light on various opportunities that impact applications concerning targeted therapy, biosensing as well as disease control and prevention.
