We consider the classical Minimum Crossing Number problem: given an n-vertex graph G, compute a drawing of G in the plane, while minimizing the number of crossings between the images of its edges. This is a fundamental and extensively studied problem, whose approximability status is widely open. In all currently known approximation algorithms, the approximation factor depends polynomially on Δ – the maximum vertex degree in G. The best current approximation algorithm achieves an O(n1/2−· (Δ·logn))-approximation, for a small fixed constant є, while the best negative result is APX-hardness, leaving a large gap in our understanding of this basic problem. In this paper we design a randomized O(2O((logn)7/8loglogn)·(Δ))-approximation algorithm for Minimum Crossing Number. This is the first approximation algorithm for the problem that achieves a subpolynomial in n approximation factor (albeit only in graphs whose maximum vertex degree is subpolynomial in n). In order to achieve this approximation factor, we design a new algorithm for a closely related problem called Crossing Number with Rotation System, in which, for every vertex v∈ V(G), the circular ordering, in which the images of the edges incident to v must enter the image of v in the drawing is fixed as part of input. Combining this result with the recent reduction of [Chuzhoy, Mahabadi, Tan ’20] immediately yields the improved approximation algorithm for Minimum Crossing Number.
