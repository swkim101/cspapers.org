It is our pleasure to welcome the International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) to Los Angeles for the first time in its 45-year history! Many of you may know LA for being the entertainment capital of the world. But behind what drives the next generation of entertainment is new innovations from the computing industry, including from the more than 500 tech start-ups and leading companies located in the west side of the LA metropolitan area in what is becoming known as Silicon Beach. It is therefore a fitting tribute to our great city to be the site of ISCAâ€™18, particularly this year as we are very honored to host the 2017 ACM Turing Award Lecture by John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson.
