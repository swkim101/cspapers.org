The study aims to develop a measurement system for acquiring ultrasonic transmission tomography data. Along building the automated measurement system we test the algorithm which use incorporation of image compression into the process of reconstruction what speed up computation and simplifies regularization of the solution to the inverse problem of tomography. The reconstructive algorithm used in transmission tomography is based on the Discrete Cosine Transformation method. The algorithm applies image compression techniques for each block of the image separately, according to the conducted test such a solution seems to be much more robust than classical methods used for ultrasonic tomography. Presented work is a part of the research that aim for applying ultrasonic technology for analyse and visualise technological processes in distributed systems and in the next step for development of wearable equipment for monitoring in medicine.
