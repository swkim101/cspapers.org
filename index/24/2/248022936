Online tracking has garnered signiﬁcant attention due to the privacy risk it poses to users. Among the various approaches, techniques that identify which extensions are installed in a browser can be used for ﬁngerprinting browsers and tracking users, but also for inferring personal and sensitive user data. While preventing certain ﬁngerprinting techniques is relatively simple, mitigating behavior-based extension-ﬁngerprinting poses a signiﬁcant challenge as it relies on hiding actions that stem from an extension’s functionality. To that end, we introduce the conceptof DOM RealityShifting ,wherebywe splitthe reality users experience while browsing from the reality that webpages can observe. To demonstrate our approach we de-velop Simulacrum, a prototype extension that implements our defense through a targeted instrumentation of core Web API interfaces. Despite being conceptually straightforward, our implementation highlights the technical challenges posed by the complex and often idiosyncratic nature and behavior of web applications, modern browsers, and the JavaScript language. We experimentally evaluate our system against a state-of-the-art DOM-based extension ﬁngerprinting system and ﬁnd that Simulacrum readily protects 95.37% of susceptible extensions. We then identify trivial modiﬁcations to extensions that enable our defense for the majority of the remaining extensions. To facilitate additional research and protect users from privacy-invasive behaviors we will open-source our system.
