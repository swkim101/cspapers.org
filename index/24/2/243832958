We show a flow-augmentation algorithm in directed graphs: There exists a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that, given a directed graph G, two integers s,t ∈ V(G), and an integer k, adds (randomly) to G a number of arcs such that for every minimal st-cut Z in G of size at most k, with probability 2−poly(k) the set Z becomes a minimum st-cut in the resulting graph. The directed flow-augmentation tool allows us to prove (randomized) fixed-parameter tractability of a number of problems parameterized by the cardinality of the deletion set, whose parameterized complexity status was repeatedly posed as open problems: Chain SAT, defined by Chitnis, Egri, and Marx [ESA’13, Algorithmica’17], a number of weighted variants of classic directed cut problems, such as Weighted st-Cut, Weighted Directed Feedback Vertex Set, or Weighted Almost 2-SAT. By proving that Chain SAT is (randomized) FPT, we confirm a conjecture of Chitnis, Egri, and Marx that, for any graph H, if the List H-Coloring problem is polynomial-time solvable, then the corresponding vertex-deletion problem is fixed-parameter tractable (with the remark that our algorithms are randomized).
