In the pharmaceutical industry, the maintenance of production machines must be audited by the regulator. In this context, the problem of predictive maintenance is not when to maintain a machine, but what parts to maintain at a given point in time. The focus shifts from the entire machine to its component parts and prediction becomes a classification problem. In this paper, we focus on rolling-elements bearings and we propose a framework for predicting their degradation stages automatically. Our main contribution is a k-means bearing lifetime segmentation method based on high-frequency bearing vibration signal embedded in a latent low-dimensional subspace using an AutoEncoder. Given high-frequency vibration data, our framework generates a labeled dataset that is used to train a supervised model for bearing degradation stage detection. Our experimental results, based on the publicly available FEMTO Bearing run-to-failure dataset, show that our framework is scalable and that it provides reliable and actionable predictions for a range of different bearings.
