We present Bayesian Team Imitation Learner (BTIL), an imitation learning algorithm to model the behavior of teams performing sequential tasks in Markovian domains. In contrast to existing multi-agent imitation learning techniques, BTIL explicitly models and infers the time-varying mental states of team members, thereby enabling learning of decentralized team policies from demonstrations of suboptimal teamwork. Further, to allow for sample- and label-efficient policy learning from small datasets, BTIL employs a Bayesian perspective and is capable of learning from semi-supervised demonstrations. We demonstrate and benchmark the performance of BTIL on synthetic multi-agent tasks as well as a novel dataset of human-agent teamwork. Our experiments show that BTIL can successfully learn team policies from demonstrations despite the influence of team members' (time-varying and potentially misaligned) mental states on their behavior.
