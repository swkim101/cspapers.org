Teleoperation platforms often require the user to be situated at a fixed location to both visualize and control the movement of the robot and thus do not provide the operator with much mobility. One example is in existing robotic surgery solutions that require the surgeons to be away from the patient, attached to consoles where their heads must be fixed and their arms can only move in a limited space. This creates a barrier between physicians and patients that does not exist in normal surgery. To address this issue, we propose a mobile telesurgery solution where the surgeons are no longer mechanically limited to control consoles and are able to teleoperate the robots from the patient bedside, using their arms equipped with wireless sensors and viewing the endoscope video via optical see-through head-mounted displays (HMDs). We evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of our user interaction method compared to a standard surgical robotic manipulator via two tasks with different levels of required dexterity. The results indicate that with sufficient training our proposed platform can attain similar efficiency while providing added mobility for the operator.
