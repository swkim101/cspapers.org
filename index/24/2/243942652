Tiny energy harvesting battery-less devices present a promising alternative to battery-powered devices for a sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) vision. The use of small capacitors as energy storage, along with a dynamic and unpredictable harvesting environment, leads these devices to exhibit intermittent on-off behavior. As the traditional computing models cannot handle this behavior, in this demo we present and demonstrate an energy-aware task scheduler for battery-less IoT devices based on task dependencies and priorities, which can intelligently schedule the application tasks avoiding power failures.
