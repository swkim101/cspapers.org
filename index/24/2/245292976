In this paper, we present a solution for simultaneous handling of large components with industrial robots performing synchronized motions with an AGV in flexible flow assembly. For this purpose, we implement an Extended Kalman Filter with a global localization system to track an AGV and multiple manipulators. We propose a model-predictive controller for force compliance and trajectory tracking in multi-robot cooperative, decentralized, and fast manipulation tasks. In order to show the effectiveness of our system, we assemble a truck windshield using two industrial robots and an AGV in motion. In our experiments, we reliably achieve assembly tolerances of 1.5mm at AGV velocities up to $400\frac{{{\text{mm}}}}{{\text{s}}}$. The presented system makes flexible assembly systems with AGVs and freely reconfigurable manipulators possible. It enables the automation of high variant, low volume, large size assembly tasks such as aircraft, truck or steel beam assembly, which are mostly manual processes at present.
