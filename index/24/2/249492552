The supramolecular aggregation processes occurring on metallic (aluminum and gold) surfaces in aqueous solutions of bovine serum albumin (BSA) during drying were studied using advanced scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The possible mechanism for the formation of amazing intricate fractal structures on metallic surfaces was proposed based on the analysis of SEM images, size distribution diagrams and EDX-scanning element distribution maps.
