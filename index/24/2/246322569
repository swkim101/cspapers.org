Biosample analysis often requires the purification, separation, or fractionation of a biofluid prior to transport to the biosensor. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is a size-based microfluidic separation technique that shows promise for biosample preparation. Recently, high-throughput DLD separation has been demonstrated with airfoil-shaped pillars at higher flow rates, but this also changes separation dynamics as the Reynolds number (Re) increases. In this work, the particle trajectories in the airfoil DLD with two different angle-of-attacks (AoAs) were studied at a range of Re with alterations of fluid viscosity to mimic biological fluids. Previous studies have found that the critical diameter (Dc) decreases as Re climes. We demonstrated that variations of the fluid viscosity do not alter the separation dynamics if the Re is kept constant. As the associated Re of the flow increases, the Dc decreases regardless of viscosity. The negative AoA with an airfoil DLD pillar design provided the stronger Dc shift to negate pressure increases.
