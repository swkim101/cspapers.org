This paper aims to address the problem of pretraining for person re-identification (Re-ID) with noisy labels. To setup the pretraining task, we apply a simple online multi-object tracking system on raw videos of an existing un-labeled Re-ID dataset “LUPerson” and build the Noisy Labeled variant called “LUPerson-NL”. Since theses ID labels automatically derived from tracklets inevitably con-tain noises, we develop a large-scale Pre-training frame-work utilizing Noisy Labels (PNL), which consists of three learning modules: supervised Re-ID learning, prototype-based contrastive learning, and label-guided contrastive learning. In principle, joint learning of these three mod-ules not only clusters similar examples to one prototype, but also rectifies noisy labels based on the prototype as-signment. We demonstrate that learning directly from raw videos is a promising alternative for pre-training, which utilizes spatial and temporal correlations as weak super-vision. This simple pre-training task provides a scalable way to learn SOTA Re-ID representations from scratch on “LUPerson-NL” without bells and whistles. For example, by applying on the same supervised Re-ID method MGN, our pre-trained model improves the mAP over the unsu-pervised pre-training counterpart by 5.7%, 2.2%, 2.3% on CUHK03, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17 respectively. Under the small-scale or few-shot setting, the performance gain is even more significant, suggesting a better transferability of the learned representation.
