In this paper, we present a novel millimeter-wave antenna using the Grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW)-to- Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) transition. This high-gain and wideband antenna consists of four patches and each patch is fed by the SIW and a cross-shaped aperture. The antenna operates from 27.1 GHz to 31.9 GHz (S11 â‰¤ -10dB) with a peak gain of 10 dBi, and an efficiency of 89%.
