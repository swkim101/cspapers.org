Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm, in which multiple clients collaboratively train neural networks without centralizing their local data, and hence preserve data privacy. However, real-world FL applications usually encounter challenges arising from distribution shifts across the local datasets of individual clients. These shifts may drift the global model aggregation or result in convergence to deflected local optimum. While existing efforts have addressed distribution shifts in the label space, an equally important challenge remains relatively unexplored. This challenge involves situations where the local data of different clients indicate identical label distributions but exhibit divergent feature distributions. This issue can significantly impact the global model performance in the FL framework. In this work, we propose Federated Representation Augmentation (FRAug) to resolve this practical and challenging problem. FRAug optimizes a shared embedding generator to capture client consensus. Its output synthetic embeddings are transformed into client-specific by a locally optimized RTNet to augment the training space of each client. Our empirical evaluation on three public benchmarks and a real-world medical dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, which substantially outperforms the current state-of-the-art FL methods for feature distribution shifts, including PartialFed and FedBN.
