In this work,1 we study the multi-scale expert problem, where the rewards of different experts vary in different reward ranges. The performance of existing algorithms for the multi-scale expert problem degrades linearly proportional to the maximum reward range of any expert or the best expert and does not capture the non-uniform heterogeneity in the reward ranges among experts. In this work, we propose learning algorithms that construct a hierarchical tree structure based on the heterogeneity of the reward range of experts and then determine differentiated learning rates based on the reward upper bounds and cumulative empirical feedback over time. We then characterize the regret of the proposed algorithms as a function of non-uniform reward ranges and show that their regrets outperform prior algorithms when the rewards of experts exhibit non-uniform heterogeneity in different ranges. Last, our numerical experiments verify our algorithms' efficiency compared to previous algorithms.
