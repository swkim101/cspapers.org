Distracted driving has become a serious problem for traffic safety with the increasing number of fatalities every year. Existing systems have shortcomings of requiring additional hardware or vehicle motion data separation. Moreover, the excessive use of motion sensors can cause fast battery drain which is impractical for everyday use. In this work, we present a wearable-based distracted driving detection system that leverages Bluetooth. The proposed system exploits already in-vehicle BLE compatible devices to track the driver's hand position and infer potential unsafe driving behaviors. Preliminary study shows our system can achieve over 95% detection accuracy for various distracted driving behaviors.
