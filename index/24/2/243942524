With the dramatically increasing video streaming in the total network traffic, it is critical to develop effective algorithms to ensure the quality of content delivery service. Adaptive bitrate (ABR) control is the most essential technique which determines the proper bitrate to be chosen based on network conditions, thus realize high-quality video streaming. In this paper, a novel ABR strategy is proposed based on Ising machine by using the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) method and Digital Annealer (DA) for the first time. The proposed method is evaluated by simulation with the real-world measured throughput and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Experiment results show that the proposed QUBO-based method can outperform the existing methods, which demonstrating the superior of the proposed QUBO-based method.
