While relying on energy harvesting to power Internet of Things (IoT) devices eliminates the maintenance burden of battery replacement, energy generation fluctuation constitutes a major source of uncertainty to design reliable self-powered IoT devices. To characterize spatial-temporal variability of energy harvesting, data acquisition campaigns are needed across the range of potential harvesting sources. In this work we present a dataset to characterize thermal energy sources in residential settings by measuring thermoelectric generator (TEG) operating conditions over 16 deployment locations for periods ranging from 19 to 53 days. We present our easy-to-use thermal energy measurement platform built from off-the-shelf component modules and a custom TEG interface circuit. We demonstrate how the collected measurements can inform the design of energy harvesting IoT devices by deriving the TEG's maximum power output and estimating the available energy at each harvesting location.
