\beginabstract \AcpDS are evaluated depending on their type and purpose. Two categories are often distinguished: \beginenumerate* \item \acpTDS, which are typically evaluated on utility, i.e., their ability to complete a specified task, and \item open-domain chat-bots, which are evaluated on the user experience, i.e., based on their ability to engage a person. \endenumerate* What is the influence of user experience on the user satisfaction rating of \acpTDS as opposed to, or in addition to, utility ? We collect data by providing an additional annotation layer for dialogues sampled from the ReDial dataset, a widely used conversational recommendation dataset. Unlike prior work, we annotate the sampled dialogues at both the turn and dialogue level on six dialogue aspects: relevance, interestingness, understanding, task completion, efficiency, and interest arousal. The annotations allow us to study how different dialogue aspects influence user satisfaction. We introduce a comprehensive set of user experience aspects derived from the annotators' open comments that can influence users' overall impression. We find that the concept of satisfaction varies across annotators and dialogues, and show that a relevant turn is significant for some annotators, while for others, an interesting turn is all they need. Our analysis indicates that the proposed user experience aspects provide a fine-grained analysis of user satisfaction that is not captured by a monolithic overall human rating. \endabstract
