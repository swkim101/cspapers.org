Problems with doping in nanoscale devices or low temperature applications are widely known. Our approach to replace the degenerate doping in source/drain (S/D)-contacts is silicon nitride interface engineering. We measured Schottky diodes and MOSFETs with very thin silicon nitride layers in between silicon and metal. Al/SiN/p-Si diodes show Fermi level depinning with increasing SiN thickness. The diode fabricated with rapid thermal nitridation at 900 ∘C reaches the theoretical value of the Schottky barrier to the conduction band ΦSB,n=0.2 eV. As a result, the contact resistivity decreases and the ambipolar behavior can be suppressed. Schottky barrier MOSFETs with depinned S/D-contacts consisting of a thin silicon nitride layer and contact metals with different work functions are fabricated to demonstrate unipolar behavior. We presented n-type behavior with Al and p-type behavior with Co on samples which only distinguish by the contact metal. Thus, the thermally grown SiN layers are a useful method suppress Fermi level pinning and enable reconfigurable contacts by choosing an appropriate metal.
