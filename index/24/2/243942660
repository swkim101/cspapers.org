Playing is an essential way for preschoolers to learn. There are three types of games for preschoolers: functional play, constructive play, and symbolic play. However, existing works/games can only work for one specific type of children's play. Therefore, we designed and implemented an extensible children's game framework based on Augmented Reality building blocks. We implement an AR prototype from scratch that achieves up to 8 blocks with 81% detection rate and overhead of 21ms (46 FPS) on average.
