Barrel distortion rectification aims at removing the radial distortion in a distorted image captured by a wide-angle lens. Previous deep learning methods mainly solve this problem by learning the implicit distortion parameters or the nonlinear rectified mapping function in a direct manner. However, this type of manner results in an indistinct learning process of rectification and thus limits the deep perception of distortion. In this paper, inspired by the curriculum learning, we analyze the barrel distortion rectification task in a progressive and meaningful manner. By considering the relationship among different construction levels in an image, we design a multi-level curriculum that disassembles the rectification task into three levels, structure recovery, semantics embedding, and texture rendering. With the guidance of the curriculum that corresponds to the construction of images, the proposed hierarchical architecture enables a progressive rectification and achieves more accurate results. Moreover, we present a novel distortion-aware pre-training strategy to facilitate the initial learning of neural networks, promoting the model to converge faster and better. Experimental results on the synthesized and real-world distorted image datasets show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other learning methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
