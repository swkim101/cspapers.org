We are now witnessing a trend of realizing full-screen on electronic devices such as smartphones to maximize their screen-to-body ratio for a better user experience. Thus the bezel/narrow-bezel on today's devices to host various line-of-sight sensors would disappear. This trend not only is forcing sensors like the front cameras to be placed under the screen of devices, but also will challenge the deployment of the emerging Visible Light Communication (VLC) technology, a paradigm for the next-generation wireless communication. In this work, we propose the concept of through-screen VLC with photosensors placed under Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) screen. Though being transparent, an OLED screen greatly attenuates the intensity of passing-through light, degrading the efficiency of intensity-based VLC systems. In this paper, we instead exploit the color domain to build SpiderWeb, a through-screen VLC system. For the first time, we observe that an OLED screen introduces a color-pulling effect at photosensors, affecting the decoding of color-based VLC signals. Motivated by this observation and by the structure of spider's web, we design the SWebCSK Color-Shift Keying modulation scheme and a slope-based demodulation method, which can eliminate the color-pulling effect. We prototype SpiderWeb with off-the-shelf hardware and evaluate its performance thoroughly under various scenarios. The results show that compared to existing solutions, our solutions can reduce the bit error rate by two orders of magnitude and can achieve a 3.4x data rate.
