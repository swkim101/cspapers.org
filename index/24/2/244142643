This article presents a multi-standard system for geolocation applications. The multi-standard Semtech LR1110 components are integrated into a multiple antenna platform. For indoor scenarios, the proposed terminal can be positioned by WiFi Passive scanning technique. For outdoor methods, GNSS positioning is used. Moreover, this system supports LoRa communication to send the data to the server for different tracking or positioning applications. The board is packaged on an IP65 enclosure with an overall dimension of 90mm x 90mm x 40mm. With the average power consumption down to 26.6uA, this proposal is suitable for the low-power wide-area network (LPWAN).
