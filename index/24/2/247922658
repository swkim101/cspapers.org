A mixed list of ads and organic items is usually displayed in feed and how to allocate the limited slots to maximize the overall revenue is a key problem. Meanwhile, user behavior modeling is essential in recommendation and advertising (e.g., CTR prediction and ads allocation). Most previous works only model point-level positive feedback (i.e., click), which neglect the page-level information of feedback and other types of feedback. To this end, we propose Deep Page-level Interest Network (DPIN) to model the page-level user preference and exploit multiple types of feedback. Specifically, we introduce four different types of page-level feedback, and capture user preference for item arrangement under different receptive fields through the multi-channel interaction module. Through extensive offline and online experiments on Meituan food delivery platform, we demonstrate that DPIN can effectively model the page-level user preference and increase the revenue.
