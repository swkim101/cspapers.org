Equivariance has been a long-standing concern in various fields ranging from computer vision to physical modeling. Most previous methods struggle with generality, simplicity, and expressiveness â€” some are designed ad hoc for specific data types, some are too complex to be accessible, and some sacrifice flexible transformations. In this work, we propose a novel and simple framework to achieve equivariance for point cloud analysis based on the message passing (graph neural network) scheme. We find the equivariant property could be obtained by introducing an orientation for each point to decouple the relative position for each point from the global pose of the entire point cloud. Therefore, we extend current message passing networks with a module that learns orientations for each point. Before aggregating information from the neighbors of a point, the networks transforms the neighbors' coordinates based on the point's learned orientations. We provide formal proofs to show the equivariance of the proposed framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed method is competitive on both point cloud analysis and physical modeling tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/luost26/Equivariant-OrientedMP.
