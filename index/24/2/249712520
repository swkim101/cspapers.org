We present a system for realistic one-shot mesh-based human head avatars creation, ROME for short. Using a single photograph, our model estimates a person-specific head mesh and the associated neural texture, which encodes both local photometric and geometric details. The resulting avatars are rigged and can be rendered using a neural network, which is trained alongside the mesh and texture estimators on a dataset of in-the-wild videos. In the experiments, we observe that our system performs competitively both in terms of head geometry recovery and the quality of renders, especially for the cross-person reenactment.
