The phenomenon of retroactivity describes the impact that a downstream system has on an upstream one when they are connected. From a molecular communication point of view, the effect of the signal that is back propagated between the two systems leads to a reduction of the correct amount of information that can be exchanged between the input and the output of the upstream system. In this work we propose a solution to mitigate such a negative effect. Specifically, a retroactivity suppressor is introduced, which role is that of binding to the downstream system in place of the output of the primary upstream system.
