Feature extraction or localization based on the fiducial marker could fail due to motion blur in real-world robotic applications. To solve this problem, a lightweight generative adversarial network, named Ghost-DeblurGAN, for real-time motion deblurring is developed in this paper. Furthermore, on account that there is no existing deblurring benchmark for such task, a new large-scale dataset, York-Tag, is proposed that provides pairs of sharp/blurred images containing fiducial markers. With the proposed model trained and tested on YorkTag, it is demonstrated that when applied along with fiducial marker systems to motion-blurred images, Ghost-DeblurGAN improves the marker detection significantly.
