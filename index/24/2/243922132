The brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) gains attention as a light-weight and extremely parallelizable learning solution alternative to deep neural networks. Prior research shows the effectiveness of HDC-based learning on less powerful systems such as edge computing devices. However, the many-class classification problem is beyond the focus of mainstream HDC research; the existing HDC would not provide sufficient quality and efficiency due to its coarse-grained training. In this paper, we propose an efficient many-class learning framework, called CascadeHD, which identifies latent high-dimensional patterns of many classes holistically while learning a hierarchical inference structure using a novel meta-learning algorithm for high efficiency. Our evaluation conducted on the NVIDIA Jetson device family shows that CascadeHD improves the accuracy for many-class classification by up to 18% while achieving 32% speedup compared to the existing HDC.
