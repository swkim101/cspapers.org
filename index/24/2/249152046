We consider the mobile robot path planning problem for a class of recurrent reachability objectives. These objectives are parameterized by the expected time needed to visit one position from another, the expected square of this time, and also the frequency of moves between two neighboring locations. We design an efficient strategy synthesis algorithm for recurrent reachability objectives and demonstrate its functionality on non-trivial instances.
