Strength training is essential for both physical and mental well-being. Muscular mass and strength gain can help with weight loss, balance improvement, and fall prevention. The neuromuscular connection, or mind-muscle connection, is critical for improving strength training performance. However, many fitness trackers and applications are missing a feature that allows users to track their neuromuscular workout performance. The goal is to immerse the user experience while keeping the cost and size of the healthcare device to a minimum. A wearable EEG hairband and EMG shirt are outfitted with dry and non-invasive bio-signal detecting that securely attaches to the body's surface during exercise. Participants in our study are exposed to five upper-limb free-weight exercises. The result shows that low-intensity exercise can increase upper-limp muscle contraction by over 30%, and individuals with mental effort have an average precision of 81%.
