We develop a conceptually simple, flexible, and effective framework (named T-Net) for two-view correspondence learning. Given a set of putative correspondences, we reject outliers and regress the relative pose encoded by the essential matrix, by an end-to-end framework, which is consisted of two novel structures: "−" structure and "|" structure. " − " structure adopts an iterative strategy to learn correspondence features. "|" structure integrates all the features of the iterations and outputs the correspondence weight. In addition, we introduce Permutation-Equivariant Context Squeeze-and-Excitation module, an adapted version of SE module, to process sparse correspondences in a permutation-equivariant way and capture both global and channel-wise contextual information. Extensive experiments on outdoor and indoor scenes show that the proposed T-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. On outdoor scenes (YFCC100M dataset), T-Net achieves an mAP of 52.28%, a 34.22% precision increase from the best-published result (38.95%). On indoor scenes (SUN3D dataset), T-Net (19.71%) obtains a 21.82% precision increase from the best-published result (16.18%). Source code: https://github.com/x-gb/T-Net.
