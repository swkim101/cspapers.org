This paper will suggest solutions to minimize the total cost for lot sizing problem with capacitated one warehouse multi retailers with particulates matters emissions constraint , We will show that this problem is NP-hard. In this present study, We will provide the design of a supply chain consisting of a production company with a central distributor and variable capacity and product issued several retailers. We will develop binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm. The improved BPSO algorithm will test on a set of instances .Comparative experiments will be conducted by the CPLEX and A Binary Particle Swarm Optimization; We will indicate BPSO is efficient on finding high qualities solutions for the tested instances. Besides, the results will show that the decrease of the upper limit emissions increases the amount produced, and vice versa. In addition, this decrease or increase affects the total cost.
