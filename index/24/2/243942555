Due to the pervasiveness of Interconnected devices, large amounts of heterogeneous data types are being continuously collected. Regardless of the benefits that come from sharing data, exposing sensitive and private information arises serious privacy concerns. To prevent unwanted disclosures and, hence, to protect users' privacy, several privacy-preserving mechanisms have been proposed. However, the data heterogeneity and the inherent correlations among the different data types have been disregarded when developing such mechanisms. Our goal is to develop privacy-preserving mechanisms that are suitable for data heterogeneity and data correlation. These aspects will also be considered to develop mechanisms to achieve private learning.
