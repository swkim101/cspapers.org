This paper presents the results of research on the identification of moisture inside the walls of buildings with the use of non-invasive electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The novelty and contribution of this research is the development of an original algorithmic method to solve the ill posedness, inverse problem. Since the new algorithm optimizes the method for each pixel of the tomographic image, taking into account a specific measurement vector, regardless of what and how many homogeneous methods are included in the algorithm, the obtained results are more accurate than those obtained with the use of homogeneous methods. As part of the research, prototypes of the EIT tomograph and electrodes for examining walls were designed and manufactured.
