Tiny spy cameras hidden in everyday objects are continuing to pose severe privacy threats to the general public as these cameras are often placed in sensitive locations such as hotels and restroom stalls. Commercially available "hidden camera detectors" have high false positive rates, and existing academic works detect (but cannot localize) only a subset of hidden cameras with wireless capabilities. We overcome these limitations by proposing LAPD, a novel hidden camera detection and localization system that leverages time-of-flight (ToF) sensors on commodity smartphones. LAPD is a smartphone app that detects hidden cameras in real-time by transmitting laser signals from the ToF sensor and searching for unique signatures representing reflections from hidden camera lenses. Using computer vision and machine learning techniques, LAPD achieves significantly higher hidden camera detection rates compared to the naked eye and hidden camera detectors.
