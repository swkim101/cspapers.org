We propose mmSleep, a millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signal based sleep posture monitoring system that can assist in tracking 3D location of body joints of a person during sleep. mmSleep overcomes the limitations of existing vision-based sleep monitoring and can work under low-light without being privacy-invasive. mmSleep uses a customized Convolutional Neural Network to learn diverse sleep postures, and our preliminary results show that mmSleep can consistently predict 3D joint locations with high accuracy.
