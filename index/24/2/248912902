This paper presents a stealthy triggering mechanism that reduces the dependencies of analog hardware Trojans on the frequent toggling of the software-controlled rare nets. The trigger to activate the Trojan is generated by using a glitch generation circuit and a clock signal, which increases the selectivity and feasibility of the trigger signal. The proposed trigger is able to evade the state-of-the-art run-time detection (R2D2) and Built-In Acceleration Structure (BIAS) schemes. Furthermore, the simulation results show that the proposed trigger circuit incurs a minimal overhead in side-channel footprints in terms of area (29 transistors), delay (less than 1ps in the clock cycle), and power (1Î¼W).
