Detecting pedestrians and their associated faces jointly is a challenging task. On one hand, body or face could be absent because of occlusion or non-frontal human pose. On the other hand, the association becomes difficult or even miss-leading in crowded scenes due to the lack of strong correlational evidence. This paper proposes Body-Face Joint (BFJ) detector, a novel framework for detecting bodies and their faces with accurate correspondance. We follow the classical multi-class detector design by detecting body and face in parallel but with two key contributions. First, we propose an Embedding Matching Loss (EML) to learn an associative embedding for matching body and face of the same person. Second, we introduce a novel concept, "head hook", to bridge the gap of matching body and faces spatially. With the new semantical and geometrical sources of information, BFJ greatly reduces the difficulty of detecting body and face in pairs. Since the problem is unexplored yet, we design a new metric named log-average miss matching rate (mMRâˆ’2) to evaluate the association performance and extend the CrowdHuman and CityPersons benchmarks by annotating each face box. Experiments show that our BFJ detector can maintain state-of-the-art performance in pedestrian detection on both one-stage and two-stage structures while greatly outperform various body-face association strategies.
