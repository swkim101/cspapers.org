Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) are an emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm marked by low-power and long-distance communication. Among them, LoRa is widely deployed for its unique characteristics and open-source technology. By adopting the Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, LoRa enables low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) communication. However, the standard demodulation method does not fully exploit the properties of chirp signals, thus yields a sub-optimal SNR threshold under which the decoding fails. Consequently, the communication range and energy consumption have to be compromised for robust transmission. This paper presents NELoRa, a neural-enhanced LoRa demodulation method, exploiting the feature abstraction ability of deep learning to support ultra-low SNR LoRa communication. Taking the spectrogram of both amplitude and phase as input, we first design a mask-enabled Deep Neural Network (DNN) filter that extracts multi-dimension features to capture clean chirp symbols. Second, we develop a spectrogram-based DNN decoder to decode these chirp symbols accurately. Finally, we propose a generic packet demodulation system by incorporating a method that generates high-quality chirp symbols from received signals. We implement and evaluate NELoRa on both indoor and campus-scale outdoor testbeds. The results show that NELoRa achieves 1.84-2.35 dB SNR gains and extends the battery life up to 272% (~0.38-1.51 years) in average for various LoRa configurations.
