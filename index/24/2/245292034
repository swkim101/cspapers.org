We develop an event-triggered control strategy for a weighted-unbalanced directed homogeneous robot network to reach a dynamic consensus in this work. We present some guarantees for synchronizing a robot network when all robots have access to the reference and when a limited number of robots have access. The proposed event-triggered control can reduce and avoid the periodic updating of the signals. Unlike some current control methods, we prove stability by making use of a logarithmic norm, which extends the possibilities of the control law to be applied to a wide range of directed graphs, in contrast to other works where the event-triggered control can be only implemented over strongly connected and weight-balanced digraphs. We test the performance of our algorithm by carrying out experiments both in simulation and in a real team of robots.
