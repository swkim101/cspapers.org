This paper presents a low-resolution infrared thermal dataset of people and thermal objects, such as a working laptop, in indoor environments. The dataset was collected by a far infrared thermal camera (32x24 pixels), which can capture the position and shape information of thermal objects without privacy issues that enable trustworthy computer vision applications. The dataset consists of 1770 thermal images with high-quality annotation collected from an indoor room with around 15Â°C. We implemented a privacy-preserving human detection method and trained a multiple object detection (MOD) model based on the dataset. The human detection method reaches 90.3% accuracy. On the other hand, the MOD model achieved 56.8% mean average precision (mAP). Researchers can implement interesting applications based on our dataset, for example, privacy-preserving people counting systems, occupancy estimation systems for smart buildings, and social distance detectors.
