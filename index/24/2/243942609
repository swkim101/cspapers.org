Advancements in IoT technology has provided great benefits, unfortunately, IoT adoption also causes an increase in the attack surface which intensify security risks. As a consequence, different types of IoT smart devices have become the main targets of many high-profile cyber-attacks. To safeguard against threats such as introduction of fake IoT nodes and identity theft, the IoT needs scalable and resilient device authentication management. Contrary to existing mechanisms for IoT device authentication which are unsuitable for huge number of devices, my research focuses on decentralised and distributed security mechanisms that will improve current protocols such as Oauth2, GDOI and GNAP.
