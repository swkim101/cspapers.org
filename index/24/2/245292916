This paper presents a robust monocular visual teach-and-repeat (VT&R) navigation system for long-term operation in outdoor environments. The approach leverages deep-learned descriptors to deal with the high illumination variance of the real world. In particular, a tailored self-supervised descriptor, DarkPoint, is proposed for autonomous navigation in outdoor environments. We seamlessly integrate the localisation with control, in which proportionalâ€“integral control is used to eliminate the visual error with the pitfall of the unknown depth. Consequently, our approach achieves day-to-night navigation using a single-experience map and is able to repeat complex and fast manoeuvres. To verify our approach, we performed a vast array of navigation experiments in various outdoor environments, where both navigation accuracy and robustness of the proposed system are investigated. The experimental results show that our approach is superior to the baseline method with regards to accuracy and robustness.
