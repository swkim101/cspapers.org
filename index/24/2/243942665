The ECCO-Box is a framework to establish connectivity of heterogeneous devices and sensors and distribute computing on the computing continuum dynamically at runtime. The goal of the dissertation is to design an architecture concept and develop a working prototype as a proof of concept. There are several requirements to the application which have to be fulfilled and will be evaluated in the form of an experimental study in the end. The main use case of the application will be processing of sensor data and analysis with artificial intelligence in an industrial environment.
