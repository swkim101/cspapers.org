Curriculum guidelines for Computer Science undergraduate courses from different institutions recognize computational thinking as a fundamental skill that all students must exercise in Computer Science courses. Unfortunately, the guidelines do not make it clear when and how these skills should be exercised. The literature recognizes the importance and relevance of computational thinking. However, there is still little evidence around which aspects should be considered to design activities to support the development of computational thinking. To address this problem, my research aims to investigate how to design and conduct activities to promote computational thinking in Computer Science courses. The expected result is to produce an approach to assist the design and conduct of computational thinking learning activities in Computer Science courses.
