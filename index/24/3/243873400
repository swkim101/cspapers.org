The increasing use of cloud and HPC systems put more pressure on the efficient utilization of hardware resources to keep costs low. Many dynamic concurrency throttling (DCT) techniques have successfully used to tune the number of executing threads to better balance a parallel application according to its available scalability. Similarly, boosting frequency strategies have been used to speed up the sequential partsâ€™ execution. Given that, we propose Poseidon, the first transparent and automatic approach that cooperatively exploits both techniques to rebalance OpenMP applications without any preprocessing, with no code transformation, recompilation, or OS modification.
