This paper presents a method of designing a positional stability control system for the Reaction Wheel Pendulum. The Reaction Wheel Pendulum is a single-input, multiple-output (SIMO) nonlinear system. The state feedback controller is designed for this system by choosing the distribution of the solutions of the above characteristic polynomial in the solution space. This original distribution is optimized by the BAT algorithm through the ITAE objective function. The results of the synthetic control law are proven through simulation results and comparison with other control laws. The effectiveness of the rule with optimized parameters is also shown in the results on the embedded control system.
