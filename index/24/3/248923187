In mixed-criticality systems (MCSs), less-critical tasks are often terminated to ensure the correct execution of high critical tasks. This strategy could however lead to safety hazards, and largely reduce system functionality due to the absence of the discarded tasks. To overcome this problem, we introduce a high resilience and approximated computing framework for MCS, i.e., HIART-MCS. HIART-MCS introduces a novel processor which supports approximation at the hardware level. Associated with this, we also introduce a new intermediate system mode which allows less-critical tasks to be executed with reduced precision instead of being directly dropped out. Corresponding to the HIART-MCS, we further present a new theoretical model and schedulability analysis providing a timing guarantee for the system, followed by optimisations of the mode switch strategy. As demonstrated in both the theoretical and practical evaluations, HIART-MCS effectively improves the survivability of less-critical tasks with limited sacrifice of the critical tasks and negligible extra overhead. It is notable that HIART-MCS is the first practical framework for imprecise MCSs.
