Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various processing tasks for processing graphs and complex network data. However, in recent studies, GNNs cannot effectively process the structural topology information and characteristics of the nodes in the graph, or even fail to deal with the information of the nodes. For optimal node embedding aggregation and delivery, this weakness may severely affect the ability of GNNs to classify nodes. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a novel node Mutual Information-based Graph Convolutional Network (MI-GCN) for semi-supervised node classification. First, we analyze the node information entropy that measures the importance of nodes in the complex network, and further define the node joint information entropy and node mutual information in the graph data. Then, we use node mutual information to strengthen the ability of GNNs to fuse node structural information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MI-GCN not only retains the advantages of the most advanced GNNs, but also improves the ability to fuse node structural information. MI-GCN can achieve superior performance on node classification compared to several baselines on real-world multi-type datasets, including fixed data splits and random data splits.
