Semantic patterns offine-grained objects are determined by subtle appearance difference of local parts, which thus inspires a number of part-based methods. However, due to uncontrollable object poses in images, distinctive de-tails carried by local regions can be spatially distributed or even self-occluded, leading to a large variation on ob-ject representation. For discounting pose variations, this paper proposes to learn a novel graph based object rep-resentation to reveal a global configuration of local parts for self-supervised pose alignment across classes, which is employed as an auxiliary feature regularization on a deep representation learning network. Moreover, a coarse-to-fine supervision together with the proposed pose-insensitive constraint on shallow-to-deep sub-networks encourages discriminative features in a curriculum learning manner. We evaluate our method on three popular fine-grained ob-ject classification benchmarks, consistently achieving the state-of-the-art performance.
