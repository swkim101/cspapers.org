In this paper, we present a novel algorithm â€“ DRGBT (Dynamic Rapidly-exploring Generalized Bur Tree), intended for motion planning in dynamic environments. The main idea behind DRGBT lies in a so-called adaptive horizon, consisting of a set of prospective target nodes that belong to a predefined $\mathcal{C}$-space path, which originates from the current node. Each node is assigned a weight that depends on relative distances and captured changes in the environment. The algorithm continuously uses a suitable horizon assessment to decide when to trigger the replanning procedure. A comprehensive simulation study is performed, covering a variety of manipulators, where DRGBT is compared to a state-of-the-art algorithm. Results indicate some promising features of the proposed method.
