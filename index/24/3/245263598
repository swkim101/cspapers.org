Lower Limb Exoskeletons (LLEs) are promising in gait rehabilitation for stroke survivors. In gait training of post-stroke patients with LLEs, one of the main challenges is how to generate appropriate gait patterns from the sound leg to the paretic leg for different patients with varying walking speeds. In this paper, we proposed a Synergetic Gait Prediction (SGP) model for rehabilitation LLEs with post-stroke patients, which can generate adaptive synergetic gait patterns for different patients with varying walking speeds. The proposed SGP model is based on Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) neural networks with temporal attention mechanisms. In the training procedure of the proposed SGP model, a gait database with collected gait patterns from healthy subjects is employed to learn the parameters of SGP model. The SGP model takes current joint angles from the sound leg and a segment of observed history joint angles from both legs as input and predicts the future joint angles for the paretic leg. We compared the effectiveness of the SGP model with the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, experimental results indicate that SGP model can generate synergetic gait patterns for different subjects via varying walking speeds with less prediction error.
