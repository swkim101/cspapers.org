The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the ongoing opioid crisis in the United States. Individuals with a substance use disorder are vulnerable to relapse during times of acute stress. Online peer support communities (OPSCs) have the potential to decrease social isolation and increase social support for participants. In September 2020, we launched a private, professional-moderated OPSC using the Facebook Group platform to study its effects on the mental health wellness of women undergoing substance use treatment. This study was particularly meaningful as the participants were not able to join in-person treatment sessions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary findings indicate that study participants reported decreased loneliness and increased online social support three months after initiating the OPSC. They tended to interact with content initiated by a clinical professional more than those generated by peers.
