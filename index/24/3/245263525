In this paper, we propose an implementation of a new technique of power maximization using a photovoltaic system emulator. The PV system design and its performance evaluation test before installation would be both costly and time-consuming. To overcome this problem the use of an emulator adds more performance and efficiency in the laboratory. Also, by measuring the voltage and current from the PV emulator the characteristic I-V and P-V are extract.The need to consider the measure power state is strongly nonlinear distribution curve with noise. For that reason, to establish and to detect the power value, measurement equations and dynamic equations proposed MPPT control strategy based on Kalman filter algorithm. The correctness and effectiveness of the strategy is verified by simulation and experiment. This algorithm was experimentally implemented. Data acquisition and control system were implemented using dSPACE1103. The results show that the Kalman filter MPPT work accurately and successfully under the change of solar irradiation.
