Image copy detection (ICD) aims to determine whether a query image is an edited copy of any image from a reference set. Currently, there are very limited public benchmarks for ICD, while all overlook a critical challenge in real-world applications, i.e., the distraction from hard negative queries. Specifically, some queries are not edited copies but are inherently similar to some reference images. These hard negative queries are easily false recognized as edited copies, significantly compromising the ICD accuracy. This observation motivates us to build the first ICD benchmark featuring this characteristic. Based on existing ICD datasets, this paper constructs a new dataset by additionally adding 100,000 and 24, 252 hard negative pairs into the training and test set, respectively. Moreover, this paper further reveals a unique difficulty for solving the hard negative problem in ICD, i.e., there is a fundamental conflict between current metric learning and ICD. This conflict is: the metric learning adopts symmetric distance while the edited copy is an asymmetric (unidirectional) process, e.g., a partial crop is close to its holistic reference image and is an edited copy, while the latter cannot be the edited copy of the former (in spite the distance is equally small). This insight results in an Asymmetrical-Similarity Learning (ASL) method, which allows the similarity in two directions (the query â†” the reference image) to be different from each other. Experimental results show that ASL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin, confirming that solving the symmetric-asymmetric conflict is critical for ICD.
