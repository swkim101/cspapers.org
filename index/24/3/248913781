In this paper, we use the term “Analysis-Runtime Co-design” to describe the technique of modifying the runtime protocol of a scheduling scheme to closely match the analysis derived for it. Carefully designed modifications to the runtime protocol make the schedulability analysis for the scheme less pessimistic, while the schedulability guarantee afforded to any given application remains intact. Such modifications to the runtime protocol can result in significant benefits with respect to other important metrics. An enhanced runtime protocol is designed for the Adaptive Mixed-Criticality (AMC) scheduling scheme. This protocol retains the same analysis, while ensuring that in the event of high-criticality behavior, the system degrades less often and remains degraded for a shorter time, resulting in far fewer low-criticality jobs that either miss their deadlines or are not executed.
