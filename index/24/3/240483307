CASTLE is a Compression-based main memory Architecture realizing a read-decrypt-free (i.e., write-only) Secure solution for low laTency, Low Energy, high endurance non-volatile memories (NVMs). CASTLE integrates pattern-based data compression and incomplete data mapping (i.e., expansion coding) to improve NVM energy, latency, and lifetime without impacting the security guarantees of the underlying security architecture. System-level simulations of a TLC RRAM architecture show that CASTLE reduces memory energy by 19% and write latency by 38.7%, and improves lifetime by 1.8 Ã— over state-of-the-art solutions for NVM security.
