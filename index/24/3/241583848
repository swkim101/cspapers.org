Increasing the representation of minorities in computer science (CS) has become a national priority. One of the many reasons minority students nationwide choose not to study CS is that they often lack mentors and role models to encourage them early in their learning. In her seminal article, Jeannette Wing argues that computational thinking (CT) is an emerging essential skill that should become an integral part of K-12 education. However, a big issue facing this initiative is that many K-12 teachers find themselves lack (1) relevant materials, (2) systematic training, and (3) a supportive community. The democratization of media, such as photos and videos, has provided a great variety of options to educate a broad audience on myriad topics. In this poster, we will describe the challenges and successes of using animated videos including its beauty, soundness, and utility as critical elements in establishing a strong CT comprehension while engaging K-12 teachers in a non-threatening way. Using a process of iterative design, we have found ways to integrate CT concepts in six non-CS disciplines in the K-12 curriculum. The teachers who have collaborated with us respond positively that this design approach provides them with a greater comprehension of the CT concepts while giving them exciting instructional activities. Therefore, this poster may be of interest to any CS educator who wishes to improve the engagement of K-12 teachers while sustaining a CT training program at their institution.
