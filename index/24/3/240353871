We give an online algorithm that with high probability computes a (e/e−1 + o(1))Δ edge coloring on a graph G with maximum degree Δ = ω(logn) under online edge arrivals against oblivious adversaries, making first progress on the conjecture of Bar-Noy, Motwani, and Naor in this general setting. Our algorithm is based on reducing to a matching problem on locally treelike graphs, and then applying a tree recurrences based approach for arguing correlation decay.
