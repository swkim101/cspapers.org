 Social Impact has been widely discussed by the engineering community, but studies show that there is currently little systematic consideration of the social impact of products in both academia and in industry beyond social impacts on health and safety. This paper illustrates how Failure Mode and Effect Analaysis (FMEA) style analysis can be applied to evaluating the social impact of products. The authors propose a new method titled Social Impact Effects Analysis (SIEA), describe how it is performed, and explain the benefits of performing SIEA.
