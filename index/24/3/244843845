The method for calculating the working process of small-size two-stroke internal combustion engines has been developed and tested. After analyzing the obtained data, the power characteristics obtained by calculation for the Evolution 20GX2 two-stroke internal combustion engine were compared with the characteristics of known engine models with similar geometric parameters and designs. Based on the results of the comparison, the following conclusions were made: during the calculation according to the proposed method, all the necessary parameters were obtained; the obtained results of comparing the parameters of the engines under consideration can be considered encouraging and promising for further research; to fully confirm the developed methodology, it is necessary to perform calculations using computer modeling, as well as conduct steady-state tests of the Evolution 20GX2 engine, to verify the results obtained [1], [2], [3], [4].
