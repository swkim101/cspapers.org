Under-actuated bionic hands have achieved tremendous popularity in many fields because of their advantages of lightweight, budget-friendly, satisfactory flexibility, and adaptability. Except for the bionic mechanical design, various anthropomorphic control strategies have been proposed and investigated in the last decades. However, due to its under-actuated characteristic, there are still many challenges for anthropomorphic control of all the degrees of freedom (DOFs) using less input. It is challenging to map the human hand kinematic synergies on robotic hands, particularly for a dynamic environment. Therefore, it is worth studying how to control the under-actuated bionic hand effectively in a dynamic environment. In this paper, an anthropomorphic control method is proposed using sensor fusion of hand kinematic inputs to control the under-actuated bionic hand. In order to map the kinematics of human fingers to the bionic hand, a novel finger bending angle is defined to represent the posture of human fingers. Multiple Leap Motion Controllers (LMC) are fused to estimate the stable and accurate finger bending angles to avoid the occlusion problem. Finally, experiments with real-time control of the under-actuated bionic hand are implemented to demonstrate the proposed approachâ€™s effectiveness.
