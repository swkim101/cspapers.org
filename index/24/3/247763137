Recent advances in vision Transformers (ViTs) have come with a voracious appetite for computing power, highlighting the urgent need to develop efficient training methods for ViTs. Progressive learning, a training scheme where the model capacity grows progressively during training, has started showing its ability in efficient training. In this paper, we take a practical step towards efficient training of ViTs by customizing and automating progressive learning. First, we develop a strong manual baseline for progressive learning of ViTs, by introducing momentum growth (MoGrow) to bridge the gap brought by model growth. Then, we propose automated progressive learning (AutoProg), an efficient training scheme that aims to achieve lossless acceleration by automatically increasing the training overload on-the-fly; this is achieved by adaptively deciding whether, where and how much should the model grow during progressive learning. Specifically, we first relax the optimization of the growth schedule to sub-network architecture optimization problem, then propose one-shot estimation of the sub-network performance via an elastic supernet. The searching overhead is reduced to minimal by recycling the parameters of the supernet. Extensive experiments of efficient training on ImageNet with two representative ViT models, DeiT and VOLO, demonstrate that AutoProg can accelerate ViTs training by up to 85.1% with no performance drop.11Code:https://github.com/changlin31/AutoProg.
