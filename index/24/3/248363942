Data literacy as a term is growing in presence in society. Until recently, most of the educational focus has been around how to equip people with the skills to use data. However the increased impact that data is having on society has demonstrated the need for a different approach, one where people are able to understand and think critically about how data is being collected, used and shared. Going beyond definitions, in this paper we present research on benchmarking data literacy through self assessment based upon the creation of a set of data literacy levels for adults. Although the work highlights the limitations of self assessment, there is clear potential to build on the definitions to create potential IQ-style tests that help boost critical thinking and demonstrate the importance of data literacy education.
