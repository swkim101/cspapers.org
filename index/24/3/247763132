In this paper, we focus on the Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) task, which aims to answer questions regarding different visual objects, sounds, and their associations in videos. The problem requires comprehensive multimodal understanding and spatio-temporal reasoning over audio-visual scenes. To benchmark this task and facilitate our study, we introduce a large-scale MUSIC-AVQA dataset, which contains more than 45K question-answer pairs covering 33 different question templates spanning over different modalities and question types. We develop several baselines and introduce a spatio-temporal grounded audio-visual network for the AVQA problem. Our results demonstrate that AVQA benefits from multisensory perception and our model outperforms recent A-, V-, and AVQA approaches. We believe that our built dataset has the potential to serve as testbed for evaluating and promoting progress in audio-visual scene understanding and spatio-temporal reasoning.
