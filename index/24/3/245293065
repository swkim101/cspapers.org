We report the development of novel fault detection and isolation (FDI) methods for model-based fault detection (MB-FD) and quotient-space fault isolation (QS-FI). This FDI approach performs MB-FD and QS-FI of single or multiple con-current faults in plants and actuators simultaneously, without a priori knowledge of fault form, type, or dynamics. To detect faults, MB-FD characterizes deviation from nominal behavior using the plant velocity and plant and actuator parameters estimated by nullspace-based adaptive identification. To isolate (i.e. identify) faults, the QS-FI algorithm compares the estimated parameters to a nominal parameter class in progressively decreasing-dimensional quotient spaces of the parameter space. A preliminary simulation study of these proposed FDI methods applied to a three degree-of-freedom uninhabited underwater vehicle plant model shows their ability to detect as well as isolate faults for the cases of both single and multiple simultaneous faults and suggests the generalizability of the MB-FD and QS-FI approaches to any well-defined second-order plant and actuator model whose parameters enter linearly: a broad class of systems which includes aerial vehicles, marine vehicles, spacecraft, and robot arms.
