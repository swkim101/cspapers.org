Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) is a powerful tool for 3D cellular visualization. Due to instrumental limitations, cryo-ET images and their volumetric reconstruction suffer from extremely low signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end self-supervised learning model, the Sparsity Constrained Network (SC-Net), to restore volumetric image from single noisy data in cryo-ET. The proposed method only requires a single noisy data as training input and no ground-truth is needed in the whole training procedure. A new target function is proposed to preserve both local smoothness and detailed structure. Additionally, a novel procedure for the simulation of electron tomographic photographing is designed to help the evaluation of methods. Experiments are done on three simulated data and four real-world data. The results show that our method could produce a strong enhancement for a single very noisy cryo-ET volumetric data, which is much better than the state-of-the-art Noise2Void, and with a competitive performance comparing with Noise2Noise.
