Events such as terrorist attacks and Brexit play an important role in the research of social scientists and Digital Humanities researchers. They need innovative user access models to event-centric information which support them throughout their research. Current access models such as recommendation and information retrieval methods often fail to adequately capture essential features of events and provide acceptable access to event-centric information. This PhD research aims to develop efficient and effective user access models to event-centric information by leveraging well-structured information in Knowledge Graphs. The goal is to tackle the challenges researchers encounter during their research in a workflow, from exploratory search to accessing well-defined and complete information collections. This paper presents the specific research questions and presents the approach and preliminary results.
