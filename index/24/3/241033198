We give an algorithm for augmenting the edge connectivity of an undirected graph by using the isolating cuts framework (Li and Panigrahi, FOCS '20). Our algorithm uses poly-logarithmic calls to any max-flow algorithm, which yields a running time of $\tilde O(m + n^{3/2})$ and improves on the previous best time of $\tilde O(n^2)$ (Bencz\'ur and Karger, SODA '98) for this problem. We also obtain an identical improvement in the running time of the closely related edge splitting off problem in undirected graphs.
