We consider a class of visual analogical reasoning problems that involve discovering the sequence of transformations by which pairs of input/output images are related, so as to analogously transform future inputs. This program synthesis task can be easily solved via symbolic search. Using a variation of the ‘neural analogical reasoning’ approach, we instead search for a sequence of elementary neural network transformations that manipulate distributed representations derived from a symbolic space, to which input images are directly encoded. We evaluate the extent to which our ‘neural reasoning’ approach generalises for images with unseen shapes and positions.
