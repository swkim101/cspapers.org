We introduce PartGlot, a neural framework and associated architectures for learning semantic part segmentation of 3D shape geometry, based solely on part referential language. We exploit the fact that linguistic descriptions of a shape can provide priors on the shape's parts - as natural language has evolved to reflect human perception of the compositional structure of objects, essential to their recognition and use. For training we use ShapeGlot's paired geometry /language data collected via a reference game where a speaker produces an utterance to differentiate a target shape from two distractors and the listener has to find the target based on this utterance [3]. Our network is designed to solve this target multi-modal recognition problem, by carefully incorporating a Transformer-based attention module so that the output attention can precisely highlight the semantic part or parts described in the language. Remarkably, the network operates without any direct supervision on the 3D geometry itself. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the learned part information is generaliz-able to shape classes unseen during training. Our approach opens the possibility of learning 3D shape parts from language alone, without the need for large-scale part geometry annotations, thus facilitating annotation acquisition.
