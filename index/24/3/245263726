Under the ceaseless global COVID-19 pandemic, lung ultrasound (LUS) is the emerging way for effective diagnosis and severeness evaluation of respiratory diseases. However, close physical contact is unavoidable in conventional clinical ultrasound, increasing the infection risk for health-care workers. Hence, a scanning approach involving minimal physical contact between an operator and a patient is vital to maximize the safety of clinical ultrasound procedures. A robotic ultrasound platform can satisfy this need by remotely manipulating the ultrasound probe with a robotic arm. This paper proposes a robotic LUS system that incorporates the automatic identification and execution of the ultrasound probe placement pose without manual input. An RGB-D camera is utilized to recognize the scanning targets on the patient through a learning-based human pose estimation algorithm and solve for the landing pose to attach the probe vertically to the tissue surface; A position/force controller is designed to handle intraoperative probe pose adjustment for maintaining the contact force. We evaluated the scanning area localization accuracy, motion execution accuracy, and ultrasound image acquisition capability using an upper torso mannequin and a realistic lung ultrasound phantom with healthy and COVID-19-infected lung anatomy. Results demonstrated the overall scanning target localization accuracy of 19.67 ± 4.92 mm and the probe landing pose estimation accuracy of 6.92 ± 2.75 mm in translation, 10.35 ± 2.97 deg in rotation. The contact force-controlled robotic scanning allowed the successful ultrasound image collection, capturing pathological landmarks.
