Community detection, one of the most important tools for graph analysis, finds groups of strongly connected nodes in a graph. However, community detection may suffer from misleading information in a graph, such as a nontrivial number of inter-community edges or an insufficient number of intra-community edges. In this paper, we propose GraphReformCD that reformulates a given graph into a new graph in such a way that community detection can be conducted more accurately. For the reformulation, it builds a k-nearest neighbor graph that gives a node k opportunities to connect itself to those nodes that are likely to belong to the same community together with the node. To find the nodes that belong to the same community, it employs the structural similarities such as Jaccard index and SimRank. To validate the effectiveness of our GraphReformCD, we perform extensive experiments with six real-world and four synthetic graphs. The results show that our GraphReformCD enables state-of-the-art methods to improve their accuracy significantly up to 40.6% in community detection.
