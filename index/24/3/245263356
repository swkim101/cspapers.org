The spherical joint is an effective solution to design parallel micro-robotic systems with rotation capabilities in the three-dimensional space. This type of joint has however some non-linear characteristics, such as the clearance, which affect the positioning accuracy in micro-robotic tasks. The starting point of this study lies in experimental observations of rotation errors from a 3-PPPS 6-DOF parallel micro-robotic systems operating inside a scanning electron microscope. The objective of the paper is to assess the role of the spherical joints in the rotation errors and to evaluate whether the joints non-linearities can cause errors with the same order of magnitude as those observed experimentally. To this end, the first part of the study addresses the modeling of 3-PPPS 6-DOF parallel micro-robotic systems with spherical joints including the clearance. This model allows for analysing the effect of the clearance on position and rotation accuracies of the micro-robotic system. It is found by simulations that the same positioning behavior as in the experiments occurs when the clearance of the spherical joint is included in the model, supporting the hypothesis. Therefore, it is concluded that clearance in spherical joints has a significant effect on the precision of parallel type micro-robotic systems which opens new challenges in the control of poly-articulated micro-robotic systems with clearance compensation.
