We consider the problem of localizing a spatio-temporal tube in a video corresponding to a given text query. This is a challenging task that requires the joint and efficient modeling of temporal, spatial and multi-modal interactions. To address this task, we propose TubeDETR, a transformer-based architecture inspired by the recent success of such models for text-conditioned object detection. Our model notably includes: (i) an efficient video and text encoder that models spatial multi-modal interactions over sparsely sampled frames and (ii) a space-time decoder that jointly performs spatio-temporal localization. We demonstrate the advantage of our proposed components through an extensive ablation study. We also evaluate our full approach on the spatio-temporal video grounding task and demonstrate improvements over the state of the art on the challenging VidSTG and HC-STVG benchmarks.
