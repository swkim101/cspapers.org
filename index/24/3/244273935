Pilot contamination jamming not only reduces the secrecy capacity but also is difficult to detect. In this paper, we proposed a technique, in which we employ random NPSK to detect passive eavesdropper throw pilot contamination in Massive MIMO Uncorrelated Rician Fading Channels. The technique only needs two training times slot and without channel knowledge.
