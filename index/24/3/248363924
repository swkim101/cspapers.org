A key component of technology sector business strategy is understanding the mechanisms by which technologies are adopted and the rate of their growth over time. Furthermore, predicting how technologies grow in relation to each other informs business decision-making in terms of product definition, research and development, and marketing strategies. An important avenue for exploring technology trends is by looking at activity in the software community. Social networks for developers can provide useful technology trend insights and have an inherent temporal graph structure. We demonstrate an approach to technology growth ranking that adapts spatiotemporal graph neural networks to work with structured temporal relational graph data.
