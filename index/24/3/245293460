The fast growth of communication technologies such as 5G provides high bandwidth and low latency wireless internet access. This enables both high definition video stream and real-time robot commands transmitted between robots and operators in the context of telepresence and teleoperation. Although there has been substantial research to establish algorithms that convert images to robot motions and telerobotic systems, little effort was made in establishing a clear scheme that enable artists to draw portraits using telerobotic systems. In this paper, we provide an easy-to-follow structure and implementation of a robot avatar for portrait drawing by artists through remote manipulation. The proposed telerobotic system uses a digital tablet and motion capture suit as input devices, which provides accurate drawing and continuous motion data stream respectively. With sensor fusion of the input data on the robot side, the drawing process presented in this work uses a unified force and impedance controller to ensure smooth and uniform pen-strokes. The proposed scheme was used to synthesise a system that was used by an artist to successfully finish the portrait drawing of Elon Musk. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the introduced control framework through an experiment. In particular, we validate the benefit of combining unified force and impedance control with sensor fusion of the digital tablet and motion capture suit data.
