—Memory forensic tools rely on the knowledge of kernel symbols and kernel object layouts to retrieve digital evidence and artifacts from memory dumps. This knowledge is called proﬁle. Existing solutions for proﬁle generation are either inconvenient or inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a logic inference approach to automatically generating a proﬁle directly from a memory dump. It leverages the invariants existing in ker- nel data structures across all kernel versions and conﬁgurations to precisely locate forensics-required ﬁelds in kernel objects. We have implemented a prototype named L OGIC M EM and evaluated it on memory dumps collected from mainstream Linux distribu- tions, customized Linux kernels with random conﬁgurations, and operating systems designed for Android smartphones and embed- ded devices. The evaluation results show that the proposed logic inference approach is well-suited for locating forensics-required ﬁelds and achieves 100% precision and recall for mainstream Linux distributions and 100% precision and 95% recall for customized kernels with random conﬁgurations. Moreover, we show that false negatives can be eliminated with improved logic rules. We also demonstrate that L OGIC M EM can generate proﬁles when it is otherwise difﬁcult (if not impossible) for existing approaches, and support memory forensics tasks such as rootkit detection.
