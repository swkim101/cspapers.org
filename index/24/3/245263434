This paper introduces a planar tensegrity robot that walks passively and cyclically on a gentle downhill, where its gait versatility can be strengthened by applying actuation forces on the connection cables. The novelty of this work is that we design the structure of this passive robot inspired by the rimless wheel, which naturally generates cyclic locomotion. Consequently, its mathematical model is analytically derived based on passive dynamic walking. Besides, the limb support conditions and dynamics effects induced by the collisions can be precisely determined accordingly. Moreover, numerical simulation is performed to show the typical gait pattern, and resonance phenomenon is observed. Finally, a preliminary experimental study is conducted to prove the validity of the mathematical model. The robot we developed and the mathematical model we derived enable further extensions on the gait analysis and model-based control by conveniently adopting efficient passivemimic walking techniques.
