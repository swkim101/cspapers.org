Origami robots–often called "printable" robots– created using folding processes have gained extensive attention due to their potential for rapid and accessible design and fabrication through simple structures with complex functionalities. However, almost all origami robots require conventional rigid electronics for control, which may hinder the integration and restrict the potential of these origami systems. Here we introduce origami logic gates that can be built through folding. The major enabling technology is a bistable switch that can switch between two different circuits to control the electrical flow. Based on the origami switch, we develop NOT, AND, and OR logic gates (showing functional completeness) and demonstrate these logic gates through sufficiently powering low-current LEDs. These logic gates are fabricated using cut-and-fold manufacturing and offer a potential way of integrating logic functions directly into origami machines without electronics.
