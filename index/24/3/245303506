In this paper we propose a novel flexible and optimization-free controller for standard torque-controlled manipulator for Robotic-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery. A novel method has been developed to model the constraint introduced by the laparoscopic tool, i.e. the remote center of motion, exploiting closed chain manipulators theory, and the final controller was synthesized considering the effects the constraint produces at a dynamic level. A set of simulations has been performed in a trajectory tracking task to validate the performances of the proposed controller. Performances have been also tested in a real experimental scenario with a KUKA LWR 4+ with 7 degrees of freedom endowed with a laparoscopic-like tool. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller and its capability of modifying the trajectory in order to preserve the RCM constraint.
