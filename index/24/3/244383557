 Thin bistable composite laminates can be used for shape morphing applications by virtue of their material properties and asymmetric ply layup. These laminates are called bistable because they can be snapped into two or more stable shapes. A single bistable patch can result in simple cylindrical shapes and when multiple such patches are assembled into a single multi-patch laminate they result in more complex shapes and multiple stable shapes that can find wide practical use in shape morphing applications. Analytical models exist that can approximate the stable shapes of the laminates from the input of material properties and laminate geometry. And these models correlate with FEA and experiment to a satisfactory degree and could be used for the design of multi patch laminates. In this research, we make use of these analytical models that solve for a four-patch grid laminate and create a design method based on optimization to solve the reverse problem to arrive at the laminate parameters given the target shape(s). Two approaches are presented wherein one targets a single stable shape and the other targets two stable shapes which are the shapes before and after snap through. This work would be useful to understand how multi-patch laminates could be designed using optimization.
