Hydrogen presents a clean energy source for the environment; its production must be advantageous by using clean energy converters. In this paper, we present the Matlab/Similink modeling of a clean hydrogen production system which consists of water electrolyzes coupled with a PV panel system. Hydrogen is produced by the chemical process of water electrolysis. The necessary current is supplied by a photovoltaic system. Simulation of Matlab/Simulink is to provide an electrical model of the water electrolysis and the PV panel system. The obtained results are the current-voltage characteristics I-V of the hydrogen production system. This hydrogen will then be stored in a tank to be used by a PEM fuel cell to power an electric load at any time. This system is advantageous so that it allows us to have stable electrical energy during the period of darkness or poor irradiance.
