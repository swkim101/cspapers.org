This paper is concerned with a new design of positive functional filters for positive linear standard systems. The order of this filter is equal to the dimension of the vector to be estimated. In fact, we propose a new positive reduced order filter for positive linear systems. The designed functional filters always nonnegative at any time and they converge asymptotically to the true functional state vector. Then, conditions that ensuring positivity of such filters are formulated in terms of Matrix Inequalities (LMIs); The proposed approach is based on the unbiasedness of the estimation error using Sylvester equation; Based on the Kalman-Yacubovich-Popov (KYP) positive real lemma, all structural constraints on positive filter matrices were addressed in terms of LMI formulation.
