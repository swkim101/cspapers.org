This study presents dynamics computation and control of a hybrid multi-link system that integrates rigid- and soft-bodies. It is a challenging problem to install a softness in a robot system, which is an important factor in human body. Softness achieved by human muscles and ligaments contributes to dynamic motion. Flexibility of a sports prosthetic leg allows a handicapped person to run. However, traditional algorithms of dynamics computation for a robot system or human skeletal model only consider a rigid-body multi-link system. Recent progress in soft robotics such as piecewise constant strain (PCS) model provides the way to compute dynamics of soft deformation with a low computational cost. We construct a hybrid multi-link system integrating rigid-body and the PCS model. For controlling a humanoid robot with soft links, we implement a dynamics computation with a floating-base and derive the center-of-gravity Jacobian matrix of the hybrid link system. Moreover, we demonstrate a forward dynamics simulation of a humanoid robot with prosthetic legs.
