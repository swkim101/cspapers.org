 The placement of objects on a ship is critical to many facets of the performance of a ship. Most notably, the mass distribution properties of objects in a ship affect the shipâ€™s stability, trim, and structural loading. Information gathered from object placement optimization can allow naval architects to further optimize the design of the whole ship by potentially reducing the structural weight of the vessel, and adjusting the shape of the hull or the general arrangements based on available space in the ship. This paper presents a novel, many-objective bin packing problem for object placement across multiple decks on a ship. This problem is also highly constrained to avoid object intersection and protrusion. The problem was optimized with the NSGA-II algorithm, utilizing a heuristic population initialization and by separating the objectives into a bilevel optimization scheme. The bilevel scheme decouples certain objectives and design variables from the rest of the problem and sequences the evaluation for the objectives in a two-stage process. The hypervolume of the final population measured the performance of the optimization test. The results indicate that sequencing the objectives with a bilevel scheme produces an 80.3% larger hypervolume than an all-in-one optimization for the same problem. The findings from this study provide a systematic way by combining concepts from many-objective optimization, bin packing heuristics, and bilevel optimization to sequence the optimization of many-objective, object placement problems.
