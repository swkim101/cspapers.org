In this work, we present a definition of a neurointerface architecture combined from two main parts (1) neuroport (a hardware device) that implements a neuro protocol, generated and managed by a (2) neuroterminal (a software). The proposed architecture was created by analogy with OSI network architecture. We also present the neuroterminal as an oscillator motif real-time neurosimulation and results of the comparison of a bio-plausible motor pattern generated by oscillator motifs with square pulses of 20 – 40 Hz used as the neuro protocol for the output neuroport and measured their discomfort rate and efficacy according to an angle of subject fingers deflection. We determined that the most effective is the five oscillator motifs generated pattern for a median nerve stimulation, whereas for a muscle simulation 20 and 40 Hz are more effective. We indicate that the oscillator motif generated pattern feels more natural than square pulses 20 – 40 Hz, which feel like a spasm.
