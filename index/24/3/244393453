 Low and middle income countries often do not have the infrastructure needed to support weather forecasting models, which are computationally expensive and often require detailed inputs from local weather stations. Local, low-cost weather prediction services are needed to enable optimal irrigation scheduling and increase crop productivity for rural farmers in low-resource settings. This work proposes a machine learning approach to predict the weather inputs needed to calculate crop water demand, namely evapotranspiration and precipitation. The focus of this work is on the accuracy with which Moroccan weather can be predicted with a vector autoregression (VAR) model compared to using typical meteorological year (TMY) weather, and how this accuracy changes as the number of weather parameters is reduced.
