Time series classification (TSC) has attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry. TSC methods that are based on shapelets (intuitively, small highly-discriminative subsequences have been found effective and are particularly known for their interpretability, as shapelets themselves are subsequences. A recent work has significantly improved the efficiency of shapelet discovery. For instance, the shapelets of more than 65% of the datasets in the UCR Archive (containing data from different application domains) can be computed within an hour, whereas those of 12 datasets can be computed within a minute. Such efficiency has made it possible for demo attendees to interact with shapelet discovery and explore high-quality shapelets. In this demo, we present Visualet -- a tool for visualizing shapelets, and exploring effective and interpretable ones.
