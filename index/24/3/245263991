This paper deals with robust torque controller design for induction motor. The design is based on singularly perturbed system theory and linear parameter-varying systems, with the rotor resistance acting as a time-varying parameter. In addition, the MRAS observer is designed to estimate both the rotor resistance and the electromagnetic torque, whereas an LPV observer estimates the rotor flux. The key feature of this proposed controller is that it improves and ensures both stability and robustness when the rotor resistance varies across the entire working range. Simulation tests are carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.
