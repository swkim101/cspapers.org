Network Function Virtualization has demonstrated how general purpose infrastructure in the cloud can match the performance of specialized hardware while providing greater flexibility and scalability. Yet, specialized hardware remains the preferred implementation choice for the wireless physical layer. This is primarily due to the tight latency requirements and high bandwidth demanded by operations at the wireless PHY, as opposed to the network-layer. This poster argues that in the era of low-power Internet of Things, virtualization of physical layer functions deserves a revisit. We specifically study low-power Internet of Things technologies that present a ripe opportunity for cloudification of wireless network functions, with their lower bandwidths and lax latency constraints. We present our vision of how physical layer function virtualization should be structured to maximize benefits and performance. We present a feasibility study on the latency and scalability limits of such virtualization for various physical layer functions that could leverage such an architecture.
