Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) is an important unsupervised approach to group the multi-view data containing missing data in some views. Previous IMVC methods suffer from the following issues: (1) the inaccurate imputation or padding for missing data negatively affects the clustering performance, (2) the quality of features after fusion might be interfered by the low-quality views, especially the inaccurate imputed views. To avoid these issues, this work presents an imputation-free and fusion-free deep IMVC framework. First, the proposed method builds a deep embedding feature learning and clustering model for each view individually. Our method then nonlinearly maps the embedding features of complete data into a high-dimensional space to discover linear separability. Concretely, this paper provides an implementation of the high-dimensional mapping as well as shows the mechanism to mine the multi-view cluster complementarity. This complementary information is then transformed to the supervised information with high confidence, aiming to achieve the multi-view clustering consistency for the complete data and incomplete data. Furthermore, we design an EM-like optimization strategy to alternately promote feature learning and clustering. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior clustering performance over state-of-the-art methods.
