This paper presents a fractional order robust nonlinear control for variable speed wind energy system equipped with a permanent magnet synchronous generator. The control strategy, which is applied to the generator side converter, combines the Sliding Mode Control method with three adaptive Takagi Sugeno fuzzy systems in the fractional order. The resulting control laws improve the systemâ€™s robustness and tracking performance. Fractional Lyapunov function has been used to prove the asymptotic stability of the control system. The comparison of simulation results between the proposed control method and its integer order counterpart, via Matlab / Simulink environment, illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed control approach regarding external disturbances and parametric uncertainties.
