Being asked to agree to data disclosure is a ubiquitous experience in digital services - yet it is rare to encounter a well-designed consent experience. Considering the momentum for a European data space where personal information easily flows across organizations, sectors, and nations, solving the thorny issue of ”how to get consent right” cannot be postponed any further. In this paper, we describe the first findings from a study based on 24 semi-structured interviews investigating participants’ expectations and opinions toward a consent form redesigned as a comic and an infographic in a data-sharing scenario. We found that time, information prioritization, tone, and audience fit are crucial when individuals are invited to disclose their information and the infographic is a better fit in biomedical scenarios.
