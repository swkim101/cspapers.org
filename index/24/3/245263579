SLAM in deformable environments is a very challenging research topic. Some research works have been presented by different research groups in the past few years. However, there are still some challenging research questions remaining unanswered. This paper discusses some of these research questions focusing on the case when point features are used to describe the deformable environments. The SLAM problems are formulated as extensions of point feature based SLAM in static environments, including both optimisation based offline SLAM and filter based online SLAM. To illustrate the problems and questions more clearly, some concepts and results using simple 2D examples are presented. The MATLAB source codes of the results are made publicly available (https://github.com/cyb1212/DeformableSLAM2D.git) to help the readers understand the problems more clearly.
