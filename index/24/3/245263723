In the last decades, saliency detection was extensively studied. The number of computational models that help to detect salient regions in still images is increasing, whereas, detecting salient regions in videos is in its early stages. In this paper we present an overview on the visual attention field. We explain how salient object is selected and how this selection process is performed.
