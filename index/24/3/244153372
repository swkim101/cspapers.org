Security in today’s IoT applications becomes extremely important because it is strongly related to social and human life. User authentication is the most important problem and the first step in establishing reliable communication sessions. Biometric authentication solutions including network face recognition have many advantages such as being fast, accurate, and user-friendly. Traditional authentication solutions using only device identification have always to deal with increasingly sophisticated forms of spoofing or sabotage attacks, especially for environments with low-complexity hardware devices. Thus, this paper proposes a novel multi-factor authentication solution exploiting face recognition and user’s device characteristics to increase the trustworthiness of the authentication process. Moreover, combined with the watermarking technique, the proposed scheme is lightweight and suitable for resource-constrained computing devices. By using BAN logic, the security of the proposed scheme has been analyzed to prove the reliability and security of the algorithms.
