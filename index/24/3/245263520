This study analyzes the surface sliding behavior of space probes in simulated extraterrestrial environments. When a space probe lands on an extraterrestrial body, its landing gear (footpad, landing legs) contacts and slides along the ground surface. The influence of various parameters (i.e., footpad size, velocity, ground condition, atmospheric pressure, and gravity) on the friction behavior of footpads was experimentally evaluated herein. First, we developed an experimental system that can perform footpad sliding tests repeatedly. Subsequently, the system was used to perform tests under various conditions: 1) on ground under normal atmospheric conditions, 2) in a vacuum, and 3) in reduced gravity. The tests performed in a vacuum and in reduced gravity indicated that the friction behavior of the footpad is largely unaffected by atmospheric pressure and gravity. The findings obtained herein offer useful design and control guidelines for space probes landing on extraterrestrial bodies.
