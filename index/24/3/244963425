The Veteran Services Tracking and Analytics Program (VS-TAP) is a web application used to store and query the rate and duration of visitors within Veteran Servicesâ€™ locations. The application accepts data from Navigate as well as a hosted demographics survey to dis- play statistics in a graphically meaningful way. Accumulating data from different sources allows stakeholders to create custom reports to compare multiple variables that represent student veterans.
