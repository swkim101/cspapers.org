In most cases of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) application, the event information transmitted via the connected wireless sensor has not great significance without a precise valuation of its geographical position. In this work, we exploit the Machine Learning Technique (MLT) to improve node localization accuracy in WSN. The adopted MLT was applied with a range-free technique which is founded on the multi-hop localization process. The proposed methods are based on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and the On-line Sequential Extreme Learning Machine. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms permit to greatly minimize the average localization errors of the estimated nodeâ€™s position compared to the basis ELM learning machine and the well know Distance Vector Hop (Dv-Hop). Satisfactory results were obtained for isotropic and anisotropic environments in range free case.
