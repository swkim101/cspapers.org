Robotic legs often lag behind the performance of their biological counterparts. The inherent passive dynamics of natural legs largely influences the locomotion and can be abstracted through the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model. This model is often approximated in physical robotic legs using a leg with minimal mass. Our work aims to embed the SLIP dynamics by using a nonlinear strict oscillatory mode into a segmented robotic leg with significant mass, to minimize the control required for achieving periodic motions. For the first time, we provide a realization of a nonlinear oscillatory mode in a robotic leg prototype. This is achieved by decoupling the polar task dynamics and fulfilling the resulting conditions with the physical leg design. Extensive experiments validate that the robotic leg effectively embodies the strict mode. The decoupled leg-length dynamic is exhibited in leg configurations corresponding to the stance and flight phases of the locomotion task, both for the passive system and when actuating the motors. We additionally show that the leg retains this behavior while performing jumping in place experiments.
