Crew failure from visibility is common in military landing, take-off and runway-related accidents. Especially in the field of aviation, there are many studies aimed at reducing accidents caused by bad weather. In this study, an application has been developed that allows the helicopter to reach a target point using shortest path in a designated large terrain. It has been ensured that the pilot can land safely in adverse weather conditions. With Unity Hub's NavMesh and A* algorithm feature, the helicopter was given a safe 3D path recommendations in the 3D model using a height map of the terrain. A* algorithm and navigation mesh have been used to suggest a dynamic road in the field based on the position of the helicopter removed from a specific point. Experimental results show that the proposed 3D shortest path is successful in minimizing the route length and degree of risk.
