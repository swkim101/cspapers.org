This paper reports the design and evaluation of a novel piezo based actuator for needle drive in autonomous Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty (piezo-DALK). The actuator weighs less than 8g and is 20mm x 20mm x 10.5mm in size, making it ideal for eye-mounted applications. Mean open loop positional deviation was 1.17 ± 3.15um, and system repeatability and accuracy were 17.16um and 18.33um, respectively. Stall force was found to vary linearly with the cooling cycle and the actuator achieved a maximum drive force of 3.98N. When simulating the DALK procedure in synthetic corneal tissue, the piezo-DALK achieved a penetration depth of 643.56um which was equivalent to 92.1% of the total corneal thickness. This correlated closely with our desired depth of 90% ± 5% and took 2.5 hours to achieve. This work represents the first eye mountable actuator capable of "Big Bubble" needle drive for autonomous DALK procedures.
