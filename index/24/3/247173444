Modern deep neural networks are often vulnerable to adversarial examples. Most exist attack methods focus on crafting adversarial examples in the digital domain, while only limited works study physical adversarial attack. However, it is more challenging to generate effective adversarial examples in the physical world due to many uncontrollable physical dynamics. Most current physical attack methods aim to generate robust physical adversarial examples by simulating all possible physical dynamics. When attacking new images or new DNN models, they require expensive manually efforts for simulating physical dynamics and considerable time for iteratively optimizing for each image. To tackle these issues, we propose a class-agnostic and model-agnostic physical adversarial attack model (Meta-Attack), which is able to not only generate robust physical adversarial examples by simulating color and shape distortions, but also generalize to attacking novel images and novel DNN models by accessing a few digital and physical images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate the physical attack as a few-shot learning problem. Here, the training task is redefined as the composition of a support set, a query set, and a target DNN model. Under the few-shot setting, we design a novel class-agnostic and model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm to enhance the generalization ability of our method. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets with four challenging experimental settings verify the superior robustness and generalization of our method by comparing to state-of-the-art physical attack methods.
