The main purpose of the paper is to identify the structural constraints and parameter uncertainties which condition the static output control design for uncertain linear Metzler systems. The proposed technique is implemented using the associated structures of linear matrix inequalities to possess the closed-loop system properties. The results indicate that the design technique is eligible for uncertain linear Metzler system structures, guaranteeing closed-loop quadratic stabilisation by adjustment of positive definite diagonal matrix variables, dictated by their computational tractability in the use, and serve satisfactory performances and robustness objectives of the control structure.
