Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously represent pixel-level brightness changes as event streams. Event-based monocular multi-view stereo (EMVS) is a technique that exploits the event streams to estimate semi-dense 3D structure with known trajectory. It is a critical task for event-based monocular SLAM. However, the required intensive computation workloads make it challenging for real-time deployment on embedded platforms. In this paper, Eventor is proposed as a fast and efficient EMVS accelerator by realizing the most critical and time-consuming stages including event back-projection and volumetric ray-counting on FPGA. Highly paralleled and fully pipelined processing elements are specially designed via FPGA and integrated with the embedded ARM as a heterogeneous system to improve the throughput and reduce the memory footprint. Meanwhile, the EMVS algorithm is reformulated to a more hardware-friendly manner by rescheduling, approximate computing and hybrid data quantization. Evaluation results on DAVIS dataset show that Eventor achieves up to 24X improvement in energy efficiency compared with Intel i5 CPU platform.
