In intelligent education systems, question difficulty prediction (QDP) is a fundamental task of many applications, such as personalized question recommendation and test paper analysis. Previous work mainly focus on data-driven QDP methods, which are heavily relied on the large-scale labeled dataset of courses. To alleviate the labor intensity, an intuitive method is to introduce domain adaptation into QDP and consider each course as a domain. In educational psychology, there are two factors influencing difficulty common to different courses: the obstacles of comprehending the question and generating a response, namely stimulus and task difficulty. To this end, we propose a novel Stimulus and Task difficulty-based Adversarial Network (STAN) that models question difficulty from the views of stimulus and task. Then, in order to align the difficulty distribution of the source domain and the target domain, we utilize the conditional adversarial learning with readability-enhanced pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, we proposed a sampling method based on density estimation to implicit alignment. Finally, we conduct experiments on the real questions datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our QDP model and domain adaptation method. Our method significantly improves accuracy over state-of-the-art methods on real-world question data of multiple courses.
