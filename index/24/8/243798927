Thermal efficient resource mapping and scheduling techniques are particularly important for mobile processors because of limited opportunities for external cooling. In mobile processors such as the ones using ARM's big.LITTLE architectures, the cores of either the big or the LITTLE processor cannot be individually voltage/frequency scaled. However, we show that by forcing all the application threads to a single core, and not having any workload on the other cores of a processor, there is still considerable thermal benefit. This is counterintuitive since all the cores run at the same frequency. We show real measurements and discuss what impact this has on thermal-aware scheduling for such multicore processors.
