Detecting commuting patterns or migration patterns in movement data is an important problem in computational movement analysis. Given a trajectory, or set of trajectories, this corresponds to clustering similar subtrajectories. We study subtrajectory clustering under the continuous and discrete Fr√©chet distances. The most relevant theoretical result is by Buchin et al. (2011). They provide, in the continuous case, an O(n) time algorithm and a 3SUM-hardness lower bound, and in the discrete case, an O(n) time algorithm. We show, in the continuous case, an O(n log n) time algorithm and a 3OV-hardness lower bound, and in the discrete case, an O(n log n) time algorithm and a quadratic lower bound. Our bounds are almost tight unless SETH fails.
