Cache plays an important role to maintain high and stable performance (i.e. high throughput, low tail latency and throughput jitter) in storage systems. Existing rule-based cache management methods, coupled with engineers' manual configurations, cannot meet ever-growing requirements of both time-varying workloads and complex storage systems, leading to frequent cache overloading. In this paper, we propose the first light-weight learning-based cache bandwidth control technique, called L-QoCo which can adaptively control the cache bandwidth so as to effectively prevent cache overloading in storage systems. Extensive experiments with various workloads on real systems show that L-QoCo, with its strong adaptability and fast learning ability, can adapt to various workloads to effectively control cache bandwidth, thereby significantly improving the storage performance (e.g. increasing the throughput by 10%-20% and reducing the throughput jitter and tail latency by 2X-6X and 1.5X-4X, respectively, compared with two representative rule-based methods).
