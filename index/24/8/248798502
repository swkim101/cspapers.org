Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results in the motion planning of manipulators. However, no method guarantees the safety of highly dynamic obstacles, such as humans, in RL-based manipulator control. This lack of formal safety assurances prevents the application of RL for manipulators in real-world human environments. Therefore, we propose a shielding mechanism that ensures ISO- verified human safety while training and deploying RL algorithms on manipulators. We utilize a fast reachability analysis of humans and manipulators to guarantee that the manipulator comes to a complete stop before a human is within its range. Our proposed method guarantees safety and significantly improves the RL performance by preventing episode-ending collisions. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method in simulation using human motion capture data.
