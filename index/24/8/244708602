The ability to capture inter-frame dynamics has been critical to the development of video salient object detection (VSOD). While many works have achieved great success in this field, a deeper insight into its dynamic nature should be developed. In this work, we aim to answer the following questions: How can a model adjust itself to dynamic variations as well as perceive fine differences in the real-world environment; How are the temporal dynamics well introduced into spatial information over time? To this end, we propose a dynamic context-sensitive filtering network (DCFNet) equipped with a dynamic context-sensitive filtering module (DCFM) and an effective bidirectional dynamic fusion strategy. The proposed DCFM sheds new light on dynamic filter generation by extracting location-related affinities between consecutive frames. Our bidirectional dynamic fusion strategy encourages the interaction of spatial and temporal information in a dynamic manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on most VSOD datasets while ensuring a real-time speed of 28 fps.
