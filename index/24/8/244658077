Spatial networks are networks for which the nodes and edges are constrained by geometry and embedded in real space, which has crucial effects on their topological properties. Although tremendous success has been achieved in spatial and network representation separately in recent years, there exist very little works on the representation of spatial networks. Extracting powerful representations from spatial networks requires the development of appropriate tools to uncover the pairing of both spatial and network information in the appearance of node permutation invariant, and rotation and translation invariant. Hence it can not be modeled merely with either spatial or network models individually. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a generic framework for spatial network representation learning. Speciﬁcally, a provably information-lossless and rotation-translation invariant representation of spatial information on networks is presented. Then a higher-order spatial network convolution operation that adapts to our proposed representation is introduced. To ensure efﬁciency, we also propose a new approach that relied on sampling random spanning trees to reduce the time and space complexity from O ( N 3 ) to O ( N ) . We demonstrate the strength of our proposed framework through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
