Knowledge-based visual question answering requires the ability of associating external knowledge for open-ended cross-modal scene understanding. One limitation of existing solutions is that they capture relevant knowledge from text-only knowledge bases, which merely contain facts expressed by first-order predicates or language descriptions while lacking complex but indispensable multimodal knowledge for visual understanding. How to construct vision-relevant and explainable multimodal knowledge for the VQA scenario has been less studied. In this paper, we propose MuKEA to represent multimodal knowledge by an explicit triplet to correlate visual objects and fact answers with implicit relations. To bridge the heterogeneous gap, we propose three objective losses to learn the triplet representations from complementary views: embedding structure, topological relation and semantic space. By adopting a pretraining and fine-tuning learning strategy, both basic and domain-specific multimodal knowledge are progressively accumulated for answer prediction. We outperform the state-of-the-art by 3.35% and 6.08% respectively on two challenging knowledge-required datasets: OK-VQA and KRVQA. Experimental results prove the complementary benefits of the multimodal knowledge with existing knowledge bases and the advantages of our end-to-end framework over the existing pipeline methods.
