Authors of papers accepted to the technical track were invited to submit their artifact for evaluation. We received 51 submissions. Each artifact was reviewed by at least two members of our evaluation committee and further assessed in the online discussion phase. If satisfying the criteria, artifacts were awarded one or more badges, which are shown on the front page of their paper and on the conference website.
