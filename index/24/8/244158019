We introduce a relay selection strategy to secure energy scavenging-based cognitive networks. The introduced strategy selects a relay which satisfies two conditions: i) decode correctly data of secondary source and ii) obtain the highest secrecy capacity to the secondary destination. To assess promptly the efficacy of the introduced strategy, the secrecy outage probability (SOP) is firstly derived in exact closed form. The recommended SOP expression is then verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. Finally, useful comments on security performance of the recommended relay selection strategy are withdrawn from various results relying on the recommended SOP expression.
