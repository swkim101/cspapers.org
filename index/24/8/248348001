Web of Things (WoT) is capable of promoting the knowledge discovery and address interoperability problems of diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, due to the dynamic and diverse features of data entities on WoT, the heterogeneous entity matching has become arguably the greatest “new frontier” for WoT advancements. Currently, the data entities and the corresponding knowledge on WoT are generally modelled with the ontology, and therefore, matching heterogeneous data entities on WoT can be converted to the problem of matching ontologies. Ontology matching is a complex cognitive process, it is usually initially done manually by domain experts. To effectively distinguish the heterogeneous entities and determine high-quality ontology alignment, this work proposes a word embedding based matching technique. Our approach models the word’s semantic in the vector space, and use two vectors’ cosine angle to measure the corresponding words’ similarity. In addition, the word embedding approach does not depend on a specific knowledge base and retain the rich semantic information of words, which makes our proposal more robust. The experiment uses Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI)’s benchmark for testing, and the experimental results show that our approach outperforms other advanced matching methods.
