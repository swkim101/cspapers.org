Pose estimation is the task of determining the 6D position of an object in a scene. Pose estimation aid the abilities and flexibility of robotic set-ups. However, the system must be configured towards the use case to perform adequately. This configuration is time-consuming and limits the usability of pose estimation and, thereby, robotic systems. Deep learning is a method to overcome this configuration procedure by learning parameters directly from the dataset. However, obtaining this training data can also be very time-consuming. The use of synthetic training data avoids this data collection problem, but a configuration of the training procedure is necessary to overcome the domain gap problem. Additionally, the pose estimation parameters also need to be configured. This configuration is jokingly known as grad student descent as parameters are manually adjusted until satisfactory results are obtained. This paper presents a method for automatic configuration using only synthetic data. This is accomplished by learning the domain randomization during network training, and then using the domain randomization to optimize the pose estimation parameters. The developed approach shows state-of-the-art performance of 82.0 % recall on the challenging OCCLUSION dataset, outperforming all previous methods with a large margin. These results prove the validity of automatic set-up of pose estimation using purely synthetic data.
