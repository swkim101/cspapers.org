This paper presents a dual circularly polarized metasurface-based antenna for synthetic aperture radars with a simulated high isolation of -30.6 dB and a simulated gain of 9.3 dB, within the bandwidth of 6.6%. This single element antenna achieves high isolation by using the ground with unbalanced # shaped-slot. A radiation metasurface with 4 Ã— 4 periodic corner-truncated metallic plates changes the antenna from linear polarization (LP) to circular polarization (CP). A simple feeding network, consisting of two orthogonal ports is used in the design to excite RHCP or LHCP mode in the proposed antenna. So it is possible to employ only one antenna rather than two (RHCP and LHCP) when using the proposed structure.
