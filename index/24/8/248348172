Time information is a very important dimension in information space, which can be shown as tense expressions in natural language. Meanwhile, numerals play an important role in financial texts, which is the embodiment of fine-grained information, and most of financial events contain numerals. We have observed that Chinese does not express the tense of texts intuitively at the lexical level of verbs, but through some adverb or auxiliary tense operators, and there has not further research on numeral tense in Chinese financial texts yet. However, the tense of numerals in the texts is very crucial for the financial fields which pays attention to time series. Therefore, to assist Chinese tense understanding in financial texts, in this paper, we propose a novel task for numeral tense detection in Chinese financial fields. We firstly annotate a numeral tense dataset based on Chinese finance news texts, named CFinNumTense, which defines the numeral tense categories into “past tense”, “future tense”, “static state” and “time”, and then conduct Chinese finance numeral tense detection task on CFinNumTense. We employ RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) pre-trained model as the embedding layer and use four baseline models, i.e., FNN (Feedforward Neural Network), TextCNN (Text Convolutional Neural Networks), RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) and BiLSTM (Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory), to detect numeral tenses, respectively. In the ablation experiments, we design NE (Numeral Encoding) to improve the information on target numeral in the texts, and design an auxiliary learning model based on BiLSTM. Experiments show that the multitask learning of target numeral tense detection and tense operator extraction can strengthen the understanding ability of target numeral tense in Chinese financial texts.
