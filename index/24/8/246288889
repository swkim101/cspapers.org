In recent years, with the better availability of medical data such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), more and more data mining models have been developed to explore the data-driven insights for better human health. However, there are many challenges for analyzing EHR such as high-dimensionality, temporality, sparsity, etc., which make the data-driven models less reliable. Medical knowledge graph (MKG), which encodes comprehensive knowledge about the medical concepts and relationships extracted from medical literature, holds great promise to regularize the data-driven models as prior knowledge. Nonetheless, the MKGs are typically not complete, which limits its utility in helping with the data mining process. In this paper, we propose a mutual enhancement framework MendMKG for predictive modeling of clinical events with both EHR and MKG. In particular, MendMKG first conducts a self-supervised learning strategy to simultaneously pre-train a graph attention network for embedding nodes and complete the MKG. It iteratively performs (1) an embedding-based knowledge graph completion module to derive missing edges, (2) and a reconstruction module of unlabeled EHR data to select high-quality ones from these edges, which would be further appended to the MKG to update the embedding model. Through the iterations, the two modules mutually benefit each other. Then, MendMKG uses the pre-trained graph attention network and the updated MKG to generate the visit embeddings to represent patientâ€™s historical visits, and predict the diagnosis in future visit, through a fine-tuning approach. Experimental results on real world EHR corpus are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, compared to a series of state-of-the-art baselines.11The source code and knowledge graph data have been anonymously uploaded to https://github.com/1317375434/MendMKG.
