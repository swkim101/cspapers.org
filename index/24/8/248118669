. While significant progress has been made in deep video denoising, it remains very challenging for exploiting historical and future frames. Bidirectional recurrent networks (BiRNN) have exhibited appealing performance in several video restoration tasks. However, BiRNN is intrinsically offline because it uses backward recurrent modules to propagate from the last to current frames, which causes high latency and large memory consumption. To address the offline issue of BiRNN, we present a novel recurrent network consisting of with constant latency and memory consumption. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/nagejacob/FloRNN .
