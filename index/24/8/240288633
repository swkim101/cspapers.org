We propose a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism called 2D-2FA to address security and usability issues in existing methods. 2D-2FA has three distinguishing features: First, after a user enters a username and password on a login terminal, a unique identifier is displayed to her. She inputs the same identifier on her registered 2FA device, which ensures appropriate engagement in the authentication process. Second, a one-time PIN is computed on the device and automatically transferred to the server. Thus, the PIN can have very high entropy, making guessing attacks infeasible. Third, the identifier is also incorporated into the PIN computation, which renders concurrent attacks ineffective. Third-party services such as push-notification providers and 2FA service providers, do not need to be trusted for the security of the system. The choice of identifiers depends on the device form factor and the context. Users could choose to draw patterns, capture QR codes, etc. We provide a proof of concept implementation, and evaluate performance, accuracy, and usability of the system. We show that the system offers a lower error rate (about half) and better efficiency (2-3 times faster) compared to the commonly used PIN-2FA. Our study indicates a high level of usability with a SUS of 75, and a high perception of efficiency, security, accuracy, and adoptability.
