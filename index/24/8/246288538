Recently, knowledge-graph-enhanced recommendation systems have attracted much attention, since knowledge graph (KG) can help improving the dataset quality and offering rich semantics for explainable recommendation. However, current KG-enhanced solutions focus on analyzing user behaviors on the product level and lack effective approaches to extract user preference towards product category, which is essential for better recommendation because users shopping online normally have strong preference towards distinctive product categories, not merely on products, according to various user studies. Moreover, the existing pure embedding-based recommendation methods can only utilize KGs with a limited size, which is not adaptable to many real-world applications. In this paper, we generalize the recommendation problem with preference mining as a compound knowledge reasoning task and propose a novel multi-agent system, called Mcore, which can promote model performance by mining usersâ€™ high-level interests and is adaptable to large KGs. Specifically, we split the overall problem and allocate sub-task to each agent: Coordinate Agent takes charge of recognizing the product-category preference of current user, while Relation Agent and Entity Agent perform KG reasoning cooperatively from a user node towards the preferred categories and terminate at a product node as recommendation. To train this heterogeneous multi-agent system, where agents own various functionalities, we propose an asynchronous reinforcement training pipeline, called Multi-agent Collaborative Learning. The extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of Mcore on recommendation tasks.
