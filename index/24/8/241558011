We demo MPBond, a novel multipath transport system allowing multiple personal mobile devices to collaboratively fetch content from the Internet. Inspired by the success of MPTCP, MPBond applies the concept of distributed multipath transport where multiple subflows can traverse different devices. Other key design aspects of MPBond include a device/connection management scheme, a buffering strategy, a packet scheduling algorithm, and a policy framework tailored to MPBond's architecture. We install MPBond on commodity mobile devices and show how easy it is to configure the usage of MPBond for unmodified apps. We visualize the runtime behavior of MPBond to further illustrate its design. We also demonstrate the download time and energy reduction of file download, as well as the video streaming QoE improvement with MPBond.
