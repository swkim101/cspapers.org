Federated learning (FL) is a challenging setting for optimization due to the heterogeneity of the data across different clients which can cause a client drift phenomenon. In fact, designing an algorithm for FL that is uniformly better than simple centralized training has been a major open problem thus far. In this work, we propose a general algorithmic framework, M IME , which i) mitigates client drift and ii) adapts an arbitrary centralized optimization algorithm such as momentum and Adam to the cross-device federated learning setting. M IME uses a combination of control-variates and server-level optimizer state (e.g. momentum) at every client-update step to ensure that each local update mimics that of the centralized method run on i.i.d. data. We prove a reduction result showing that M IME can translate the convergence of a generic algorithm in the centralized setting into convergence in the federated setting. Moreover, we show that, when combined with momentum-based variance reduction, M IME is provably faster than any centralized method –the ﬁrst such result. We also perform a thorough experimental exploration of M IME ’s performance on real world datasets (implemented here).
