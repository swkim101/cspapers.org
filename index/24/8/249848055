Integrating high-level context information with low-level details is of central importance in semantic segmentation. Towards this end, most existing segmentation models apply bilinear up-sampling and convolutions to feature maps of different scales, and then align them at the same resolution. However, bilinear up-sampling blurs the precise information learned in these feature maps and convolutions incur extra computation costs. To address these issues, we propose the Implicit Feature Alignment function (IFA). Our method is inspired by the rapidly expanding topic of implicit neural representations, where coordinate-based neural networks are used to designate fields of signals. In IFA, feature vectors are viewed as representing a 2D field of information. Given a query coordinate, nearby feature vectors with their relative coordinates are taken from the multi-level feature maps and then fed into an MLP to generate the corresponding output. As such, IFA implicitly aligns the feature maps at different levels and is capable of producing segmentation maps in arbitrary resolutions. We demonstrate the efficacy of IFA on multiple datasets, including Cityscapes, PASCAL Context, and ADE20K. Our method can be combined with improvement on various architectures, and it achieves state-of-the-art computation-accuracy trade-off on common benchmarks.
