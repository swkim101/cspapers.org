In this demo we present Scriptoria, an online crowdsourcing system to tackle the complex transcription process of classical orchestral scores. The system’s requirements are based on experts’ feedback from classical orchestra members. The architecture enables an end-to-end transcription process (from PDF to MEI) using a scalable microtask design. Reliability, stability, task and UI design were also evaluated and improved through Focus Group Discussions. Finally, we gathered valuable comments on the transcription process itself alongside future additions that could greatly enhance current practices in their field.
