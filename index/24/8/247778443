Learning under a continuously changing data distribution with incorrect labels is a desirable real-world problem yet challenging. A large body of continual learning (CL) methods, however, assumes data streams with clean labels, and online learning scenarios under noisy data streams are yet underexplored. We consider a more practical CL task setup of an online learning from blurry data stream with corrupted labels, where existing CL methods struggle. To address the task, we first argue the importance of both diversity and purity of examples in the episodic memory of continual learning models. To balance diversity and purity in the episodic memory, we propose a novel strategy to manage and use the memory by a unified approach of label noise aware diverse sampling and robust learning with semi-supervised learning. Our empirical validations on four real-world or synthetic noise datasets (CI-FAR10 and 100, mini-WebVision, and Food-101N) exhibit that our method significantly outperforms prior arts in this realistic and challenging continual learning scenario.
