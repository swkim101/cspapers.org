The pursuit of manufacturing cost reduction reshaped the conventional system-on-chip (SoC) design and manufacturing flow into the horizontal business model. In this model, the design house loses control of the design during the manufacturing process. Therefore, this shift has introduced potential vulnerabilities at each stage of the flow and provides adversaries ample opportunities to cause piracy, security, and trust concerns. Further, SoCs deployed in IoT, smart, and mission-critical devices contain sensitive assets to perform security-critical applications, requiring an on-chip security engine (SE) to ensure protecting assets and secure operation throughout the lifecycle. In this paper, we present an end-to-end secure SoC lifecycle management flow that establishes trust at each stage of the manufacturing process, prevents potential security threats, provides secure provisioning schemes, and protects the chip from in-field and supply chain vulnerabilities.
