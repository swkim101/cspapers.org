The encapsulation of clove essential oil (CEO) in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) and the subsequent incorporation of the inclusion complex in an elastic chitosan film in order to achieve a controlled release profile of the volatile CEO are herein presented. Freshly distilled CEO was found to contain eugenol in concentrations higher than 70%. The kneading method was implemented for the preparation of a CEO-HP-β-CD inclusion complex, resulting in a 50% inclusion efficiency of the essential oil in particles sized 214.40 nm with ζ-potential −27.5 mV. Free CEO and CEO-HP-β-CD inclusion complex were tested for their ability to scavenge the 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, and it was found that the CEO-HP-β-CD complex presented enhanced antioxidant activity (88%) compared to the free CEO (71%). Choline chloride-containing chitosan (CS) films were prepared, incorporating either the pure CEO or the CEO-HP-β-CD inclusion complex, and their mechanical properties were determined. The study of the release profile in different pH values demonstrated the capacity of the CS-HP-β-CD system to provide sustained release of CEO, noting its potential use in food processing as smart packaging.
