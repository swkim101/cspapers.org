Gaussian Processes (GPs) deﬁne distributions over functions and their generalization capabilities depend heavily on the choice of kernels. In this paper, we propose a novel structure-aware random Fourier (SRF) kernel for GPs that brings several beneﬁts when modeling graph-structured data. First, SRF kernel is deﬁned with a spectral distribution based on the Fourier duality given by the Bochner’s theorem, transforming the kernel learning problem to a distribution inference problem. Second, SRF kernel admits a random Fourier feature formulation that makes the kernel scalable for optimization. Third, SRF kernel enables to leverage geometric structures by taking subgraphs as inputs. To effectively optimize GPs with SRF kernel, we develop a variational EM algorithm, which alternates between an inference procedure (E-step) and a learning procedure (M-step). Experimental results on ﬁve real-world datasets show that our model can achieve state-of-the-art performance in two typical graph learning tasks, i.e., object classiﬁcation and link prediction.
