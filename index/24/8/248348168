We consider multi-label classification in the context of complex hierarchical relationships organized into an ontology. These situations are ubiquitous in learning problems on the web and in science, where rich domain models are developed but labeled data is rare. Most existing solutions model the problem as a sequence of simpler problems: one classifier for each level in the hierarchy, or one classifier for each label. These approaches require more training data, which is often unavailable in practice: as the ontology grows in size and complexity, it becomes unlikely to find training examples for all expected combinations. In this paper, we learn offline representations of the ontology using a graph autoencoder and separately learn to classify input records, reducing dependence on training data: Since the relationships between labels are encoded independently of training data, the model can make predictions even for underrepresented labels, naturally generalize to DAG-structured ontologies, remain robust to low-data regimes, and, with minor offline retraining, tolerate evolving ontologies. We show empirically that our label predictions respect the hierarchy (predicting a descendant implies predicting its ancestors) and propose a method of evaluating hierarchy violations that properly ignores irrelevant violations. Our main result is that our model outperforms all state-of-the-art models on 17 of 20 datasets across multiple domains by a significant margin, even with limited training data.
