We present LIVE, a system enabling a life-immersive Mixed Reality experience. Daily MR usage is challenging in that the user's interaction state with the physical objects continuously change over time, while the immersion and the utility should be supported simultaneously in the process. As many works of blending the virtual and physical world are designed for a single interaction state, they are not enough to support life-immersive MR. We propose the initial design of LIVE that (i) selects the current user's context among the three states of interaction with physical object and (ii) applies the most suitable blending method to balance immersion and the utility.
