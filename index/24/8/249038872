An opinion tag is a sequence of words on a specific aspect of a product or service. Opinion tags reflect key characteristics of product reviews and help users quickly understand their content in e-commerce portals. The task of abstractive opinion tagging has previously been proposed to automatically generate a ranked list of opinion tags for a given review. However, current models for opinion tagging are not personalized, even though personalization is an essential ingredient of engaging user interactions, especially in e-commerce. In this paper, we focus on the task of personalized abstractive opinion tagging. There are two main challenges when developing models for the end-to-end generation of personalized opinion tags: sparseness of reviews and difficulty to integrate multi-type signals, i.e., explicit review signals and implicit behavioral signals. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end model, named POT, that consists of three main components: (1) a review-based explicit preference tracker component based on a hierarchical heterogeneous review graph to track user preferences from reviews; (2)a behavior-based implicit preference tracker component using a heterogeneous behavior graph to track the user preferences from implicit behaviors; and (3) a personalized rank-aware tagging component to generate a ranked sequence of personalized opinion tags. In our experiments, we evaluate POT on a real-world dataset collected from e-commerce platforms and the results demonstrate that it significantly outperforms strong baselines.
