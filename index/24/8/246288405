Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models have shown to be effective in a wide range of machine learning applications, and tabular data generation process has not been an exception. Notably, some state-of-the-art models of tabular data generation, such as CTGAN, TableGan, MedGAN, etc. are based on GAN models. Even though these models have resulted in superiour performance in generating artificial data when trained on a range of datasets, there is a lot of room (and desire) for improvement. Not to mention that existing methods do have some weaknesses other than performance. E.g., the current methods focus only on the performance of the model, and limited emphasis is given to the interpretation of the model. Secondly, the current models operate on raw features only, and hence they fail to exploit any prior knowledge on explicit feature interactions that can be utilized during data generation process. To alleviate the two above-mentioned limitations, in this work, we propose a novel tabular data generation model– Generative Adversarial Network modelling inspired from Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression’s relationship (GANBLR), which can not only address the interpretation limitation in existing tabular GAN-based models but can provide capability to handle explicit feature interactions. By extensively evaluating on wide range of datasets, we demonstrate GANBLR’S superiour performance as well as better interpretable capability (explanation of feature importance in the synthetic generation process) as compared to existing state-of-the-art tabular data generation models.
