We study the problem of supervised contrastive (SupCon) learning on graphs. The SupCon loss has been recently proposed for classification tasks by pulling data points in the same class closer than those of different classes. However, it could be difficult for SupCon to handle datasets with large intra-class variances and high inter-class similarities. This issue is also challenging when it couples with graph structures. To address this, we present the cluster-aware supervised contrastive learning loss (ClusterSCL1) for graph learning tasks. The main idea of ClusterSCL is to retain the structural and attribute properties of a graph in the form of nodesâ€™ cluster distributions during supervised contrastive learning. Specifically, ClusterSCL introduces the strategy of cluster-aware data augmentation and integrates it with the SupCon loss. Extensive experiments on several widely adopted graph benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of ClusterSCL over the cross-entropy, SupCon, and other graph contrastive objectives.
