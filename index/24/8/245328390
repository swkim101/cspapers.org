This paper deals with unknown input interval observers for discrete-time linear switched systems. A new structure of interval observer is used to overcome the design difficulty of coordinate transformation often used in such context. The interval observer gains are computed by solving Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) derived from multiple quadratic Lyapunov functions (MQLF) under average dwell time switching signals.
