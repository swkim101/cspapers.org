A novel algorithm to detect road lanes in the eigen-lane space is proposed in this paper. First, we introduce the notion of eigenlanes, which are data-driven descriptors for structurally diverse lanes, including curved, as well as straight, lanes. To obtain eigenlanes, we perform the best rank-M approximation of a lane matrix containing all lanes in a training set. Second, we generate a set of lane candi-dates by clustering the training lanes in the eigenlane space. Third, using the lane candidates, we determine an optimal set of lanes by developing an anchor-based detection net-work, called SIIC-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides excellent detection performance for structurally diverse lanes.
