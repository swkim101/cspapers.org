Analytic approximations are presented for the response of buckling-mode electrothermal actuators with very slender beams with a width-to-length ratio of W/L≤0.001 of the type found in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). The results are found as closed-form solutions to the Euler beam bending theory rather than by an iterative numerical solution or a time-consuming finite element analysis. Expressions for transverse deflections and stiffness are presented for actuators with the common raised cosine and chevron pre-buckled shapes. The approximations are valid when the effects of bending dominate over those of axial compression. A few higher-order approximations are also presented for less slender beams with 0.001≤W/L≤0.01.
