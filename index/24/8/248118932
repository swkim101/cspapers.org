Although vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved great success in computer vision, the heavy computational cost hampers their applications to dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation on mobile devices. In this paper, we present a mobile-friendly architecture named Token Pyramid Vision Transformer (TopFormer). The proposed TopFormer takes Tokens from various scales as input to produce scale-aware semantic features, which are then in-Jected into the corresponding tokens to augment the representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms CNN- and ViT-based networks across several semantic segmentation datasets and achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and latency. On the ADE20K dataset, TopFormer achieves 5% higher accuracy in mIoU than MobileNetV3 with lower latency on an ARM-based mobile device. Furthermore, the tiny version of TopFormer achieves real-time inference on an ARM-based mobile device with competitive results.
