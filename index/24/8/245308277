The present paper proposes a strategy to effectively address the increasingly important problem of optimal control for nonlinear singularly perturbed or interconnected systems. Based on multi-model approach and fuzzy fusion technique, the proposed composite controller design provides a near optimal results without the need to solve the nonlinear Hamilton- Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and guarantees the asymptotic stability of the controlled studied systems. Moreover, it achieves a decrease to the computational complexity of the full order optimal control problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.
