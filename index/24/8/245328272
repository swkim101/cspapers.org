The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects that can provide a series of new services for the next wave of technological innovation. The Internet of Things is developing rapidly, during which machines and devices are connected via wireless or wired networks. This technology brings many advantages. Facilities in many fields, such as urban smart building management, industrial medical, agricultural energy and other security conditions. However, there are many issues that need to be resolved, such as resource constraints, heterogeneity, mobility, and architecture. In the remainder of this article, we propose a new approach based on a merger algorithm that combines passwords and image functions to increase the pattern structureâ€™s randomness and security, and we have developed a combination of encryption and blockchain techniques. This method ensures that the image validation system is protected when accepting default specifications for confidentiality and safety information by sending the model from a recorder to the Nodes database. So, our system secures confidentiality and availability. Thus, we use the blockchain to perform and access secure data. The experimental result shows that our model is more precise than the literature.
