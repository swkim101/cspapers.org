AI/ML systems have been deployed in both SoC design/architecture as well as in semiconductor manufacturing over the years. These systems have been independent of each other with process design kits (PDK) being the interface between design and manufacturing. Recent advances in packaging technology and the adoption of chiplet architecture has opened exciting avenues for merged AI/ML systems that bring SoC architecture and manufacturing together. This work explores this opportunity of enabling an AI/ML system that brings manufacturing and design information together for chiplet architecture exploration
