We present a novel high-resolution and challenging stereo dataset framing indoor scenes annotated with dense and accurate ground-truth disparities. Peculiar to our dataset is the presence of several specular and transparent surfaces, i.e. the main causes of failures for state-of-the-art stereo networks. Our acquisition pipeline leverages a novel deep space-time stereo framework which allows for easy and accurate labeling with sub-pixel precision. We re-lease a total of 419 samples collected in 64 different scenes and annotated with dense ground-truth disparities. Each sample include a high-resolution pair (12 Mpx) as well as an unbalanced pair (Left: 12 Mpx, Right: 1.1 Mpx). Additionally, we provide manually annotated material segmentation masks and 15K unlabeled samples. We evaluate state-of-the-art deep networks based on our dataset, highlighting their limitations in addressing the open challenges in stereo and drawing hints for future research.
