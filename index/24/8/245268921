Currently, there have been many kinds of pointbased 3D trackers, while voxel-based methods are still underexplored. In this paper, we first propose a voxel-based tracker, named PointSiamRCNN, improving tracking performance by embedding target information into the search region. Our framework is composed of two parts for achieving proposal generation and proposal refinement, which fully releases the potential of the two-stage object tracking. Specifically, it takes advantage of efficient feature learning of the voxel-based Siamese network and high-quality proposal generation of the Siamese region proposal network head. In the search region, the groundtruth annotations are utilized to realize semantic segmentation, which leads to more discriminative feature learning with pointwise supervisions. Furthermore, we propose the Self and Cross Attention Module for embedding target information into the search region. Finally, the multi-scale RoI pooling module is proposed to obtain compact representations from target-aware features for proposal refinement. Exhaustive experiments on the KITTI tracking dataset demonstrate that our framework reaches the competitive performance with the state-of-the-art 3D tracking methods and achieves the state-of-the-art in terms of BEV tracking.
