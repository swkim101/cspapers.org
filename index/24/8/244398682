Image style transfer aims to transfer the styles of artworks onto arbitrary photographs to create novel artistic images. Although style transfer is inherently an underdetermined problem, existing approaches usually assume a deterministic solution, thus failing to capture the full distribution of possible outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a Diverse Image Style Transfer (DIST) framework which achieves significant diversity by enforcing an invertible cross-space mapping. Specifically, the framework consists of three branches: disentanglement branch, inverse branch, and stylization branch. Among them, the disentanglement branch factorizes artworks into content space and style space; the inverse branch encourages the invertible mapping between the latent space of input noise vectors and the style space of generated artistic images; the stylization branch renders the input content image with the style of an artist. Armed with these three branches, our approach is able to synthesize significantly diverse stylized images without loss of quality. We conduct extensive experiments and comparisons to evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
