Though widely used in industry, traditional task-oriented dialogue systems suffer from three bottlenecks: (i) difficult ontology construction (e.g., intents and slots); (ii) poor controllability and interpretability; (iii) annotation-hungry. In this paper, we propose to represent utterance with a simpler concept named Dialogue Action, upon which we construct a tree-structured TaskFlow and further build task-oriented chatbot with TaskFlow as core component. A framework is presented to automatically construct TaskFlow from large-scale dialogues and deploy online. Our experiments on real-world after-sale customer services show TaskFlow can satisfy the major needs, as well as reduce the developer burden effectively.
