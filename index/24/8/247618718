The goal of recommender systems is to provide ordered item lists to users that best match their interests. As a critical task in the recommendation pipeline, re-ranking has received increasing attention in recent years. In contrast to conventional ranking models that score each item individually, re-ranking aims to explicitly model the mutual influences among items to further refine the ordering of items given an initial ranking list. In this paper, we present a personalized re-ranking model (dubbed PEAR) based on contextualized transformer. PEAR makes several major improvements over the existing methods. Specifically, PEAR not only captures feature-level and item-level interactions, but also models item contexts from both the initial ranking list and the historical clicked item list. In addition to item-level ranking score prediction, we also augment the training of PEAR with a list-level classification task to assess usersâ€™ satisfaction on the whole ranking list. Experimental results on both public and production datasets have shown the superior effectiveness of PEAR compared to the previous re-ranking models.
