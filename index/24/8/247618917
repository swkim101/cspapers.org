Autonomous driving requires the model to perceive the environment and (re)act within a low latency for safety. While past works ignore the inevitable changes in the environment after processing, streaming perception is proposed to jointly evaluate the latency and accuracy into a single metric for video online perception. In this paper, instead of searching trade-offs between accuracy and speed like previous works, we point out that endowing real-time models with the ability to predict the future is the key to dealing with this problem. We build a simple and effective frame-work for streaming perception. It equips a novel Dual-Flow Perception module (DFP), which includes dynamic and static flows to capture the moving trend and basic detection feature for streaming prediction. Further, we introduce a Trend-Aware Loss (TAL) combined with a trend factor to generate adaptive weights for objects with different moving speeds. Our simple method achieves competitive performance on Argoverse-HD dataset and improves the AP by 4.9% compared to the strong baseline, validating its effectiveness.
