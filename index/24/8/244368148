 This paper presents a proposal for a density-adaptive design of bone screws using pedicle screws for spinal fixations as an example. The basis is the analysis and categorization of currently available variants of bone screws, which differ in principle in their thread design because of different application areas (cortical or cancellous bone). These screw variants are investigated in FEA simulations for pullout and bending with regard to occurring stresses. A corresponding simulation model is presented for this purpose. The precise design models for these screws are generated in a CAD system using a self-developed configuration tool. Based on the FEA evaluation, the proposal for a new pedicle screw design, consisting of several thread types merged into each other, is described in detail. By integrating different thread types over the shaft, the respective properties of the bone can thus be optimally utilized.
