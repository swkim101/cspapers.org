Multi-tenancy emerged as a software architecture pattern in an effort to optimize the use of compute resources and minimize the operational cost of large scale deployments. Its applicability, however, needs to take into account each particular context as the challenges of this software architecture pattern may not make it an optimal choice in every situation. A Smart City Platform is by definition a type of software that is also expected to be deployed at a large scale. The applicability of the multi-tenancy architecture pattern in this context is debatable as the benefits it brings may not outweigh the challenges.
