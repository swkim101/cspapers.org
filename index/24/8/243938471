We consider an information dissemination problem where the root of an undirected graph constantly updates its information. The goal is to keep every other node in the graph about the root as freshly informed as possible. Our synchronous information spreading model uses telephone calls at each time step, in which any node can call at most one neighbor, thus forming a matching over which information is transmitted at each step. We introduce two problems in minimizing two natural objectives (Maximum and Average) of the latency of the root's information at all nodes in the network. After deriving a simple reduction from the maximum rooted latency problem to the well-studied minimum broadcast time problem, we focus on the average rooted latency version. We introduce a natural problem of finding a finite schedule that minimizes the average broadcast time from a root. We show that any average rooted latency induces a solution to this average broadcast problem within a constant factor and conversely, this average broadcast time is within a logarithmic factor of the average rooted latency. Then, by approximating the average broadcast time problem via rounding a time-indexed linear programming relaxation, we obtain a logarithmic approximation to the average latency problem. Surprisingly, we show that using the average broadcast time for average rooted latency introduces this necessary logarithmic factor overhead even in trees. We overcome this hurdle and give a 40-approximation for trees. For this, we design an algorithm to find near-optimal locally-periodic schedules in trees where each vertex receives information from its parent in regular intervals. On the other side, we show how such well-behaved schedules approximate the optimal schedule within a constant factor.
