Recently, transformer-based methods have achieved promising progresses in object detection, as they can eliminate the post-processes like NMS and enrich the deep representations. However, these methods cannot well cope with scene text due to its extreme variance of scales and aspect ratios. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective transformer-based architecture for scene text detection. Different from previous approaches that learn robust deep representations of scene text in a holistic manner, our method performs scene text detection based on a few representative features, which avoids the disturbance by background and reduces the computational cost. Specifically, we first select a few representative features at all scales that are highly relevant to foreground text. Then, we adopt a transformer for modeling the relationship of the sampled features, which effectively divides them into reasonable groups. As each feature group corresponds to a text instance, its bounding box can be easily obtained without any post-processing operation. Using the basic feature pyramid network for feature extraction, our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several popular datasets for scene text detection.
