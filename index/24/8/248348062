Headache disorders are experienced by many people around the world. In current clinical practice, the follow-up and diagnosis of headache disorder patients only happens intermittently, based on subjective data self-reported by the patient. The mBrain system tries to make this process more continuous, autonomous and objective by additionally collecting contextual and physiological data via a wearable, mobile app and machine learning algorithms. To support the monitoring of headache symptoms during attacks for headache classification and the detection of headache triggers, much knowledge and contextual data is available from heterogeneous sources, which can be consolidated with semantics. This paper presents a demonstrator of knowledge-driven services that perform these tasks using Semantic Web technologies. These services are deployed in a distributed cascading architecture that includes DIVIDE to derive and manage the RDF stream processing queries that perform the contextually relevant filtering in an intelligent and efficient way.
