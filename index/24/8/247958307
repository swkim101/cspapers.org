Representing visual signals by implicit representation (e.g., a coordinate based deep network) has prevailed among many vision tasks. This work explores a new intriguing direction: training a stylized implicit representation, using a generalized approach that can apply to various 2D and 3D scenarios. We conduct a pilot study on a variety of implicit functions, including 2D coordinate-based representation, neural radiance field, and signed distance function. Our solution is a Unified Implicit Neural Stylization framework, dubbed INS. In contrary to vanilla implicit representation, INS decouples the ordinary implicit function into a style implicit module and a content implicit module, in order to separately encode the representations from the style image and input scenes. An amalgamation module is then applied to aggregate these information and synthesize the stylized output. To regularize the geometry in 3D scenes, we propose a novel self-distillation geometry consistency loss which preserves the geometry fidelity of the stylized scenes. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on multiple task settings, including novel view synthesis of complex scenes, stylization for implicit surfaces, and fitting images using MLPs. We further demonstrate that the learned representation is continuous not only spatially but also style-wise, leading to effortlessly interpolating between different styles and generating images with new mixed styles.
