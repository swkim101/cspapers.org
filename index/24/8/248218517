Transformer-based models are widely used in natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, and multimodal transformers have been effective in visual-language tasks. This study explores distilling visual information from pretrained multimodal transformers to pretrained language encoders. Our framework is inspired by cross-modal encodersâ€™ success in visual-language tasks while we alter the learning objective to cater to the language-heavy characteristics of NLU. After training with a small number of extra adapting steps and finetuned, the proposed XDBERT (cross-modal distilled BERT) outperforms pretrained-BERT in general language understanding evaluation (GLUE), situations with adversarial generations (SWAG) benchmarks, and readability benchmarks. We analyze the performance of XDBERT on GLUE to show that the improvement is likely visually grounded.
