Recent years have witnessed a surge of approaches to use neural networks to help tackle combinatorial optimization problems, including graph optimization problems. However, theoretical understanding of such approaches remains limited. In this paper, we consider the geometric setting, where graphs are induced by points in a ﬁxed dimensional Euclidean space. It turns out that several graph optimization problems can be approximated (in a bicriteria manner) by an algorithm that runs in time linear in graph size n via a framework that we call the Baker-paradigm. A key advantage of the Baker-paradigm is that it decomposes the input problem into (at most linear number of) small sub-problems of bounded sizes (independent of the size of the input). For the family of such bounded-size sub-problems, we can now design neural networks with universal approximation guarantees to solve them. This leads to a mixed algorithmic-ML framework, which we call NN-Baker that has the capacity to approximately solve a family of graph optimization problems (e.g, maximum independent set and minimum vertex cover) in time linear in the input graph size. We instantiate our NN-Baker by a CNN version and GNN version, and demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our approach via a range of experiments.
