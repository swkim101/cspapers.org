SPARQL is the standard query language for RDF as stated by the W3C. It is a highly expressive querying language that contains the standard operations based on set algebra, as well as navigational operations found in graph querying languages. Because of this, there are various ways to represent the same query, which may lead to redundancy in applications of the Semantic Web such as caching systems. We propose a canonicalisation method as a solution, such that all (monotone) congruent queries will have the same canonical form. Despite the theoretical complexity of this problem, our experiments show a good performance over real-world queries. Finally, we anticipate applications in caching, log analysis, query optimisation, etc.
