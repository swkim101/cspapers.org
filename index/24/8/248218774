Few-shot learning (FSL) is an important and topical problem in computer vision that has motivated extensive research into numerous methods spanning from sophisticated metalearning methods to simple transfer learning baselines. We seek to push the limits of a simple-but-effective pipeline for real-worldfew-shot image classification in practice. To this end, we explore few-shot learning from the perspective of neural architecture, as well as a three stage pipeline of pre-training on external data, meta-training with labelled few-shot tasks, and task-specific fine-tuning on unseen tasks. We investigate questions such as: ① How pre-training on external data benefits FSL? ② How state of the art transformer architectures can be exploited? and ③ How to best exploit finetuning? Ultimately, we show that a simple transformer-based pipeline yields surprisingly good performance on standard benchmarks such as Mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS, CDFSL and Meta-Dataset.
