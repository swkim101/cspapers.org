We present a simple and concise semantics for temporal planning. Our semantics are developed and formalised in the logic of the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. We derive from those semantics a validation algorithm for temporal planning and show, using a formal proof in Isabelle/HOL, that this validation algorithm implements our semantics. We experimentally evaluate our verified validation algorithm and show that it is practical.
