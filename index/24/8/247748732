Recent neural human representations can produce high-quality multi-view rendering but require using dense multi-view inputs and costly training. They are hence largely limited to static models as training each frame is infeasible. We present HumanNeRF - a neural representation with efficient generalization ability - for high-fidelity free-view synthesis of dynamic humans. Analogous to how IBRNet assists NeRF by avoiding perscene training, HumanNeRF employs an aggregated pixel-alignment feature across multi-view inputs along with a pose embedded non-rigid deformation field for tackling dynamic motions. The raw Human-NeRF can already produce reasonable rendering on sparse video inputs of unseen subjects and camera settings. To further improve the rendering quality, we augment our solution with in-hour scene-specific fine-tuning, and an appearance blending module for combining the benefits of both neural volumetric rendering and neural texture blending. Extensive experiments on various multi-view dynamic hu-man datasets demonstrate effectiveness of our approach in synthesizing photo-realistic free-view humans under challenging motions and with very sparse camera view inputs.
