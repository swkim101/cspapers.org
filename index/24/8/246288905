Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the critical diagnostic tools in healthcare. Various deep learning models, except Transformers, have been explored and applied to map ECG patterns to heart abnormalities. Transformer models have been adopted from natural language processing to computer vision with advanced features. Most recently, vision transformers show exceptional performances, even on moderate-scale datasets. However, naively applying vision transformers on electrocardiogram datasets leads to poor results. In this paper, we propose a novel network called Beat-aligned Transformer (BaT), a hierarchical Transformer that sufficiently exploits the cyclicity of ECG. We organize and treat an input ECG as multiple aligned beats instead of a single time series. In the BaT, shifted-window-based Transformer blocks (SW Block) are adopted to learn the representation for each beat, and aggregation blocks are designed to exchange information among the beat representations. Nested SW Blocks and aggregation blocks form a beat-aware hierarchical structure of BaT. In this way, the new data format and the BaT hierarchical structure boost Transformer performance on ECG classification. From the experiments on public ECG datasets, we observe BaT outperforms other Transformer-based models and achieves competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.
