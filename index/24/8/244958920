In real-time scheduling theory, self-suspension describes the behavior that a job can suspend itself from the ready state and thus be exempted from the scheduling for the suspension duration. This behavior makes it non-trivial to resort to established concepts such as the busy-interval analysis to self-suspending task sets which is required to analyze the worst-case response time of tasks with backlog, e.g., arbitrary-deadline task sets. In this paper, we present a novel suspension-aware busy-interval analysis for dynamic self-suspension tasks where the inter-arrival time of subsequent jobs can be bounded by an arrival curve. Based on the general analysis, we provide worst-case response time analyses and hence sufficient schedulability tests for fixed-priority preemptive uniprocessor scheduling algorithms for arrival-curve constrained and sporadic self-suspension task systems with arbitrary deadlines. Moreover, we provide evaluations based on synthetically generated task sets that show that our method indeed exploits the optimism that is introduced when enlarging the relative deadline of tasks. We demonstrate that our approach improves the state of the art by considering arrival curves that are obtained from tasks with release jitter.
