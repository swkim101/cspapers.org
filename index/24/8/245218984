Answering complex questions about images is an ambitious goal for machine intelligence, which requires a joint understanding of images, text, and commonsense knowledge, as well as a strong reasoning ability. Recently, multimodal Transformers have made a great progress in the task of Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), by jointly understanding visual objects and text tokens through layers of cross-modality attention. However, these approaches do not utilize the rich structure of the scene and the interactions between objects which are essential in answering complex commonsense questions. We propose a
Scene Graph Enhanced Image-Text Learning (SGEITL) framework to incorporate visual scene graph in commonsense reasoning. In order to exploit the scene graph structure, at the model structure level, we propose a multihop graph transformer for regularizing attention interaction among hops. As for pre-training, a scene-graph-aware pre-training method is proposed to leverage structure knowledge extracted in visual scene graph. Moreover, we introduce a method to train and generate domain relevant visual scene graph using textual annotations in a weakly-supervised manner. Extensive experiments on VCR and other tasks show significant performance boost compared with the state-of-the-art methods, and prove the efficacy of each proposed component.
