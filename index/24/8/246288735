This work introduces DIVINIA, a feature extractor and novel training objective for content-based image retrieval. DIVINIA combines a semantic matching objective with a ranking objective to produce a feature extractor that is able to retrieve semantically relevant regions from a large search corpus. It further ranks them appropriately according to visual similarity. Furthermore, DIVINIA provides a mechanism for performing one-shot and even zero-shot object localization without the need to fine-tune the feature extraction model or re-index the corpus of search features. We demonstrate the capabilities of the DIVINIA system in the context of object localization in satellite imagery. We present quantitative and qualitative results that show robust domain transfer between satellite image optics and sensor modalities. We show good precision and search relevance ordering when returning areas of interest to specific object classes.
