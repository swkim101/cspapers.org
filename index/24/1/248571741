Estimating homography from an image pair is a fundamental problem in image alignment. Unsupervised learning methods have received increasing attention in this field due to their promising performance and label-free training. However, existing methods do not explicitly consider the problem of plane-induced parallax, which will make the predicted homography compromised on multiple planes. In this work, we propose a novel method HomoGAN to guide unsupervised homography estimation to focus on the dominant plane. First, a multi-scale transformer network is designed to predict homography from the feature pyramids of input images in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised GAN to impose coplanarity constraint on the predicted homography, which is realized by using a generator to predict a mask of aligned regions, and then a discriminator to check if two masked feature maps are induced by a single homography. To validate the effectiveness of HomoGAN and its components, we conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset, and results show that our matching error is 22% lower than the previous SOTA method.
