A wide variety of error tolerant applications supports the use of approximate circuits that achieve power savings by introducing small errors. This paper proposes a fast and novel algorithm for the design of such circuits with the goal of maximizing power savings, constrained by a fixed error budget, through an analytical expression to optimally select the number of bits to be approximated. This algorithm outperforms uniform approximation schemes by over 30% in power savings, with negligible computational overhead.
