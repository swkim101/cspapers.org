Multi-view anchor graph clustering selects representative anchors to avoid full pair-wise similarities and therefore reduce the complexity of graph methods. Although widely applied in large-scale applications, existing approaches do not pay sufficient attention to establishing correct correspondences between the anchor sets across views. To be specific, anchor graphs obtained from different views are not aligned column-wisely. Such an \textbf{A}nchor-\textbf{U}naligned \textbf{P}roblem (AUP) would cause inaccurate graph fusion and degrade the clustering performance. Under multi-view scenarios, generating correct correspondences could be extremely difficult since anchors are not consistent in feature dimensions. To solve this challenging issue, we propose the first study of the generalized and flexible anchor graph fusion framework termed \textbf{F}ast \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}nchor-\textbf{C}orrespondence \textbf{C}lustering (FMVACC). Specifically, we show how to find anchor correspondence with both feature and structure information, after which anchor graph fusion is performed column-wisely. Moreover, we theoretically show the connection between FMVACC and existing multi-view late fusion \cite{liu2018late} and partial view-aligned clustering \cite{huang2020partially}, which further demonstrates our generality. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Moreover, the proposed alignment module also shows significant performance improvement applying to existing multi-view anchor graph competitors indicating the importance of anchor alignment.
