Given two point sets A and B in ℝd of size n each, for some constant dimension d≥ 1, and a parameter ε>0, we present a deterministic algorithm that computes, in n·(ε−1 logn)O(d) time, a perfect matching between A and B whose cost is within a (1+ε) factor of the optimal matching under any ℓp-norm. Although a Monte-Carlo algorithm with a similar running time is proposed by Raghvendra and Agarwal [J. ACM 2020], the best-known deterministic ε-approximation algorithm takes Ω(n3/2) time. Our algorithm constructs a (refinement of a) tree cover of ℝd, and we develop several new tools to apply a tree-cover based approach to compute an ε-approximate perfect matching.
