Deep learning frameworks generally require sufficient training data to generalize well while fail to adapt on small or few-shot datasets. Meta-learning offers an effective means of tackling few-shot scenarios and has drawn increasing attention in recent years. Meta-optimization aims to learn a shared set of parameters across tasks for meta-learning while facing challenges in determining whether an initialization condition can be generalized to tasks with diverse distributions. In this regard, we propose a meta-gradient boosting framework that can fit diverse distributions based on a base learner (which learns shared information across tasks) and a series of gradient-boosted modules (which capture task-specific information). We evaluate the model on several few-shot learning benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in modulating task-specific meta-learned priors and handling diverse distributions.
