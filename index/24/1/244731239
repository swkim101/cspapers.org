Quantum computers are reaching a level where interactions between classical and quantum computations can happen in real-time. This marks the advent of a new, broader class of quantum circuits: dynamic quantum circuits. They offer a broader range of available computing primitives that lead to new challenges for design tasks such as simulation, compilation, and verification. Due to the non-unitary nature of dynamic circuit primitives, most existing techniques and tools for these tasks are no longer applicable in an out-of-the-box fashion. In this work, we discuss the resulting consequences for quantum circuit verification, specifically equivalence checking, and propose two different schemes that eventually allow to treat the involved circuits as if they did not contain non-unitaries at all. As a result, we demonstrate methodically, as well as, experimentally that existing techniques for verifying the equivalence of quantum circuits can be kept applicable for this broader class of circuits.
