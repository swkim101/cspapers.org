Computer architecture design space is vast and complex. Tools are needed to explore new ideas and gain insights quickly, at low effort and desired accuracy. Cycle Accurate Simulators (CAS), commonly used to explore computer designs, can be slow and cumbersome to develop. We propose a complementary approach, Calipers, a criticality-based framework, to model key abstractions of complex architectures and a program's execution using dynamic event-dependence graphs. By applying graph algorithms, Calipers can track instruction and event dependencies, compute critical paths, and analyze architecture bottlenecks. By manipulating the graph, Calipers enables investigation of a wide range of Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and microarchitecture design choices/"what-if" scenarios during both early- and late-stage design space exploration without recompiling and rerunning the program. Calipers can model in-order and out-of-order microarchitectures, structural hazards, and different types of ISAs, and can evaluate multiple ideas in a single run. Related modeling algorithms are described in detail. We apply Calipers to explore and gain insights in a variety of complex microarchitectural and ISA ideas for RISC and EDGE processors, at lower effort than CAS and with comparable accuracy. For example, experiments show that targeting only a fraction of critical loads can help realize most benefits of value prediction.
