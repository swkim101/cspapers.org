Concentric Tube Robots (CTR) have been gaining ground in minimally-invasive robotic surgeries due to their small footprint, compliance, and high dexterity. CTRs can assure safe interaction with soft tissue, provided that precise and effective motion control is achieved. Controlling the motion of CTRs is still challenging. Commonly used model-based control approaches often employ simplified geometric/dynamic assumptions, which could be very inaccurate in the presence of unmodelled disturbances and external interaction forces. Additionally, application of emerging data-driven algorithms in real-time control of CTRs is limited due to the fact that these controllers require considerable amount of time to let the algorithm develop enough to reach a desired accuracy and relevancy. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach to overcome the aforementioned difficulties. This hybrid solution uses the solution of a kinematic model of the robot to estimate initial values for a model-free data-driven method. The proposed algorithm combines both model-based and data-driven algorithms to provide real-time motion control of CTRs interacting with an unknown external environment. Three different simulations studies were performed to thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of the proposed hybrid control approach as compared to two common model-based and data-driven control techniques. The results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method. The root-mean-square error of the proposed hybrid approach is less than 1.1 mm, which is 9 times less than a common model-based controller.
