In order to improve the reliability of dynamic wireless LAN (WLAN) network systems such as a vehicular network system for traffic accident prevention, testing the system software is important. Network emulation enables to test the practical software of the system without building a physical network. Many existing network emulators are built by using a virtual Ethernet device named TUN/TAP device for enabling a network simulator to capture Ethernet frames. However, the network emulation with the TUN/TAP device cannot emulate the operation of the WLAN protocols such as ETSI DCC, which dynamically changes transmission power and interval based on receive signal strength indication (RSSI), because the TUN/TAP device cannot capture IEEE 802.11 frames and control parameters such as transmission power, RSSI. In previous work, we developed a wireless network tap device (wtap80211) and proposed a vehicular network emulator using wtap80211. In the demonstration, we will demonstrate the capability of our emulator using its prototype.
