As users navigate the web they face a multitude of threats; among them, attacks that result in account compromise can be particularly devastating. In a world fraught with data breaches and sophisticated phishing attacks, web services strive to fortify user accounts by adopting new mechanisms that identify and prevent suspicious login attempts. More recently, browser ﬁngerprinting techniques have been incorporated into the authentication workﬂow of major services as part of their decision-making process for triggering additional security mechanisms (e.g., two-factor authentication). In this paperwe present the ﬁrst comprehensive and in-depth exploration of the security implications of real-world systems relying on browser ﬁngerprints for authentication. Guided by ourinvestigation,we developa toolforautomaticallyconstruct-ing ﬁngerprinting vectors that replicate the process of target websites, enabling the extraction of ﬁngerprints from users’ devices that exactly match those generated by target websites. Subsequently, we demonstrate how phishing attackers can replicate users’ ﬁngerprints on different devices to deceive the risk-based authentication systems of high-value web services (e.g., cryptocurrency trading) to completely bypass two-factor authentication . To gain a better understanding of whether attackers can carry out such attacks, we study the evolution of browserﬁngerprinting practices in phishing websites overtime. While attackers do not generally collect all the necessary ﬁngerprinting attributes, unfortunately that is not the case for attackers targeting certain ﬁnancial institutions where we observe an increasing number of phishing sites capable of pulling off our attacks. To address the signiﬁcant threat posed by our attack, we have disclosed our ﬁndings to the vulnerable vendors.
