Microservice design offers many advantages for enterprise applications, including increased scalability and faster deployment times. Microservices’ independence from one another in development and deployment provides these advantages. This separation, however, results in the absence of a centralized view of the application’s functionality, and each microservice’s data model is isolated and replicated. As a result, it has the potential to deviate from the architectural design’s original intent. To address this, we offer a method for analyzing a microservice mesh and generating a communication diagram, context map, and microservice-specific limited contexts using static code analysis.
