We study linear and kernel classiﬁcation in the streaming model. For linear clas-siﬁcation, we improve upon the algorithm of [1], which solves the (cid:96) 1 point query problem on the optimal weight vector w ∗ ∈ R d in sublinear space. We ﬁrst give an algorithm solving the more difﬁcult (cid:96) 2 point query problem on w ∗ , also in sublinear space. We then give an algorithm which solves the related (cid:96) 2 heavy hitter problem on w ∗ , in sublinear space and running time. Finally, we give an algorithm which can deterministically solve the (cid:96) 1 point query problem on w ∗ , with sublinear space, improving upon that of [1]. For kernel classiﬁcation, if w ∗ ∈ R d p is the optimal weight vector classifying points in the stream according to their p th -degree polynomial kernel, then we give an algorithm solving the (cid:96) 2 point query problem on w ∗ in poly ( p log d ε ) space, and an algorithm solving the (cid:96) 2 heavy hitter problem in poly ( p log d ε ) space and running time. Note that our space and running time is polynomial in p , making our algorithms well-suited to high-degree polynomial kernels and the Gaussian kernel (approximated by the polynomial kernel of degree p = Θ(log T ) ). Our algorithms for kernels are in fact a special case of a more general algorithm we give for low-rank tensor inputs.
