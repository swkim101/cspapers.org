Artificial neural nets can represent and classify many types of data but are often tailored to particular applications -- e.g., for"fair"or"hierarchical"classification. Once an architecture has been selected, it is often difficult for humans to adjust models for a new task; for example, a hierarchical classifier cannot be easily transformed into a fair classifier that shields a protected field. Our contribution in this work is a new neural network architecture, the concept subspace network (CSN), which generalizes existing specialized classifiers to produce a unified model capable of learning a spectrum of multi-concept relationships. We demonstrate that CSNs reproduce state-of-the-art results in fair classification when enforcing concept independence, may be transformed into hierarchical classifiers, or even reconcile fairness and hierarchy within a single classifier. The CSN is inspired by existing prototype-based classifiers that promote interpretability.
