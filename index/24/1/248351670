Understanding and prediction of spreading phenomena are vital for numerous applications. The massive availability of social network data provides a platform for studying spreading phenomena. Past works studying and predicting spreading phenomena have explored the spread in dimensions of time and volume, such as predicting total infected users, predicting popularity, predicting the time when content receives a threshold number of infected users. However, as the information spreads from user to user, it also spreads from location to location. In this paper, we attempt to predict the spread in the dimension of geographic space. In accordance with the past spreading prediction problems, we design our problem to predict the spatial spread at an early stage. For this, we utilized spatial features, social features, and emotion features. We feed these features into existing classification algorithms and evaluate on three datasets from Twitter.
