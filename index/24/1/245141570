An in-depth scene understanding usually requires recognizing all the objects and their relations in an image, encoded as a scene graph. Most existing approaches for scene graph generation ﬁrst independently recognize each object and then predict their relations independently. Though these approaches are very efﬁcient, they ignore the dependency between different objects as well as between their relations. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to jointly predict the entire scene graph by fully capturing the dependency between different objects and between their relations. Speciﬁcally, we establish a uniﬁed conditional random ﬁeld (CRF) to model the joint distribution of all the objects and their relations in a scene graph. We carefully design the potential functions to enable relational reasoning among different objects according to knowledge graph embedding methods. We further propose an efﬁcient and effective algorithm for inference based on mean-ﬁeld variational inference, in which we ﬁrst provide a warm initialization by independently predicting the objects and their relations according to the current model, followed by a few iterations of relational reasoning. Experimental results on both the relationship retrieval and zero-shot relationship retrieval tasks prove the efﬁciency and efﬁcacy of our proposed approach.
