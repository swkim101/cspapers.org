We quantify the robustness of a trained network to input uncertainties with a stochastic simulation inspired by the ﬁeld of Statistical Reliability Engineering. The robustness assessment is cast as a statistical hypothesis test: the network is deemed as locally robust if the estimated probability of failure is lower than a critical level. The procedure is based on an Importance Splitting simulation generating samples of rare events. We derive theoretical guarantees that are non-asymptotic w.r.t. sample size. Experiments tackling large scale networks outline the efﬁciency of our method making a low number of calls to the network function.
