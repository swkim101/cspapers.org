Langevin algorithms are gradient descent methods augmented with additive noise, and are widely used in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, optimization, and machine learning. In recent years, the non-asymptotic analysis of Langevin algorithms for non-convex learning has been extensively explored. For constrained problems with non-convex losses over a compact convex domain with IID data variables, the projected Langevin algorithm achieves a deviation of $O(T^{-1/4} (\log T)^{1/2})$ from its target distribution [27] in $1$-Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we obtain a deviation of $O(T^{-1/2} \log T)$ in $1$-Wasserstein distance for non-convex losses with $L$-mixing data variables and polyhedral constraints (which are not necessarily bounded). This improves on the previous bound for constrained problems and matches the best-known bound for unconstrained problems.
