Many soft robots are capable of significantly changing their shape, an ability that can offer advantages in many applications. For instance, such a robot can flatten its body to fit under small gaps and expand to move over large obstacles. Further, because these shape changes are usually driven by a pressurized fluid, if they act over a large area, they have the potential to apply large forces to the world. However, when these same shape changes are used for the locomotion of an untethered robot, they tend to result in slow forward movement. Here we present a hybrid soft-rigid elongated-sphere robot that decouples shape change from locomotion. Pairing a compliant, inflatable outer skin, which changes volume by 15x to both fit under and roll over obstacles and can lift objects up to 30 kg, with a wheeled internal carriage, we obtain relatively fast locomotion. A new two-sided controllable adhesive between the internal carriage and the skin enables the carriage to climb vertically inside the skin, allowing the robot to climb external obstacles. We present the design of the robot, simple modeling of its behavior, and experimental testing. Our work advances the area of hybrid soft-rigid robotics by demonstrating how leveraging the strengths of both soft and rigid systems can have quantifiable performance benefits.
