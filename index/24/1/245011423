We initiate the work towards a comprehensive picture of the worst average-case satisfaction of voting axioms in semi-random models, to provide a ﬁner and more realistic foundation for comparing voting rules. We adopt the semi-random model and formulation in [54], where an adversary chooses arbitrarily correlated “ground truth” preferences for the agents, on top of which random noises are added. We focus on characterizing the semi-random satisfaction of two well-studied voting axioms: Condorcet criterion and participation . We prove that for any ﬁxed number of alternatives, when the number of voters n is sufﬁciently large, the semi-random satisfaction of the Condorcet criterion under a wide range of voting rules is 1 , 1 − exp( − Θ( n )) , Θ( n − 0 . 5 ) , exp( − Θ( n )) , or being Θ(1) and 1 − Θ(1) at the same time; and the semi-random satisfaction of participation is 1 − Θ( n − 0 . 5 ) . Our results address open questions by Berg and Lepelley [3] in 1994, and also conﬁrm the following high-level message: the Condorcet criterion is a bigger concern than participation under realistic models.
