In this paper, we propose a simple analytical model for pneu-net soft actuator. The model is based on Eulerâ€“ Bernoulli finite strain hyperelastic thin cantilever beam theory. The deformation of the air chambers is modelled using infinitesimal strain membrane theory. The proposed theoretical model estimates the deformation and force characteristics of the actuator. The developed model accounts the axial stretch and forces applied to the actuator. The theoretical deformation and force characteristics of different actuators are compared with finite element (FE) model and experimental characteristics. The theoretically estimated deformation and force of the actuator are similar to the FE model, but the theoretical model computation time is less than 1% of the FE model.
