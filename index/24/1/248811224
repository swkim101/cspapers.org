As a rising task, panoptic segmentation is faced with challenges in both semantic segmentation and instance seg-mentation. However, in terms of speed and accuracy, ex-isting LiDAR methods in the field are still limited. In this paper, we propose a fast and high-performance LiDAR-basedframework, referred to as Panoptic-PHNet, with three attractive aspects: 1) We introduce a clustering pseudo heatmap as a new paradigm, which, followed by a cen-ter grouping module, yields instance centers for efficient clustering without object-level learning tasks. 2) A knn-transformer module is proposed to model the interaction among foreground points for accurate offset regression. 3) For backbone design, we fuse the fine- grained voxel features and the 2D Bird's Eye View (BEV) features with different receptive fields to utilize both detailed and global information. Extensive experiments on both SemanticKITTI dataset and nuScenes dataset show that our Panoptic-PHNet sur-passes state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins with a real-time speed. We achieve the 1st place on the public leaderboard of SemanticKITTI and leading performance on the recently released leaderboard of nuScenes.
