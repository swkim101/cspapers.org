Referring video object segmentation aims to predict foreground labels for objects referred by natural language expressions in videos. Previous methods either depend on 3D ConvNets or incorporate additional 2D ConvNets as encoders to extract mixed spatial-temporal features. However, these methods suffer from spatial misalignment or false distractors due to delayed and implicit spatial-temporal interaction occurring in the decoding phase. To tackle these limitations, we propose a Language-Bridged Duplex Transfer (LBDT) module which utilizes language as an intermediary bridge to accomplish explicit and adaptive spatial-temporal interaction earlier in the encoding phase. Concretely, cross-modal attention is performed among the temporal encoder, referring words and the spatial encoder to aggregate and transfer language-relevant motion and appearance information. In addition, we also propose a Bilateral Channel Activation (BCA) module in the decoding phase for further denoising and highlighting the spatial-temporal consistent features via channel-wise activation. Extensive experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art performances on four popular benchmarks with 6.8% and 6.9% absolute AP gains on A2D Sentences and J-HMDB Sentences respectively, while consuming around 7Ã— less computational overhead11https://github.com/dzh19990407/LBDT.
