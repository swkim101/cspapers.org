Traffic prediction is a crucial task in many real-world applications. The task is challenging due to the implicit and dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic data. On the one hand, the spatial dependencies among traffic flows are latent and fluctuate with environmental conditions. On the other hand, the temporal dependencies among traffic flows also vary significantly over time and locations. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Network (ASTCN) to tackle these challenges. First, we propose a spatial graph learning module that learns the dynamic spatial relations among traffic data based on multiple influential factors. Furthermore, we design an adaptive temporal convolution module that captures complex temporal traffic dependencies with environment-aware dynamic filters. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world traffic datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed ASTCN consistently outperforms state-of-the-arts.
