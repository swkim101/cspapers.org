Hough voting, as has been demonstrated in VoteNet, is effective for 3D object detection, where voting is a key step. In this paper, we propose a novel VoteNet-based 3D detector with vote enhancement to improve the detection accuracy in cluttered indoor scenes. It addresses the limitations of current voting schemes, i.e., votes from neighboring objects and background have significant negative impacts. Before voting, we replace the classic MLP with the proposed Attentive MLP (AMLP) in the backbone network to get better feature description of seed points. During voting, we design a new vote attraction loss (VALoss) to enforce vote centers to locate closely and compactly to the corresponding object centers. After voting, we then devise a vote weighting module to integrate the foreground/background prediction into the vote aggregation process to enhance the capability of the original VoteNet to handle noise from background voting. The three proposed strategies all contribute to more effective voting and improved performance, resulting in a novel 3D object detector, termed VENet. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components.
