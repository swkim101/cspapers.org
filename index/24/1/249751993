This paper studies dynamic BFT, where replicas can join and leave the system dynamically, a primitive that is nowadays increasingly needed. We provide a formal treatment for dynamic BFT protocols, endowing them with a flexible syntax and various security definitions.We demonstrate the challenges of extending static BFT to dynamic BFT. Then we design and implement Dyno, a highly efficient dynamic BFT protocol under the partial synchrony model. We show that Dyno can seamlessly handle membership changes without incurring performance degradation.
