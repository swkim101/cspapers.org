Selecting which libraries (‘dependencies’ or ‘packages’ in the industry’s jargon) to adopt in a project is an essential task in software development. The quality of the corresponding source code is a key factor behind this selection (from security to timeliness). Yet, how easy is it to find the ‘actual’ source? How reliable is this information? To address this problem, we developed an approach called py2src to automatically identify GitHub source code repositories corresponding to packages in PyPI and automatically provide an indicator of the reliability of such information. We also report a preliminary empirical evaluation of the approach on the top PyPI packages.
