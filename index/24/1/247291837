Online path planning for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) systems is considered a challenging task. It needs to ensure collision-free path planning in real-time, especially when the multi-UAV systems can become very crowded on certain occasions. In this paper, we presented a vision-based decentralized collision-avoidance policy learning method for multi-UAV systems. The policy takes depth images and inertial measurements as sensory inputs and outputs UAV's steering commands, and it is trained together with the latent representation of depth images using a policy gradient-based reinforcement learning algorithm and autoencoder in the multi-UAV three-dimensional workspaces. Each UAV follows the same trained policy and acts independently to reach the goal without colliding or communicating with other UAVs. We validate our method in various simulated scenarios. The experimental results show that our learned policy can guarantee fully autonomous collision-free navigation for multi-UAV in three-dimensional workspaces, and its navigation performance will not be greatly affected by the increase in the number of UAVs.
