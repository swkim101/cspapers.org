Recent advances in legged locomotion have en-abled quadrupeds to walk on challenging terrains. However, bipedal robots are inherently more unstable and hence it's harder to design walking controllers for them. In this work, we leverage recent advances in rapid adaptation for locomotion control, and extend them to work on bipedal robots. Similar to existing works, we start with a base policy which produces actions while taking as input an estimated extrinsics vector from an adaptation module. This extrinsics vector contains information about the environment and enables the walking controller to rapidly adapt online. However, the extrinsics estimator could be imperfect, which might lead to poor performance of the base policy which expects a perfect estimator. In this paper, we propose A-RMA (Adapting RMA), which additionally adapts the base policy for the imperfect extrinsics estimator by finetuning it using model-free RL. We demonstrate that A-RMA outperforms a number of RL-based baseline controllers and model-based controllers in simulation, and show zero-shot deployment of a single A-RMA policy to enable a bipedal robot, Cassie, to walk in a variety of different scenarios in the real world beyond what it has seen during training.
