The imitation learning research community has recently made significant progress towards the goal of enabling artificial agents to imitate behaviors from video demonstrations alone. However, current state-of-the-art approaches developed for this problem exhibit high sample complexity due, in part, to the high-dimensional nature of video observations. Towards addressing this issue, we introduce here a new algorithm called Visual Generative Adversarial Imitation from Observation using a State Observer (VGAIfO-SO). At its core, VGAIfO-SO seeks to address sample inefficiency using a novel, self-supervised state observer, which provides estimates of lower-dimensional proprioceptive state representations from high-dimensional images. We show experimentally in several continuous control environments that VGAIfO-SO is more sample efficient than other IfO algorithms at learning from video-only demonstrations and can sometimes even achieve performance close to the Generative Adversarial Imitation from Observation (GAIfO) algorithm that has privileged access to the demonstrator's proprioceptive state information.
