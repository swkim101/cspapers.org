In recent years, Deep Learning methods have become very popular in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially transformer-based architecture. NLP domain requires a high volume of annotated data to work. Unfortunately, obtaining high-quality and voluminous labeled data is expensive and time-consuming. One promising method which has singled out for its performance in the context of data deficiency is semi-supervised learning with Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In this paper, we propose a new approach called PaGAN which is a combination of a document classifier and a sentence-level classifier inside a GAN for patent documents understanding. The idea is to mine the patentâ€™s motivating problem (aka contradiction in TRIZ domain) which is fundamentally important to understand the underlying invention and its originality. PaGAN is applied and evaluated on a real-world dataset. Experiments show outperforming results of PaGAN comparatively to baseline approaches.
