Persistent challenges in making autonomous vehicles safe and reliable have hampered their widespread deployment. We believe that formal methods will play an essential role in the enterprise of ensuring AV safety by providing tools for the modeling, verification, synthesis, and runtime assurance of AV systems. In this paper, we outline the progress we and others have made towards this goal, and the challenges that remain.
