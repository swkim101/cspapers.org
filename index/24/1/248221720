—Companies providing services like cab sharing, e- commerce logistics and food delivery are willing to instrument their vehicles for scaling up measurements of trafﬁc congestion, travel time, road surface quality, air quality, etc. [1]. Analyzing ﬁne-grained sensors data from such large ﬂeets can be highly beneﬁcial; however, this sensor information reveals the locations and the number of vehicles in the deployed ﬂeet. This sensitive data is of high business value to rival companies in the same business domain, e.g., Uber vs. Ola, Uber vs. Lyft in cab sharing, or Amazon vs. Alibaba in the e-commerce domain. This paper provides privacy guarantees for the scenario mentioned above using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) based interpolation, Differential Privacy (DP), and Secure two-party computations (2PC). The sensed values from instrumented vehicle ﬂeets are made available preserving ﬂeet and client privacy, along with client utility. Our system has efﬁcient latency and bandwidth overheads, even for resource-constrained mobile clients. To demonstrate our end-to-end system, we build a sample Android application that gives the least polluted route alternatives given a source-destination pair in a privacy preserved manner.
