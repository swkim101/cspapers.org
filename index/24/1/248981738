Today’s voice personal assistant (VPA) services have been largely expanded by allowing third-party developers to build voice-apps and publish them to marketplaces ( e.g. , the Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant platforms). In an effort to thwart unscrupulous developers, VPA platform providers have specifed a set of policy requirements to be adhered to by third-party developers, e.g. , personal data collection is not allowed for kid-directed voice-apps. In this work, we aim to identify policy-violating voice-apps in current VPA platforms through a comprehensive dynamic analysis of voice-apps. To this end, we design and develop S KILL D ETECTIVE , an interactive testing tool capable of exploring voice-apps’ behaviors and identifying policy violations in an automated manner. Distinc-tive from prior works, S KILL D ETECTIVE evaluates voice-apps’ conformity to 52 different policy requirements in a broader context from multiple sources including textual, image and audio fles. With S KILL D ETECTIVE , we tested 54,055 Amazon Alexa skills and 5,583 Google Assistant actions, and collected 518,385 textual outputs, approximately 2,070 unique audio fles and 31,100 unique images from voice-app interactions. We identifed 6,079 skills and 175 actions violating at least one policy requirement. We have reported our fndings to both VPA vendors, and received their acknowledgments.
