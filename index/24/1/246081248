The limitation of the current program synthesis method is that the synthesized program is small in scale and simple in logic. In this work, we introduce an effective program synthesis approach based on algorithm pseudocode. By parsing the pseudocode, critical information like control structure framework and variable names can be obtained which are used to guide the process of synthesis. Experiments show that information extracted from pseudocode helps to reduce the space of programs and enhance the ability of the synthesizer. It can synthesize some complex programs with control structures.
