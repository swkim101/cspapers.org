While making investment decisions by reading financial documents, investors need to differentiate between in-claim and out-of-claim numerals. In this paper, we present a tool which can do this task automatically. It extracts context embeddings of the numerals using a transformer based pre-trained language model â€“ BERT. Subsequently, it uses a Logistic Regression based model to detect whether a numeral is in-claim or out-of-claim. We use the FinNum-3 (English) dataset to train our model. We conducted rigorous experiments and our best model achieved a Macro F1 score of 0.8223 on the validation set. We have open-sourced this tool which can be accessed from https://github.com/sohomghosh/FiNCAT_Financial_Numeral_Claim_Analysis_Tool
