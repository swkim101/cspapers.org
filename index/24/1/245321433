Two sided assembly line is often found at the assembly of large-sized and high-volume products such as trucks, buses and cars. In this type of production line, both left and right sides of the line are used simultaneously. Some operations need to be assigned to a particular side of the Left/Right line (type L and R). Other operations can be assigned to any side of the line (type E). In our study, we consider the so-called Two-Sided Assembly Line Balancing Problem TALBP-II. This paper presents two new mathematical models for solving the TALBP-II. The first one is developed for the case where the assignment side of each operation is known. The second one deals with the general case where we have type E operations. To assess the performance of our model, a comparative study is conducted with another mathematical model presented in the literature. The obtained results prove the efficiency of the new proposed mathematical formulation, and basically when dealing with TALBP-II.
