Software developers sometimes use inefficient data structures or library interfaces without considering the potential impact they may have during the runtime of a program. This is due to the significant effort required to research and evaluate possibly more eï¬ƒcient alternatives. Consequently, there is a need for tooling to automate the design space exploration. Our proposed code optimisation solution, called Artemis++, tries to address this issue with automatic exploration and transformation of data structures to optimise software performance. In preliminary testing on three mainstream C++ libraries, we have observed improvements up to 16.09%, 27.90%, and 2.74% for CPU usage, runtime and memory, respectively.
