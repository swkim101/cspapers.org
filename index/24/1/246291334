The objective of fraud detection is to distinguish fraudsters from normal users. In graph/network environments, both fraudsters and normal users are modeled as nodes, and the connections between those nodes are represented as edges. Fraudsters typically try to camouflage themselves with “normal” behaviors, say, by deliberately establishing many connections to normal users. Such camouflage inherently makes their appearance inconsistent with the essence of what it is to be normal, and gives rise to inconsistencies in the graph. In this paper, we investigate three aspects of these graph inconsistencies: features, topologies, and relations. To date, graph-based fraud detectors have shown a rather limited capability to fuse information about different types of inconsistencies. Apart from that, there is another problem of imbalance to overcome. This is because fraudsters usually only account for a very small percentage of all users. To achieve a promising capability, i.e., dual-resistant to graph inconsistency and imbalance, we present a new fraud detection model FRAUDRE based on Graph Neural Networks. Extensive experiments comparing eight up-to-date baselines on two real-world datasets, Amazon and YelpChi, demonstrate the superiority of FRAUDRE.
