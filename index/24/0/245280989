To cope with the requirements on efficiency and labour-saving of the out-pipe surface grinding tasks in the wild, several proposals are revealed and discussed. The one benefiting from the characteristics of planetary gear transmission and friction actuating mechanism are expatiated. To realize full coverage of out-pipe surface, the self-rotation and revolution motions of every polishing tool (cutter) are actuated by the same motor, and the friction force produced in grinding process acts as suitable tractive force for the forward travel of the grinding system. The friction statics analysis is established to illustrate the force transmission. Compression spring system are utilized to realize force equilibrium and support passive diameter adaptability. The proposed robotic grinding system is characterized by less actuator, online grinding capability and high working efficiency. It has clear advantages regarding manufacturing costs and control complexity. As the result of prototype experiments, performance of smooth grinding the out-pipe surface is confirmed.
