Mobile application developers sometimes might not be serious about source code security and publish apps to the marketplaces. Therefore, it is essential to have a fully automated security solutions generator to integrate security-by-design into the development practices, especially for the Android platform. This research proposes a Machine Learning (ML) based highly accurate method to detect Android source code vulnerabilities. A new labelled dataset containing Android source code vulnerability samples was generated initially. The dataset was used to train binary and multi-class classification based ML models, to identify code issues by following a static analysis approach. The proposed model can detect code vulnerabilities with a 0.90 F1-Score and vulnerability categories (CWE) with a 0.96 F1-Score. By integrating this with the Android development environment, app developers can analyse source code and identify security vulnerabilities in real-time. The proposed framework can be extended to suggest suitable patches to overcome the source code issues by providing real-time fixes in future.
