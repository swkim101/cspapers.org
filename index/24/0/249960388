Serverless computing presents an attractive model for general distributed computing as it focuses on abstracting the infrastructure required to execute an application. This workshop investigates the intersection between high performance computing and serverless computing, looking both at the high performance and distributed systems used to deliver serverless platforms and also at the use of serverless models for high performance and distributed systems.
