Quantization has been applied to multiple domains in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We propose Depthwise Quantization (DQ) where quantization is applied to a de-composed sub-tensor along the feature axis of weak statis-tical dependence. The feature decomposition leads to an exponential increase in representation capacity with a linear increase in memory and parameter cost. In addition, DQ can be directly applied to existing encoder-decoder frame-works without modification of the DNN architecture. We use DQ in the context of Hierarchical Auto-Encoders and train end-to-end on an image feature representation. We provide an analysis of the cross-correlation between spatial and channel features and propose a decomposition of the image feature representation along the channel axis. The improved performance of the depthwise operator is due to the increased representation capacity from implicit feature decoupling. We evaluate DQ on the likelihood estimation task, where it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32 and ImageNet-64. We progressively train with increasing image size a single hierarchical model that uses 69% fewer parameters and has faster convergence than the previous work.
