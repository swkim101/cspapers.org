As the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes more and more pervasive, encompassing many aspects of our daily life, the issue of how much the IoT systems can be trusted is critical. However, the multitude of recent incidents that were caused by or somehow involved such systems, often with dire consequences, makes it obvious that IoT system trustworthiness is not yet attained. In this paper we provide an overview on IoT trustworthiness, and introduce a trustworthiness assurance methodology based on the novel concept of Trustworthiness Assurance Levels (TALs). The methodology is intended for analyzing IoT systems to determine the degree of confidence one can have that they will perform as expected for a given deployment, taking into consideration external disturbances, system errors, faults and attacks. The paper also includes a case study discussion to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology.
