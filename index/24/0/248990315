The development of techniques for creating completely synthetic photographic images and videos, as well as the increasing prevalence of disinformation associated with such synthetic media, have sparked interest in the computer community. One such issue is the proliferation of deepfakes. However, much of the research is devoted to outwitting the SOTA in order to generate and detect fabricated images and video. Considering them from the perspective of computer security and human ethics is largely ignored. As such, this workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers to exchange ideas and methodologies, as well as to provide academia and industry with insights into the development and identification of fake media from a computer security perspective.
