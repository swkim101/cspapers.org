Automotive Ethernet is considered to be the next-generation in-vehicle network, because of its high bandwidth, high throughput, and low cost characteristics. However, no common standard has been established for the security protocol of Automotive Ethernet. While there are a few candidates, including MACsec, IPsec, and TLS, there is no widely favored candidate. Most importantly, existing candidates cannot fully satisfy the requirements of in-vehicle communication, specifically source authentication for broadcast/multicast communication. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis in both security and performance of existing security protocol candidates and identify source authentication and Denial-of-Service (DoS) prevention as two essential but missing properties in these candidates. We propose Gatekeeper, a gateway-based broadcast authentication protocol to ensure source authentication. In general, Gatekeeper introduces an on-path authenticator, which co-locates with the in-vehicle gateway or domain controllers and helps receivers to verify the sender's identity. To defend against DoS threats, we further integrate the time-lock puzzle with Gatekeeper to slow down malicious traffic. Our performance evaluation results show that Gatekeeper only results in 0.03 ms latency overhead for CAN data transmission and outperforms TESLA on both CAN and LiDAR transmission scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of Gatekeeper.
