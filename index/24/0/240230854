Cold start problem is one of the most challenging and long-standing problems in recommender systems, and cross-domain recommendation (CDR) methods are effective for tackling it. Most cold-start related CDR methods require training a mapping function between high-dimensional embedding space using overlapping user data. However, the overlapping data is scarce in many recommendation tasks, which makes it difficult to train the mapping function. In this paper, we propose a new approach for CDR, which aims to alleviate the training difficulty. The proposed method can be viewed as a special parameterization of the mapping function without hurting expressiveness, which makes use of non-overlapping user data and leads to effective optimization. Extensive experiments on two real-world CDR tasks are performed to evaluate the proposed method. In the case that there are few overlapping data, the proposed method outperforms the existed state-of-the-art method by 14% (relative improvement).
