Continuous monitoring with an ever-increasing number of sensors has become ubiquitous across many application domains. However, acquired time series are typically high-dimensional and difficult to interpret. Expressive deep learning (DL) models have gained popularity for dimensionality reduction, but the resulting latent space often remains difficult to interpret. In this work we propose SOM-CPC, a model that visualizes data in an organized 2D manifold, while preserving higher-dimensional information. We address a largely unexplored and challenging set of scenarios comprising high-rate time series, and show on both synthetic and real-life data (physiological data and audio recordings) that SOM-CPC outperforms strong baselines like DL-based feature extraction, followed by conventional dimensionality reduction techniques, and models that jointly optimize a DL model and a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). SOM-CPC has great potential to acquire a better understanding of latent patterns in high-rate data streams.
