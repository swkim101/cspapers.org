In this work, we present the first leakage-resilient identity-based encryption (LR-IBE) scheme that features (almost) tight security under the multi-challenge setting, in which the adversary could receive multiple challenging ciphertexts from multiple users. Meanwhile, our construction enjoys security against chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) under the Matrix Decisional Diffie-Hellman (MDDH) assumption. Apart from admitting the continual leakage of secret key, we provide strong security via additionally allowing the continual leakage of the master secret key. In particular, albeit in the single-challenge setting, our LR-IBE is also the first tight and CCA-secure scheme that withstands continual leakage of the master secret key and identity secret key. Furthermore, our ciphertext is constant-size when we instantiate the scheme by the Symmetric external Diffie-Hellman (SXDH) assumption. Concretely, there are only 6 group elements with security against chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) and extra 14 group elements for the CCA security.
