Attributed Graph Clustering (AGC) and Attributed Hypergraph Clustering (AHC) are important topics in graph mining with many applications. For AGC, amongst the unsupervised methods that combine the graph structure with node attributes, graph convolution has been shown to achieve impressive results. However, the effects of graph convolution on AGC have not yet been adequately studied. In this paper, we show that graph convolution attempts to find the best trade-off between node attribute distance and the number of inter-cluster edges. On the one hand, we show that compared to clustering node attributes directly, graph convolution produces a greater distance between node attributes in the same cluster and a smaller distance between node attributes in different clusters (which is detrimental for clustering). On the other hand, we show that graph convolution benefits clustering by considerably reducing the number of edges among different clusters. We then extend our result on AGC to AHC and leverage the hypergraph convolution to propose an unsupervised, fast, and memory-efficient algorithm (GRAC) for AHC, which achieves excellent performance on popular supervised clustering measures.
