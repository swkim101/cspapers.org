In this paper, we demonstrate the implementation details and usage of GenTree, a dynamic analysis tool for learning a programâ€™s interactions. Configurable software systems, while providing more flexibility to the users, are harder to develop, test, and analyze. GenTree can efficiently analyze the interactions among configuration options in configurable software. These interactions compactly represent large sets of configurations and thus allow us to efficiently analyze and discover interesting properties (e.g., bugs) in configurable software. Our experiments on 17 configurable systems spanning 4 languages show that GenTree efficiently finds precise interactions using a tiny fraction of the configuration space. GenTree and its dataset are open source and available at https://github.com/unsat/gentree and a video demo is at https://youtu.be/x3eqUflvlN8.
