Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen compositions formed from seen state and object during training. Since the same state may be various in the visual appearance while entangled with different objects, CZSL is still a challenging task. Some methods recognize state and object with two trained classifiers, ignoring the impact of the interaction between object and state; the other methods try to learn the joint representation of the state-object compositions, leading to the domain gap between seen and unseen composition sets. In this paper, we propose a novel Siamese Contrastive Embedding Network (SCEN)11Code: https://github.com/XDUxyLi/SCEN-master for unseen composition recognition. Considering the entanglement between state and object, we embed the visual feature into a Siamese Contrastive Space to capture prototypes of them separately, alleviating the interaction between state and object. In addition, we design a State Transition Module (STM) to increase the diversity of training compositions, improving the robustness of the recognition model. Extensive experiments indicate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on three challenging benchmark datasets, including the recent proposed C-QGA dataset.
