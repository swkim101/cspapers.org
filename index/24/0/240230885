While being a lasting theme, privacy, security, and trust (PST) has been increasingly important in recent days due to the pervasive (but more prone) computation infrastructure and deep (but more intrusive) data analytics, and has been hugely demanded from governments, companies, and individuals. This workshop aims at providing a forum for researchers, practitioners and developers from different background areas such as computational intelligence, data privacy and cyber security, trust management, cloud computing, edge computing, Internet of Things, big data analytics, machine learning and data mining, knowledge discovery to exchange the latest experience, research ideas and synergic research and development on fundamental issues and applications about privacy, security and trust issues in computational intelligence.
