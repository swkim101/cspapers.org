This paper presents a HAO-Interaction question answering system, which exploits knowledge based question answering (KBQA) technology to quickly obtain an answer path for the input question, and then a creative text generation mechanism to acquire the final answer text. The system also provides visibility of the answer path on the user interface in order to facilitate user understanding. Different from other KBQA systems, HAO-Interaction supports users to incorporate an organizational graph database while accessing all system functionalities. In addition, the answer generation solution implemented in the system does not require any training data. HAO-Interaction keeps low response latency while ensuring a high user satisfaction. The effectiveness of HAO-Interaction has been verified by analyzing thousands of user reviews collected by the system.
