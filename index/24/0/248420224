We performed a mixed-design study with 56 participants to compare the effect of horizontal FOV (hfov) and vertical FOV (vfov) on egocentric distance perception in four different realistic virtual environments (VEs). We also compared VE attributes of indoor/outdoor and cluttered/uncluttered. The participants blind-walked towards four different targets at 3m, 4m, 5m, and 6m distance while wearing a backpack computer and a wide FOV head-mounted display (HMD). The combinations of 165°, 110° and 45° hfovs, and 110° and 35° vfovs was simulated in the same HMD. The results indicated more accurate distance judgement with larger hfov with no significant effect of vfov. More accurate distance judgement in indoor VEs compared to outdoor VEs was observed. Also, participants judged distances more accurately in cluttered environments versus uncluttered environments. These results highlight that the environment is important in distance-critical VR applications and wider hfov should be considered for an improved distance judgment.
