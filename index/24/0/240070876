Computer-aided diagnosis plays a salient role in more accessible and accurate cardiopulmonary diseases classification and localization on chest radiography. Millions of people get affected and die due to these diseases without an accurate and timely diagnosis. Recently proposed contrastive learning heavily relies on data augmentation, especially positive data augmentation. However, generating clinically-accurate data augmentations for medical images is extremely difficult because the common data augmentation methods in computer vision, such as sharp, blur, and crop operations, can severely alter the clinical settings of medical images. In this paper, we proposed a novel and simple data augmentation method based on patient metadata and supervised knowledge to create clinically accurate positive and negative augmentations for chest X-rays. We introduce an end-to-end framework, SCALP, which extends the self-supervised contrastive approach to a supervised setting. Specifically, SCALP pulls together chest X-rays from the same patient (positive keys) and pushes apart chest X-rays from different patients (negative keys). In addition, it uses ResNet-50 along with the triplet-attention mechanism to identify cardiopulmonary diseases, and Grad-CAM ++ to highlight the abnormal regions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SCALP outperforms existing baselines with significant margins in both classification and localization tasks. Specifically, the average classification AUCs improve from 82.8% (SOTA using DenseNet-121) to 83.9% (SCALP using ResNet-50), while the localization results improve on average by 3.7% over different IoU thresholds.
