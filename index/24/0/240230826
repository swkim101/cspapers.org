Change point detection is widely used for finding transitions between states of data generation within a time series. Methods for change point detection currently assume this transition is instantaneous and therefore focus on finding a single point of data to classify as a change point. However, this assumption is flawed because many time series actually display short periods of transitions between different states of data generation. Previous work has shown Bayesian Online Change Point Detection (BOCPD) to be the most effective method for change point detection on a wide range of different time series. This paper explores adapting the change point detection algorithms to detect abrupt changes over short periods of time. We design a segment-based mechanism to examine a window of data points within a time series, rather than a single data point, to determine if the window captures abrupt change. We test our segment-based Bayesian change detection algorithm on 36 different time series and compare it to the original BOCPD algorithm. Our results show that, for some of these 36 time series, the segment-based approach for detecting abrupt changes can much more accurately identify change points based on standard metrics.
