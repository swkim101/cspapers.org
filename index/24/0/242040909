This half day workshop explores challenges in data search, with a particular focus on data on the web. We want to stimulate an interdisciplinary discussion around how to improve the description, discovery, ranking and presentation of structured and semi-structured data, across data formats and domain applications. We welcome contributions describing algorithms and systems, as well as frameworks and studies in human data interaction. The workshop aims to bring together communities interested in making the web of data more discoverable, easier to search and more user friendly.
