The popularity of online social coding (SC) platforms such as GitHub is growing due to their social functionalities and tremendous support during the product development lifecycle. The rich information of experts' contributions on repositories can be leveraged to recruit experts for new/existing projects. In this paper, we define the problem of collaborative experts finding in SC platforms. Given a project, we model an SC platform as an attributed heterogeneous network, learn latent representations of network entities in an end-to-end manner and utilize them to discover collaborative experts to complete a project. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from GitHub indicate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art in terms of a range of performance measures.
