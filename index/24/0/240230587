Entity alignment (EA) is the task of detecting equivalent entities from different knowledge graphs (KGs). Although this problem has been intensively studied during the last few years, the majority of the state-of-the-arts heavily rely on the labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Therefore, it calls for the study of EA with scarce supervision. To resolve this issue, we put forward a reinforced active entity alignment framework to select the entities to be manually labeled with the aim of enhancing alignment performance with minimal labeling efforts. Under this framework, we further devise an unsupervised contrastive loss to contrast different views of entity representations and augment the limited supervision signals by exploiting the vast unlabeled data. We empirically evaluate our proposal on eight popular KG pairs, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model and its components consistently boost the alignment performance under scarce supervision.
