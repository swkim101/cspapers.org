Extreme scale computing and data have become essential to computational and data-enabled science and engineering, promising dramatic new insights into natural and engineered systems. However, data-management challenges continue to limit the potential impact of extreme-scale application workflows. Data-intensive application workflows targeting extreme scale, high-performance, distributed computing environments can involve dynamic coordination, interactions and data coupling between multiple application processes that run at scale on different resources, and with services for monitoring, analysis and visualization and archiving, and present challenges due to increasing data volumes and complex data-coupling patterns, system energy constraints, increasing failure rates, etc. In this talk I will present my translational computer science (TCS) research experiences in addressing these challenges. TCS research bridges foundational/use-inspired research with the delivery and deployment of outcomes to the target community and supports the essential bi-direction interplays. Specifically, I will explore data sharing abstractions, managed data pipelines, data-staging services, and in-situ/in-transit data placement and processing to support extreme scale in-situ workflows.
