Query feeds recommendation is a new recommended paradigm in mobile search applications, where a stream of queries need to be recommended to improve user engagement. It requires a great quantity of attractive queries for recommendation. A conventional solution is to retrieve queries from a collection of past queries recorded in user search logs. However, these queries usually have poor readability and limited coverage of article content, and are thus not suitable for the query feeds recommendation scenario. Furthermore, to deploy the generated queries for recommendation, human validation, which is costly in practice, is required to filter unsuitable queries. In this paper, we propose TitIE, a query mining system to generate valuable queries using the titles of documents. We employ both an extractive text generator and an abstractive text generator to generate queries from titles. To improve the acceptance rate during human validation, we further propose a model-based scoring strategy to pre-select the queries that are more likely to be accepted during human validation. Finally, we propose a novel dual learning approach to jointly learn the generation model and the selection model by making full use of the unlabeled corpora under a semi-supervised scheme, thereby simultaneously improving the performance of both models. Results from both offline and online evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach.
