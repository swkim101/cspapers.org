Conventional gloves partially insulate against heat transfer from a hot external environment. They also prevent metabolic heat generated by the human body from escaping. Thus, gloves are a source of heat buildup and heat stress in workers. Heat stress can lead to hyperthermia. Described herein is a glove that cools using a carbon nanotube (CNT) fabric micro-liner and forced convection from a fan. A cold sink is assumed to be located in the glove to cool the convection air. This glove is called an active textile glove. CNT fabric has high thermal conductivity in the plane of the fabric, low thermal conductivity through its thickness, and a large surface area for convection cooling. Thus, the active textile glove can transfer heat from the hand to cooler air in the environment. This paper simulates the performance of a CNT-cooled glove using simple theoretical heat transfer models. Cooling was also demonstrated by testing the glove using a hot plate. Forced convection was found to provide the greatest cooling effect, with it working in synergy with the CNT fabric which aids in spreading heat. CNT fabric also acts as a shield from environmental dangers. The fabric is flame resistant, attenuates radio frequency waves, and prevents smoke particles and toxic chemicals from entering the glove. Testing illustrates the shielding properties of CNT fabric.
