We introduce a novel self-supervised contrastive learning method to learn representations from unlabelled videos. Existing approaches ignore the specifics of input distortions, e.g., by learning invariance to temporal transformations. Instead, we argue that video representation should preserve video dynamics and reflect temporal manipulations of the input. Therefore, we exploit novel constraints to build representations that are equivariant to temporal transformations and better capture video dynamics. In our method, relative temporal transformations between augmented clips of a video are encoded in a vector and contrasted with other transformation vectors. To support temporal equivariance learning, we additionally propose the self-supervised classification of two clips of a video into 1. overlapping 2. ordered, or 3. unordered. Our experiments show that time-equivariant representations achieve state-of-the-art results in video retrieval and action recognition benchmarks on UCF101, HMDB51, and Diving48.
