Many payment platforms hold large-scale marketing campaigns, which allocate incentives to encourage users to pay through their applications. To maximize the return on investment, incentive allocations are commonly solved in a two-stage procedure. After training a response estimation model to estimate the users' mobile payment probabilities (MPP), a linear programming process is applied to obtain the optimal incentive allocation. However, the large amount of biased data in the training set, generated by the previous biased allocation policy, causes a biased estimation. This bias deteriorates the performance of the response model and misleads the linear programming process, dramatically degrading the performance of the resulting allocation policy. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a bias correction adversarial network. Our method leverages the small set of unbiased data obtained under a full-randomized allocation policy to train an unbiased model and then uses it to reduce the bias with adversarial learning. Offline and online experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and significantly improves the performance of the resulting allocation policy in a real-world marketing campaign.
