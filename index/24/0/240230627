Users usually consult the manufacturers or the internet when they encounter operation questions with an electronics product. In this paper, we explore to represent an operation question as a procedure graph and formulate the problem of operation diagnosis as two sub-tasks, namely error node detection, and correction, on top of the graph. We construct the first benchmark for this task and propose a transformer-based model to integrate external knowledge and context information to enhance the performance. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed model.
