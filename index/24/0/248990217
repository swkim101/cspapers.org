We propose a decentralized but collaborative attribute-based tracing mechanism (a signer-identifying mechanism) for group signatures. Instead of a central tracing party in our scheme, a set of tracers satisfying the attribute set used for generating the group signature can identify the signer. Thus our proposal limits the parties who can identify the signer. On the other hand, it decentralized the tracing authority.
