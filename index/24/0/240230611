The orderly operation and development of any system are indivisible from decision optimization. Several issues in life are applicable to the thought of optimization problems to resolve. In this digital age, the size of information and data is obtaining larger and the potency of problem determination is changing into more demanding. Though there're many solvers for specific optimization problems, in the face of large-scale scenarios, there's no single platform that concurrently addresses usability, solvers' uniformity, and computing efficiency. In this demo, we present AntOpt, a decision optimization platform that integrates large-scale distributed computing engines, optimization algorithm solvers and productized services.
