In this paper, we investigate the problem of vision and language navigation. To solve this problem, grounding the landmarks and spatial relations in the textual instructions into visual modality is important. We propose a neural agent named Explicit Object Relation Alignment Agent (EXOR),to explicitly align the spatial information in both instruction and the visual environment, including landmarks and spatial relationships between the agent and landmarks.Empirically, our proposed method surpasses the baseline by a large margin on the R2R dataset. We provide a comprehensive analysis to show our modelâ€™s spatial reasoning ability and explainability.
