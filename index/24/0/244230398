Converting source code from one programming language to another is a problem that occurs regularly in real life, but has attracted limited attention and has not been inves- tigated systematically. This paper presents the challenges of translating a large source code from one high-level programming language to another, and the solutions developed to resolve these problems. Furthermore, the paper introduces a systematic classification of the occurring challenges during the translation process and elaborates on the ability to handle them without manual intervention by a programmer. A detailed performance comparison between the two language versions of the code is being performed.
