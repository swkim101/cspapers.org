HPC and distributed systems are the driving force for the advancement of many emerging technologies, such as exascale systems, quantum machines, terabit networking, 5G/6G wireless, and cloud/edge computing. The tasks of systems and network telemetry are a key element for effective operations and management of the advancement of many emerging systems and technologies, and require more scalable telemetry and analysis techniques for comprehensive monitoring and analysis. Various input sources such as end systems, switches, firewalls, intrusion sensors and the emerging network elements speaking with different syntax and semantics make organizing and incorporating the generated data challenging for the quantitative and qualitative analysis. This workshop looks for new approaches and methods at the intersection of HPC systems and data sciences to address these difficult challenges of emerging technologies from the diverse angles of systems/network performance, availability, reliability, and security.
