We demonstrate DORA THE EXPLORER, a system that guides users in finding items of interest in a very large data set. DORA THE EXPLORER provides users with the full spectrum of exploration modes and is driven by Data Familiarity or Curiosity, as well as User Interventions. DORA THE EXPLORER is able to handle data and search scenario complexity, i.e., the difficulty to find scattered/clustered individual records in the data set, and user ability to express what s/he needs. DORA THE EXPLORER relies on Deep Reinforcement Learning that combines intrinsic (curiosity) and extrinsic (familiarity) rewards. DORA's main goal is to support scientific discovery from data. We describe the system architecture and illustrate it with three demonstration scenarios on a 2.6 mil-lion galaxies SDSS, a large sky survey data set1.
