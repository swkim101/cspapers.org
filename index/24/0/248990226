Malware is a term used for computer software created for malicious purposes. The rise of malware has closely followed the rise of computers in the society, and in~2022 it represents a ubiquitous threat in the digital world, impacting individuals, organizations and governments. As a reaction to the emergence of malware, the new research direction malware analysis was established. Unlike most other domains of computer science, malware analysis operates in an actively adversarial environment, where the potential reward for attackers is very high, and their maneuvering space is ample. Under such conditions, an arms race has arisen between attackers and defenders. A crucial condition necessary to prevail in this race is the research of robust methods and solutions. The goal of this workshop is to bring together leading researchers in the field in a joint forum for advancing the robustness of malware analysis.
