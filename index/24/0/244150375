The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is an evolution of real-time monitoring and inspection in construction through sensors and wireless devices. One of the important elements of the equipment is the antenna which decides the quality and accuracy of supervising information over various communication standards. In this paper, we proposed a triple band Vivaldi antenna in which all detailed dimensions are optimized by CST software. Based on FR4 substrate with a height of 1.6mm, the total size of the Vivaldi antenna is 58.5 x 40 x 1.6 mm3 that can be fitted on a small form factor. Operating at 2.44GHz, 4GHz, and 5.6GHz with a large bandwidth of 8.09%, 12.5%, and 19.29% respectively, the proposed antenna bandwidth covers almost all popular IIoT bands such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and 5G below 6GHz ones.
