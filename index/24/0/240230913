Sequential recommendation systems seek to learn users' preferences to predict their next actions based on the items engaged recently. Static behavior of users requires a long time to form, but short-term interactions with items usually meet some actual needs in reality and are more variable. RNN-based models are always constrained by the strong order assumption and are hard to model the complex and changeable data flexibly. Most of the CNN-based models are limited to the fixed convolutional kernel. All these methods are suboptimal when modeling the dynamics of item-to-item transitions. It is difficult to describe the items with complex relations and extract the fine-grained user preferences from the interaction sequence. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge-aware sequential recommender with the attention-enhanced dynamic convolutional network (KAeDCN). Our model combines the dynamic convolutional network with attention mechanisms to capture changing dependencies in the sequence. Meanwhile, we enhance the representations of items with Knowledge Graph (KG) information through an information fusion module to capture the fine-grained user preferences. The experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that KAeDCN outperforms most of the state-of-the-art sequential recommenders. Furthermore, experimental results also prove that KAeDCN can enhance the representations of items effectively and improve the extractability of sequential dependencies.
