One of the key enhancements in the upcoming 802.11ay standard for 60 GHz WLANs is the support for simultaneous transmissions of up to 8 data streams via SU- and MU-MIMO, which has the potential to enable data rates up to 100 Gbps. However, in spite of the key role MIMO is expected to play in 802.11ay, experimental evaluation of MIMO performance in 60 GHz WLANs has been limited to date, primarily due to lack of hardware supporting MIMO transmissions at millimeter wave frequencies. In this work, we fill this gap by conducting the first large-scale experimental evaluation of SU- and MU-MIMO performance in 60 GHz WLANs. Unlike previous studies, our study involves multiple environments with very different multipath characteristics. We analyze the performance in each environment, identify the factors that affect it, and compare it against the performance of SISO. Further, we seek to identify factors that can guide beam and user selection to limit the (often prohibitive in practice) overhead of exhaustive search. Finally, we propose two heuristics that perform both user and beam selection with low overhead, and show that they perform close to an Oracle solution and outperform previously proposed approaches in both static and mobile scenarios, regardless of the environment and number of users.
