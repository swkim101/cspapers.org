Organizational clusters are often shared among users who compete over resources, but the organization's goal is to increase the overall utility produced by the cluster. That is, to increase the aggregate benefit drawn from the cluster. To overcome this problem, we enhanced SLURM with an auctioning system. We evaluated our work on several real cluster traces. Our auctioning scheduler increases the responsiveness to highly valued jobs. It reduces the weight of the queued jobs (the sum of multiplication of jobs by their wait time by their number of required nodes and by their bid) by 3X--33X compared with backfilling.
