Modern mobile games often contain in-app purchasing (IAP) for players to purchase digital items such as virtual currency, equipment, or extra moves. In theory, IAP should have been implemented securely; but in practice, we have found that many game developers have failed to do so, particularly by misplacing the trust of payment veriﬁcation, e.g. , by either locally verifying the payment transactions or without using any veriﬁcation at all, leading to playing without paying vulnerabilities. This paper presents P AYMENT S COPE , a static binary analysis tool to automatically identify vulnerable IAP implementations in mobile games. Through modeling of its IAP protocols with the SDK provided APIs using a payment-aware data ﬂow analysis, P AYMENT S COPE directly pinpoints untrusted payment veriﬁcation vulnerabilities in game native binaries. We have implemented P AYMENT S COPE on top of binary analysis framework Ghidra, and tested with 39 , 121 Unity (the most popular game engine) mobile games, with which P AYMENT S COPE has identiﬁed 8 , 954 (22 . 89%) vulnerable games. Among them, 8 , 233 games do not verify the validity of payment transactions and 721 games simply verify the transactions locally. We have disclosed the identiﬁed vulnerabilities to developers of vulnerable games, and many of them have acknowledged our ﬁndings.
