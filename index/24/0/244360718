 We demonstrate the design of resonating structures using a density-based topology optimization approach, which requires the eigenfrequencies to match a set of target values. To develop a solution, several optimization modules are implemented, including material interpolation models, penalization schemes, filters, analytical sensitivities, and a solver. Moreover, common challenges in topology optimization for dynamic systems and their solutions are discussed. In this study, the objective function is to minimize the error between the target and actual eigenfrequency values. The finite element method is used to compute the eigenfrequencies at each iteration. To solve the optimization problem, we use the sequential linear programming algorithm with move limits, enhanced by a filtering technique. Finally, we present a resonator design as a case study and analyze the design process with different optimization parameters.
