To assist the COVID-19 focused researchers in life science and healthcare in understanding the pandemic, we present an exploratory information retrieval system called RCES. The system employs a previously developed EVE (Explainable Vector-based Embedding) model using DBpedia and an adopted model using MeSH taxonomies to exploit concept relations related to COVID-19. Various expansion methods are also developed, along with explanations and facets that collectively form rapid cues for a valuable navigational and informed user experience.
