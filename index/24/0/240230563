Bipartite graphs arise naturally when modeling two different types of entities such as user-item, author-paper, and director-board. In recent years, driven by numerous real-world applications in these networks, mining cohesive structures in bipartite graphs becomes a popular research topic. In this paper, we propose the first cohesive-structure-based bipartite graph analytics system, CohBGA. The key innovative features of our system are as follows. Firstly, we involve several cohesive-structure-based models and statistics in our system to analyze bipartite graphs at different levels of granularity. Secondly, CohBGA has a user-friendly and interactive visual interface with various functional tools to meet users' diverse query requirements. Thirdly, we implement state-of-the-art algorithms in CohBGA to support efficient query processing. Furthermore, as a generic framework is designed in CohBGA, CohBGA is going to be an open-source bipartite graph analytics platform that allows researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of more cohesive-structure-based models and algorithms for bipartite graphs.
