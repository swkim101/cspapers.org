 Design optimization of metamaterials and other complex systems often relies on the use of computationally expensive models. This makes it challenging to use global multi-objective optimization approaches that require many function evaluations. Engineers often have heuristics or rules of thumb with potential to drastically reduce the number of function evaluations needed to achieve good convergence. Recent research has demonstrated that these design heuristics can be used explicitly in design optimization, indeed leading to accelerated convergence. However, these approaches have only been demonstrated on specific problems, the performance of different methods was diverse, and despite all heuristics being “correct”, some heuristics were found to perform much better than others for various problems. In this paper, we describe a case study in design heuristics for a simple class of 2D constrained multiobjective optimization problems involving lattice-based metamaterial design. Design heuristics are strategically incorporated into the design search and the heuristics-enabled optimization framework is compared with the standard optimization framework not using the heuristics. Results indicate that leveraging design heuristics for design optimization can help in reaching the optimal designs faster. We also identify some guidelines to help designers choose design heuristics and methods to incorporate them for a given problem at hand.
