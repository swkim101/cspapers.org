CubeSat structure satellites have limited communication ability as a result of limited power and size, as well as low cost transceivers. The communication between CubeSat and the Earth station therefore faces a lot of risks such as impairing transceiver performance and degrading mission data throughput. In this paper, a design of S-band transceiver for telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C) is presented for use onboard CubeSat satellites. The transceiver can provide a measured 96 Kbps of data rate with maximum output power of 39.3 dBm (8.5 W) and an overall volume of 87.4 93.4 20 mm3 with total mass of 252 grams including aluminum housing.
