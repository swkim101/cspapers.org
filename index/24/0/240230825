Data often accumulates in tabular format with many attribute items, and prediction using machine learning adds value to data for business. However, studies on machine learning for tabular data only input attribute values, which reduces accuracy. Therefore, we propose an inference method that inputs attribute values and values from aggregated tabular data that has varying attribute values for each attribute item. In an experiment, we compared our proposed method with AutoGluon-Tabular using AutoML benchmark datasets. Our proposed method achieved the highest accuracy for 21 out of 39 datasets.
