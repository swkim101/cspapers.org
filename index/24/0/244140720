This paper proposes a method to improve decoding performance for the Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) format 0 with intra-slot frequency hopping configuration. The proposed algorithm sums absolute values of correlation between symbols instead of summing their correlation. By this way, the phase opposition in symbols correlation can be theoretically eliminated in order to improve decoding accuracy. By applying simple but effective modification in algorithm, the proposed approach exhibits extraordinary performance to ensure all PUCCH performance requirements described in the TS 38.104 from 3GPP. Feasibility of the proposed method is verified by conducting experiment in laboratory environment with different intra-slot frequency hopping configurations and receiving antenna numbers.
