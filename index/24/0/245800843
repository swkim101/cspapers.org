Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is a powerful technique in high-resolution atomic imaging of materials. Decreasing scanning time and reducing electron beam exposure with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio are two popular research aspects when applying STEM to beam-sensitive materials. Specifically, partially sampling with fixed electron doses is one of the most important solutions, and then the lost information is restored by computational methods. Following successful applications of deep learning in image in-painting, we have developed an encoder-decoder network to reconstruct STEM images in extremely sparse sampling cases. In our model, we combine both local pixel information from convolution operators and global texture features, by applying specific filter operations on the frequency domain to acquire initial reconstruction and global structure prior. Our method can effectively restore texture structures and be robust in different sampling ratios with Poisson noise. A comprehensive study demonstrates that our method gains about 50% performance enhancement in comparison with the state-of-art methods.
