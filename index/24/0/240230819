Human interactions with items are being constantly logged, which enables advanced representation learning and facilitates various tasks. Instead of generating static embeddings at the end of training, several temporal embedding methods were recently proposed to learn user and item embeddings as functions of time, where each entity has a trajectory of embedding vectors aiming to encode the full dynamics. However, these methods may not be optimal to encode the dynamical behaviors on the interaction graphs in that they can not generate "fully''-temporal embeddings and do not consider information propagation. In this paper, we tackle the issues and propose CoPE (Co ntinuous P ropagation and E volution). We use an ordinary differential equation based graph neural network to model information propagation and more sophisticated evolution patterns. We train CoPE on sequences of interactions with the help of meta-learning to ensure fast adaptation to the most recent interactions. We evaluate CoPE on three tasks and prove its effectiveness.
