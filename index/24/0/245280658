During the last decades, the research endeavours on autonomous driving found great resonance in Advanced Driver-Assistance Solutions that equipped the contemporary civilian vehicles and significantly boosted their driver-less mobility. The existing applications are mostly focused on urban scenarios where signs, road lanes and markers are well defined and ordered favouring the motion of the vehicles whilst, less attention has been paid to the semi-structured and rural environments where traffic infrastructure is scarce. The paper at hand introduces a holistic framework for autonomous vehicles navigation in semi-structured environments. Semantic cues fused with geometrical information of LiDAR data are used for road detection and tracking. OpenStreetMaps are employed as a rough route planner, the waypoints of which are rectified via a probability distribution function over the visible area of vehicle’s vicinity. Thus, vehicle’s localization is obtained by Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) SLAM, where the covariance of egomotion estimation is obtained by processing short-term 3D maps, fused with GPS measurements by means of an extended Kalman filter. Local planning and execution of vehicle’s motion is applied on local cost maps formulated by the union of 2D laser readings and the detected road boundaries fitted through Bézier curves. The complete framework has been evaluated with the aid of a real Autonomous Guided Vehicle in a constrained semi-structured urban area, exhibiting robust navigation performance.
