Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that respond to brightness changes asynchronously and output in the form of event streams instead of frame-based images. They own outstanding advantages compared with traditional cameras: higher temporal resolution, higher dynamic range, and lower power consumption. However, the spatial resolution of existing event cameras is insufficient and challenging to be enhanced at the hardware level while maintaining the asynchronous philosophy of circuit design. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the algorithm of event stream super-resolution, which is a non-trivial task due to the sparsity and strong spatio-temporal correlation of the events from an event camera. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework based on spiking neural network for event stream super-resolution, which can generate high-resolution (HR) event stream from the input low-resolution (LR) event stream. A spatiotemporal constraint learning mechanism is proposed to learn the spatial and temporal distributions of the event stream simultaneously. We validate our method on four large-scale datasets and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The satisfying results on two downstream applications, i.e. object classification and image reconstruction, further demonstrate the usability of our method. To prove the application potential of our method, we deploy it on a mobile platform. The high-quality HR event stream generated by our real-time system demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.
