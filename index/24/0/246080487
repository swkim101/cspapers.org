An increasing number of people are dependent on mobile devices to access data and complete essential tasks. For people with disabilities, mobile apps that violate accessibility guidelines can prevent them from carrying out these activities. Size-Based Inaccessibility is one of the top accessibility issues in mobile applications. These issues make apps difficult to use, especially for older people and people with motor disabilities. Existing accessibility related techniques are limited in terms of helping developers to resolve these issues. In this paper, we present our novel automated approach for repairing Size-Based Inaccessibility issues in mobile applications. Our empirical evaluation showed that our approach was able to successfully resolve 99% of the reported Size-Based Inaccessibility issues and received a high approval rating in a user study of the appearance of the repaired user interfaces.
