This paper proposes a compact automatic system, which could be installed easily on vehicles, to detect and send warnings if pupils are accidentally left on school buses. The detection and identification method is mainly based on MobileNets - the new structure of convolutional neural networks. The information is then fed to an embedded processing module and alarms are provided to relevant people via sound, text messages, phone-calls and/or emails in order to avoid unfortunate consequences. The device is tested on a real bus to show the efficiency and safety with various situations.
