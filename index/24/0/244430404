We present a novel approach to the detection of unknown objects in the context of autonomous driving. The problem is formulated as anomaly detection, since we assume that the unknown stuff or object appearance cannot be learned. To that end, we propose a reconstruction module that can be used with many existing semantic segmentation networks, and that is trained to recognize and reconstruct road (drivable) surface from a small bottleneck. We postulate that poor reconstruction of the road surface is due to areas that are outside of the training distribution, which is a strong indicator of an anomaly. The road structural similarity error is coupled with the semantic segmentation to incorporate information from known classes and produce final per-pixel anomaly scores. The proposed JSR-Net was evaluated on four datasets, Lost-and-found, Road Anomaly, Road Obstacles, and FishyScapes, achieving state-of-art performance on all, reducing the false positives significantly, while typically having the highest average precision for wide range of operation points.
