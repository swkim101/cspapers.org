As a well-established probabilistic method, topic models seek to uncover latent semantics from plain text. In addition to having textual content, we observe that documents are usually compared in listwise rankings based on their content. For instance, world-wide countries are compared in an international ranking in terms of electricity production based on their national reports. Such document comparisons constitute additional information that reveal documents' relative similarities. Incorporating them into topic modeling could yield comparative topics that help to differentiate and rank documents. Furthermore, based on different comparison criteria, the observed document comparisons usually cover multiple aspects, each expressing a distinct ranked list. For example, a country may be ranked higher in terms of electricity production, but fall behind others in terms of life expectancy or government budget. Each comparison criterion, or aspect, observes a distinct ranking. Considering such multiple aspects of comparisons based on different ranking criteria allows us to derive one set of topics that inform heterogeneous document similarities. We propose a generative topic model aimed at learning topics that are well aligned to multi-aspect listwise comparisons. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method in jointly modeling topics and ranked lists against baselines comprehensively.
