Lenticular angle gauge (LEAG) is a planar pattern that visualizes relative attitude by the position of the black line, which moves according to the viewing angle. The authors developed a new LEAG in which the direction of movement of the black line is 90◦ different from the previous LEAG, and used it to develop a non-square high-accuracy fiducial marker. The new marker realized accurate pose estimation with a position error of 0.15% of the distance and an attitude error of 0.5°. This research contributes to the development of high-accuracy markers with a more flexible design. This paper describes the principle and behavior of the new LEAG, the design of the new fiducial marker, and the pose estimation algorithm, followed by the results of performance verification experiments.
