Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) processors have recently gained market share in both cloud computing and desktop applications. Meanwhile, ARM devices have shifted to a more peripheral based design, wherein designers attach a number of coprocessors and accelerators to the System-on-a-Chip (SoC). By adopting a System-Level Cache, which acts as a shared cache between the CPU-cores and peripherals, ARM attempts to alleviate the memory bottleneck issues that exist between data sources and accelerators. This paper investigates emerging security threats introduced by this new System-Level Cache. Specifically, we demonstrate that the System-Level Cache can still be exploited to create a cache occupancy channel to accurately fingerprint websites. We redesign and optimize the attack for various browsers based on the ARM cache design, which can significantly reduce the attack duration while increasing accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a novel GPU contention channel in mobile devices, which can achieve similar accuracy to the cache occupancy channel. We conduct a thorough evaluation by examining these attacks across multiple devices, including iOS, Android, and MacOS with the new M1 MacBook Air. The experimental results demonstrate that (1) the System-Level Cache based website fingerprinting technique can achieve promising accuracy in both open (up to 90%) and closed (up to 95%) world scenarios, and (2) our GPU contention channel is more effective than the CPU cache channel on Android devices.
