Exciting changes are coming to the fore in the world of Storage and I/O for High Performance and Data Intensive computing. Existing data access and data retrieval methods that suitably support the new generation of data intensive applications in the realm of HPC and AI are being re-assessed. These new applications need to support both evolutionary as well as revolutionary approaches to data access and storage. Open source is enabling the adoption of these new techniques. This workshop looks at cutting edge trends in storage systems and solutions for data intensive HPC and AI applications with specific focus primarily on community driven initiatives and commercial products that may inspire the community.
