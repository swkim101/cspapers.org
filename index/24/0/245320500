Due to the massive quantity of information and the excessive use of filters, Image processing becomes more and more costly at the runtime level. It remains a very complex operation at the programming level mostly in specific real time application. However, several methods have been developed to improve the system performance. In this work, we investigate the performance of object tracking algorithm implemented in raspberry pi3. We use an hybrid method based on combination of color and edge method. Subsequently, we prove that this embedded system presents high performance with an optimal conservation of energy. We present The Simulation results into the support of theoretical analysis.
