The unique role that AI plays in making decisions that affect human lives creates a need to foster improved public understanding of AI systems. Informal learning spaces are particularly important contexts for fostering AI literacy, as they have the potential to reach a broader audience and provide spaces for children and parents to learn together. This paper explores 1) what types of dialogue family groups engage in when learning about AI in an at-home learning environment in order to inform our understanding of 2) how to design AI literacy activities for informal learning contexts. We present an analysis of family group dialogue surrounding three different AI education activities and use our findings to reflect on, update, and add to existing principles for designing AI literacy educational interventions.
