Linux has built-in security features based on discretionary access control that can be enhanced using the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework. However, so far there has been no reported work on strengthening Linux with Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), which is gaining in popularity in recent years due to its flexibility and dynamic nature. In this paper, a method for enabling ABAC for Linux file system objects using LSM is proposed. We report initial experimental results and also share our public repository links for integrating ABAC in any Linux installation.
