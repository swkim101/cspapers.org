As technology advances, critical infrastructure sectors are increasingly reliant on digital control systems and networking systems. Attacks targeting systems in critical infrastructure sectors are a matter of when and not if, as such systems are attractive to both financially motivated cyber criminals and state/politically motivated malicious actors. In this workshop, we will present findings that explore and demonstrate the various applications of blockchain in critical infrastructure sectors.
