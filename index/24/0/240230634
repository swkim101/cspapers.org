To address the sample selection bias between the training and test data, previous research works focus on reweighing biased training data to match the test data and then building classification models on the reweighed training data. However, how to achieve fairness in the built classification models is under-explored. In this paper, we propose a framework for robust and fair learning under sample selection bias. Our framework adopts the reweighing estimation approach for bias correction and the minimax robust estimation approach for achieving robustness on prediction accuracy. Moreover, during the minimax optimization, the fairness is achieved under the worst case, which guarantees the model's fairness on test data. We further develop two algorithms to handle sample selection bias when test data is both available and unavailable.
