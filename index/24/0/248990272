Any person can post arbitrary strings on the bulletin board. Following publication on bulletin board, a party receives a "evidence" that the intended data were posted. The bulletin board is open to the public, which means that anyone can view its contents. The fundamental security criteria for a BB are that its contents cannot be deleted, and that no evidence of publication can be falsified. BB was commonly perceived as a trusted and publicly verifiable channel. It formed the backbone of many important protocols such as e-voting, secure multi-party computation etc. and quite often it was assumed to exist to support the execution of the main protocol. After the advent of blockchain technology, BB systems has found a strong footing regarding its implementation in a distributed manner. In this paper, we aim to provide a concise summary of the evolution of bulletin board, its implementation issues and security analysis with an emphasis on its impact to e-voting systems.
