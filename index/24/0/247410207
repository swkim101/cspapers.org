The emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) sheds light on applying the machine teaching (MT) algorithms for online personalized education on home devices. This direction becomes more promising during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person education becomes infeasible. However, as one of the most inﬂu-ential and practical MT paradigms, iterative machine teaching (IMT) is prohibited on IoT devices due to its inefﬁcient and unscalable algorithms. IMT is a paradigm where a teacher feeds examples iteratively and intelligently based on the learner’s status. In each iteration, current IMT algorithms greedily traverse the whole training set to ﬁnd an example for the learner, which is computationally expensive in practice. We propose a novel teaching framework, Locality Sensitive Teaching (LST), based on locality sensitive sampling, to overcome these challenges. LST has provable near-constant time complexity, which is exponentially better than the existing baseline. With at most 425.12 × speedups and 99.76 % energy savings over IMT, LST is the ﬁrst algorithm that enables energy and time efﬁcient machine teaching on IoT devices. Owing to LST’s substantial efﬁciency and scalability, it is readily applicable in real-world education scenarios.
