With the number of users in crowdsourcing increasing rapidly, task matching service is attracting more and more attention. However, it also causes many security concerns, one of which is the leakage of sensitive information. Privacy-preserving task matching techniques can protect the private information of task requesters and workers. Whereas existing privacy-preserving task matching schemes are constructed on a central server, and thereby they may suffer from potential wrongdoings of a malicious server. In addition, most of them only provide accurate task matching, which means that they cannot tolerate keyword spelling errors, leading to the decline of task matching accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Reliable and Privacy-preserving Task Matching scheme (RPTM) for crowdsourcing. To guarantee the reliability of task matching results, RPTM employs smart contracts to ensure that operations of RPTM are faithfully performed. However, it may still disclose the privacy of users due to the transparency of the blockchain. In order to deal with this problem, RPTM can perform task matching service without compromising the privacy of task requesters and workers by leveraging a novel integer vector encryption scheme. Moreover, RPTM supports multi-keyword fuzzy matching by exploiting locality sensitive hashing and Bloom filter, which can tolerate keyword spelling errors and different expression formats. Extensive analysis and experiments based on a test net of EOS show that RPTM is efficient and secure.
