The volatility of stock price reflects the risk of stock and influences the risk of investor's portfolio. It is also a crucial part of pricing derivative securities. Researchers have paid their attention to predict the stock volatility with different kinds of textual data. However, most of them focus on using word information only. Few touch on capturing the numeral information in textual data, providing fine-grained clues for financial document understanding. In this paper, we present a novel dataset, ECNum, for understanding the numerals in the transcript of earnings conference calls. We propose a simple but efficient method, Numeral-Aware Model (NAM), for enhancing the capacity of numeral understanding of neural network models. We employ the distilled information in the stock volatility forecasting task and achieve the best performance compared to the previous works in short-term scenarios.
