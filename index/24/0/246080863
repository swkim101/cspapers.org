Automation in quantum software testing is essential to support systematic and cost-effective testing. Towards this direction, we present a quantum software testing tool called Quito that can automatically generate test suites covering three coverage criteria defined on inputs and outputs of a quantum program coded in Qiskit, i.e., input coverage, output coverage, and input-output coverage. Quito also implements two types of test oracles based on program specifications, i.e., checking whether a quantum program produced a wrong output or checking a probabilistic test oracle with statistical test. We describe the architecture and methodology of the tool. We also validated the tool with one quantum program and one faulty version of it. Results indicate that Quito can generate test suites and perform test assessments that detect faults, and produce test results with a good time performance.Quito’s code: https://github.com/Simula-COMPLEX/quitoQuito’s video: https://youtu.be/kuI9QaCo8A8Artifact Available: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5288665
