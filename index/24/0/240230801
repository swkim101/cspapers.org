The ever increasing complexity of machine learning techniques used more and more in practice, gives rise to the need to explain the outcomes of these models, often used as black-boxes. Explainable AI approaches are either numerical feature-based aiming to quantify the contribution of each feature in a prediction or symbolic providing certain forms of symbolic explanations such ascounterfactuals. This paper proposes a generic agnostic approach named ASTERYX allowing to generate both symbolic explanations and score-based ones. Our approach is declarative and it is based on the encoding of the model to be explained in an equivalent symbolic representation. This latter serves to generate in particular two types of symbolic explanations which aresufficient reasons andcounterfactuals. We then associate scores reflecting the relevance of the explanations and the features w.r.t to some properties. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approach and its effectiveness in providing symbolic and score-based explanations.
