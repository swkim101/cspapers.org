While online advertising is one of the major sources of income for search engines, pumping up the incomes from business advertisements while ensuring the user experience becomes a challenging but emerging area. Designing high-quality advertisements with persuasive content has been proved as a way to increase revenues through improving the Click-Through Rate (CTR). However, it is difficult to scale up the design of high-quality ads, due to the lack of automation in creativity. In this paper, we present Commonsense-Enriched Advertisement on Search Engine (CHASE) --- a system for the automatic generation of persuasive ads. CHASE adopts a specially designed language model that fuses the keywords, commonsense-related texts, and marketing contents to generate persuasive advertisements. Specifically, the language model has been pre-trained using massive contents of explicit knowledge and fine-tuned with well-constructed quasi-parallel corpora with effective control of the proportion of commonsense in the generated ads and fitness to the ads' keywords. The effectiveness of the proposed method CHASE has been verified by real-world web traffics for search and manual evaluation. In A/B tests, the advertisements generated by CHASE would bring 11.13% CTR improvement. The proposed model has been deployed to cover three advertisement domains (which are kid education, psychological counseling, and beauty e-commerce) at Baidu, the world's largest Chinese search engine, with adding revenue of about 1 million RMB (Chinese Yuan) per day.
