Interactive image retrieval involves users searching a collection of images to satisfy their subjective information needs. However, even large image collections are finite and therefore may not be able to satisfy users. An alternate approach would be to explore a generative adversarial network (GAN) and model users' search intents directly in terms of the latent space used by the GAN to generate images. In this article, we present a simulation study exploring the performance of Gaussian Process bandits in the context of interactive GAN exploration. We used recent advances in interpretable GAN controls to investigate the scalability of different approaches in terms of image space dimensionality. While we present several experiments with promising results, none of the approaches tested scale sufficiently well to explore the entire GAN image space.
