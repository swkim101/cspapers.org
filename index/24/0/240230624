Understanding inactive users is the key to user growth and engagement for many Internet companies. However, learning inactive users' representations and their preferences is still challenging because the features available are missing and the positive responses or labels are insufficient. In this paper, we propose a cross domain learning approach to exclusively recommend customized items to inactive users by leveraging the knowledge of active users. Particularly, we represent users, no matter active or inactive users, by their friends' browsing behaviors based on a graph neural network (GNN) layer atop of a heterogeneous graph defined on social networks (user-user friendships) and browsing behaviors (user-page clicks). We jointly optimize the learning tasks of active users in source domain and inactive users in target domain based on the domain invariant features extracted from the embedding of our GNN layer, where the domain invariant features that are learned to benefit both tasks on active/inactive users, and are indiscriminate with respect to the shift between the domains. Extensive experiments show that our approach can well capture the preference of inactive users using both public data and real-world data at Alipay.
