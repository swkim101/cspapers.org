Subspace clustering based on data self-expressive model aims to represent each data point as a linear combination of other data points on the dataset. Most existing methods focus on developing the regularization of self-expressive coefficients to solve the transductive unsupervised problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Supervised Embedding for Subspace Clustering (S2ESC), which exploits a low-dimensional feature space where the data points belonging to the same category can be well-connected. Specifically, each data point is encouraged to be close to its transformation which is termed as self-supervised embedding learning. Therefore, the self-expressive coefficients can be learned by representing the data points over the corresponding transformations in the feature space. We introduce the low-rank and sparse regularization to illustrate the performance of self-supervised embedding. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the compared traditional subspace clustering methods.
