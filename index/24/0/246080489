Continuous Integration is a critical problem for software maintenance in global projects, compromising companiesâ€™ performance, which tends to accumulate a high-resolution time due to the approval process, conflict resolution, tests, and validations. The process of the validation involves the commit description interpretation and can be automated by NLP-mechanisms. This paper presents an intelligent NLP-based approach to evaluate whether the commits can be integrated into a certain software release based only on their descriptions. Our experiments showed an accuracy of 92.9%.
