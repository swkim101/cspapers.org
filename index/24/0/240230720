With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT), sensor technologies and advancement in the analytics systems mainly in the form of deep learning algorithms, the long quest for developing human-centric applications like automated disease diagnosis, privacy-enabled analytics is becoming a reality. Knowledge-Driven Analytics and Systems Impacting Human Quality of Life (KDAH) is indeed an attractive proposition. For example, Phonocardiogram or heart sound-based detection of heart abnormality or Myocardial Infarction (MI) prediction using single lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are signifying the capability of analytics algorithm to directly solve human-centric problems. We have proposed privacy-preserved analytics with phonocardiogram-based heart condition detection, established benchmark performance of MI detection using single lead ECG signals as well as demonstrated deep residual learning based algorithm to help carbon footprint management.
