Irregularly, asynchronously and sparsely sampled multivariate time series (IASS-MTS) are characterized by sparse non-uniform time intervals between successive observations and different sampling rates amongst series. Those properties pose substantial challenges to mainstream machine learning models for learning complicated relations within and across IASS-MTS. This is because that most of the models assume that the time series in question are even, complete (fixed-dimensional features) and synchronous. To address these challenges, we present a novel time-aware Dual-Attention and Memory-Augmented Network (DAMA-Net). The proposed model can leverage both time irregularity, multi-sampling rates and global temporal patterns information inherent in IASS-MTS so as to learn more effective representations for improving prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments on real datasets show that the DAMA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in multivariate time series classification task.
