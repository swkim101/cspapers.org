Can you speak the way you desire without feeling the pressure to conform to standards of speaking? In this study, we investigated the impact of user-controlled voice manipulation and listening to recordings of model speakers on self-perceptions of voice and speech. Quantitative analysis showed that there was a significant improvement in the perceived confidence of tone by listening to model speakers, but there were no significant improvements due to voice manipulation. Qualitative analysis of interviews revealed that participants responded positively to the visual and auditory feedback provided by the voice manipulation software. The participants also evaluated the quality of model speakers to decide whether or not they wanted to refer to them for speech practice. Based on the results of these analyses, we summarized the design implications for a speech practice system that would allow further investigation of the impact of the system on self-perceptions of speech performance.
