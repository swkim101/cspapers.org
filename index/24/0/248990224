Within the last few years, indirect network-level covert channels have experienced a renaissance with new ideas and evolving concepts. Logical network separation may now be crossed and the sending and receiving activities can be performed with temporal distance between sending and receiving operations. Despite these new developments, all indirect network covert channels share certain basic principles that allow a categorization. So far, the concepts of indirect network-level covert channels have never been systematized. In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy containing indirect covert channel patterns that allow a differentiated analysis of all known indirect network-level covert channels. We introduce additional definitions to unify the understanding of the domain and further identify crucial features of indirect covert channels to make them comparable and describable. We further discuss application scenarios as well as potential and already evaluated countermeasures against indirect covert channels. Further, we discuss observable trends and anticipated future developments in the research area of indirect network-level covert channels.
