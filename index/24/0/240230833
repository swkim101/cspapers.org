Machine learning models have been widely used for fraud detection, while developing and maintaining these models often suffers from significant limitations in terms of training data scarcity and constrained resources. To address these issues, in this paper, we leverage machine learning vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and design a novel model AdvRFD that Adversarially Reprograms an ImageNet classification neural network for Fraud Detection task. AdvRFD first embeds transaction features into a host image to construct new ImageNet data, and then learns a universal perturbation to be added to all inputs, such that the outputs of the pretrained model can be accordingly mapped to the final detection decisions for all transactions. Extensive experiments on two transaction datasets made over Ethereum and credit cards have demonstrated that AdvRFD is effective to detect fraud using limited data and resources.
