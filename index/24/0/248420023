Increased levels of interactivity and multi-sensory stimulation have been shown to enhance the immersion of Virtual Reality experiences. We present the AirRes mask that enables users to utilize their breathing for precise natural interactions with the virtual environment without suffering from limitations of the sensing equipment such as motion artifacts. Furthermore, the AirRes mask provides breathing resistance as novel output modality that can be adjusted in real-time by the application. In a user study, we demonstrate the mask’s precision measurements for interaction as well as its ability to use breathing resistance to communicate contextual information such as adverse environmental conditions that affect the user’s virtual avatar. Our results show that the AirRes mask enhances virtual experiences and has the potential to create more immersive scenarios for applications by enforcing the perception of danger or improving situational awareness in training simulations, or for psychotherapy by providing additional physical stimuli.
