Name ambiguity is a big challenge in people information retrieval and has received considerable attention, especially with the increasing volume of Web data in recent years. In this demo, we present a system, GRAPE, which is capable of finding people related information over the Web. The salient features of our system are people name disambiguation and people tag presentation, which effectively distinguish different people entities sharing the same name and uniquely represent each namesake with a cluster of tags, such as occupation, birthdate, and organization.
