We study the Stochastic Multi-armed Bandit problem under bounded arm-memory. In this setting, the arms arrive in a stream, and the number of arms that can be stored in the memory at any time, is bounded. The decision-maker can only pull arms that are present in the memory. We address the problem from the perspective of two standard objectives: 1) regret minimization, and 2) best-arm identiﬁcation. For regret minimization , we settle an important open question by showing an almost tight guarantee. We show Ω( T 2 / 3 ) cumulative regret in expectation for single-pass algorithms for arm-memory size of ( n − 1) , where n is the number of arms. For best-arm identiﬁcation , we provide an ( ε, δ ) -PAC algorithm with arm-memory size of O (log ∗ n ) and O ( nε 2 · log( 1 δ )) optimal sample complexity.
