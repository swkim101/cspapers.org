Knowledge graph (KG) representation learning which aims to encode entities and relations into low-dimensional spaces, has been widely used in KG completion and link prediction. Although existing KG representation learning models have shown promising performance, the theoretical mechanism behind existing models is much less well-understood. It is challenging to accurately portray the internal connections between models and build a competitive model systematically. To overcome this problem, a unified KG representation learning framework, called GrpKG, is proposed in this paper to model the KG representation learning from a generic groupoid perspective. We discover that many existing models are essentially the same in the sense of groupoid isomorphism and further provide transformation methods between different models. Moreover, we explore the applications of GrpKG in the model classification as well as other processes. The experiments on several benchmark data sets validate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework by comparing two proposed models (GrpQ8 and GrpM2) with the state-of-the-art models.
