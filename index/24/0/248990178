Clicking on the wrong link and downloading a malware or leaking confidential information has been a common threat to everyone. Novel defense mechanisms against web threats have emerged, from URL parsing via Machine Learning to JavaScript deep graph analysis. In this study, we consider the problem of generating Adversarial Examples to evade URL classifiers. We propose a neural network architecture that will be able to generate synthetic URLs for a variety of attacks that will evade existing security classifiers. The main focus of the literature is on classifiers for phishing URLs, but in this work we aim to extend it to other attacks like Drive-by-Download. Our system splits the URL at the word level before substituting words with symbols. This approach contrasts with the existing literature that works on the character level without semantic considerations. We also envision a combination of the word level generation with a character level analysis by a Convolutional Neural Network to improve the evasion capacity of the synthetic samples.
