Reliability is a fundamental computing abstraction. This abstraction is increasingly challenging to achieve at high node-level component densities and for large compute infrastructures. Industry standards have played a key role in enabling such scaling, by facilitating greater heterogeneity, tighter integration of compute and memory, and paving the way for new node and system architectures. Therefore, Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS) techniques that enhance resilience and intercept major industry standards are beneficial to the overall ecosystem that use these standards. We first explain why RAS is important for large-scale systems and outline some key best practices in servers. We then present insights from studying reliability field data from production systems and provide an overview of tools and techniques developed to enhance resiliency and reliability. Finally, we show how the research influenced the RAS architecture and capabilities of two recently announced industry standards and their potential resilience benefits at scale.
