Sound zone technology allows multiple simultaneous sound experiences for multiple people in the same room without interference. However, given the inherent invisible and intangible nature of sound zones, it is unclear how to communicate the position and size of sound zones to users. This paper compares two visualisation techniques; absolute visualisation, relational visualisation, as well as a baseline condition without visualisations. In a within-subject experiment (N = 33), we evaluated these techniques for effectiveness and efficiency across four representative tasks. Our findings show that the absolute and relational visualisation techniques increase effectiveness in multi-user tasks but not in single-user tasks. The efficiency for all tasks was improved using visualisations. We discuss the potential of visualisations for sound zones and highlight future research opportunities for sound zone interaction.
