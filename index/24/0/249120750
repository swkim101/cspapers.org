Modern vehicles are equipped with many ECU s (Electronic Control Unit) that are connected to the IVN (In-Vehicle Network) for controlling the vehicles. Meanwhile, various interfaces of vehicles, such as OBD-II port, T-Box, sensors, and telematics, implement the interaction between the IVN and external environment. Although rich value-added functionalities can be provided through these interfaces, such as diagnostics and OTA (Over The Air) updates, the adversary may also inject malicious data into IVN , thus causing severe safety is-sues. Even worse, existing defense approaches mainly focus on detecting the injection attacks launched from IVN , such as malicious/compromised ECU s, by analyzing CAN frames, and cannot defend against the higher layer MIA s (Message Injection Attacks) that can cause abnormal vehicle dynamics. In this paper, we propose a new state-aware abnormal message injection attack defense approach, named S AID . It detects the abnormal data to be injected into IVN by considering the data semantics and the vehicle dynamics and prevents the MIA s launched from devices connected to the vehicles, such as the compromised diagnostic tools and T-boxes. We develop a prototype of S AID for defending against MIA s and evaluate it using both real road data and simulation data. The experimental results show that S AID can defend against more than 99% of the network and service layer attack trafÔ¨Åc and all state layer MIA s, effectively enforcing the safety of vehicles.
