Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) consist of large-scale interconnected systems of heterogeneous components interacting with their physical environments. There exist a multitude of CPS devices and applications deployed to serve critical functions in our lives thus making security an important non-functional attribute of such systems. CPSS'22 workshop will provide a platform for professionals from academia, government, and industry to discuss novel ways to address the ever-present security and privacy challenges in CPS.
