The 2nd International Workshop on Flexible Resource and Application Management on the Edge (FRAME 2022) is dedicated to the so-called Cloud/Edge Continuum, where Cloud and Edge infrastructures can work together to fulfill requirements from a variety of NextGen applications. Clouds provide appropriate levels of performance to large groups of different users, whereas Edge resources act as a first layer of computing capacity that is closer to the user, to reduce the service latency. With respect to Clouds, Edge infrastructures typically are composed of heterogeneous and constrained resources and introduce new challenges from the viewpoint of security, orchestration and resource management. Tackling these new issues calls for innovative combinations of tools and abstractions, where AI and machine learning techniques complement algorithmic orchestration and optimization, bringing about new levels of distributed adaptivity and self-management. As real-time data-driven decisions can be promptly taken on the spot, without the need to wait for data to travel to the Cloud and back, also interactive and time-sensitive services like the immersive data processing of Extended Reality (XR) applications can be partially extended toward the edge, thus exploiting a better computation to communication tradeoff and smoother connections to improve their QoE and remote collaboration.
