 This paper proposes a topology optimization method that considers the geometrical constraint of a non-closed hole for additive manufacturing based on the fictitious physical model concept. First, the basic topology optimization concept and level set-based method are introduced. Second, the concept of a fictitious physical model for geometrical constraint in the topology optimization framework is discussed. Then, the model for the geometrical constraint of a non-closed hole for additive manufacturing is proposed. Numerical examples are provided to validate the proposed model. In addition, topology optimization considering this geometrical constraint is formulated, and topology optimization algorithms are constructed using the finite element method. Finally, optimization examples are provided to validate the proposed topology optimization method.
