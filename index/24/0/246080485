The need for cyber resilience is increasingly important in our technology-dependent society, where computing systems, devices and data will continue to be the target of cyber attackers. Hence, we propose a conceptual framework called ‘Human-in-the-Loop Explainable-AI-Enabled Vulnerability Detection, Investigation, and Mitigation’ (HXAI-VDIM). Specifically, instead of resolving complex scenario of security vulnerabilities as an output of an AI/ML model, we integrate the security analyst or forensic investigator into the man-machine loop and leverage explainable AI (XAI) to combine both AI and Intelligence Assistant (IA) to amplify human intelligence in both proactive and reactive processes. Our goal is that HXAI-VDIM integrates human and machine in an interactive and iterative loop with security visualization that utilizes human intelligence to guide the XAI-enabled system and generate refined solutions.
