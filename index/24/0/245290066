This paper presents a synthesis of a new nonlinear model based predictive control (NMBPC) for a multivariable nonlinear systems based on a new modeling entitled MISO-GOB-Volettra model. The considered model provides a parametric reduction compared to the MISO Volterra model with a recursive and easy vector representation. This property allows to develop for a 2nd order of nonlinearity the general matrix form of a new predictor allowing proposition of an optimization problem which can be solved as a sequential quadratic method under linear constraints. The regulation performances in terms of tracking and stability of the developed multivariable nonlinear predictive control based on 2nd order MISO-GOB-Volterra model are illustrated on a numerical simulation.
