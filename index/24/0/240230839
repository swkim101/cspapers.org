Graph neural networks (GNN) recently achieved huge success in collaborative filtering (CF) due to the useful graph structure information. However, users will continuously interact with items, which causes the user-item interaction graphs to change over time and well-trained GNN models to be out-of-date soon. Naive solutions such as periodic retraining lose important temporal information and are computationally expensive. Recent works that leverage recurrent neural networks to keep GNN up-to-date may suffer from the "catastrophic forgetting'' issue, and experience a cold start with new users and items. To this end, we propose the incremental graph convolutional network (IGCN) --- a pure graph convolutional network (GCN) based method to update GNN models when new user-item interactions are available. IGCN consists of two main components: 1) a historical feature generation layer, which generates the initial user/item embedding via model agnostic meta-learning and ensures good initial states and fast model adaptation; 2) a temporal feature learning layer, which first aggregates the features from local neighborhood to update the embedding of each user/item within each subgraph via graph convolutional network and then fuses the user/item embeddings from last subgraph and current subgraph via incremental temporal convolutional network. Experimental studies on real-world datasets show that IGCN can outperform state-of-the-art CF algorithms in sequential recommendation tasks.
