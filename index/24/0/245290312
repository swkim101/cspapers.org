Soft, tip-extending, pneumatic "vine robots" that grow via eversion are well suited for navigating cluttered environments. Two key mechanisms that add to the robotâ€™s functionality are a tip-mounted retraction device that allows the growth process to be reversed, and a tip-mounted camera that enables vision. However, previous designs used rigid, relatively heavy electromechanical retraction devices and external camera mounts, which reduce some advantages of these robots. These designs prevent the robot from squeezing through tight gaps, make it challenging to lift the robot tip against gravity, and require the robot to drag components against the environment. To address these limitations, we present a soft, pneumatically driven retraction device and an internal camera mount that are both lightweight and smaller than the diameter of the robot. The retraction device is composed of a soft, extending pneumatic actuator and a pair of soft clamping actuators that work together in an inch-worming motion. The camera mount sits inside the robot body and is kept at the tip of the robot by two low-friction interlocking components. We present characterizations of our retraction device and demonstrations that the robot can grow and retract through turns, tight gaps, and sticky environments while transmitting live video from the tip. Our designs advance the ability of everting vine robots to navigate difficult terrain while collecting data.
