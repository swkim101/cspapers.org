Bamboo is a state-of-the-art concurrency control protocol based on the 2-phase locking protocol. One problem of Bamboo is that it requires transactions to fetch timestamps from a single centralized atomic counter. To replace the concentrated access to it, each transaction should generate timestamps independently. This paper proposes thread-ID method (TID), which dismisses the process of fetching timestamps entirely by assigning an ID to each thread, and transactions use the thread IDs as their timestamps. In high-contention settings, the performance of TID plummets, but proposed optimization FairTID sustains the performance. The experiments measured an improvement of up to 60% from Bamboo with the proposed method.
