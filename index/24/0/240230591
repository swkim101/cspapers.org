As a fundamental task of document content analysis, keyphrase extraction (KE) aims at predicting a set of lexical units that conveys the core information of the document. In this paper, we study the problem of KE in the talent recruitment. This problem is critical for the development of a variety of intelligent recruitment services, such as person-job fit, market trend analysis and course recommendation. However, unlike traditional textual data, the texts from the recruitment domain, such as resume and job postings, often have unique characteristics of abbreviation and succinctness, resulting in massive keyphrases consisting of inconsecutive words that are hard to be fully captured by existing KE methods. To this end, we propose an interactive neural network approach, INKE, for facilitating KE in the talent recruitment. To be specific, we first introduce a novel keyphrase indicator that captures the explicit hint information for each keyphrase. Then, we design a dynamically-initialized decoder which can generate keyphrases in an interactive manner. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm to enhance the interaction between the hint information capture and keyphrase generation. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world data clearly validate the effectiveness and interpretability of INKE compared with state-of-the-art baselines.
