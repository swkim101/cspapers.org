Natural language question answering over knowledge graphs is an important and interesting task as it enables common users to gain accurate answers in an easy and intuitive manner. However, it remains a challenge to bridge the gap between unstructured questions and structured knowledge graphs. To address the problem, a natural discipline is building a structured query to represent the input question. Searching the structured query over the knowledge graph can produce answers to the question. Distinct from the existing methods that are based on semantic parsing or templates, we propose an effective approach qaSQP powered by a novel notion, structural query pattern, in this paper. Given an input question, we first generate its query sketch that is compatible with the underlying structure of the knowledge graph. Then, we complete the query graph by labeling the nodes and edges under the guidance of the structural query pattern. Finally, answers can be retrieved by executing the constructed query graph over the knowledge graph. In order to improve the overall performance of answering questions, we propose the mutual optimization technique. Evaluations on three question-answering benchmarks show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.
