Most cloud services and distributed applications rely on hashing algorithms that allow dynamic scaling of a robust and efficient hash table. Examples include AWS, Google Cloud and BitTorrent. Consistent and rendezvous hashing are algorithms that minimize key remapping as the hash table resizes. While memory errors in large-scale cloud deployments are common, neither algorithm offers both efficiency and robustness. Hyperdimensional Computing is an emerging computational model that has inherent efficiency, robustness and is well suited for vector or hardware acceleration. We propose Hyperdimensional (HD) hashing and show that it has the efficiency to be deployed in large systems. Moreover, a realistic level of memory errors causes more than 20% mismatches for consistent hashing while HD hashing remains unaffected.
