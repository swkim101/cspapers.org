Link-based similarity computation arises in many real applications, including web search, clustering and recommender system. Lots of similarity measures are devoted recently, but there is one undesirable drawback, called ''path missing'' issue, i.e., the paths between objects are not fully considered for similarity computation. For example, SimRank considers only in-coming paths of equal length from a common ''center'' object, and a large portion of other paths are fully neglected. A comprehensive measure can be modeled by tallying all the possible paths between objects, but a large number of traverses would be required for these paths to fetch the similarities, which might increase the computational difficulty. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive similarity measure, namely RG-SimRank (Random surfer Graph-based SimRank), which resolves the "path missing'' issue with inheriting the philosophy of SimRank. We build a random surfer graph by allowing the surfer to stay at current object, go to other objects against in-links or along out-links. RG-SimRank adopts SimRank to compute similarities in random surfer graph instead of the original network, which has a same form of SimRank and hence inherits the optimization techniques on similarity computation. We prove that RG-SimRank considers all the possible paths of any direction and any length. And it provides a general solution to assess similarities, under which lots of existing similarity measures become its special cases. Other similarity measures besides SimRank can also be enhanced similarly using random surfer graph. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.
