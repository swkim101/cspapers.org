The key attribute that drives the unprecedented success of modern Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on learning tasks which involve sequential data, is their ever-improving ability to model intricate long-term temporal dependencies. However, an adequate measure of RNNs long-term memory capacity is lacking, and thus formal understanding of their ability to correlate data throughout time is limited. Though depth efficiency in convolutional networks is well established, it does not suffice in order to account for the success of deep RNNs on data of varying lengths, and the need to address their `time-series expressive power' arises. In this paper, we analyze the effect of depth on the ability of recurrent networks to express correlations ranging over long time-scales. To meet the above need, we introduce a measure of the information flow across time supported by the network, referred to as the Start-End separation rank. This measure essentially reflects the distance of the function realized by the recurrent network from a function that models no interaction whatsoever between the beginning and end of the input sequence. We prove that deep recurrent networks support Start-End separation ranks which are exponentially higher than those supported by their shallow counterparts. Thus, we establish that depth brings forth an overwhelming advantage in the ability of recurrent networks to model long-term dependencies. Such analyses may be readily extended to other RNN architectures of interest, e.g. variants of LSTM networks. We obtain our results by considering a class of recurrent networks referred to as Recurrent Arithmetic Circuits (RACs), which merge the hidden state with the input via the Multiplicative Integration operation. Finally, we make use of the tool of quantum Tensor Networks to gain additional graphic insight regarding the complexity brought forth by depth in recurrent networks.
