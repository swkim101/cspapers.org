Modeling informal inference in natural language is very challenging. With the recent availability of large annotated data, it has become feasible to train complex models such as neural networks to perform natural language inference (NLI), which have achieved state-of-the-art performance. Although there exist relatively large annotated data, can machines learn all knowledge needed to perform NLI from the data? If not, how can NLI models benefit from external knowledge and how to build NLI models to leverage it? In this paper, we aim to answer these questions by enriching the state-of-the-art neural natural language inference models with external knowledge. We demonstrate that the proposed models with external knowledge further improve the state of the art on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset.
