''User reviews‚Äù are becoming an essential component of e-commerce. When buyers write a negative or doubting review, ideally, the sellers need to quickly give a response to minimize the potential impact. When the number of reviews is growing at a frightening speed, there is an urgent need to build a response writing assistant for customer service providers. In order to generate high-quality responses, the algorithm needs to consume and understand the information from both the original review and the target product. The classical sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) methods can hardly satisfy this requirement. In this study, we propose a novel deep neural network model based on the Seq2Seq framework for the review response generation task in e-commerce platforms, which can incorporate product information by a gated multi-source attention mechanism and a copy mechanism. Moreover, we employ a reinforcement learning technique to reduce the exposure bias problem. To evaluate the proposed model, we constructed a large-scale dataset from a popular e-commerce website, which contains product information. Empirical studies on both automatic evaluation metrics and human annotations show that the proposed model can generate informative and diverse responses, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art text generation models.
