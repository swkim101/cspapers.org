Design of effective control for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires consideration of several sources of uncertainty. These undesired uncertainties affect the flight stability and performance in an unpredictable manner. The existence of transmission delays caused by wireless communication and payload variation are among such critical challenges. Adaptive control (AC) can lead to high performance tracking in the presence of uncertainties. This paper presents the application of model reference adaptive control (MRAC) to quadrotor types of UAVs considering the time delay in the altitude control system. MATLAB system identification tool is applied to obtain the altitude motion model, without time delay, for the quadrotor. Proportional-plus-velocity (PV) and PV-MRAC altitude control systems are designed, by incorporating an estimated constant time delay. The designed controllers are validated using simulations and flight tested in an indoor environment. The robustness of the PV-MRAC controller is tested against the baseline non-adaptive PV controller using the quadrotorâ€™s payload capability..
