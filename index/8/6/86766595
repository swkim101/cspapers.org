bases were introduced in [Smyth, 1977] where they are called \R-structures". Examples of abstract bases are concrete bases of continuous domains, of course, where the relation is the restriction of the order of approximation. Axiom (INT) is satis ed because of Lemma 2.2.15 and because we have required bases in domains to have directed sets of approximants for each element. Other examples are partially ordered sets, where (INT) is satis ed because of re exivity. We will shortly identify posets as being exactly the bases of compact elements of algebraic domains. In what follows we will use the terminology developed at the beginning of this chapter, even though the relation on an abstract basis need neither
