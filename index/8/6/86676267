The ACM CIKM07 Workshop on Web Information and Data Management (WIDM 2007) is the ninth in a series of workshops on Web Information and Data Management held in conjunction with the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). The objective of the workshop is to bring together researchers, industrial practitioners, and developers to study how Web information can be extracted, stored, analyzed, and processed to provide useful knowledge to the end users for various advanced database applications. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for all experts in the field. 
 
The call for papers resulted in the submission of 80 papers from 32 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mauritius, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom and the United States. 
 
Starting from 2005, the workshop has a one-day schedule. All papers were thoroughly reviewed by the program committee and external reviewers. This year, the program committee accepted 20 papers, resulting in a competitive 25% acceptance rate. The 20 accepted papers were divided into five sessions: "XML and Semi-Structured Data", "P2P and System Design Issues", "Personalization", "Mining Knowledge from Web Data" and "Web Metadata and Search".
