Big Data is about extracting valuable information from data in order to use it in intelligent ways such as to revolutionize decision-making in businesses, science and society. The continuous and tremendous growth of data volume and velocity combined with easier access to data and the availability of powerful IT systems have led to intensified activities around Big Data. 
 
BIGDSE 2015 aims to explore opportunities that Big Data technology offers to software engineering, both in research and practice. In addition, BIGDSE will look at the software engineering challenges imposed by building Big Data software systems. The workshop brings together researchers and practitioners working in the areas of Big Data, software engineering and software analytics to discuss research challenges, recent developments, novel applications and scenarios, as well as methods, techniques, experiences, and tools to leverage and exploit the opportunities offered by Big Data.
