Healthcare Informatics is one of the fastest growing economic sectors in the world today. With the anticipated future advances and investments in this field, it is expected that Healthcare Informatics will become one of the dominant economic factors in the 21st century. In addition to economic importance, this field has the potential to make substantial contributions to the comfort and longevity of every human being on the face of the earth. Software, and thus Software Engineering, has an important role to play in all of this. Medical devices, electronic medical records, robotic-driven surgery are just some examples where software plays a critical role. In addition, medical processes are known to be error prone and prime targets for process improvement technology. Moreover, there are important questions about software quality, user interfaces, systems interoperability, process automation, regulatory regimes, and many other concerns familiar to software engineering practitioners and researchers. 
 
The Software Engineering in Health Care (SEHC) workshop series was established to provide a forum for reporting on research and experience associated with this dynamic and challenging domain.
