The GREENS workshop provides a forum for practitioners and academics to share knowledge, ideas, practices, and current results related to green and sustainable software engineering. The goal of green software engineering is to apply green principles to the design and operation of softwareintensive systems. Green and self-greening software systems have tremendous potential to decrease energy consumption. Moreover, enterprise software can and should be re-thought to address sustainability issues using innovative business models, processes, and incentives. Monitoring and measuring the greenness of software is critical towards the notion of sustainable and green software. Demonstrating improvement is paramount for users to achieve and affect change. Thus, the theme of GREENS 2015 is Towards a Green Software Body of Knowledge. GREENS 2015 is interested in contributions from industry, government, and academia on all topics related to greener software engineering. Topics range from bringing sustainability and energy efficiency into all software lifecycle stages, to green measures and estimations, practices, notations, and tools to both greening the software engineering process, and greening the resulting ICT systems. 
 
To ensure high quality papers and presentations, all submissions were reviewed by at least three program committee members whose identity was not revealed to any of the authors. The reviewers did not review papers for which they had a conflict of interest. The organizers were excluded by the reviewer selection process when in direct or indirect conflict of interest.
