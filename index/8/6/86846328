Mixed Reality (MR) is a promising interface for robot programming because it can project an immersive 3D visualization of a robotâ€™s intended movement onto the real world. MR can also support hand gestures, which provide an intuitive way for users to construct and modify robot motions. We present a Mixed Reality Head-Mounted Display (MRHMD) interface that enables end-users to easily create and edit robot motions using waypoints. We describe a user study where 20 participants were asked to program a robot arm using 2D and MR interfaces to perform two pick-and-place tasks. In the primitive task, participants created typical pickand-place programs. In the adapted task, participants adapted their primitive programs to address a more complex pickand-place scenario, which included obstacles and conditional reasoning. Compared to the 2D interface, a higher number of users were able to complete both tasks in significantly less time, and reported experiencing lower cognitive workload, higher usability, and higher naturalness with the MR-HMD interface.
