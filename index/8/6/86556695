The 2006 International Workshop on Web Information and Data Management (WIDM 2006) is the eighth in a series of workshops on Web Information and Data Management held in conjunction with the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). The objective of the workshop is to bring together researchers, industrial practitioners, and developers to study how Web information can be extracted, stored, analyzed, and processed to provide useful knowledge to the end users for various advanced database applications. WIDM 2006 has received the sponsorship from ACM SIGIR. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for all experts in the field.The call for papers resulted in the submission of 51 papers from Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, South America, and the United States. Starting from last year, the workshop has a one-day schedule. All papers were thoroughly reviewed by the program committee and external reviewers. This year, the program committee accepted 11 papers, resulting in a competitive 21.5% acceptance rate. The 11 accepted papers were divided into 4 sessions: "XML Data Management and P2P," "Web Ranking and Classification," "Web Resource Crawling and Searching", and "Web Organization". In addition, the WIDM 2006 program also includes an invited talk on "The Power of Structured Data on the Web" by Sihem Amer-Yahia, from Yahoo! Research (USA).
