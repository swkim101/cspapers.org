With the proliferation of embedded ubiquitous systems in all aspects of human life, the embedded systems world has become a fast growing industry. Embedded systems have to rely on high quality hardware as well as high quality software. Software development for embedded systems is often a complex undertaking and fundamentally different from that of non-embedded systems. Complexity arises from the need to co-design and create software at low-level of abstraction that also interacts closely with hardware with strong emphasis on dependability and mission-critical real-time constraints. Compared to traditional software development, the increasing complexity also exacerbates challenges in embedded software development processes, such as troubles in achieving sufficient product quality and timely delivery. In order to tackle these challenges in embedded software development, industry needs to apply software engineering technologies that are appropriate for specific situations. 
 
The 2nd International Workshop on Software Engineering for Embedded Systems (SEES 2012) Workshop, in conjunction with International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2012) in Zurich, Switzerland, aims to provide researchers and practitioners an international forum to discuss the issues, challenges in adopting software engineering methods for embedded systems development. Further, the overall goal of the workshop is to identify the research opportunities and develop a research agenda to tackle the challenges.
