Data-driven approaches such as Gaussian Process (GP) regression have been used extensively in recent robotics literature to achieve estimation by learning from experience. To ensure satisfactory performance, in most cases, multiple learning inputs are required. Intuitively, adding new inputs can often contribute to better estimation accuracy, however, it may come at the cost of a new sensor, larger training dataset and/or more complex learning, some- times for limited benefits. Therefore, it is crucial to have a systematic procedure to determine the actual impact each input has on the estimation performance. To address this issue, in this paper we propose to analyse the impact of each input on the estimate using a variance-based sensitivity analysis method. We propose an approach built on Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) decomposition, which can characterise how the prediction changes as one or more of the input changes, and also quantify the prediction uncertainty as attributed from each of the inputs in the framework of dependent inputs. We apply the proposed approach to a terrain-traversability estimation method we proposed in prior work, which is based on multi-task GP regression, and we validate this implementation experimentally using a rover on a Mars-analogue terrain.
