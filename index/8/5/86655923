Result ranking diversification has become an important issue for web search, summarization, and question answering. For more complex questions with multiple aspects, such as those in community-based question answering (CQA) sites, a retrieval system should provide a diversified set of relevant results, addressing the different aspects of the query, while minimizing redundancy or repetition. We present a new method, DRN , which learns novelty-related features from unlabeled data with minimal social signals, to emphasize diversity in ranking. Specifically, DRN parameterizes question-answer interactions via an LSTM representation, coupled with an extension of neural tensor network, which in turn is combined with a novelty-driven sampling approach to automatically generate training data. DRN provides a novel and general approach to complex question answering diversification and suggests promising directions for search improvements.
