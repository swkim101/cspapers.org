An Institute of Medicine report published in 2012 concluded that healthcare has become too complex and costly to continue on its present trajectory, and that digital technologies will be a key aspect of healthcare delivery [1]. While such reports provide a valuable research agenda for how the healthcare system needs to function, a fundamental issue is it is not designed to provide the level of care outlined in the reports. For our healthcare system to function at a high level it needs to undergo a substantial transformation, of which software engineering and the SEHC community will play a critical role. The current healthcare delivery paradigm is one of connectivity and information exchange. Software engineering will be a crucial enabling technology for healthcare transformation because our ability to provide integrated healthcare delivery will only be as good as our ability to engineer the underlying software that enables connectivity. In that sense, our ability to deliver efficient, safe and evidence based healthcare services will depend greatly on software engineering and the innovative research of the SEHC community.
