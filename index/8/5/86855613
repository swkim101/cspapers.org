Welcome to the 4th International Workshop on Managing Technical Debt (MTD 2013), colocated with the 35rd International Conference on Software Engineering in San Francisco, California. This is the third year that we are holding this workshop co-located with ICSE. 
 
Delivering complex, large-scale systems faces the ongoing challenge of how to balance rapid deployment with long-term value. From Cunningham's original description---"not quite right code which we postpone making it right"---people have used the metaphor of technical debt to describe many other kinds of debts or ills of software development, including anything that stands in the way of deploying, selling, or evolving a software system or anything that adds to the friction from which software development endeavors suffer: test debt, people debt, architectural debt, requirement debt, documentation debt, or just an amorphous, all-encompassing software debt.
