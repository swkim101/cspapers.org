This paper reviews the development of the intelligent robot and separates skills from high level intelligence. It demonstrates that skills can be represented as virtual mechanisms programmed in software. Virtual mechanisms are defined by controlling both motion and force of a robot arm in a task related cartesian coordinate system. By adding monitoring, a skillful robot system can be built. The skill of an intelligent robot is accumulated in the form of task - particular knowledge that is a specification of the mechanism.
