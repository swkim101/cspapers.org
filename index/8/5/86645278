The workshop aims to be a research living lab to answer these questions while building an academic research agenda and network on the design and innovation concerns in software engineering. Participants are encouraged to investigate multidisciplinary design research and design thinking approaches and their integration into the wider engineering and innovation processes. The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from various fields to look across various design theories and schools including the traditional software design methodologies, innovation by design, design and system thinking and user-centric design, participatory design, eco-design and innovation approaches.
