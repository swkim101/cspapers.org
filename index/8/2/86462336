It my great pleasure and honor to welcome you to FoSER 2010: The FSE/SDP Workshop on the Future of Software Engineering Research. This workshop was organized in collaboration with and made possible by generous support from the Software Design and Productivity Coordinating Group (SDP) of the U.S. National Coordination Office (NCO) for Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). 
 
This one-time, international working conference has brought together top academic and industrial researchers and government research funding agency personnel from around the world to engage in an extended discussion of consequential new ideas about the future of our field. The ideas produced by this workshop will be disseminated in two forms. First, the position papers accepted by the program committee will be published in a companion to the Proceedings of FSE-18. Second, the workshop findings will be published subsequently in a special report by NITRD/SDP. 
 
The call for papers for FoSER 2010 solicited 4-page position papers with new ideas about the future of software and software-reliant systems, and the research that will be needed to meet future needs. Papers were expected to be creative and thought-provoking, and to articulate compelling new perspectives, positions, problem formulations, assumptions and approaches. The workshop did not seek, and did not accept, technical research papers or abstracts. The workshop received a total of 139 position papers. Of these, 90 papers (65%) were accepted. Each paper was reviewed by at least two members of the workshop program committee. The committee was asked to accept all papers presenting significant new ideas about how our field should move forward.
