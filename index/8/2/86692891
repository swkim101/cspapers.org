It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Wireless of the students, by the students, for the students workshop -- ACM S3'11. Now in its third year, this workshop continues the tradition of being a unique venue for graduate students around the world to present, discuss, and exchange ideas on research in systems and theory of mobile wireless networks. Last year's workshop continued to attract numerous student researchers worldwide and we hope that the new additions to the program will make S3 even more interesting and more relevant. 
 
Building on the success of two previous workshops, this year's program comprises several new sessions. Nine research presentations are divided between the systems and theory tracks, including negative result presentations. A new startup/wild ideas session promises to be an interesting setting for participants to showcase their creativity. A PhD forum session enables participants to discuss interesting aspects of their research beyond their results, such as their impact and relevance. Finally, a panel of recent graduates of wireless research will discuss the pros and cons of their career choices to guide student researchers in their future career paths.
