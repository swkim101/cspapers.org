It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 17th ACM International Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP (DOLAP 2014). The DOLAP workshop continues its tradition of being a premier forum where both researchers and practitioners in Data Warehousing and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) share their findings in theoretical foundations, methodologies, physical designs, new trends, and practical experiences. The mission of the DOLAP workshop is to identify and explore new directions for future research and development, as well as emerging application domains in the areas of data warehousing and OLAP. Traditional solutions and architecture designs in Data Warehousing and OLAP are evolving to cope with emerging application domains and data types, such as MPP, big data infrastructures, and analytics. In recent years, research in these areas has addressed emerging topics and has provided solutions toward building effective decision-support applications, deploying them on modern hardware, and aiming at improving optimization objectives as system performance. 
 
The call for papers attracted 24 submissions (22 regular papers and 2 short papers) from 17 different countries. The program committee reviewed and accepted 8 full papers and 4 short papers, resulting to an acceptance rate of 36% for full papers and 50% overall. The accepted papers span a wide variety of topics, including query processing and physical design, security issues for cloud data warehouses, handling of 'exotic' data like genomic and GPS data, location intelligence, optimization and data generation for data flows, and modeling issues for movement data, analytical metadata, and OLAP sessions. The program also includes an invited keynote talk by Prof. Minos Garofalakis from the Technical University of Crete, on querying big, dynamic, distributed data, and a panel on how DW and OLAP technologies can be used in big graph analytics.
