We would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to the Fourth International Workshop on Realizing Artificial Intelligence Synergies in Software Engineering (RAISE 2015) which is co-located with the 37th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2015) and will be held in Florence on 17th May 2015. We are looking forward to an interdisciplinary workshop in which the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering is explored and extended. 
 
We had a total of thirteen submissions. After a rigorous reviewing cycle we accepted seven research papers, one of which was an invited paper. These papers will stimulate many varied discussions and will help to continue the momentum which drives the RAISE workshops. 
 
The RAISE workshops provide a platform for discussion of the synergies between AI and software engineering and also help to raise awareness of this work within the wider community. This year we are honoured to have a very exciting keynote talk by John Mylopoulos (from the University of Toronto) entitled "Knowledge Representation for Requirements Engineering, and Requirements Engineering for Intelligent Systems". This will set the stage for our workshop and will be a source of great inspiration.
