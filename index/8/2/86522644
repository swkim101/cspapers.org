Welcome to the Workshop on Domain-Specific Approaches to Software Test Automation --- DoSTA 2007. This is the first time a workshop dedicated for domain-specific issues in software test automation is being organized. We are expecting a day full of exciting presentations and fruitful discussions. We hope you can use this opportunity to network with your colleagues in this emerging field. 
 
There were paper submissions from seven countries: Brazil, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United States. Each paper was read by at least three reviewers. Six papers were accepted for presentation at the workshop and publication in these proceedings.
