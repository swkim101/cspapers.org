The purpose of this project was to demonstrate that digital radiography is a credible and advantageous non-destructive testing technique to find corrosion under insulation. Despite regular planned CUI surveys process pipework is still failing as a result of CUI. It is incredibly important that companies adopt a successful CUI survey to ensure the ongoing safe and reliable operation of their assets. It has proved difficult in the past to find a viable and reliable technique to carry out successful surveys. Digital radiography will demonstrate its successfulness by presenting how it can reduce man-hours considerably from that of previous surveys and most importantly produce reliable and safe results that the client can view for themselves to give them confidence in the survey. The digital radiography technique can elevate itself as the number one technique to aid in the detection of CUI, eliminating the need to use other advanced techniques out with the core crew capabilities on an offshore platform. The survey will look at the radiographic technique to be deployed and the software systems utilised and exhibit the results of the survey along with any lessons learned to improve any future surveys undertaken.
