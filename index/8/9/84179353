Fiducials are artificial features with a variety of uses in computer vision such as object tracking and localization. We propose the idea of flexible tag layouts for visual fiducial systems. In contrast to traditional square tags, flexible tag layouts allow circular, annular, or other shapes as desired. One use of layout flexibility is to increase the data density of standard square shaped tags. In addition, we describe a detector that is faster and has higher recall than both the AprilTag 2 and ArUco detectors while maintaining precision.
