A large body of research into FLOSS (Free/Libre/Open Source Software) has focused on the exemplars within the available corpus of FLOSS projects: such as Apache HTTP Server, Eclipse, and Linux. However, many other FLOSS projects exist which provide a very rich body to study and understand. By focusing on more projects that perhaps do not gain the immediate attention of researchers, we hope to broaden our knowledge of the rich ecosystems within FLOSS. 
 
Specifically, the goal of the FLOSS-3 workshop (8th in a series at ICSE) is to bring together academic researchers, industry members, and FLOSS developers for the purpose of discussing topics including analyzing "competing" projects within FLOSS that share the same domain, performing data collection and analysis among many FLOSS projects, examining governance models within FLOSS projects, identifying licensing paradigms of FLOSS projects, discussing the interplay of corporate involvement within FLOSS projects, social and technical interactions between FLOSS projects, and dependency analysis and reuse between FLOSS projects. 
 
We believe that this workshop will also serve as a common bridge between the ACM/IEEE (ICSE) and (IFIP) OSS research communities, thereby providing a window for others in the Software Engineering community to interact with and learn more about the advances of research into FLOSS development and communities.
