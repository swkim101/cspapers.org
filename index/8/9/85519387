Nowadays most IoT devices in smart homes rely on radio frequency channels for communication, making them exposed to various attacks. Existing methods using encryption keys may be inapplicable on these resource-constrained devices that cannot afford the computationally expensive encryption operations. Thus, in this paper we design a key-free communication method for such devices. In particular, we introduce the Home-limited Channel (HLC) that can be accessed only within a house yet inaccessible for an outside-house attacker. Utilizing HLCs, we propose a challenge-response mechanism to authenticate the communications inside a house. The advantages of the HlcAuth protocol are low cost, lightweight as well as key-free, and requiring no human intervention. We show that HlcAuth can defeat replay attacks, message-forgery attacks, and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, among others. HlcAuth achieves 100% true positive rate (TPR) within 4.2m for in-house devices while 0% false positive rate (FPR) for outside attackers.
