This paper describee some new methods used in PLANNER-BESM-6 system for the implementation of PLANNER. Backtracking is implemented with a single stack and no copying of activation frames is needed. Lists are represented as arrays of pointers; the garbage collector for this representation requires no additional memory. Restrictions on variable values are accomplished by using 'semi-definedf structures. These methods have enabled to achieve the high efficiency of the system work.
