This paper presents the design, modeling, analysis, and experimental results of a bipedal robotic system that utilizes two interconnected single degree-of-freedom leg mechanisms to produce stable forward locomotion and steering. The legs are composed of double four-bar mechanism connected in series that maintain a parallel orientation of a flat foot, relative to the biped body, that is actuated via a Reuleaux triangle cam-follower system to produce a desirable foot trajectory. The mechanical design of the leg mechanism is presented followed by kinematic analysis of the cam-follower system to select the optimal foot trajectory and synthesize the mechanism dimensions and produce a desired step height and step length. The concept of leg sequencing is then presented to maintain a constant body height above the ground and a constant forward walking velocity. Experimental results using an integrated prototype indicate that the proposed biped robot is capable of maintaining quasi-static stability during locomotion, maintaining a constant robot body height, maintaining a constant body orientation, move forward with a constant maximum velocity of 27.4 cm/s, and steer.
