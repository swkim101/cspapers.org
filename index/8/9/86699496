It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the WWW 2017 â€“ the International Workshop on Social Computing: Spatial Social Behavior Analytics on the Web. IWSC is a new and main international forum for scientists, engineers, and users to exchange and share their experiences, new ideas, and latest research results on all aspects of social computing. The goal of this workshop is to invent new techniques and approaches to explain user-to-user relationships in physical world based on their cyber information, e.g., social connections, online behaviors and disclosed location information in large social networks. The cast from cyber to physical world can help industries to extract and build their invaluable knowledge base and improve their business service quality, especially when the data is big and complex. The workshop will encourage researchers to invent efficient data processing techniques to discover invaluable knowledge. Our target is to bring together researchers and practitioners from around the world in database system, data mining, big data, graph processing, distributed and parallel processing, machine learning communities interested in (1) cloud computing/parallel data processing, (2) advanced index and algorithms, (3) quality model and metric of data mining, (4) short text processing in information retrieval, (4) building models and frameworks for evaluating the designed approaches.
