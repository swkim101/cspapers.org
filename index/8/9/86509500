Welcome to the (pre-workshop) proceedings of the 4th SEMAT Workshop on General Theory of Software Engineering (GTSE 2015), co-located with the 37th International Conference on Software Engineering in Florence, Italy, on May 18th, 2015. 
 
General theories explain the fundamental phenomena that constitute a research domain. They apply across a domain and often integrate many theories and concepts into a single cohesive view. While general theories are extremely important for education and research coordination, and common in many disciplines (e.g. sociology, criminology, electrical engineering, biology, physics), software engineering lacks a well-accepted general theory. The General Theory of Software Engineering workshop seeks to rectify this situation by promoting theory development in software engineering.
