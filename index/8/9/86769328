The rapid evolution of software technology has brought monumental changes to virtually every market sector and has created enormous opportunities for innovation. One such opportunity is developing innovative systems through the composition of software services available over the Internet. Those services have the power to provide utility to users in a much more dynamic and flexible way than is possible with traditional software technology. 
 
However, service-oriented systems and their corresponding software services require fundamental changes to the way software is developed, deployed and maintained. Software that constitutes a service-oriented system is no longer owned by one single organization but is distributed and shared amongst many organizations. This distributed ownership opens up a whole range of challenges, including the design, evolution, adaptation and quality assurance of service-oriented systems. 
 
This workshop presents and discusses results of fundamental research carried out within S-Cube, the European Network of Excellence on Software Services and Systems1. The workshop also serves as a springboard to discuss research challenges for developing, maintaining as well as operating future service-oriented systems and software services.
