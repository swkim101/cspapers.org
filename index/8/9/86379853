The increasing utilization of massive open online courses has significantly expanded global access to formal education. Despite the technology's promising future, student interaction on MOOCs is still a relatively under-explored and poorly understood topic. This work proposes a multi-level pattern discovery through hierarchical discriminative tensor factorization. We formulate the problem as a hierarchical discriminant subspace learning problem, where the goal is to discover the shared and discriminative patterns with a hierarchical structure. The discovered patterns enable a more effective exploration of the contrasting behaviors of two performance groups. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world MOOC datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our study advances the current predictive modeling in MOOCs by providing more interpretable behavioral patterns and linking their relationships with the performance outcome.
