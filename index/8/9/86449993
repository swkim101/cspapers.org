The theme of this year's workshop, aligned with the ICSE 2012 conference theme, is Automation of Security Testing. The broad scope of AST is reflected in the wide range of topics covered by the 33 submissions that we received. Of these, with the 34 members of the AST Program Committee from both academic and industrial research labs, we selected 22 regular research papers that are grouped into seven sessions, representing a diversity of test automation related topics. The seven sessions are: 
 
•Security 
 
•Surveys 
 
•Industrial case studies 
 
•Input generation/selection I 
 
•GUI testing 
 
•Design for test 
 
•Input generation/selection II
