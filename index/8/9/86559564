This paper introduces CertiCAN, a tool produced using the Coq proof assistant for the formal certification of CAN analysis results. Result certification is a process that is light-weight and flexible compared to tool certification, which makes it a practical choice for industrial purposes. The analysis underlying CertiCAN, which is based on a combined use of two well-known CAN analysis techniques, is computationally efficient. Experiments demonstrate that CertiCAN is faster than the corresponding certified combined analysis. More importantly, it is able to certify the results of RTaW-Pegase, an industrial CAN analysis tool, even for large systems. This result paves the way for a broader acceptance of formal tools for the certification of real-time systems analysis results.
