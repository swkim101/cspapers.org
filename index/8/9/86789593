With the growth of computation-intensive real-time applications on multi-core embedded systems, energy-efficient real-time scheduling becomes crucial. Multi-core processors enable intra-task parallelism, and there has been much progress on exploiting that, while there has been only a little progress on energy-efficient multi-core real-time scheduling as yet. In this work, we study energy-efficient real-time scheduling of constrained deadline sporadic parallel tasks, where each task is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We consider a clustered multi-core platform where processors within the same cluster run at the same speed at any given time. A new concept named speed-profile is proposed to model per-task and per-cluster energy-consumption variations during run-time to minimize the expected long-term energy consumption. To our knowledge, no existing work considers energy-aware real-time scheduling of DAG tasks with constrained deadlines, nor on a clustered multi-core platform. The proposed energy-aware realtime scheduler is implemented upon an ODROID XU-3 board to evaluate and demonstrate its feasibility and practicality. To complement our system experiments in large-scale, we have also conducted simulations that demonstrate a CPU energy saving of up to 57% through our proposed approach compared to existing methods.
