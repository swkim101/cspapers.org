With the continued proliferation of drones, unmanned aerial vehicles, additional uses for them are growing and the demand for their services is on the rise. We present AnDrone, a drone-as-a-service solution that makes drones accessible in the cloud. AnDrone pairs a cloud service with the first drone virtualization architecture. This enables a physical drone to run multiple virtual drones simultaneously in an isolated and secure manner at little additional cost, as computational costs are cheap compared to the operational and energy costs of putting a drone in the air. AnDrone virtualizes drones using a novel Linux container architecture. Android Things virtual drone containers provide a familiar user and development environment that can run existing Android apps. A real-time Linux flight controller container supports existing drone flight software and provides virtual drones with geofenced flight control. A device container transparently multiplexes access from virtual drones to a full range of drone hardware devices, including cameras and other sensors. Upon flight completion, virtual drones and their data can be uploaded to the cloud for offline access. We have implemented an AnDrone prototype based on Raspberry Pi 3 drone hardware. We demonstrate that it incurs minimal runtime performance and energy overhead, supports real-time virtual drone flight control, and runs untrusted third-party software in virtual drones in a secure manner while ensuring that the service provider maintains control of the drone hardware.
