Software systems have become more and more complicated with components developed by different vendors and using different techniques in different programming languages and even run on different platforms. Few software testing tools can support all testing tasks within one tool. There is an urgent requirement to develop the technology of software test automation (TA) for emerging software technologies. On the other hand, as the theory of software testing become more mature, a deeper automation of the testing process becomes feasible. Therefore, TA is important for the development of software testing methodologies and the progress of the software testing scientific discipline as a part of software engineering. 
 
The goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for both researchers and practitioners to exchange recent research results and novel ideas, as well as to identify challenging and new emerging problems in research and practice. It aims at bridging the gap between theory and practice in order to improve the current state of practice and to foster innovative research in the area. In addition to the general themes and topics, this year we have identified TA in Agile Development as the special focus theme. The workshop will provide a platform for researchers and developers of testing tools to work together to set an agenda and lay the foundation for future development. To achieve this goal, the workshop will continue to follow the successful tradition of the previous editions by forming a program committee consisting of leading active researchers from both academic institutions and the industry. Surrounding the special focus, the structure of the workshop includes charrette discussions, keynote speeches, and regular paper presentations for two days.
