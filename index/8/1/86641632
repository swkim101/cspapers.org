The 1st International Workshop on Software Engineering Curricula for Millennials (SECM 2017) aims at bringing students, educators, and prospective employees together, to discuss the demands and challenges of software engineering education for Millennials, in both higher education and professional settings. 
 
Millennials are defined as the demographic cohort following Generation X, born between early 1980s and early 2000s. Millennials have been dominating the higher education programs for some time. This cohort has unique needs, learning styles, and skills. They are diverse, collaborative, creative, tech-savvy, and keenly interested in emerging technologies. They drive the growth of the software industry, which itself is in a constant state of flux, with new technologies, techniques, paradigms, and application domains popping up with increasing frequency. Companies quickly adjust to this shifting landscape while trying to cater to the needs of their new hires. What about educators? How should software engineering curricula and educators' teaching styles adapt to these changes? Perspectives of students, educators, and prospective employees should be heard. Our goal is to bring them together to discuss these challenges in the context of a highly interactive workshop.
