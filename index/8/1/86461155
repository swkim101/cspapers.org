It is our great pleasure to welcome you to The First ACM Annual International Workshop on Mission-Oriented Wireless Sensor Networking -- ACM MiSeNet'12. The first edition of this year's workshop is the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues of mission-oriented wireless sensor networks, including models, systems, applications, and theory. The mission of the workshop is to understand the major technical and application challenges as well as exchange and discuss scientific and engineering ideas related to architecture, protocols, algorithms, and application design in mission-oriented wireless sensor networks, and identify new directions for future research and development. ACM MiSeNet gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of mission-oriented wireless sensor networking. 
 
The call for papers attracted 18 submissions from Africa, Asia, Europe, South America, and the United States. The program committee accepted 9 papers that cover a variety of topics, including mobility models in participatory sensing, architecture design for highly-scalable and low duty-cycle sensor networks, middleware for resource and mission oriented sensor networks, and fault tolerance. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech by Professor Sajal K. Das on the challenges and future directions of cyber-physical and networked sensor systems. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers in the area of missionoriented wireless sensor networking.
