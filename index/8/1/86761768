It is our pleasure to welcome the reader to the (pre-workshop) proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Requirements Engineering and testing (RET15) co-located with the 37th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2015) held in Florence, Italy, 18th May 2015. 
 
RET is an important new area within software engineering that focuses on how RE can interact with Testing and vice versa in order to better support the overall software engineering process, and improve software quality and requirements compliance. While requirements specify the expectations of the stakeholders on a software system, testing should ensure these expectations are met. Indeed, in many areas, such as in the automotive and telecommunications domains, certification of the system functionalities and qualities depends in part on demonstrating that the system has been thoroughly tested with respect to the requirements. 
 
The goal of this workshop is to highlight the importance of this cross-disciplinary research area and to develop a body of knowledge for RET. The workshop provides a forum where researchers from different research communities and practitioners can meet, share ongoing research and together chart a proposed agenda for future research.
