We would like to take this opportunity to welcome you all to the second workshop on Games and Software Engineering --- "GAS 2012: Realizing User Engagement with Game Engineering Techniques." GAS 2012 explores issues that crosscut the software engineering and the game engineering communities. We had a total of eighteen submissions, of which nine were accepted. The first workshop on Games and Software Engineering was held in conjunction with ICSE 2011 in Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii. This workshop brought a diverse community of researchers and practitioners together, fostering discussion on new and interesting research avenues. 
 
This year's program, put together by the program committee and ourselves, touches on three main topics: gamification and the software engineering process, software engineering techniques for games, and studies of serious and pervasive games. We believe that this diversity in topics and selected papers will continue to foster the growth of our community.
