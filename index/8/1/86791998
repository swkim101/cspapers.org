We present a novel generative Session-Based Recommendation (SBR) framework, called VAriational SEssion-based Recommendation (VASER) - a non-linear probabilistic methodology allowing Bayesian inference for flexible parameter estimation of sequential recommendations. Instead of directly applying extended Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) to SBR, the proposed method introduces normalizing flows to estimate the probabilistic posterior, which is more effective than the agnostic presumed prior approximation used in existing deep generative recommendation approaches. VASER explores soft attention mechanism to upweight the important clicks in a session. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, including the recently-proposed RNN/VAE-based approaches on real-world datasets.
