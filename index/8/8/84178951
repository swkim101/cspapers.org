The process of data exploration is becoming an essential part of today's scientific workflows. A large number of immersive visualization environments are being explored to help researchers and experts to better understand the data and to offer intuitive interaction. Despite these benefits, shown by prior research, it is still uncommon to find them being applied to realistic scientific workflows. We argue that immersive visualization techniques will not be adopted until they can be easily integrated in the workflow of domain experts, and that specific efforts should be made to help the integration of novel and immersive visualization techniques with classically used software.
