Under a newly introduced setting of multistream classification, two data streams are involved, which are referred to as source and target streams. The source stream continuously generates data instances from a certain domain with labels, while the target stream does the same task without labels from another domain. Existing approaches assume that domains for both data streams are identical, which is not quite true in real world scenario, since data streams from different sources may contain distinct features. Furthermore, obtaining labels for every instance in a data stream is often expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it has become an important topic to explore whether labeled instances from other related streams can be helpful to predict those unlabeled instances in a given stream. Note that domains of source and target streams may have distinct features spaces and data distributions. Our objective is to predict class labels of data instances in the target stream by using the classifiers trained by the source stream. We propose a framework of multistream classification by using projected data from a common latent feature space, which is embedded from both source and target domains. This framework is also crucial for enterprise system defenders to detect cross-platform attacks, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Empirical evaluation and analysis on both real-world and synthetic datasets are performed to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, comparing to state-of-the-art techniques. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms other existing approaches.
