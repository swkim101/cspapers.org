This paper presents URSA, a hybrid block store that provides virtual disks for various applications to run efficiently on cloud VMs. Trace analysis shows that the I/O patterns served by block storage have limited locality to exploit. Therefore, instead of using SSDs as a cache layer, URSA proposes an SSD-HDD-hybrid storage structure that directly stores primary replicas on SSDs and replicates backup replicas on HDDs, using journals to bridge the performance gap between SSDs and HDDs. URSA integrates the hybrid structure with designs for high reliability, scalability, and availability. Experiments show that URSA in its hybrid mode achieves almost the same performance as in its SSD-only mode (storing all replicas on SSDs), and outperforms other block stores (Ceph and Sheepdog) even in their SSD-only mode while achieving much higher CPU efficiency (performance per core). We also discuss some practical issues in our deployment.
