Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have not only achieved a big success in various generation tasks such as images, but also boosted the accuracy of classification tasks by generating additional labeled data, which is called data augmentation. In this paper, we propose a Rating Augmentation framework with GAN, named RAGAN, aiming to alleviate the data sparsity problem in collaborative filtering (CF), eventually improving recommendation accuracy significantly. We identify a unique challenge that arises when applying GAN to CF for rating augmentation: naive RAGAN tends to generate values biased towards high ratings. Then, we propose a refined version of RAGAN, named RAGANBT, which addresses this challenge successfully. Via our extensive experiments, we validate that our RAGANBT is really effective to solve the data sparsity problem, thereby providing existing CF models with great improvement in accuracy under various situations such as basic top-N recommendation, long-tail item recommendation, and recommendation to cold-start users.
