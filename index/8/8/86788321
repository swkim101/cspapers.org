ICCAD continues to be the premier conference on technical innovation on design automation with a focus on in-depth technical presentations. A key to the quality of the selected research work is a thorough double-blind review process that imposes a strict conflict-of-interest policy. As in the year before, the final selection was carried out in form of a 1-day physical TPC meeting that was held this year in June in Austin. A total of 354 papers went into the review process out of which 92 were finally accepted. This represents an acceptance ratio of 26% and an increase in submissions by around 5% compared to last year. Especially the front-end/system-level design as well as the nano/bio/new directions paper submissions represent a source of steady growth.
