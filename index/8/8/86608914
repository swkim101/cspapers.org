The present volume contains the proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on TEchnical and LEgal aspects of data pRIvacy and SEcurity (TELERISE 2015), held in conjunction with the 37th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2015) in Florence, Italy, on May 18, 2015. 
 
The workshop provides a forum for researchers and engineers, in academia and industry, to foster an exchange of research results, experiences, and products in the area of privacy-preserving and secure data management, both from a technical and legal perspective. The ultimate goal is to conceive new trends and ideas on designing, implementing, and evaluating solutions for privacy-preserving information sharing, with an eye to the cross-relations between ICT and regulatory aspects of data management. 
 
Information sharing is essential for today's business and societal transactions. Nevertheless, such a sharing should not violate the security and privacy requirements either dictated by Law to protect data subjects or by internal regulations provided both at organisation and individual level. An effectual, rapid, and unfailing electronic data sharing among different parties, while protecting legitimate rights on these data, is a key issue with several shades. One of the main goals of the TELERISE workshop is to carry forward innovative solutions, such as the design and implementation of new software architectures, software components, and software interfaces, able to fill the gap between technical and legal aspects of data privacy and data security management.
