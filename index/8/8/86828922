Triangle counts of massive graphs can provide important information regarding the structure of the networks these graphs model. Exact triangle counting can be expensive and thus researchers have proposed a number of approximation approaches. The state-of-the-art triangle count approximation techniques depend on wedge (two-path) sampling. In this paper we offer a mechanism to significantly improve wedge sampling for triangle counting. We shrink the sampling space by eliminating wedges that are less likely to participate in triangles. Experiments over large-scale real-world graphs show that proposed mechanism provides five- to a few hundred-folds sampling space reduction. When compared against the state-of-the-art approaches, it requires as low as ~ 100 × less sampling to provide the same accuracy, or makes as low as ~ 8 × less error when used with the same sampling ratio.
