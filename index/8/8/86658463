Welcome to the Fifth International Workshop on the Twin Peaks of Requirements and Architecture (TwinPeaks), held on May 17 in Florence, Italy, and co-located with the 37th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2015). 
 
The goal of TwinPeaks 2015 is to offer a venue for researchers, practitioners and educators from the areas of requirements engineering, software architecture and general software engineering to discuss their experiences, forge new collaborations, and explore innovative solutions that address the challenges of the Twin Peaks model (B. Nuseibeh, Weaving together requirements and architectures, IEEE Computer, vol. 34, no. 3, pp. 115--117, 2001). The workshop is expected to result in an improved understanding of key issues and challenges at the intersection of requirements engineering and software architecture, an understanding of the state of the art in research and practice, and directions towards addressing open issues identified in previous editions of TwinPeaks. 
 
The theme for this edition of the workshop is "TwinPeaks goes Agile". We explore lightweight techniques for integrating requirements and architectural thinking into the agile process, including understanding when to engage in upfront requirements analysis and architectural design, and techniques for incremental delivery.
