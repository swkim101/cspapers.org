The 29th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, held December 9--13, 2013, returns to picturesque New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, after an absence of a dozen years. Like this beautiful city, ACSAC has witnessed many changes to its landscape in the interim. Some are evolutionary; others are gamechanging. Topics that commanded attention during our last visit, like intrusion detection, public key cryptography and firewalls, have yielded to pressing concerns in mobile security, cloud security, and malware. The breadth of topics continues to expand.
