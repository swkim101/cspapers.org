It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the First International Workshop on Software Architectures and Mobility (SAM 2008). The theme of this year ICSE is Driving World Business, acknowledging the crucial role the engineering of software plays in a variety of sectors, from business to health care, from telecommunications to embedded systems. Mobility stands out as an orthogonal dimension to most of these application domains: consider, for example, the outburst of m-commerce applications, or the use of pervasive computing technologies to deliver healthcare services in the future. The goal of this workshop is to strengthen the cross-fertilization of advances from requirements and domain engineering, software architectures, and middleware to systematically develop and evolve architectures supporting mobility. SAM gives software engineering researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to facilitate information exchange, share ideas, and promote collaboration. 
 
The call for papers attracted both full and short papers from researchers in Asia, Canada, Europe and the United States. The program committee conducted a rigorous reviewing process, at the end of which 6 full papers and 6 short papers were accepted for presentation and discussion at the workshop. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech by Nenad Medvidovic, from the University of Southern California. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers in the field of software architectures and mobility from institutions around the world.
