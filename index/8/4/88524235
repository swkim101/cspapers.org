This paper studies image-based geo-localization (IBL) problem using ground-to-aerial cross-view matching. The goal is to predict the spatial location of a ground-level query image by matching it to a large geotagged aerial image database (e.g., satellite imagery). This is a challenging task due to the drastic differences in their viewpoints and visual appearances. Existing deep learning methods for this problem have been focused on maximizing feature similarity between spatially close-by image pairs, while minimizing other images pairs which are far apart. They do so by deep feature embedding based on visual appearance in those ground-and-aerial images. However, in everyday life, humans commonly use orientation information as an important cue for the task of spatial localization. Inspired by this insight, this paper proposes a novel method which endows deep neural networks with the `commonsense' of orientation. Given a ground-level spherical panoramic image as query input (and a large georeferenced satellite image database), we design a Siamese network which explicitly encodes the orientation (i.e., spherical directions) of each pixel of the images. Our method significantly boosts the discriminative power of the learned deep features, leading to a much higher recall and precision outperforming all previous methods. Our network is also more compact using only 1/5th number of parameters than a previously best-performing network. To evaluate the generalization of our method, we also created a large-scale cross-view localization benchmark containing 100K geotagged ground-aerial pairs covering a city.
