It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2014 ACM MobiSys PhD Forum workshop. This year's workshop continues its tradition of providing a friendly and supportive environment for doctoral students to present and discuss their dissertation research both with their peers and with a panel of experienced researchers from academia and industry. In addition to providing feedback and advice, this forum provides an excellent opportunity for students to network as well as to practice presenting their research clearly and concisely. 
 
Following the workshop traditions, the forum is best suited to students who are far enough into their PhD to have a concrete dissertation proposal outlining the key challenges they plan to solve as well as the strategies and methodologies that are applicable. We require that the students do not plan to finish their dissertation within 6 months of the forum, as that would leave little time to include advice and suggestions into their work. 
 
This year, however, we will be introducing a new session in the workshop, specifically designed for early PhD students with no concrete dissertation proposal. These students will be encouraged to present their current efforts towards a future dissertation topic and will receive feedback from the panel and the audience in the hope that the feedback will help them in the pursuit of their PhD topic.
