Different methodologies have been used over the years to conduct research and develop products. Albeit all the methods specify a particular and mostly lineal set of steps, in real practice they might not be followed to the letter and some shortcuts can be taken. This paper presents the definition of a nonlinear and iterative framework to conduct research. It is also an user-focused and science-based approach whose main goals are observation, definition of ideas based on user needs, sharp validation or disproval of the ideas aiming to deliver and launch a quality product.
