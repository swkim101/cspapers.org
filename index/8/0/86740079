Welcome to the 2013 International Workshop on Software Engineering for Computational Science & Engineering. We are excited about the program for this year. The submissions represented a good mix of papers from the software engineering perspective and papers from the computational science & engineering perspective. This year we accepted two types of papers: full papers (10 pages) and position papers (4 pages). We received a total of 20 submissions (15 full papers and 5 position papers). After a thorough review process, the program committee and organizing committee selected 10 full papers and 4 position papers for inclusion in this year's program.
