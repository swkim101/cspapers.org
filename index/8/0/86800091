The 2005 International Workshop on Web Information and Data Management (WIDM 2005) is the seventh in a series of workshops on Web Information and Data Management held in conjunction with the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). The objective of the workshop is to bring together researchers, industrial practitioners, and developers to study how Web information can be extracted, stored, analyzed, and processed to provide useful knowledge to the end users for various advanced database applications. WIDM 2005 has received the sponsorship from ACM SIGIR and the cooperation of ACM SIGMOD.The call for papers resulted in the submission of 44 papers from 15 countries around the world. Starting from this year, a one-day workshop schedule lets accommodate regular papers (up to 8 pages long) along with a few short papers (up to 6 pages long). All papers were thoroughly reviewed by the program committee and external reviewers. The program committee accepted 12 papers (8 full and 4 short papers) for this year novel one-day program, resulting in competitive 27% acceptance rate. The authors of these papers are from 7 countries. The 12 accepted papers were divided into 3 sessions: "Web Ranking and Retrieval," "XML Data Management and Web Discovery," and "Web Clustering, Filtering and Applications". In addition, the WIDM 2005 program also includes an invited talk on "A Web of Data: New Architectures for New Technology?" by Prof. Donald Kossmann, from ETH Zurich (Switzerland).The workshop would not be possible without the support from the NIKE (Nittany Information, Knowledge and wEb) Research Group of The Pennsylvania State University. The group provided both the manpower and computing resources to host the workshop Web site and to run the ConfMan paper submission and review system.
