In recent years, the massive increase in the use of mobile applications has greatly influenced the way people go about their daily lives. The number of available mobile applications has grown enormously due to the establishment of app stores and marketplaces that enable users to download and seamlessly install apps. Mobile platforms are rapidly changing and include diverse capabilities, such as GPS, cameras, wireless communications (e.g., WLAN, 4G, and RFID), a variety of on-device memory and disk capacities, and various sensors. 
 
Innovative mobile services and exciting mobile applications are emerging as a result of the ingenious use of these technologies. Consequently, the development of mobile applications has also been growing at a fast pace, presenting new challenges to Software Engineering. Developing versatile and robust mobile applications requires formally grounded methods, as well as advanced practices and tools.
