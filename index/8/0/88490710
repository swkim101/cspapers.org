In order to accurately populate and curate Knowledge Graphs (KGs), it is important to distinguish ?s?p?o? facts that can be traced back to sources from facts that cannot be verified. Manually validating each fact is time-consuming. Prior work on automating this task relied on numerical confidence scores which might not be easily interpreted. To overcome this limitation, we present Tracy, a novel tool that generates human-comprehensible explanations for candidate facts. Our tool relies on background knowledge in the form of rules to rewrite the fact in question into other easier-to-spot facts. These rewritings are then used to reason over the candidate fact creating semantic traces that can aid KG curators. The goal of our demonstration is to illustrate the main features of our system and to show how the semantic traces can be computed over both text and knowledge graphs with a simple and intuitive user interface.
