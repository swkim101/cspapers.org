The program that we have put together touches on three main topics: semantic web technologies, modelling, and machine learning. This diversity is not surprising considering the interdisciplinary and embryonic nature of this field. There is still a great deal for us to research, and a multitude of paths for us to explore. 
 
The RAISE workshop not only provides a forum for researchers interested in the synergies between AI and software engineering, but also provides us with a platform to raise awareness of our work within the wider computer science community as an exciting research area in its own right. We hope that RAISE will encourage other researchers to participate in this ongoing discussion, including those who may have been unclear about the challenges available in this area. With the creation of the RAISE workshop, we can begin to grow this community.
