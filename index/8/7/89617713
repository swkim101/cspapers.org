—The complex, distributed nature of data centers have spawned the adoption of distributed, multi-tiered software architectures, consisting of many inter-connected microservices. These microservices exhibit extremely short request service times, often less than 250 µ s. We show that these “killer microsecond” service times can cause state-of-the-art dynamic power management techniques to break down, due to short idle period length and low power state transition overheads. In this paper, we propose µ DPM , a dynamic power management scheme for the microsecond era that coordinates request delaying, per-core sleep states, and voltage frequency scaling. The idea is to postpone the wake up of a CPU as long as possible and then adjust the frequency so that the tail latency constraint of requests are satisﬁed just-in-time. µ DPM reduces processor energy consumption by up to 32% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 2x.
