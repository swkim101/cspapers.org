The annual Linked Learning workshop series has been established 3 years ago and gathered a significant and constantly growing community since its first edition, proving the high relevance and timeliness of the workshop scope: use of Linked Data in educational scenarios. Building on the previous editions (Linked Learning 2011, Linked Learning 2012) and its growing community, this workshop will provide a forum to discuss approaches making use of Web Data resources and technologies, especially linked data, for teaching, learning and education.
