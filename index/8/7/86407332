It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 13th Workshop on Early Aspects -- EA'08. This year's workshop continues its tradition of being the premier forum for identification, modularization, representation and composition of crosscutting concerns during the requirements engineering and architecture derivation activities. This edition of the workshop especially focuses on relating Early Aspects (EA) and Software Product Lines (SPL): it has a mission of stimulating the integration of the work on early development activities for product lines with the work for Early Aspects. 
 
The main topics covered by the accepted papers are Early Aspects for Product Lines Applications and New Research and Challenges of Early Aspects. The workshop is intended to be an interactive event, with a large part of the workshop time reserved for group discussions and overall conclusions on the issues raised during the presentations, as well as elicited by the paper reviewers and problems currently being tackled within the larger EA and SPL communities. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech by Daniel M. Berry titled In Requirements Engineering, Everything is an Aspect whereby the speaker invites the proponents and opponents of early aspects to ponder over the nature of aspects in requirements. Finally, the workshop will be concluded with a panel on What Early Aspects can do for Software Product Lines? We hope that the workshop will provide an opportunity for the participants to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners and stimulate further research in the EA and SPL areas, while these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for both the EA and SPL researchers and developers.
