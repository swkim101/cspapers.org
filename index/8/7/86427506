The theme of this workshop is thus: "conducting empirical studies in industry". Among the goals are: 
 
•to deliberate on challenges and experiences in conducting empirical studies in industrial settings; 
 
•to discuss strategies for overcoming impediments; 
 
•to debate on the limitations of contemporary research methods; and 
 
•to project towards their resolutions. 
 
Ideas and arguments, both pros and cons, will be sought from both industry and academic participants at CESI so as to have an improved understanding of the subject matter. Participants will post their thoughts and ideas asynchronously on "The Wall of Ideas" --- a structured wall to capture participant contributions --- which will then be analysed collectively in an interactive manner. Such contributions and analysis will be summarised in a postworkshop report.
