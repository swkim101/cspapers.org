We would like to take this opportunity to welcome you all to the very first Games and Software Engineering workshop (GAS 2011). We had a total of twenty submissions, of which fourteen were accepted. Having such a wonderful number of submissions indicates just what a vibrant and varied community there is, and we are very glad that you have all chosen to participate. 
 
The program that has been put together by the program committee and ourselves touches on four main topics: observations on games and software engineering, games and software engineering education, techniques for software engineering of games and games and the physical world. This diversity is surely one of the strengths of this field. There is still much for us to discover and contribute, and intriguing research avenues for all who are interested. 
 
The GAS workshop not only provides a forum for researchers interested in the intersection of games and software engineering, but also a platform for our work to be recognized by the wider software engineering community as an exciting research area in its own right. We hope that GAS will encourage other researchers to participate in this discussion. Perhaps there were those that were unsure how their work could be published, or those that were unclear about the challenges available in this area. With the creation of the GAS workshop, we can begin to find and grow this community. Your attendance here today shapes the future conversations we will have, and we look forward to seeing you all, alongside any and all newcomers, in the workshops to come.
