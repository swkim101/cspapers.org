We present a novel learning framework for vehicle recognition from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods which only use attention mechanisms to locate 2D discriminative information, our work learns a novel 3D perspective feature representation of a vehicle, which is then fused with 2D appearance feature to predict the category. The framework is composed of a global network (GN), a 3D perspective network (3DPN), and a fusion network. The GN is used to locate the region of interest (RoI) and generate the 2D global feature. With the assistance of the RoI, the 3DPN estimates the 3D bounding box under the guidance of the proposed vanishing point loss, which provides a perspective geometry constraint. Then the proposed 3D representation is generated by eliminating the viewpoint variance of the 3D bounding box using perspective transformation. Finally, the 3D and 2D feature are fused to predict the category of the vehicle. We present qualitative and quantitative results on the vehicle classification and verification tasks in the BoxCars dataset. The results demonstrate that, by learning such a concise 3D representation, we can achieve superior performance to methods that only use 2D information while retain 3D meaningful information without the challenge of requiring a 3D CAD model.
