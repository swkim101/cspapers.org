The premise of CTGDSD is that software engineering project courses where student teams are geographically distributed can effectively simulate the problems of globally distributed software development (DSD). However, while we see an increasing number of distributed project courses, this pedagogical model has proven difficult to adopt or sustain. It requires significant pedagogical resources and collaboration infrastructure. Institutionalizing such courses also requires compatible and reliable teaching partners. 
 
The CTGDSD workshop brings together faculty, industrial participants, and students to foster a community committed to developing, supporting, and teaching DSD. Foundational materials presented will include pedagogical materials and infrastructure developed and used in teaching distributed software development. 
 
Workshop participants, instructors and students, will share their experiences, results, and lessons learned. Participants will also work together to identify and implement approaches to lowering adoption barriers including developing open source, common pedagogical materials, projects, and collaboration infrastructures. This will further the work of the first CTGDSD workshop. This year's workshop will also focus on opportunities for collaborative research in DSD. We expect to emerge from the workshop with a pool of potential teaching partners from around the globe and a framework for building a shared repository of useful materials.
