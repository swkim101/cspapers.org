Although deep learning models trained on electronic health records (EHR) data have shown state-of-the-art performance in many predictive clinical tasks, the discovery of adversarial examples (i.e., input data that are engineered to cause misclassification) has exposed vulnerabilities with lab and imaging data. We specifically consider adversarial examples with longitudinal EHR data, an area that has not been previously examined because of the challenges with temporal high-dimensional and sparse features. We propose Longitudinal AdVersarial Attack (, a saliency score based adversarial example using a method that requires a minimal number of perturbations and that automatically minimizes the likelihood of detection. Features are selected and modified by jointly modeling a saliency map and attention mechanism. Experimental results with longitudinal EHR data show that an substantially reduce model performance for attention-based target models (from AUPR = 0.5 to AUPR = 0.08).
