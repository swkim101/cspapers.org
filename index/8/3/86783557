It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 1st ACM Workshop on AISec -- AISec '08. The mission of this new workshop is to stimulate increased collaboration between the Security and AI communities. It is our strong belief that such collaboration is the best route towards fully realizing the security and privacy benefits of today's ubiquitous information. 
 
The call for papers attracted 20 submissions from Asia, Canada, Europe and the United States. The program committee accepted 7 research papers and 2 position papers covering a variety of topics, including usable access control and authentication, malware and network attack defense and reputation systems. In addition, the program includes two exciting invited talks. The first is by Dr. Chris Clifton of Purdue University; a prominent leader in both the privacy and data mining communities. The second is by Dr. Carl Landwehr, IARPA and University of Maryland. Dr. Landwehr is very well-known for his information assurance research and currently is the Program leader for the National Intelligence Community Information Assurance Research at IARPA, a program with many challenging problems intersecting both Security and AI. 
 
We give our heartfelt thanks to the program committee and external reviewers. It is quite challenging crafting a program for a cross-disciplinary conference. The program committee made significant strides in defining this largely new field of research and in soliciting relevant and novel research contributions, and all the reviewers worked very hard to give useful and insightful feedback to the authors.
