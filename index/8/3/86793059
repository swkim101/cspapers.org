The constant evolution of technologies involved in the production, distribution, and consumption of broadcast material has impacted our perception of our societies and the way we interact with each other. Future changes in this landscape will be carried forward by advances in high speed mobile connectivity, and the sensing and awareness properties of virtual and augmented reality devices. In this paper we present a vision for a use-case of these emerging technologies in the context of a scenario, and discuss the social and technological challenges they present.
