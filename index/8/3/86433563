With the increasing popularity of micro-video sharing where people shoot short-videos effortlessly and share their daily stories on social media platforms, the micro-video recommendation has attracted extensive research efforts to provide users with micro-videos that interest them. In this paper, a hypothesis we explore is that, not only do users have multi-modal interest, but micro-videos have multi-modal targeted audience segments. As a result, we propose a novel framework User-Video Co-Attention Network (UVCAN), which can learn multi-modal information from both user and microvideo side using attention mechanism. In addition, UVCAN reasons about the attention in a stacked attention network fashion for both user and micro-video. Extensive experiments on two datasets collected from Toffee present superior results of our proposed UVCAN over the state-of-the-art recommendation methods, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
