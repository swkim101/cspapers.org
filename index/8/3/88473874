The goal of this symposium is to provide a right platform for the new as well as senior PhD students working in areas related to World Wide Web across the world to present their ideas and receive feedback on their work by other PhD students and experienced researchers. We are also hoping that during this workshop all the participants will be able to establish professional networks with other PhD students and more senior researchers attending the WWW 2011 conference. For this symposium, the programme committee received a total of 30 submissions and after a thorough reviewing phase, 17 papers were accepted for presentation at the workshop. This symposium is a one-day event within the WWW 2011 conference consisting of presentations followed by questions and comments. We have received an excellent support from the programme committee members and we would like to thank all of them for contributing their invaluable time and expertise to rate submissions and offer constructive feedback to authors. We believe that the review comments received by the experts will be of immense help to all PhD students who have submitted their work irrespective the acceptance decisions. We would also like to thank the Conference chairs and associate conference chairs, Program Co-Chairs, and Proceedings Co-Chairs for their support throughout the long symposium organization process.
