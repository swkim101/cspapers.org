Software becomes ever more feature-rich and thereby harder to distinguish based on its functionality. Quality now differentiates between similar software products. Specifying, constructing, and assuring quality has been under research for several decades and continues to be a long-term research area, because of its many facets and its complexity. Current national and international initiatives show that there is an active research community in academia and industry. 
 
We are happy to welcome you the 8th International Workshop on Software Quality (WoSQ'11). The series of workshops on software quality are a forum to discuss and advance the state-of-the-art research and practice in software quality. This year's edition of the workshop is co-located with the joint meeting of the European Software Engineering Conference and the ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering and brings some changes in the workshop format. We still have a keynote and paper presentations, but there is also a discussion session to bring up new topics and for the attendees to share their experiences. 
 
The call for papers attracted 11 submissions from Canada, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Out of these submissions, the program committee accepted 7 papers that cover a variety of topics, including data quality, quality models, in-process metrics and security analysis. In addition, the program includes a keynote talk by Motoei Azuma, emeritus professor at Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan.
