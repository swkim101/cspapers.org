With the rapid expansion of customer population and link bandwidth, energy expenditures of the Internet have been rising dramatically. To gain energy efficiency, we propose a novel router architecture, which allows each of its modules to adjust frequency according to traffic loads. Several modulation strategies are also discussed to ensure dwell time on low energy states and reduce blind switches. Our preliminary results show that the frequency adjustment router could save up to 40% of the total energy consumption.
