This paper introduces a novel task-space decomposed motion planning framework for multi-robot simultaneous locomotion and manipulation. When several manipulators hold an object, closed-chain kinematic constraints are formed, and it will make the motion planning problems challenging by inducing lower-dimensional singularities. Unfortunately, the constrained manifold will be even more complicated when the manipulators are equipped with mobile bases. We address the problem by introducing a dual-resolution motion planning framework which utilizes a convex task region decomposition method, with each resolution tuned to efficient computation for their respective roles. Concretely, this dual-resolution approach enables a global planner to explore the low-dimensional decomposed task-space regions toward the goal, then a local planner computes a path in high-dimensional constrained configuration space. We demonstrate the proposed method in several simulations, where the robot team transports the object toward the goal in the obstacle-rich environments.
