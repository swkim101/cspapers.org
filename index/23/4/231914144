Recognizing high potential scholars has become an important problem in recent years. However, conventional scholar evaluating methods based on hand-crafted metrics can not profile the scholars in a dynamic and comprehensive way. With the development of online academic databases, large-scale academic activity data become available, which implies detailed information on the scholars' achievement and academic activities. Inspired by the recent success of deep graph neural networks (GNNs), we propose a novel solution to recognize high potential scholars on the dynamic heterogeneous academic network. Specifically, we propose a novel Mate-path Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Convolution Network (MHHGCN) to effectively model the heterogeneous graph information. MHHGCN hierarchically aggregates entity and relational information on a set of meta-paths, and can alleviate the information loss problem in the previous heterogenous GNN models. Then to capture the dynamic scholar feature, we combine MHHGCN with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with attention mechanism to model the temporal information and predict the potential scholar. Extensive experimental results on real-world high potential scholar data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, the model shows high interpretability by visualization of the attention layers.
