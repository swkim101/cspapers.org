Heterogeneous information networks (HINs), also called heterogeneous graphs, are composed of multiple types of nodes and edges, and contain comprehensive information and rich semantics. Graph neural networks (GNNs), as powerful tools for graph data, have shown superior performance on network analysis. Recently, many excellent models have been proposed to process hetero-graph data using GNNs and have achieved great success. These GNN-based heterogeneous models can be interpreted as smooth node attributes guided by graph structure, which requires all nodes to have attributes. However, this is not easy to satisfy, as some types of nodes often have no attributes in heterogeneous graphs. Previous studies take some handcrafted methods to solve this problem, which separate the attribute completion from the graph learning process and, in turn, result in poor performance. In this paper, we hold that missing attributes can be acquired by a learnable manner, and propose a general framework for Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network via Attribute Completion (HGNN-AC), including pre-learning of topological embedding and attribute completion with attention mechanism. HGNN-AC first uses existing HIN-Embedding methods to obtain node topological embedding. Then it uses the topological relationship between nodes as guidance to complete attributes for no-attribute nodes by weighted aggregation of the attributes from these attributed nodes. Our complement mechanism can be easily combined with an arbitrary GNN-based heterogeneous model making the whole system end-to-end. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graphs. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art baselines.
