Although legged robots are becoming more nonlinear with higher degrees of freedom (DOFs), the centralized nonlinear control methods required to achieve stable locomotion cannot scale with the dimensionality of these robots. This paper investigates time-varying decentralized feedback control architectures based on hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) that stabilize dynamic legged locomotion with high degrees of freedom. By conforming to the natural symmetries present in the robot's full-order model, three decentralization schemes are proposed for control synthesis, namely left-right, front-hind and diagonal. Our approach considers the strong nonlinear interactions between the subsystems and relies only on the intrinsic communication of the body's translation and rotational data that is readily available. Further, a quadratic programming (QP) based feedback linearization is employed to compute the control inputs for each subsystem. The effectiveness of the HZD-based decentralization scheme is demonstrated numerically for the stabilization of forward and inplace walking gaits on an 18 DOF robot.
