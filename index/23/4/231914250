This paper proposed a technique to introduce the membrane protein into the lab-on-chip analysis system having a planar lipid bilayer. The proposed technique utilized a dielectrophoretic(DEP) force generated by the asymmetric configuration of the solid electrodes on the aqueous buffer separator. By applying the alternating current to the separator and the counter electrode, we manipulated liposomes that could host the membrane proteins on the surface. The key point for the dielectrophoretic manipulation on this system was the effective configuration of the droplet separator having the taperedge on the contour of the micropore. This configuration made a strong interpenetrating DEP force at the lipid bilayer, and prompted the fusion of liposome into the lipid bilayer. The separator was fabricated by micromachining techniques. Using the separator, we formed the lipid bilayer without evading the solid electrode on the surface. Finally, we elucidated the introduction of the liposome by monitoring with the optical microscopy.
