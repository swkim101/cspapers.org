The Open Source software package pathpy, available at https://www.pathpy.net, implements statistical techniques to learn optimal graphical models for the causal topology generated by paths in time-series data. Operationalizing Occamâ€™s razor, these models balance model complexity with explanatory power for empirically observed paths in relational time series. Standard network analysis is justified if the inferred optimal model is a first-order network model. Optimal models with orders larger than one indicate higher-order dependencies and can be used to improve the analysis of dynamical processes, node centralities and clusters.
