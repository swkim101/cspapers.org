Scientists always look for the most accurate and relevant answer to their queries on the scholarly literature. Traditional scholarly search systems list documents instead of providing direct answers to the search queries. As data in knowledge graphs are not acquainted semantically, they are not machine-readable. Therefore, a search on scholarly knowledge graphs ends up in a full-text search, not a search in the content of scholarly literature. In this demo, we present a faceted search system that retrieves data from a scholarly knowledge graph, which can be compared and filtered to better satisfy user information needs. Our practiceâ€™s novelty is that we use dynamic facets, which means facets are not fixed and will change according to the content of a comparison.
