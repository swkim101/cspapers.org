Point cloud registration is a common step in many 3D computer vision tasks such as object pose estimation, where a 3D model is aligned to an observation. Classical registration methods generalize well to novel domains but fail when given a noisy observation or a bad initialization. Learning-based methods, in contrast, are more robust but lack in generalization capacity. We propose to consider iterative point cloud registration as a reinforcement learning task and, to this end, present a novel registration agent (ReAgent). We employ imitation learning to initialize its discrete registration policy based on a steady expert policy. Integration with policy optimization, based on our proposed alignment reward, further improves the agentâ€™s registration performance. We compare our approach to classical and learning-based registration methods on both ModelNet40 (synthetic) and ScanObjectNN (real data) and show that our ReAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The lightweight architecture of the agent, moreover, enables reduced inference time as compared to related approaches. Code is available at github.com/dornik/reagent.
