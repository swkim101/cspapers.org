In this paper, we propose to enhance the pair-wise aspect and opinion terms extraction (PAOTE) task by incorporating rich syntactic knowledge. We first build a syntax fusion encoder for encoding syntactic features, including a label-aware graph convolutional network (LAGCN) for modeling the dependency edges and labels, as well as the POS tags unifiedly, and a local-attention module encoding POS tags for better term boundary detection. During pairing, we then adopt Biaffine and Triaffine scoring for high-order aspect-opinion term pairing, in the meantime re-harnessing the syntax-enriched representations in LAGCN for syntactic-aware scoring. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines, meanwhile yielding explainable predictions with syntactic knowledge.
