While impedance control is one of the most commonly used strategies for robot interaction control, variable impedance control is a more recent preoccupation. If designing impedance control with varying parameters allows increasing the system flexibility and dexterity, it is still a challenging issue, as it may result in a loss of passivity of the control system. This has an important impact on the stability and therefore on the safety of the interaction. In this paper, we propose methods to design passivity filters that guarantee passivity of the interaction. They aim at either checking whether a desired impedance profile is passive, or modifying it if required.
