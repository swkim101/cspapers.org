An increasing number of applications that leverage built-in sensors is hosted on new types of devices such as vehicles and drones. Example applications are augmented reality Head-Up-Display in a connected car [2], scout drone that chases a target suspect among the crowd [3], autonomous fleet drones [1], and so on. These futuristic applications in various genres of devices are latency-sensitive and require a significant computation power to process a tremendous amount of data from built-in sensors [8]. However, the capabilities of processors shipped with these devices are limited. A natural solution is offloading to an edge surrogate,1 running on a 'nearby' edge-cloud that offers more computation capacity at low latency.
