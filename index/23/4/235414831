Serverless computing has become a fact of life on modern clouds. A serverless function may process sensitive data from clients. Protecting such a function against untrusted clouds using hardware enclave is attractive for user privacy. In this work, we run existing serverless applications in SGX enclave, and observe that the performance degradation can be as high as 5.6× to even 422.6×. Our investigation identifies these slowdowns are related to architectural features, mainly from page-wise enclave initialization. Leveraging insights from our overhead analysis, we revisit SGX hardware design and make minimal modification to its enclave model. We extend SGX with a new primitive—region-wise plugin enclaves that can be mapped into existing enclaves to reuse attested common states amongst functions. By remapping plugin enclaves, an enclave allows in-situ processing to avoid expensive data movement in a function chain. Experiments show that our design reduces the enclave function latency by 94.74-99.57%, and boosts the autoscaling throughput by 19-179×.
