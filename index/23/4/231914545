Currently, laparoscopic surgery systems are adapted for a large number of indications and patients and are therefore not optimized for one specific case.The challenge to create systems with an optimized kinematic structure for a specific patient regarding reachability and manipulability in the needed workspace is the automated design and construction process.We have developed an automated design and construction process for a patient-specific Single Incision Laparoscopic System that is optimized for a specific indication, procedure, patient, and surgeon. The kinematic structure is adapted to the required workspace, needed instrumentation, and manufacturing parameters.First results show that the patient-specific Single Incision Laparoscopic System is better suited for the specific application regarding the combination of reachability, manipulability, and system size in the required workspace than the standard Single Incision Laparoscopic System in different standard sizes or one simple standard size.
