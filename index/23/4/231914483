The proliferation of mobile computing has prompted Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) to be one of the most attractive and promising indoor localization techniques for ubiquitous applications. The existing PDR approaches either suffer position drifts caused by accumulative errors or are sensitive to various users. This paper presents ARPDR, an accurate and robust PDR approach to improve the accuracy and robustness of indoor localization methods. Particularly, we propose a novel step counting algorithm based on motion models by deeply exploiting inertial sensor data. We then combine step counting with adaptive thresholding to personalize the PDR system for different users. Furthermore, we propose a novel stride-heading model with a deep neural network to predict stride lengths and walking orientations, thus the displacement errors are significantly reduced. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that ARPDR outperforms the state-of-the-art PDR methods.
