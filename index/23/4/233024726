Humans have a strong class-agnostic object segmentation ability and can outline boundaries of unknown objects precisely, which motivates us to propose a box-supervised class-agnostic object segmentation (BoxCaseg) based solution for weakly-supervised instance segmentation. The BoxCaseg model is jointly trained using box-supervised images and salient images in a multi-task learning manner. The fine-annotated salient images provide class-agnostic and precise object localization guidance for box-supervised images. The object masks predicted by a pretrained BoxCaseg model are refined via a novel merged and dropped strategy as proxy ground truth to train a Mask R-CNN for weakly-supervised instance segmentation. Only using 7991 salient images, the weakly-supervised Mask R-CNN is on par with fully-supervised Mask R-CNN on PASCAL VOC and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art box-supervised instance segmentation methods on COCO.
