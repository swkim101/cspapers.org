Formulation of carpooling schemes for mutual cost benefits between the driver and the passengers has a long history. However, the convenience of driving alone, especially under the current COVID-19 pandemic, the increase of car ownership and the difficulties in finding travelers with matching schedule and route keeps car occupancy low. The technology is a key enabler of online platforms which facilitate the ride matching process and lead the increase of carpooling services. The aim of this work-in-progress article is to clarify the value proposition of carpooling platforms in smart cities, especially under conditions like the pandemic. Thus, an extensive bibliometric analysis of three separate specialized literature collections using the bibliometrix R-Tool combined with a systematic literature review of selected papers is performed. It is identified that smart carpooling platforms could generate additional value for participants and smart cities with real-time ride matching, interconnection with public transportation and other city services, secure transactions, reputation-based services and closed organization carpooling schemes. To deliver this value to a smart city, a multi-sided platform business model is proposed, suitable for a carpooling service provider with multiple customer segments and partners.
