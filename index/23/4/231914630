To allow for the construction of large space structures to support future space endeavors, autonomous robotic solutions would serve to reduce cost and risk of human extravehicular activity (EVA). Practicality of autonomous assembly requires both theoretical and algorithmic advances, and hardware experimentation across a spectrum of technological readiness levels. Analysis of hardware experiments provides novel insights not readily apparent in simulations alone, which serves to inform future developments.This paper describes analysis and insights gained from an autonomous assembly experiment consisting of a dexterous manipulator, a gross positioning serial arm, and a 1 degree of freedom (DOF) turntable to facilitate the assembly and deployment of a solar array mockup. This experiment combined state estimation in an uncertain environment with contact-heavy operations such as grasping, self-reconfiguring, joining, and deploying. Insights gained are presented due to their applicability to other field-based manipulation tasks by a team of robots.
