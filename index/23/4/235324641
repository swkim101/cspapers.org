The rise of the counterfactual concept promoted the study of reasoning, and we applied it to Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) multi-hop reasoning as a way of data augmentation for the first time. Intuitively, we propose a model-agnostic Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing(CSS) training scheme. The CSS uses two augmentation methods Q-CSS and T-CSS to augment the training set. That is, for each training instance, we create two augmented instances, one per augmentation method. Furthermore, perform the Dynamic Answer Equipment(DAE) algorithm to dynamically assign ground-truth answers for the expanded question, constructing counterfactual examples. After training with the supplemented examples, the KBQA model can focus on all key entities and words, which significantly improved modelâ€™s sensitivity. Experimental verified the effectiveness of CSS and achieved consistent improvements across settings with different extents of KB incompleteness.
