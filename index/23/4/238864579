Interactive (mechanical) impedance and finger fatigues are important topics, which have not been well investigated. To tackle this problem, we developed a soft lightweight (0.25 kg) finger exoskeleton (TIE-EXO) for quantifying interactive impedance and finger fatigue. A resist-as-needed (RAN) controller was used to produce variable resistance in fingers’ exercises. The TIE-EXO’s feedback and RAN’s parameters were applied to quantify the relationship between interactive impedance and finger fatigue. This quantification was validated in the index and middle fingers of three subjects. This validation shows that the RAN control enables the TIE-EXO to produce online resistance adaptations to different subjects and finger fatigue. Moreover, it indicates a variation and invariance in finger impedance control. We argue that the proposed method provides a novel way for investigating interactive impedance and finger fatigue.
