This paper aims to give a systemic vision about the data-driven mobile applications in urban data management processes, which is essential to ensure a sustainable smart city ecosystem for what is needed to ensure diversification between stakeholders and data sources. The realization of sustainable data-driven smart solutions based on an urban data platform that will enable citizen wellbeing in the smart city is needed to develop data-driven applications. In this paper, we present five case study mobile applications developed using AppSheet and Google Apps Script technologies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and provide support to (potentially) infected citizens. Several aspects relevant to coronavirus pandemic are considered: quick COVID-19 patient assessment based on user-provided symptoms integrated with contact tracing; volunteer help during quarantine; UAV-based COVID-19 outdoor safety surveillance; test scheduling and AR-based pharmacy shop assistant.
