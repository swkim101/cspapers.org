We revisit human motion synthesis, a task useful in various real-world applications, in this paper. Whereas a number of methods have been developed previously for this task, they are often limited in two aspects: 1) focus on the poses while leaving the location movement behind, and 2) ignore the impact of the environment on the human motion. In this paper, we propose a new framework, with the interaction between the scene and the human motion taken into account. Considering the uncertainty of human motion, we formulate this task as a generative task, whose objective is to generate plausible human motion conditioned on both the scene and the humanâ€™s initial position. This framework factorizes the distribution of human motions into a distribution of movement trajectories conditioned on scenes and that of body pose dynamics conditioned on both scenes and trajectories. We further derive a GAN-based learning approach, with discriminators to enforce the compatibility between the human motion and the contextual scene as well as the 3D-to-2D projection constraints. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed method on two challenging datasets, which cover both synthetic and real-world environments.
