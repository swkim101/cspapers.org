This paper introduces an obstacle-crossing strategy, and the self-reconfiguration algorithm for a new class of modular robots called the rolling sphere, which can fit obstacles represented by cubes of different sizes due to the chain connection of multiple spheres. For the self-reconfiguration of the rolling spheres, a large gradient is obtained by classifying its action types and hierarchically minimizing the distance between the initial configuration and the final configuration. The most direct use of this large gradient is the fast crossing of various obstacles, by jointing multiple self-reconfigurations according to the OctoMap of the obstacles. It is verified in simulation that the self-reconfiguration takes full advantage of the parallel movement of multiple modules to reduce the total time steps, and the obstacle-crossing strategy can adapt to a variety of obstacles.
