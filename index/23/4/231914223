Many indoor spaces have constantly changing layouts and may not be mapped by an autonomous vehicle, yet maps such as floor plans or evacuation maps of these places are common. We propose a method for an autonomous robot to localize itself on such maps with inconsistent scale using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with scan matching using a 2D LiDAR. We also introduce a new scale state in 2D localization to manage the possible inconsistent scale of the input map. Experiments are conducted in an indoor corridor using three different input maps - a point cloud, a floor plan, and a hand-drawn map. The SGD localization algorithm is bench-marked to Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL). In a point cloud mapped environment, our algorithm achieves 0.264m and 5.26Â° average position and heading error respectively. On the hand-drawn map, our SGD localization algorithm remains robust while AMCL fails. The role of the scale state in our SGD localization algorithm is demonstrated in poorly scaled maps.
