In this paper, we updated an inspection robot with passive adaptation ability, which is used to detect small size water supply pipeline. By geometric calculation and kinematic verification, static model of the robot is checked for flexible movement in the pipeline. Besides, inertial measurement unit is leveraged to simultaneously detect the attitude of robot, and different algorithm is tested to compensate the camera image rotation, stabilizing the image output.
