Physical softness has been proposed to absorb impacts when establishing contact with a robot or its workpiece, to relax control requirements and improve performance in assembly and insertion tasks. Previous work has focused on special end effector solutions for isolated tasks, such as the peg-in-hole task. However, as many robot tasks require the precision of rigid robots, and their performance would degrade when simply adding compliance, it has been difficult to take advantage of physical softness in real applications. A wrist that could switch between soft and rigid modes could solve this problem, but actuators with sufficient strength for this state transition would increase the size and weight of the module and decrease the payload of the robot. To solve this problem, we propose a novel design of a soft module consisting of a cable-driven mechanism, which allows the robot end effector to change between soft and rigid mode while being very compact and light. The module effectively combines the advantages of soft and rigid robots, and can be retrofitted to existing robots and grippers while preserving the characteristics of the robotic system. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed design through experiments modeling assembly tasks, and investigate design parameters quantitatively.
