We present an algorithm for the realtime matching of wireframe extractions in pairs of images. Here we treat extracted wireframes as graphs and propose a simplified Graduated Assignment algorithm to use with this problem. Using this algorithm we achieve a 30% accuracy improvement over the baseline method. We show that, for this problem, the simplified Graduated Assignment algorithm can achieve realtime performance without a significant drop in accuracy as compared to the standard Graduated Assignment algorithm. We further demonstrate a method of utilizing this simplified Graduated Assignment algorithm for achieving a similar real-time improvement in the matching quality of standard features without wireframe detection.
