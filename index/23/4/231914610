In this paper we apply the low-rank Tensor Train decomposition for compression and operations on 3D objects and scenes represented by volumetric distance functions. Our study shows that not only it allows for a very efficient compression of the high-resolution TSDF maps (up to three orders of magnitude of the original memory footprint at resolution of 5123), but also allows to perform TSDF-Fusion directly in the low-rank form. This can potentially enable much more efficient 3D mapping on low-power mobile and consumer robot platforms.
