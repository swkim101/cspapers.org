Measurement and inference in data centers present a set of opportunities and challenges distinct from the Internet domain. Existing toolsets may be perturbed or be mislead by issues related to virtualization. Yet, while equally confronted by scale, data centers are relatively homogenous and symmetric. We believe these may be attributes to be exploited. However, data is required to better evaluate our hypotheses. Therefore, we introduce our efforts to gather data using a single framework from which we can launch tests of our choosing. Our observations reinforce recent claims, but indicate changes in the network. They also reveal additional obfuscations stemming from virtualization.
