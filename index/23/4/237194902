The open-access dissemination of pretrained language models through online repositories has led to a democratization of state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) research.This also allows people outside of NLP to use such models and adapt them to specific use-cases.However, a certain amount of technical proficiency is still required which is an entry barrier for users who want to apply these models to a certain task but lack the necessary knowledge or resources.In this work, we aim to overcome this gap by providing a tool which allows researchers to leverage pretrained models without writing a single line of code.Built upon the parameter-efficient adapter modules for transfer learning, our AdapterHub Playground provides an intuitive interface, allowing the usage of adapters for prediction, training and analysis of textual data for a variety of NLP tasks.We present the toolâ€™s architecture and demonstrate its advantages with prototypical use-cases, where we show that predictive performance can easily be increased in a few-shot learning scenario.Finally, we evaluate its usability in a user study.We provide the code and a live interface at https://adapter-hub.github.io/playground.
