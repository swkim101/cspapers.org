Extracting valuable feedback information from user behavior logs is one of the major concerns in Web search studies. Among the tremendous efforts that aim to improve search performance with user behavior modeling, constructing click models is of vital importance because it provides a direct estimation of result relevance. Most existing click models assume that whether or not users click on results only depends on the examination probability and the content of the result. However, through a carefully designed user eye-tracking study, we found that users do not make click-through decisions in isolation. Instead, they also consider the context of a result (e.g., adjacent results). This finding leads to the design of a novel click model named Comparison-based Click Model (CBCM). Different from traditional examination hypotheses, CBCM introduces the concept of an examination viewport and assumes users click results after comparing adjacent results within the same viewport. The experimental results on a publicly available user behavior dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CBCM. We also public our code of CBCM and dataset.
