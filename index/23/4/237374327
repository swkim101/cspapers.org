We develop a RGB-D scene recognition model based on object-scene relation(RSBR). First learning a Semantic Network in the semantic domain that classifies the label of a scene on the basis of the labels of all object types. Then, we design an Appearance Network in the appearance domain that recognizes the scene according to local captions. We enforce the Semantic Network to guide the Appearance Network in the learning procedure. Based on the proposed RSBR model, we obtain the state-of-the-art results of RGB-D scene recognition on SUN RGB-D and NYUD2 datasets.
