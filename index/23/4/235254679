In this paper, we try to improve exploration in Blackbox methods, particularly Evolution strategies (ES), when applied to Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems where intermediate waypoints/subgoals are available. Since Evolutionary strategies are highly parallelizable, instead of extracting just a scalar cumulative reward, we use the state-action pairs from the trajectories obtained during rollouts/evaluations, to learn the dynamics of the agent. The learnt dynamics are then used in the optimization procedure to speed-up training. Lastly, we show how our proposed approach is universally applicable by presenting results from experiments conducted on Carla driving and UR5 robotic arm simulators.
