This paper is devoted to understanding relative navigation models that are used for space
vehicles. The relative navigations models and approaches which are based on different systems
(Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)&Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) , Laser&INS, Vision-
Based, etc.) are compared. These models and approaches can be used individually or combined
for solving relative navigation problems. Advantages and disadvantages of the models vary according
to the usage area, platform type, and environment. Different methods and approaches exist
in addition to different estimation and optimization algorithms for adaptation, control, and sensor
fusion. Most of the models assume perfect attitude conditions. This study considers satellites' position
estimates according to each other within formation on the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Also, the aim
of this article is to understand correlation between the relative navigation systems and the effectiveness
of the algorithms which are used for estimating states during constellation or formation flight.
