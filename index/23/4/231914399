As a novel therapy for peritoneal dissemination, it is desired to actualize an endoscopic photothermal therapy, which is minimally invasive and is highly therapeutically effective. However, since the endoscopic tumor temperature control has not been actualized, conventional therapies could damage healthy tissues by overhearing. In this paper, we develop a thermal endoscope system that controls the tumor temperature so that the heated tumor gets necrotic. In fact, our thermal endoscope contains a thermal image sensor, a visible light endoscope and a laser fiber. Concerning the thermal image sensor, the conventional thermal endoscope has the problem that the diameter is too large, because the conventional endoscope loads a large thermal image sensor with high-resolution. Therefore, this paper uses a small thermal image sensor with low resolution, because the diameter of the thermal endoscope needs to be smaller than 15mm in order to be inserted into the trocar. However, this thermal image sensor is contaminated by much noise. Thus, we develop a tumor temperature control system using a feedback control and tumor temperature estimation based on Gaussian function, so that the noisy, small thermal image sensor can be used. As experimental results of the proposed endoscopic photothermal therapy for the hepatophyma carcinoma model of rats, it turns out that the tumor temperature by which the heated tumor gets necrotic can be kept stable. It can be said that our endoscopic photothermal therapy achieves a certain degree of therapy effect.
