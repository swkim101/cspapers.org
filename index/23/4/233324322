The concept of bounded expansion provides a robust way to capture sparse graph classes with interesting algorithmic properties. Most notably, every problem definable in first-order logic can be solved in linear time on bounded expansion graph classes. First-order interpretations and transductions of sparse graph classes lead to more general, dense graph classes that seem to inherit many of the nice algorithmic properties of their sparse counterparts.In this work we introduce lacon- and shrub-decompositions and use them to characterize transductions of bounded expansion graph classes and other graph classes. If one can efficiently compute sparse shrub- or lacon-decompositions of transductions of bounded expansion classes then one can solve every problem definable in first-order logic in linear time on these classes.
