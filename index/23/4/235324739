In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate , which is to our knowledge the first consumer-class system that streams panoramic videos far beyond the ultra high-definition resolution (up to 16K) to mobile devices, offering truly immersive experiences. Such an immense resolution makes streaming video-on-demand (VoD) content extremely resource-demanding. To tackle this challenge, introduces a novel framework that leverages an edge server to perform efficient, intelligent, and quality-guaranteed content transcoding, by extracting from panoramic frames the viewport stream that will be delivered to the client. To support real-time transcoding of 16K content, employs several key mechanisms such as dual-GPU acceleration, lossless viewport extraction, deep viewport prediction, and a two-layer streaming design. Our extensive evaluations using real usersâ€™ viewport movement data indicate that outperforms existing solutions, and can smoothly stream 16K panoramic videos to mobile devices over diverse wireless networks including WiFi, LTE, and mmWave 5G.
