In this contribution, we describe the systems presented by the PolyU CBS Team at the second Shared Task on Learning Semantic Similarities for the Financial Domain (FinSim-2), where participating teams had to identify the right hypernyms for a list of target terms from the financial domain. For this task, we ran our classification experiments with several distributional, string-based, and Transformer features. Our results show that a simple logistic regression classifier, when trained on a combination of word embeddings, semantic and string similarity metrics and BERT-derived probabilities, achieves a strong performance (above 90%) in financial hypernymy detection.
