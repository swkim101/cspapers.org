Modular robotic systems with self-repair or self-replication capabilities have been presented as a robust, low cost solution to extraterrestrial or Arctic exploration. This paper explores using ice as the sole structure element to build robots. The ice allows for increased flexibility in the system design, enabling the robotic structure to be designed and built post deployment, after tasks and terrain obstacles have been better identified and analyzed. However, ice presents many difficulties in manufacturing. The authors explore a structure driven approach to examine compatible manufacturing processes with an emphasis on conserving process energies. The energy analysis shows the optimal manufacturing technique depends on the volume of the final part relative to the volume of material that must be removed. Based on experiments three general design principles are presented. A mobile robotic platform made from ice is presented as a proof of concept and first demonstration.
