Although widely used in machine learning, backpropagation cannot directly be applied to SNN training and is not feasible on a neuromorphic processor that emulates biological neuron and synapses. This work presents a spike-based backpropagation algorithm with biological plausible local update rules and adapts it to fit the constraint in a neuromorphic hardware. The algorithm is implemented on Intelâ€™s Loihi chip enabling low power in-hardware supervised online learning of multilayered SNNs for mobile applications. We test this implementation on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and MSTAR datasets with promising performance and energy-efficiency, and demonstrate a possibility of incremental online learning with the implementation.
