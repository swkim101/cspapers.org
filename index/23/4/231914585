Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully used to analyze non-Euclidean network data. Recently, there emerge a number of works to investigate the robustness of GNNs by adding adversarial noises into the graph topology, where gradient-based attacks are widely studied due to their inherent efficiency and high effectiveness. However, the gradient-based attacks often lead to sub-optimal results due to the discrete structure of graph data. To this end, we design a novel exploratory adversarial attack (termed as EpoAtk) to boost the gradient-based perturbations on graphs. The exploratory strategy in EpoAtk includes three phases, generation, evaluation and recombination, with the goal of sidesteping the possible misinformation that the maximal gradient provides. In experiments, EpoAtk is evaluated on benchmark datasets for the task of semi-supervised node classification in different attack settings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art attacks with the same attack budgets11Our reproducible code is available at https://github.com/EpoAtk/EpoAtk..
