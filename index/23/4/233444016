Graph structural information such as topologies or connectivities provides valuable guidance for graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn nodes' representations. Existing GCN models that capture nodes' structural information weight in- and out-neighbors equally or differentiate in- and out-neighbors globally without considering nodes' local topologies. We observe that in- and out-neighbors contribute differently for nodes with different local topologies. To explore the directional structural information for different nodes, we propose a GCN model with weighted structural features, named WGCN. WGCN first captures nodes' structural fingerprints via a direction and degree aware Random Walk with Restart algorithm, where the walk is guided by both edge direction and nodes' in- and out-degrees. Then, the interactions between nodes' structural fingerprints are used as the weighted node structural features. To further capture nodes' high-order dependencies and graph geometry, WGCN embeds graphs into a latent space to obtain nodes' latent neighbors and geometrical relationships. Based on nodes' geometrical relationships in the latent space, WGCN differentiates latent, in-, and out-neighbors with an attention-based geometrical aggregation. Experiments on transductive node classification tasks show that WGCN outperforms the baseline models consistently by up to 17.07% in terms of accuracy on five benchmark datasets.
