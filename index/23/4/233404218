While neural networks produce state-of-the-art performance in several NLP tasks, they generally depend heavily on lexicalized information, which transfer poorly between domains. We present a combination of two strategies to mitigate this dependence on lexicalized information in fact verification tasks. We present a data distillation technique for delexicalization, which we then combine with a model distillation method to prevent aggressive data distillation. We show that by using our solution, not only does the performance of an existing state-of-the-art model remain at par with that of the model trained on a fully lexicalized data, but it also performs better than it when tested out of domain. We show that the technique we present encourages models to extract transferable facts from a given fact verification dataset.
