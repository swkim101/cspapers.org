We present a novel learning and control framework that combines artificial neural networks with online trajectory optimization to learn dexterous manipulation skills from human demonstration and to transfer the learned behaviors to real robots. Humans can perform the demonstrations with their own hands and with real objects. An instrumented glove is used to record motions and tactile data. Our system learns neural control policies that generalize to modified object poses directly from limited amounts of demonstration data. Outputs from the neural policy network are combined at runtime with kinematic and dynamic safety and feasibility constraints as well as a learned regularizer to obtain commands for a real robot through online trajectory optimization. We test our approach on multiple tasks and robots.
