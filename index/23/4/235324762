In this demonstration we present the Access Risk Knowledge (ARK) Platform - a socio-technical risk governance system. Through the ARK Virus Project, the ARK Platform has been extended for risk management of personal protective equipment (PPE) in healthcare settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. ARK demonstrates the benefits of a Semantic Web approach for supporting both the integration and classification of qualitative and quantitative PPE risk data, across multiple healthcare organisations, in order to generate a unique unified evidence base of risk. This evidence base could be used to inform decision making processes regarding PPE use.
