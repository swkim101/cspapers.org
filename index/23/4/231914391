In this paper, the gain scheduling technique is applied to design a balance controller for an autonomous bicycle with an inertia wheel. Previously, two different balance controllers are needed depending on whether the bicycle is stationary or dynamic. The switch between the two different controllers may cause the instability of the autonomous bicycle. Our proposed gain scheduled controller can balance the autonomous bicycle in both stationary and dynamic cases. A physical system is built and experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the gain scheduled controller.
