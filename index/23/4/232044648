A huge number of scholarly articles published every day in different domains makes it hard for the experts to organize and stay updated with the new research in a particular domain. This study gives an overview of a new approach, HierClasSArt, for knowledge aware hierarchical classification of the scholarly articles for mathematics into a predefined taxonomy. The method uses combination of neural networks and Knowledge Graphs for better document representation along with the meta-data information. This position paper further discusses the open problems about incorporation of new articles and evolving hierarchies in the pipeline. Mathematics domain has been used as a use-case.
