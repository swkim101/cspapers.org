Although research indicates that telepresence robots offer a more socially telepresent alternative to conventional forms of remote communication, the lack of touch-based interactions presents challenges for both remote and local users. In order to address these challenges, we have designed and implemented a robotic manipulator emulating a human arm. However, contact interactions like handshakes with a robotic manipulator may feel awkward and unnatural to local users. In this work, we present the design of a wearable haptic measurement glove (HMG) and use it to collect force and inertial data on handshakes in human-human and humanrobot interactions in the interest of developing intelligent shared control algorithms for natural, human-like contact interactions in human-robot interactions.
