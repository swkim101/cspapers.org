Distracted driving is one of the main contributors to traffic accidents. This paper proposes a deep learning approach to detecting multiple distracted driving behaviors. In order to obtain more accurate detection results, a synchronized image recognition system based on two cameras is designed, by which the body movements and face of the driver are monitored respectively. The images captured from driverâ€™s body and face areas are fed to two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) simultaneously to ensure the performance of classification. The data collection and validation processes of the proposed distraction detection approach were conducted on a laboratory-based assisted driving testbed to provide near-realistic driving experiences. Our dataset includes distracted and safe driving images of the drivers. Furthermore, we developed a meaningful and practical application of a voice-alert system that alerts the distracted driver to focus on the driving task. We evaluated VGG-16, ResNet, and MobileNet-v2 networks for the proposed approach. Experimental results show that by using two cameras and VGG-16 networks, we can achieve a recognition accuracy of 96.7% with a computation speed of 8 fps.
