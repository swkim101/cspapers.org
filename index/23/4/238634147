A fundamental concept in control theory is that of controllability, where any system state can be reached through an appropriate choice of control inputs. Indeed, a large body of classical and modern approaches are designed for controllable linear dynamical systems. However, in practice, we often encounter systems in which a large set of state variables evolve exogenously and indepen-dently of the control inputs; such systems are only partially controllable . The focus of this work is on a large class of partially controllable linear dynamical systems, speciﬁed by an underlying sparsity pattern. Our main results establish structural conditions and ﬁnite-sample guarantees for learning to control such systems. In particu-lar, our structural results characterize those state variables which are irrelevant for optimal control, an analysis which departs from classical control techniques. Our algorithmic results adapt techniques from high-dimensional statistics— speciﬁcally soft-thresholding and semiparametric least-squares—to exploit the underlying sparsity pattern in order to obtain ﬁnite-sample guarantees that signiﬁcantly improve over those based on certainty-equivalence. We also corroborate these theoretical improvements over certainty-equivalent control through a simulation study.
