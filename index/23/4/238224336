In this demo, we present EIT-kit, an electrical impedance tomography toolkit for designing and fabricating health and motion sensing devices. EIT-kit contains (1) an extension to a 3D editor for personalizing the form factor of the electrode arrays and the electrode distribution, (2) a customized EIT sensing motherboard that users can use to perform measurements, (3) a microcontroller library that automates electrical impedance measurements, and (4) an image reconstruction library for mobile devices for interpolating and then visualizing the measured data. Together, these allow for applications that require 2- or 4-terminal setups, up to 64-electrodes, and single or multiple (up to four) electrode arrays simultaneously. We demonstrate each element of EIT-kit, as well as the design space that EIT-kit enables by showing various applications in health sensing as well as motion sensing and control.
