The visual analysis of temporal network data is often hindered by the cognitively demanding nature of dynamic graphic visualizations. Addressing this issue, the graph visualization tool HOTVis generates time-aware static network visualizations that highlight the causal topology of temporal networks, i.e. which nodes can directly and indirectly influence each other, and are thus considerably easier to interpret than state-of-the-art dynamic graph visualizations.
