This research explores the content of marketing communications on the Web in their dialogic and data aspects. Bringing together theories from the fields of digital marketing communications and the Semantic Web, the work investigates how web marketing content is used for building semantic relationships between data nodes (by using schema.org) and across semiotic interpretative routes (by adhering to dialogic principles for communication).
