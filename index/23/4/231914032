This paper proposes a multi-task control strategy for a quadruped robot named THU-QUAD II. The mechanical design of the robot ensures a wide range of motion for all joints, which allows it to stand and walk like a mammal as well as sprawl to the ground and crawl like a reptile. Five basic leg configurations are defined for the robot, including four mammal-type configurations with bidirectional knees and one sprawling-type configuration. A multi-task control framework is developed by combining configuration selection and gait planning. According to the locomotion environments, the robot can nimbly switch between different configurations, which gives it more flexibility when facing different tasks. For the mammal-type configuration, a parametric climbing gait is designed to traverse structural terrain. For the sprawling-type configuration, a crawling gait is designed to achieve robust locomotion on uneven terrain. Simulations and experiments show that the robot is capable to move on multiple challenging terrains, including doorsills, stairs, slopes, sand and stones. This paper demonstrates that even some challenging locomotion tasks can be achieved in a rather simple way without using complicated control algorithms, which suggests us to rethink about the leg configurations in designing quadruped robots.
