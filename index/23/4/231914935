In this paper, we have constructed actively perfusable multiple hepatic lobule-like vascular networks in a 3D cellular structure by using magnetic tweezers. Without well-organized channel networks, cells in a large 3D tissue cannot receive nutrients and oxygen from the channel, and therefore, the cells will be dead after few days. To construct well-organized channel networks, we fabricated a hepatic lobule like vascular networks by using magnetic fields in our previous works [1], [2]. However, the size of the hepatic lobule like vascular network was more than five times larger than real hepatic tissue. To improve the previous research, we have proposed several things. First, we have constructed the vascular network having similar size of the real thing in this step. Second, we have cultured the constructed structure for a long-time (more than two weeks) to verify the biocompatible condition. Third, we assemble the constructed hepatic tissues to make a large size of organ, liver. Finally, an actively perfusable system have been adopted to implement a bioreactor system by adding micro pump.
