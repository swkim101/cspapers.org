Web of things (WoT) are inclined to suffer from internal attacks, which are from compromised nodes. Due to resource-constraint of WoT, the traditional security methods cannot be deployed. One of the most appropriate protection mechanisms to resist internal attacks is the trust management system. For the sake of evaluate the performance of WoT reasonably and appropriately, we improve the Beta-based reputation system, and propose a Poisson Distribution-based trust model (PDTM) in this paper. In view of evaluating a sensor node (or terminal) behaviors, its reputation and trust are represented by the Poisson distribution. PDTM is used to look for reliable nodes to transmit data and weaken malicious attacks within WoTs. The simulation results indicate that the PDTM can resist internal attack effectively, in order to strengthen the network security.
