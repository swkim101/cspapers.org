This study develops a training system for a multimodal comprehensive care methodology for dementia patients called Humanitude. Humanitude has attracted much attention as a gentle and effective care technique. It consists of four main techniques, namely, eye contact, verbal communication, touch, and standing up, and more than 150 care elements. Learning Humanitude thus requires much time. To provide an effective training system for Humanitude, we develop a training system that realizes sensing and interaction simultaneously by combining a real entity and augmented reality technology. To imitate the interaction between a patient and a caregiver, we superimpose a three-dimensional CG model of a patientâ€™s face onto the head of a soft doll using augmented reality technology. Touch information such as position and force is sensed using the whole body wearable tactile sensor developed to quantify touch skills. This training system enables the evaluation of eye contact and touch skills simultaneously. We build a prototype of the proposed training system and evaluate the usefulness of the system in public lectures.
