We propose a novel guided interactive segmentation (GIS) algorithm for video objects to improve the segmentation accuracy and reduce the interaction time. First, we design the reliability-based attention module to analyze the reliability of multiple annotated frames. Second, we develop the intersection-aware propagation module to propagate segmentation results to neighboring frames. Third, we introduce the GIS mechanism for a user to select unsatisfactory frames quickly with less effort. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides more accurate segmentation results at a faster speed than conventional algorithms.
