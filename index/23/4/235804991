The rapid development of in-vehicle networks and protocols brings efficient communication service but also increases the risk of attack. Any vulnerability may be leveraged to cause serious consequences. It is of vital importance to guarantee their security. However, the vulnerability detection efficiency of traditional techniques such as fuzzing is challenged by the complex relations among protocol states.In this paper, we propose PAVFuzz, a state-sensitive fuzz testing framework to secure those protocols used in autonomous vehicles. It automatically learns relations between two data elements in different protocol states. The relations will then be used to calculate and update the mutation weight of each data element continuously. Accordingly, PAVFuzz is able to select the target data elements and perform state-sensitive mutation to boost the efficiency. Experiments show that, compared with state-of-the-art fuzzers Peach and AFL, PAVFuzz increases branch coverage by averagely 22.51% and 369.19% within 24 hours. It has successfully exposed 12 serious previously unknown vulnerabilities among several protocols that are widely used in autonomous vehicles, such as RTPS and SOME/IP. We have reported them to the developers and corresponding patches have been released.
