Fact-checking on the Web has become the main mechanism through which we detect the credibility of the news or information. Existing fact-checkers verify the authenticity of the information (support or refute the claim) based on secondary sources of information. However, existing approaches do not consider the problem of model updates due to constantly increasing training data due to user feedback. It is therefore important to conduct user studies to correct models' inference biases and improve the model in a life-long learning manner in the future according to the user feedback. In this paper, we present FaxPlainAC, a tool that gathers user feedback on the output of explainable fact-checking models. FaxPlainAC outputs both the model decision, i.e., whether the input fact is true or not, along with the supporting/refuting evidence considered by the model. Additionally, FaxPlainAC allows for accepting user feedback both on the prediction and explanation. Developed in Python, FaxPlainAC is designed as a modular and easily deployable tool. It can be integrated with other downstream tasks and allowing for fact-checking human annotation gathering and life-long learning.
