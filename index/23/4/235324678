We identify and survey five mechanisms through which web content interacts with mobile apps. While useful, these web-app interaction mechanisms cause various notable security vulnerabilities on mobile apps or web content. The root cause is lack of proper access control mechanisms for web-app interactions on mobile OSes. Existing solutions usually adopt either an origin-centric design or a code-centric design, and suffer from one or several of the following limitations: coarse protection granularity, poor flexibility in terms of access control policy establishment, and incompatibility with existing apps/OSes due to the need of modifying the apps and/or the underlying OS. More importantly, none of the existing works can organically deal with all the five web-app interaction mechanisms. In this paper, we propose ReACt, a novel Resource-centric Access Control design that can coherently work with all the web-app interaction mechanisms while addressing the above-mentioned limitations. We have implemented a prototype system on Android, and performed extensive evaluation on it. The evaluation results show that our system works well with existing commercial off-the-shelf Android apps and different versions of Android OS, and it can achieve the design goals with small overhead.
