Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are important components of critical infrastructure and must operate with high levels of reliability and security. We propose a conceptual approach to securing CPSs: the Cyber-Physical Immune System (CPIS), a collection of hardware and software elements deployed on top of a conventional CPS. Inspired by its biological counterpart, the CPIS comprises an independent network of distributed computing units that collects data from the conventional CPS, utilizes data-driven techniques to identify threats, adapts to the changing environment, alerts the user of any threats or anomalies, and deploys threat-mitigation strategies.
