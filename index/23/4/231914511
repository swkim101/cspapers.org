Traffic flow prediction is of great importance in traffic management and public safety, but is challenging due to the complex spatial-temporal dependencies as well as temporal dynamics. Existing work either focuses on traditional statistical models, which have limited prediction accuracy, or relies on black-box deep learning models, which have superior prediction accuracy but are hard to interpret. In contrast, we propose a novel interpretable spatiotemporal deep learning model for traffic flow prediction. Our main idea is to model the physics of traffic flow through a number of latent Spatio-Temporal Potential Energy Fields (ST-PEFs), similar to water flow driven by the gravity field. We develop a Wind field Decomposition (WD) algorithm to decompose traffic flow into poly-tree components so that ST-PEFs can be established. We then design a spatiotemporal deep learning model for the ST-PEFs, which consists of a temporal component (modeling the temporal correlation) and a spatial component (modeling the spatial dependencies). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that make traffic flow prediction based on ST-PEFs. Experimental results on real-world traffic datasets show the effectiveness of our model compared to the existing methods. A case study confirms our model interpretability.
