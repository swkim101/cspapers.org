It is quite important how to correlate and find out relationships between how people grow up and succeed in their research field compared to their field’s grows. In many cases, people refer only to indices such as citation count, h-index, i10-index and compare scientists from different fields in a similar situation with the same variables. It is not a fair comparison since fields are different in development and being cited. In this paper, we used the acceleration concept from physics and propose a new method with new metrics to efficiently and fairly evaluate scientists according to the real-time analysis of their recent status compared to their field’s grows. This considers various inputs such as whether a person is beginner scientists or professional and applies all such key inputs in the evaluation. The evaluation is also over time. The results showed better evaluation compared to state-of-the-art metrics.
