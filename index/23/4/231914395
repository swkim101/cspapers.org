The ocean world Europa is a prime target for exploration given its potential habitability [1]. We propose a mobile robotic system that is capable of autonomously traversing tens of meters to visit multiple sites of interest on a Europan analogue surface. Due to the topology of Europan terrain being largely unknown, it is desired that this mobility system traverse a large variety of terrain types. The mobility system should also be capable of crossing unstructured terrain in an autonomous manner given the communications limitations between Earth and Europa.A wheel-on-limb robotic rover is presented that may actively conform to terrain features up to 1.5 wheel diameters tall while driving. The robot uses a sampling-based motion planner to generate paths that leverage its unique locomotive capabilities. The planner assesses terrain hazards and wheel workspace limits as obstacles. It may also select a mobility mode based on predicted energy usage and the need for limb articulation on the terrain being traversed. This autonomous mobility was evaluated on chaotic salt-evaporite terrain found in Death Valley, CA, an analogue to the Europan surface. Over the course of 38 trials, the rover autonomously traversed 435m of extreme terrain while maintaining a rate of 0.64 traverse ending failures for every 10m driven.
