Domain adaptation is an important property in robot vision, which enables the neural networks pre-trained on source domains to adapt target domains automatically without any annotation efforts. During this process, source data is not always accessible due to the constraints of expensive storage overhead and data privacy protection. Therefore, the source domain pre-trained model is expected to optimize with only unlabeled target data, termed as source-free unsupervised domain adaptation. In this paper, we view this problem as a special case of noisy label learning, since the given pre-trained model can generate noisy labels for unlabeled target data via network inference. The potential semantic cues for unsupervised domain adaptation exactly lie on these noisy labels. Inspired by this problem modeling, we propose a simple yet effective Self-Supervised Noisy Label Learning method, which injects self-supervised learning to impose the intrinsic data structure and facilitate label-denoising. Extensive experiments have been conducted on diverse benchmarks to validate the effectiveness. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
