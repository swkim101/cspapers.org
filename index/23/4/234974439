Not a few students mathematics education of IAIN Jember experience obstacles in studying Calculus courses. This can be seen from many students who say that calculus courses are difficult and the results of the student calculus pretest. The lack of mastery in trigonometric operations which is a prerequisite for calculus courses is one reason. Therefore, error analysis is needed to identify the types of errors and the tendency of errors experienced by students in working on trigonometric problems which are the prerequisite material for calculus courses. Data collection in this study was carried out by the method of tests and interviews, meanwhile the data analysis used descriptive analysis. Through data analysis, it can be concluded that the errors experienced by students in working on trigonometric operations as a prerequisite for calculus courses are errors of fact, concept errors, and skills errors. Of the three errors, what turns out to be a tendency to error is a fact error. In addition, the cause of the error was the very lack of understanding of the concepts that exist in the material trigonometric operations.
