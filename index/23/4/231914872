The ability to synchronize expectations among human-robot teams and understand discrepancies between expectations and reality is essential for human-robot collaboration scenarios. To ensure this, human activities and intentions must be interpreted quickly and reliably by the robot using various modalities. In this paper we propose a multimodal recognition system designed to detect physical interactions as well as nonverbal gestures. Existing approaches feature high post-transfer recognition rates which, however, can only be achieved based on well-prepared and large datasets. Unfortunately, the acquisition and preparation of domain-specific samples especially in industrial context is time consuming and expensive. To reduce this effort we introduce a weakly-supervised classification approach. Therefore, we learn a latent representation of the human activities with a variational autoencoder network. Additional modalities and unlabeled samples are incorporated by a scalable product-of-expert sampling approach. The applicability in industrial context is evaluated by two domain-specific collaborative robot datasets. Our results demonstrate, that we can keep the number of labeled samples constant while increasing the network performance by providing additional unprocessed information.
