The holonomic and omnidirectional capabilities imparted to the mobile base platform depends mainly on two factors, i.e., the wheel design and its various arrangements in the platform chassis. This paper reports on the development of a novel omnidirectional spherical sectioned wheel named Ospheel. It is modular, and the spherical sectioned geometry of the wheel is driven using two actuators placed inside the housing above the wheel that rotates it independently about two perpendicular axes. The mechanical drive system for Ospheel consists of two gear trains, namely, internal spur gear and crown gear spatially assembled in orthogonal planes and are driven by two driving pinions. The kinematics of a single Ospheel is described, followed by the kinematic equation of a robot equipped with two Ospheels. Forward and inverse kinematic equations are derived explicitly. Experiments were carried out with the two Ospheels at a fixed inclination assembled with the base to illustrate the holonomic motion. The robustness of the wheel design is experimented with different trajectories and on different terrains.
