In this paper we present a novel strategy for motion planning of autonomous robotic arms in Robotic Minimally Invasive Surgery (R-MIS). We consider a scenario where several laparoscopic tools must move and coordinate in a shared environment. The motion planner is based on a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) that predicts the future behavior of the robots and allows to move them avoiding collisions between the tools and satisfying the velocity limitations. In order to avoid the local minima that could affect the MPC, we propose a strategy for driving it through a sequence of waypoints. The proposed control strategy is validated on a realistic surgical scenario.
