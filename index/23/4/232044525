The Great Firewall of China (GFW) prevents Chinese citizens from accessing online content deemed objectionable by the Chinese government. One way it does this is to search for forbidden keywords in unencrypted packet streams. When it detects them, it terminates the offending stream by injecting TCP RST packets, and blocks further traffic between the same two hosts for a few minutes. We report on a detailed investigation of the GFW’s application-layer understanding of HTTP. Forbidden keywords are only detected in certain locations within an HTTP request. Requests that contain the English word “search” are inspected for a longer list of forbidden keywords than requests without this word. The firewall can be evaded by bending the rules of the HTTP specification. We observe censorship based on the cleartext TLS Server Name Indication (SNI), but we find no evidence for bulk decryption of HTTPS. We also report on changes since 2014 in the contents of the forbidden keyword list. Over 85% of the forbidden keywords have been replaced since 2014, with the surviving terms referring to perennially sensitive topics. The new keywords refer to recent events and controversies. The GFW’s keyword list is not kept in sync with the blocklists used by Chinese chat clients.
