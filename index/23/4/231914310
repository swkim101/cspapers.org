The Everyday Activities Science and Engineering (EASE) Collaborative Research Consortiumâ€™s mission to enhance the performance of cognition-enabled robots establishes its foundation in the EASE Human Activities Data Analysis Pipeline. Through collection of diverse human activity information resources, enrichment with contextually relevant annotations, and subsequent multimodal analysis of the combined data sources, the pipeline described will provide a rich resource for robot planning researchers, through incorporation in the OpenEASE cloud platform.
