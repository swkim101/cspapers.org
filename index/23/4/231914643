Personalized online machine learning allows a very accurate modelling of individual behavior and demands. In particular, a system that dynamically adapts during runtime can initiate a continuous collaboration with its user where both alternately adjust to each other to maximize the systemâ€™s utility. However, in application scenarios based on supervised learning it is often unclear how to obtain the required ground truth for such dynamic systems. In this paper, we focus on applications where a real-time classification of sequential data is crucial. Concretely, we propose to adapt an online personalized model solely based on pseudo-ground-truth information which is provided by another machine learning model. This model has the advantage to classify sequences in retrospective with a small delay and thus is able to achieve a higher performance than real-time systems. In particular, it is a pre-trained offline model, which means that no ground-truth information is necessary during runtime. We apply the proposal on the task of online action classification, for which the benefits of personalization have been recently emphasized.
