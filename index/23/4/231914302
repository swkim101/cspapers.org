Robotic systems are increasingly required not only to generate precise motions to complete their tasks but also to handle the interactions with the environment or human. Significantly, soft interaction brings great challenges on the force control due to the nonlinear, viscoelastic and inhomogeneous properties of the soft environment. In this paper, a robust impedance control scheme utilizing integral backstepping technology and integral terminal sliding mode control is proposed to achieve force tracking for an ultrasonic motor-actuated end-effector in a soft environment. In particular, the steady-state performance of the target impedance while in contact with soft environment is derived and analyzed with the nonlinear Hunt-Crossley model. Finally, the dynamic force tracking performance of the proposed control scheme is verified via several experiments.
