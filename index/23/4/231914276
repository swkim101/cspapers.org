Kawaii, a Japanese word that means "cute," is an essential design concept in consumer and pop culture in Japan. In this study, we focused on a situation where a social robot describes an object during an information-providing task, which is commonly required for social robots in daily environments. Since past studies reported kawaii feelings are associated with a motivation to approach a target, our robot expressed feelings of kawaii to objects touch behaviors. We also focused on whether touch behaviors that emphasize style increase the feeling of kawaii of the touched object, following a phenomenon where people strongly touch a target when they overwhelmingly feel positive emotion: cute aggression. Our experimental results showed the effectiveness of touch behaviors to express the feelings of kawaii from the robot toward objects and to increase the participantsâ€™ feelings of kawaii toward the object. We identified fewer effects from the participants to the robot. The emphasized motion style did not show any significant effects for the kawaii feelings.
