After a model is deployed on edge devices, it is desirable for these devices to learn from unlabeled data to continuously improve accuracy. Contrastive learning has demonstrated its great potential in learning from unlabeled data. However, the online input data are usually none independent and identically distributed (non-iid) and edge devicesâ€™ storages are usually too limited to store enough representative data from different data classes. We propose a framework to automatically select the most representative data from the unlabeled input stream, which only requires a small data buffer for dynamic learning. Experiments show that accuracy and learning speed are greatly improved.
