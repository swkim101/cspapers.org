We introduce Amazon Berkeley Objects (ABO), a new large-scale dataset designed to help bridge the gap between real and virtual 3D worlds. ABO contains product catalog images, metadata, and artist-created 3D models with com-plex geometries and physically-based materials that cor-respond to real, household objects. We derive challenging benchmarks that exploit the unique properties of ABO and measure the current limits of the state-of-the-art on three open problems for real-world 3D object understanding: single-view 3D reconstruction, material estimation, and cross-domain multi-view object retrieval.
