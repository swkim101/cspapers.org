We propose a recommender system that, starting from a set of users skills, identifies the most suitable jobs as they emerge from a large text of Online Job Vacancies (OJVs). To this aim, we process 2.5M+ OJVs posted in three different countries (United Kingdom, France and Germany), generating several embeddings and performing an intrinsic evaluation of their quality. Besides, we compute a measure of skill importance for each occupation in each country, the Revealed Comparative Advantage (rca). The best vector models, together with the rca, are used to feed a graph database, which will serve as the keystone for the recommender system.
Finally, a user study of 10 validates the effectiveness of Skills2Job, both in terms of precision and nDGC.
