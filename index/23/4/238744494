Event correlation reasoning infers whether a natural language paragraph containing multiple events conforms to human common sense. For example, “Andrew was very drowsy, so he took a long nap, and now he is very alert” is sound and reasonable. In contrast, “Andrew was very drowsy, so he stayed up a long time, now he is very alert” does not comply with human common sense. Such reasoning capability is essential for many downstream tasks, such as script reasoning, abductive reasoning, narrative incoherence, story cloze test, etc. However, conducting event correlation reasoning is challenging due to a lack of large amounts of diverse event-based knowledge and difficulty in capturing correlation among multiple events. In this paper, we propose EventBERT, a pre-trained model to encapsulate eventuality knowledge from unlabeled text. Specifically, we collect a large volume of training examples by identifying natural language paragraphs that describe multiple correlated events and further extracting event spans in an unsupervised manner. We then propose three novel event- and correlation-based learning objectives to pre-train an event correlation model on our created training corpus. Experimental results show EventBERT outperforms strong baselines on four downstream tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art results on most of them. Moreover, it outperforms existing pre-trained models by a large margin, e.g., 6.5 ∼ 23%, in zero-shot learning of these tasks.
