In todayâ€™s fast-evolving job market, the timely and effective understanding of the career trajectories of talents can help them quickly develop necessary skills and make the right career transitions at the right time. However, it is a non-trivial task for developing a successful career trajectory prediction method, which should have the abilities for finding the right timing for job-hopping, identifying the right companies, and matching the right positions for the candidates. While people have been trying to develop solutions for providing some of the above abilities, there is no total solution or complete framework to integrate all these abilities together. To this end, in this paper, we propose a unified time-aware career trajectory prediction framework, namely TACTP, which is capable of jointly providing the above three abilities for better understanding the career trajectories of talents. Along this line, we first exploit a hierarchical deep sequential modeling network for career embedding and extract latent talent factors from multiple networks, which are designed with different functions of handling related issues of the timing, companies, and positions for job-hopping. Then, we perform collaborative filtering for generating personalized predictions. Furthermore, we propose a temporal encoding mechanism to handle dynamic temporal information so that TACTP is capable of generating time-aware predictions by addressing the challenges for variable interval time sequence modeling. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on large-scale real-world data to evaluate TACTP against the state-of-the-art baselines, and the results show that TACTP has advantages over baselines on all targeted tasks for career trajectory prediction.
