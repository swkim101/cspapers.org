Jigsaw’s Perspective API aims to protect voices in online conversation by developing and serving machine learning models that identify toxicity text. This talk will share how the team behind Perspective thinks about the issues of Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics and Society through the lens of Google’s AI Principles. For the Perspective team, building technology that is fair and ethical is a continuous, ongoing effort. The talk will cover concrete strategies the Perspective team has already used to mitigate bias in ML models as well as new strategies currently being explored. Finally, with examples of how Perspective is being used in the real world, the talk will show how machine learning, combined with thoughtful human moderation and participation, can help improve online conversations.
