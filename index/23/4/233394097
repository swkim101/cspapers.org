The past year has witnessed the rapid development of applying the Transformer module to vision problems. While some researchers have demonstrated that Transformer-based models enjoy a favorable ability of fitting data, there are still growing number of evidences showing that these models suffer over-fitting especially when the training data is limited. This paper offers an empirical study by performing step-by-step operations to gradually transit a Transformer-based model to a convolution-based model. The results we obtain during the transition process deliver useful messages for improving visual recognition. Based on these observations, we propose a new architecture named Visformer, which is abbreviated from the ‘Vision-friendly Transformer’. With the same computational complexity, Visformer outperforms both the Transformer-based and convolution-based models in terms of ImageNet classification accuracy, and the advantage becomes more significant when the model complexity is lower or the training set is smaller.
