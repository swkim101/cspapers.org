In gait training for walking rehabilitation of patients with stroke hemiplegia or bone joint conditions such as fractures, it is important to recognize the load of the affected lower limbs for improving gait ability and avoiding risks such as re-fractures. A weight scale is used at the actual rehabilitation site to recognize the load. However, in this situation, the trainee must look down to verify whether the scale and their walking posture are correct. In addition, the trainee generally cannot read the load value accurately. Therefore, we have developed a system that can show the load in real time on an eye-level display. By using this system, we expect the patients to be able to perform gait training smoothly while recognizing the state of walking. In this paper, we have reported the results of a clinical trial held at a rehabilitation hospital and an examination of the screen-indicated methods.
