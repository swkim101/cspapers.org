Consistency Identification has obtained remarkable success on open-domain dialogue, which can be used for preventing inconsistent response generation. However, in contrast to the rapid development in open-domain dialogue, few efforts have been made to the task-oriented dialogue direction. In this paper, we argue that consistency problem is more urgent in task-oriented domain. To facilitate the research, we introduce CI-ToD, a novel dataset for Consistency Identification in Task-oriented Dialog system. In addition, we not only annotate the single label to enable the model to judge whether the system response is contradictory, but also provide more fine-grained labels (i.e., Dialogue History Inconsistency, User Query Inconsistency and Knowledge Base Inconsistency) to encourage model to know what inconsistent sources lead to it. Empirical results show that state-of-the-art methods only achieve 51.3%, which is far behind the human performance of 93.2%, indicating that there is ample room for improving consistency identification ability. Finally, we conduct exhaustive experiments and qualitative analysis to comprehend key challenges and provide guidance for future directions.
