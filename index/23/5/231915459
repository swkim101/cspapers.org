Trajectory tracking of flexible link robots is a classical control problem. Historically, the link elasticity was considered as something to be removed. Hence, the control performance was guaranteed by adopting high-gain feedback loops and, possibly, a dynamic compensation with the result to stiffen up the dynamic behavior of the robot. Nowadays, robots are pushed more and more towards a safe physical interaction with a less and less structured environment. Hence, the design and control of the robots moved to an on-purpose introduction of highly compliant elements in the robot bodies, the so-called soft robotics, and towards control approaches that aim to provide the tracking performance without a substantial change in the robot dynamic behavior. Following this approach, we present an iterative learning control that relies mainly on a feedforward component, hence preserves the robot dynamics, for trajectory tracking of a one-link flexible arm. We provide a condition, based on the system dynamics and similar to the Strong Inertially Coupled property, that ensures the applicability of the proposed control method. Finally, we report simulation and experimental tests to validate the theoretical results.
