In the current Internet architecture, application service providers (ASPs) own users' data and social groups information, which made a handful of ASP companies growing bigger and bigger and denied small and medium companies from entering this business. We propose a new architecture, called Application Independent Information Infrastructure (AI3). The design goals of AI3 are: 1) Decoupling users' data from ASPs and users' social relations from ASPs, such that ASPs become independent from users' data and social relations. 2) Open architecture, such that different ASPs can interoperate with each other. This demo is to show a prototype of AI3. The demo has four parts: 1) ASPindependent data management in AI3; 2) ASP-independent management of users' social relations in AI3; 3) inter-domain data transport and user roaming; 4) real-time communications by using AI3.
