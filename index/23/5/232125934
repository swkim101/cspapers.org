What teacher knowledge and skills are necessary for effective instruction of K-12 computer science? In recent years, standards and a national framework have delineated universal learning student outcomes in K-12 computer science (CS) education, but there has been less focus and coherence on what is required of teachers to prepare their students to equitably meet these learning outcomes. The 2020 CSTA Standards for CS Teachers were designed to meet this need. In this BoF session, we will provide a platform to discuss the evidence base aligned to each of the five teacher standards: (1) CS Content Knowledge and Skills, (2) Equity and Inclusion, (3) Professional Growth and Identity, (4) Instructional Design, and (5) Classroom Practice. Participants will share their knowledge and experience in a facilitated conversation organized around focal questions for each standard.
