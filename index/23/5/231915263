This paper addressed a challenging problem of wheeled-legged robots with high degrees of freedom exploring in unknown rough environments. The proposed method works as a pipeline to achieve prioritized exploration comprising three primary modules: traversability analysis, frontier-based exploration and hybrid locomotion planning. Traversability analysis provides robots an evaluation about surrounding terrain according to various criteria ( roughness, slope etc.) and other semantic information (small step, stair, bridge etc.), while novel gravity point frontier-based exploration algorithm can effectively decide which direction to go even in unknown environments based on robotsâ€™ current pose and desired one. Given all these information, hybrid locomotion planner will generate a path with motion mode (driving or walking) encoded by optimizing among different objectives and constraints. Lastly, our approach was well verified in both simulation and experiment on a wheeled quadrupedal robot Pholus.
