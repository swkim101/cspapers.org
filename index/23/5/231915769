We present a Lloyd-based navigation solution for robots that are required to move in a dynamic environment, where static obstacles (e.g, furnitures, parked cars) and unpredicted moving obstacles (e.g., humans, other robots) have to be detected and avoided on the fly. The algorithm can be computed in real-time and falls in the category of the reactive methods. Moreover, we propose an extension to the multi-agent case that deals with cohesion and cooperation between agents. The goodness of the method is proved through extensive simulations and, for the single agent navigation in human-shared environment, also with experiments on a unicycle-like robot.
