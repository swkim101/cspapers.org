Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) are underwater robotic devices intended to explore hostiles territories in underwater domain. AUVs research gaining popularity among underwater research community because of its extensive applications and challenges to overcome unpredictable ocean behavior. The aim of this paper is to design discrete time terminal sliding mode control (DTSMC) reaching law-based employed to NPS AUV II purposely to improve the dynamic response of the closed loop system. This is accomplished by introducing a nonlinear component to sliding surface design in which the system state accelerated, and chattering effect is suppressed. The nonlinear component consist of fractional power is to ensure steeper slope of the sliding surface in the vicinity of the equilibrium point which lead to quicker convergence speed. Thus, the chattering effect in the control action suppressed as the convergence of the system state accelerated. The stability of the control system is proven by using Sarpturk analysis and the performance of the DTSMC is demonstrated through simulation study. The performance of DTSMC is benchmarked with DSMC and PID controller
