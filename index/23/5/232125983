We propose Pythonpad, an open-source JavaScript library that supports web-based Python programming exercises. Unlike other standalone web-based programming tools, Pythonpad can be easily integrated into other websites. Although it runs learners' Python code in client-side web browsers, Pythonpad supports a file system, building and importing external modules, and many essential built-in Python libraries to teach basic programming concepts in CS1 classes.
