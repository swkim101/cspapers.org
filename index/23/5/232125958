Data science in an emerging interdisciplinary field integrating knowledge and skills from computer science, statistics, and an application domain. The contribution of computer science education to the field of data science education is therefore evident. As computer science educators, however, we can benefit from adapting concepts and methods of data science education as well. For example, working with real data sets, a common practice in data science education, can benefit computer science students, giving them better sense of real-life problems; Statistical thinking, a fundamental thinking skill for data scientists, can enhance computational thinking as a real-life problem-solving skill. This BOF will provide a platform to discuss both the possible benefits computer science educators can earn from the emerging field of data science education and practical pedagogical methods to achieve these benefits.
