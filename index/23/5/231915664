This work uses quadratic programming to perform torque control on an industrial collaborative robot, while keeping defined constraints. Limits for rotational and translational coordinates are considered at position, velocity and acceleration level. Although the problem of having hardware and safe limitations has been considered before. Solutions usually rely on functions that need a proper tuning. The proposed control scheme is tested to work on a real robot to avoid not only static but also dynamic obstacles without the need of any empirical tuning. The method is tested also under physical human robot interaction (pHRI) showing smooth behaviour of the robot despite of external forces.
