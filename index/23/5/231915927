Although they take many forms, legged robots rely upon springs to achieve high speed, dynamic locomotion. In this paper we examine the effect of adding parallel springs to robots that rely on virtual compliance. Specifically, we consider the trade-off between energetic efficiency and leg versatility that comes while using Parallel Elastic Actuators (PEAs). To do this, we vary the ratio of physical to virtual compliance for legged systems using a) a modified SLIP model, b) a single legged hopping robot, and c) a multibody simulation of the quadruped robot LLAMA. In each case we show that having a small physical compliance significantly improves the efficiency while also maintaining the robotâ€™s versatility.
