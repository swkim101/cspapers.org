In this symposium piece, I consider how Brian Street’s ideas have been picked up in the teaching of postsecondary writing in the Caribbean and suggest some aspects of his work that might still prove useful in the teaching of academic writing there and elsewhere in the 21st century. Teaching and researching in academic writing in my natal space of the Caribbean but having studied rhetoric and composition and taught firstyear composition in the US, I will be shuttling between the two spaces. I will begin with some context for my work and then examine past and potential engagements with Street’s ideas.
