The emerging underground markets (e.g., Hack Forums) have been widely used by cybercriminals to trade in illicit products or services, which have played a vital role in the cybercriminal ecosystem. In order to combat the evolving cybercrimes, in this paper, we propose and develop an intelligent framework (named PIdentifier) to automate the analysis of Hack Forums for the identification of illicit product traded in a private contract at the first attempt (to evade the law enforcement, a private contract is made between a vendor and a buyer where the traded product and its detail are invisible). In PIdentifier, based on the large-scale extracted user profiles, user posts and different types of relations within the complex ecosystem in Hack Forums, we first introduce an attributed heterogeneous information network (AHIN) to model the rich semantics and complex relations among multi-typed entities (i.e., vendors, buyers, products, comments and topics). Then, we design different metagraphs to formulate the relatedness between buyers and products based on which a metagraph aggregated heterogeneous graph neural network (denoted as mHGNN) is proposed to learn node representations for illicit traded product identification by attentively propagating and aggregating the neighborhood information defined by the designed metagraphs. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the real-world dataset collected from Hack Forums. Promising results demonstrate the performance of our proposed PIdentifier framework in illicit traded product identification by comparison with the state-of-the-art baselines.
