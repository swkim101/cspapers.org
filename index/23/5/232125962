Modern Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) are gradually progressing from just voice control tools to interactive, rich, humanlike social systems. However, creating these social humanlike IVAs is usually a daunting task and may present challenges for novice programmers, given the high technical complexity of practical implementation. In this work, we present AvaFlow, a web-based educational flow-based programming tool designed to assist novice programmers with creating and deploying IVA prototypes. We also aim to expand the use of the tool beyond IVAs to teach additional CS concepts related to data-driven applications.
