The development of environment-friendly and cost-effective palladium(
Pd) based nanocomposite is of high interest for catalytic applications.



In this paper, a porous Pd/two-dimensional-material (graphene oxide
(GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)) nanocomposite was synthesized with a green and facile
method, without adding any additional reductant, surfactant and special solvent.



The catalytic activity of the Pd/rGO composite was investigated using the 4-nitrophenol
(4-NP) reduction reaction in the presence of sodium borohydride (NaBH4). The results showed that
the Pd/rGO nanocomposite not only exhibited much higher catalytic activity than the pure porous
Pd catalyst but also showed a very good catalytic stability due to the less Pd aggregation and increased
local 4-NP concentration arose from rGO bonding attraction. Besides, the Pd-rGO nanocomposite
showed a kapp value of 0.383 min-1, which was 13 times higher than the pure Pd
(0.0292 min-1), as well as a reliable 4-NP conversion rate of over 97%.



This study may provide a route for green-design and synthesis of heterogeneous catalyst
composites with lower cost and better performance.
