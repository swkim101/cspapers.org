There are currently over 30 billion IoT (Internet of Things) devices installed worldwide. To secure these devices from various threats one often relies on public-key cryptographic primitives whose operations can be costly to compute on resource-constrained IoT devices. To support such operations these devices often include a dedicated co-processor for cryptographic procedures, typically in the form of a big integer arithmetic unit. Such existing arithmetic co-processors do not offer the functionality that is expected by upcoming post-quantum cryptographic primitives. Regardless, contemporary systems may exist in the ﬁeld for many years to come. In this paper we propose the Kronecker + algorithm for polynomial multiplication in rings of the form Z [ X ] / ( X n + 1 ) : the arithmetic foundation of many lattice-based cryptographic schemes. We discuss how Kronecker + allows for re-use of existing co-processors for post-quantum cryptography, and in particular directly applies to the various ﬁnalists in the post-quantum standardization effort led by NIST. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in practice by in-tegrating Kronecker + into Saber: one of the ﬁnalists in the ongoing NIST standardization effort. On our target platform, a RV32IMC with access to a dedicated arithmetic co-processor designed to accelerate RSA and ECC, Kronecker + performs the matrix multiplication 2.8 times faster than regular Kronecker substitution and 1.7 times faster than Harvey’s negated-evaluation-points method.
