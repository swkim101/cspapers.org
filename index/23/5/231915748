The authors have investigated underactuated locomotion robots with an inner wobbling mass, it is discovered that the wobbling mass controls the gait speed by entrainment. Supplying the wobbling from outside, outer wobbling entrains load objects and controls the transferring speed. In this paper, we propose a vibratory conveyor system based on the frequency entrainment of a limit cycle walker. The conveyance plate is vibrated by an active rimless wheel, and the system conveys a passive rimless wheel which is defined as a load object. The vibration entrains transferring of the passive rimless and controls the conveyance speed. First, we introduce the prototype experimental system and its mathematical model. Second, we report basic behavior of the passive rimless with regards to the outer vibration and results of frequency analysis through the numerical simulation. Third, we experimentally verify the results of the numerical simulation. The active rimless wheel entrains the walking frequency of the passive rimless wheel in both the simulations and the experiments.
