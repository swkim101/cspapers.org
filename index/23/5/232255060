– Wireless Network-on-Chip (NoC) has emerged as a promising solution to scale chip multi-core processors to hundreds and thousands of cores. The broadcast nature of a wireless network allows it to signiﬁcantly reduce the latency and overhead of many-to-many multicast and broadcast communication on NoC processors. Unfortunately, the trafﬁc patterns on wireless NoCs tend to be very dynamic and can change drastically across different cores, different time intervals and different applications. New medium access protocols that can learn and adapt to the highly dynamic trafﬁc in wireless NoCs are needed to ensure low latency and efﬁcient network utilization. Towards this goal, we present NeuMAC, a uniﬁed approach that combines networking, architecture and deep learning to generate highly adaptive medium access protocols for wireless NoC architectures. NeuMAC leverages a deep reinforcement learning framework to create new policies that can learn the structure, correlations, and statistics of the trafﬁc patterns and adapt quickly to optimize performance. Our results show that NeuMAC can quickly adapt to NoC trafﬁc to provide signiﬁcant gains in terms of latency, throughput, and overall execution time. In particular, for applications with highly dynamic trafﬁc patterns, NeuMAC can speed up the execution time by 1 . 37 ×− 3 . 74 × as compared to 6 baselines.
