In this paper, we explore the problem of task-consistent path planning for printing-in-motion via Mobile Manipulators (MM). MM offer a potentially unlimited planar workspace and flexibility for print operations. However, most existing methods have only mobility to relocate an arm which then prints while stationary. In this paper we present a new fully autonomous path planning approach for mobile material deposition. We use a modified version of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) algorithm, which is informed by a constrained Inverse Reachability Map (IRM) to ensure task consistency. Collision avoidance and end-effector reachability are respected in our approach. Our method also detects when a print path cannot be completed in a single execution. In this case it will decompose the path into several segments and reposition the base accordingly.
