We present several classes of reinforcement learning algorithms that safely generalize to Markov decision processes (MDPs) not seen during training. Speciﬁcally, we study the setting in which some set of MDPs is accessible for training. For various deﬁnitions of safety, our algorithms give probabilistic guarantees that agents can safely generalize to MDPs that are sampled from the same distribution but are not necessarily in the training set. These algorithms are a type of Seldo-nian algorithm (Thomas et al., 2019), which is a class of machine learning algorithms that return models with probabilistic safety guarantees for user-speciﬁed deﬁnitions of safety.
