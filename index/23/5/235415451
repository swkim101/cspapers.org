For decades, Moore’s Law has delivered the ability to integrate an exponentially increasing number of devices in the same silicon area at a roughly constant cost. This has enabled tremendous levels of integration, where the capabilities of computer systems that previously occupied entire rooms can now fit on a single integrated circuit.In recent times, the steady drum beat of Moore’s Law has started to slow down. Whereas device density historically doubled every 18-24 months, the rate of recent silicon process advancements has declined. While improvements in device scaling continue, albeit at a reduced pace, the industry is simultaneously observing increases in manufacturing costs.In response, the industry is now seeing a trend toward reversing direction on the traditional march toward more integration. Instead, multiple industry and academic groups are advocating that systems on chips (SoCs) be "disintegrated" into multiple smaller "chiplets." This paper details the technology challenges that motivated AMD to use chiplets, the technical solutions we developed for our products, and how we expanded the use of chiplets from individual processors to multiple product families.
