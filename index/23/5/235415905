Multi-core architectures have enabled data centers to increasingly co-locate multiple jobs to improve resource utilization and lower the operational cost. Unfortunately, naively co-locating multiple jobs may lead to only a modest increase in system throughput. Worse, some users may observe proportionally higher performance degradation compared to other users co-located on the same physical multi-core system. SATORI is a novel strategy to partition multi-core architectural resources to achieve two conflicting goals simultaneously: increasing system throughput and achieving fairness among the co-located jobs.
