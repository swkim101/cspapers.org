Recursion is one of the essential concepts in computer programming courses and one of the most challenging ideas to deliver in the fundamentals of computer programming courses effectively. Although several previous approaches aid students identify base and recursive cases when they write recursive-based methods, no algorithm has been proposed to help students understand the translation process between iterative to recursive. We proposed a teaching technique that allows students to translate components from loop-based programming to a recursive one.
