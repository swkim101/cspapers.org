This paper proposes a magnetic needle steering controller to manipulate mesoscale magnetic suture needles for executing planned suturing motion. This is an initial step towards our research objective: enabling autonomous control of magnetic suture needles for suturing tasks in minimally invasive surgery. To demonstrate the feasibility of accurate motion control, we employ a cardinally-arranged four-coil electromagnetic system setup and control magnetic suture needles in a 2-dimensional environment, i.e., a Petri dish filled with viscous liquid. Different from only using magnetic field gradients to control small magnetic agents under high damping conditions, the dynamics of a magnetic suture needle are investigated and encoded in the controller. Based on mathematical formulations of magnetic force and torque applied on the needle, we develop a kinematically constrained dynamic model that controls the needle to rotate and only translate along its central axis for mimicking the behavior of surgical sutures. A current controller of the electromagnetic system combining with closed-loop control schemes is designed for commanding the magnetic suture needles to achieve desired linear and angular velocities. To evaluate control performance of magnetic suture needles, we conduct experiments including needle rotation control, needle position control by using discretized trajectories, and velocity control by using a time-varying circular trajectory. The experiment results demonstrate our proposed needle steering controller can perform accurate motion control of mesoscale magnetic suture needles.
