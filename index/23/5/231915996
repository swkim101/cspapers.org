Dynamic control for robotic automation tasks is traditionally designed and optimized with a model-based approach, and the performance relies heavily upon accurate system modeling. However, modeling the true dynamics of increasingly complex robotic systems is an extremely challenging task and it often renders the automation system to operate in a non-optimal condition. Notably, many industrial robotic applications involve repetitive motions and constantly generate a large amount of motion data under the non-optimal condition. These motion data contain rich information, and therefore an intelligent automation system should be able to learn from these non-optimal motion data to drive the system to operate optimally in a data-driven manner. In this paper, we propose a learning-based controller optimization algorithm for repetitive robotic tasks. To achieve this, a multi-objective cost function is designed to take into consideration both the trajectory tracking accuracy and smoothness, and then a data-driven approach is developed to estimate the gradient and Hessian based on the motion data for optimization without relying on the dynamic model. Experiments based on a magnetically-levitated nanopositioning system are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and practical appeals of the proposed algorithm in repetitive robotic automation tasks.
