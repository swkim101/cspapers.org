eHealth provides great relief for patients and physicians. This means, patients autonomously monitor their condition via IoT medical devices and make these data available to physicians for analyses. This requires a data platform that takes care of data acquisition, management, and provisioning. As health data are highly sensitive, there are major concerns regarding data security with respect to confidentiality , integrity , and authenticity . To this end, we present a blueprint for constructing a tru s tworthy h e alth d a ta p l atform called SEAL . It provides a lightweight attribute-based authentication mechanism for IoT devices to validate all involved data sources, there is a fine-grained data provisioning system to enable data provision according to actual requirements, and a verification procedure ensures that data cannot be manipulated.
