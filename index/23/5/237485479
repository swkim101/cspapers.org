Service reliability is one of the key challenges that cloud providers have to deal with. In cloud systems, unplanned service failures may cause severe cascading impacts on their dependent services, deteriorating customer satisfaction. Predicting the cascading impacts accurately and efficiently is critical to the operation and maintenance of cloud systems. Existing approaches identify whether one service depends on another via distributed tracing but no prior work focused on discriminating to what extent the dependency between cloud services is. In this paper, we survey the outages and the procedure for failure diagnosis in two cloud providers to motivate the definition of the intensity of dependency. We define the intensity of dependency between two services as how much the status of the callee service influences the caller service. Then we propose AID, the first approach to predict the intensity of dependencies between cloud services. AID first generates a set of candidate dependency pairs from the spans. AID then represents the status of each cloud service with a multivariate time series aggregated from the spans. With the representation of services, AID calculates the similarities between the statuses of the caller and the callee of each candidate pair. Finally, AID aggregates the similarities to produce a unified value as the intensity of the dependency. We evaluate AID on the data collected from an open-source microservice benchmark and a cloud system in production. The experimental results show that AID can efficiently and accurately predict the intensity of dependencies. We further demonstrate the usefulness of our method in a large-scale commercial cloud system.
