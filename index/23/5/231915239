In this paper, we present the second version of a reconfigurable modular legged robot, Snapbot V2. The mechanical design of Snapbot V2 is enhanced for better dynamic performance and robust connection with modular legs. A motion generator for locomotion is developed to achieve various locomotion skills in one to six-leg configurations. The locomotion is tested on a multi-body dynamic simulation model and implemented on a physical robot as well. A visual detection is implemented with a camera module to recognize the robotâ€™s configuration. By detecting the particular color of the parts at the leg module, the robot can recognize the number and location of the connected legs. Based on the recognized configuration, Snapbot V2 selects the proper locomotion style automatically.
