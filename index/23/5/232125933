Despite the research, reports, and testimonials that document mental health issues among Computer Science (CS) students, little exploration has been done on how the stereotypes associated with CS affect the mental health of its participants. This lightning talk investigates how computer scientist stereotypes contribute to experiences of mental distress. Such investigation helps fill the present gap in our understanding of why students may be susceptible to symptoms of mental illness. Computer scientist stereotypes have long served as barriers for entry into the field, and its many facets - technology-oriented obsession, innate genius, social awkwardness, unattractive physical appearance, and masculinity - contribute to mental health issues within students. It is therefore critical to generate awareness on the negative consequences of perpetuating these stereotypes. Consideration of this topic includes academic literature, reports, articles, essays, and personal narratives, which collectively point to experiences of anxiety, depression, insecurity, lack of belonging, and emotional stress. With a need to strengthen this hypothesis through empirical experimentation and computational study, interested faculty and students are invited to attend the presentation and participate in the exchange of ideas, so that this hypothesis may be confirmed and to inspire future hypotheses. Ultimately, this research encourages institutions and members to challenge existing stereotypical norms, open the dialogue surrounding mental health, conduct further research on wellbeing, and better support members of the CS community.
