For safe and efficient human-robot interaction, a robot needs to predict and understand the intentions of humans who share the same space. Mobile robots are traditionally built to be reactive, moving in unnatural ways without following social protocol, hence forcing people to behave very differently from human-human interaction rules, which can be overcome if robots instead were proactive. In this paper, we build an intention-aware proactive motion planning strategy for mobile robots that coexist with multiple humans. We propose a framework that uses Hidden Markov Model (HMM) theory with a history of observations to: i) predict future states and estimate the likelihood that humans will cross the path of a robot, and ii) concurrently learn, update, and improve the predictive model with new observations at run-time. Stochastic reachability analysis is proposed to identify multiple possibilities of future states and a control scheme that leverages temporal virtual physics inspired by spring-mass systems is proposed to enable safe proactive motion planning. The proposed approach is validated with simulations and experiments involving an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) performing go-to-goal operations in the presence of multiple humans, demonstrating improved performance and effectiveness of online learning when compared to reactive obstacle avoidance approaches.
