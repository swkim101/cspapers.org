Self-supervised video representation methods typically focus on the representation of temporal attributes in videos. However, the role of stationary versus non-stationary attributes is less explored: Stationary features, which remain similar throughout the video, enable the prediction of video-level action classes. Non-stationary features, which represent temporally varying attributes, are more beneficial for downstream tasks involving more fine-grained temporal understanding, such as action segmentation. We argue that a single representation to capture both types of features is sub-optimal, and propose to decompose the representation space into stationary and non-stationary features via contrastive learning from long and short views, i.e. long video sequences and their shorter sub-sequences. Stationary features are shared between the short and long views, while non-stationary features aggregate the short views to match the corresponding long view. To empirically verify our approach, we demonstrate that our stationary features work particularly well on an action recognition downstream task, while our non-stationary features perform better on action segmentation. Furthermore, we analyse the learned representations and find that stationary features capture more temporally stable, static attributes, while non-stationary features encompass more temporally varying ones.
