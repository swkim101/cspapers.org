This paper proposes a multiple stakeholder perspective model (MSPM) which predicts the future pedestrian trajectory observed from vehicle’s point of view. For the vehicle-pedestrian interaction, the estimation of the pedestrian’s intention is a key factor. However, even if this interaction is commonly initiated by both the human (pedestrian) and the agent (driver), current research focuses on developing a neural network trained by the data from driver’s perspective only. In this paper, we suggest a multiple stakeholder perspective model (MSPM) and apply this model for pedestrian intention prediction. The model combines the driver (stakeholder 1) and pedestrian (stakeholder 2) by separating the information based on the perspective. The dataset from pedestrian’s perspective have been collected from the virtual reality experiment, and a network that can reflect perspectives of both pedestrian and driver is proposed. Our model achieves the best performance in the existing pedestrian intention dataset, while reducing the trajectory prediction error by average of 4.48% in the short-term (0.5s) and middle-term (1.0s) prediction, and 11.14% in the long-term prediction (1.5s) compared to the previous state-of-the-art.
