The AP CS A course, taught in high schools in the U.S. and around the globe, is designed to cover the same material as an introductory programming course at the collegiate level. Every May, tens of thousands of high school students sit the AP Computer Science A (AP CS A) exam, testing their introductory programming knowledge and skills. So how would your introductory students perform on this exam? In this special session attendees will receive access to AP CS A multiple choice and free response (coding) questions and have the opportunity to judge whether or not their students could answer the questions correctly. In addition, the presenters will share how each question is mapped to specific Learning Outcomes and expected student skills, much like what must be done for ABET accreditation efforts. Attendees can expect to have their Java programming skills challenged, learn ways to construct exams to meet course learning outcomes, and development of rubrics that reinforce measurement of concept mastery.
