Haptic simulators can help medical students to train and improve their skills before practicing with a real patient. However, the vast majority of needle insertion haptic simulators are based on sophisticated models that are accurate but highly demanding in computing resources. Most of them do not provide haptic feedback and/or are not suitable for haptic control due to their computing time. In this paper, we presented a new low computing consuming method that aims to provide a realistic needle insertion experience to the student. A description of the proposed solution is provided, and it is illustrated by experimental results to highlight its performance.
