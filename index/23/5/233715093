Learning to detect novel objects from few annotated examples is of great practical importance. A particularly challenging yet common regime occurs when there are extremely limited examples (less than three). One critical factor in improving few-shot detection is to address the lack of variation in training data. We propose to build a better model of variation for novel classes by transferring the shared within-class variation from base classes. To this end, we introduce a hallucinator network that learns to generate additional, useful training examples in the region of interest (RoI) feature space, and incorporate it into a modern object detection model. Our approach yields significant performance improvements on two state-of-the-art few-shot detectors with different proposal generation procedures. In particular, we achieve new state of the art in the extremely-few-shot regime on the challenging COCO benchmark.
