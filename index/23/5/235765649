In this paper, we propose a Collaboration of Experts (CoE) framework to pool together the expertise of multiple networks towards a common aim. Each expert is an individual network with expertise on a unique portion of the dataset, which enhances the collective capacity. Given a sample, an expert is selected by the delegator, which simultaneously outputs a rough prediction to support early termination. To fulfill this framework, we propose three modules to impel each model to play its role, namely weight generation module (WGM), label generation module (LGM) and variance calculation module (VCM). Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, 80.7% top-1 accuracy with 194M FLOPs. Combined with PWLU activation function and CondConv, CoE further achieves the accuracy of 80.0% with only 100M FLOPs for the first time. More importantly, our method is hardware friendly and achieves a 3-6x speedup compared with some existing conditional computation approaches.
