It is my great pleasure and honor to welcome you to the program of the 48th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA), the flagship conference of the computer architecture community. For the second year in a row, the conference is going to be virtual, but that has not lowered any excitement about submitting or attending. There is an excellent program that has been selected for the conference.
