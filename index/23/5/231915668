The Go-CHART is a four-wheel, skid-steer robot that resembles a 1:28 scale standard commercial sedan. It is equipped with an onboard sensor suite and both onboard and external computers that replicate many of the sensing and computation capabilities of a full-size autonomous vehicle. The Go-CHART can autonomously navigate a small-scale traffic testbed, responding to its sensor input with programmed controllers. Alternatively, it can be remotely driven by a user who views the testbed through the robot’s four camera feeds, which facilitates safe, controlled experiments on driver interactions with driverless vehicles. We demonstrate the Go-CHART’s ability to perform lane tracking and detection of traffic signs, traffic signals, and other Go-CHARTs in real-time, utilizing an external GPU that runs computationally intensive computer vision and deep learning algorithms.
