Broadening participation in computing touches every aspect of the undergraduate experience. This special session highlights the initiatives undertaken by NCWIT Academic Alliance members who are working to broaden participation in computing. A mix of 3-minute lightning talks, review of resources, and Q&A will provide attendees opportunities to create connections and grapple with implementation issues at their institution. This special session is a reprise of a well-reviewed session from the NCWIT Summit, and will introduce strategies for admission to major, curriculum, pedagogy, teaching assistant selection, and undergraduate research.
