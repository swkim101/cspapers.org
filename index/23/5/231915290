Aerial robotic manipulation is an emergent trend that poses several challenges. To overcome some of these, the DLR cable-Suspended Aerial Manipulator (SAM) has been envisioned. SAM is composed of a fully actuated multi-rotor anchored to a main carrier through a cable and a KUKA LWR attached below the multi-rotor. This work presents a control method to allow SAM, which is a holonomically constrained system, to perform such interaction tasks using a hierarchical control framework. Within this framework, compliance control of the manipulator end-effector is considered to have the highest priority. The second priority is the control of the oscillations induced by, for example, the motion of the arm or physical contact with the environment. A third priority task is related to the internal motion of the manipulator. The proposed approach is validated through simulations and experiments.
