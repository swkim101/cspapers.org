To improve the accuracy of the grasping detection, this paper proposes a novel detector with batch normalization masked evaluation model. It is designed with a two-layer sparse autoencoder, and a Batch Normalization based mask is incorporated into the second layer of the model to effectively reduce the features with weak correlation. The extracted features from such model are more distinctive, which guarantees the higher accuracy of the grasping detection. Extensive experiments show that the proposed evaluation model outperforms the state-of- the-art, and the recognition accuracy can reach 95.51% for robotic grasping detection.
