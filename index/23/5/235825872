Although Label Distribution Learning (LDL) has witnessed extensive classiﬁcation applications, it faces the challenge of objective mismatch – the objective of LDL mismatches that of classiﬁcation, which has seldom been noticed in existing studies. Our goal is to solve the objective mismatch and improve the classiﬁcation performance of LDL. Speciﬁcally, we extend the margin theory to LDL and propose a new LDL method called L abel D istribution L earning M achine (LDLM). First, we deﬁne the label distribution margin and propose the S upport V ector R egression M achine (SVRM) to learn the optimal label. Second, we propose the adaptive margin loss to learn label description degrees. In theoretical analysis, we develop a generalization theory for the SVRM and analyze the generalization of LDLM. Experimental results validate the better classiﬁcation performance of LDLM.
