In order to improve the convenience of operation for the medical assistive devices and reduce the use and maintenance cost, the Aruco recognition technology is applied to the navigation and positioning of visual guided electric assistive devices. Firstly, the differential control kinematic model of the electric wheelchair is analyzed. We discuss the feasibility of Aruco recognition technology in the application of medical assistive devices. The camera on wheelchair captures the Aruco marker data and transmits it to controller. The controller calculates the position and posture information of electric wheelchair, which provides reference for the next movement of electric wheelchair. Combining with the kinematic model of electric wheelchair, this method can realize the navigation and positioning of electric wheelchair. Experiments show that the vision guidance of Electric Wheelchair based on Aruco recognition is accurate, stable, low cost, and can be flexibly applied to the auxiliary equipment of medical institutions.
