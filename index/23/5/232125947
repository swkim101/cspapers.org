COVID-19 caused universities to switch from traditional face-to-face (F2F) course delivery to completely online in Spring 2020. This transition took place on short notice in the middle of the semester. We present results from surveys of students in two CS courses offered at Virginia Tech. Results indicate differing perceptions in the two courses regarding the usefulness of course components before and after the transition for each course. A logistic regression model indicates that for each course, different course components both before and after the transition significantly affect students' preferences for course modality.
