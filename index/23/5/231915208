Robot-assisted retinal surgery has become increasingly prevalent in recent years in part due to the potential for robots to help surgeons improve the safety of an immensely delicate and difficult set of tasks. The integration of robots into retinal surgery has resulted in diminished surgeon perception of tool-to-tissue interaction forces due to robot's stiffness. The tactile perception of these interaction forces (sclera force) has long been a crucial source of feedback for surgeons who rely on them to guide surgical maneuvers and to prevent damaging forces from being applied to the eye. This problem is exacerbated when there are unfavorable sclera forces originating from patient movements (dynamic eyeball manipulation) during surgery which may cause the sclera forces to increase even drastically. In this study we aim at evaluating the efficacy of providing warning auditory feedback based on the level of sclera force measured by force sensing instruments. The intent is to enhance safety during dynamic eye manipulations in robot-assisted retinal surgery. The disturbances caused by lateral movement of patient's head are simulated using a piezo-actuated linear stage. The Johns Hopkins Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER), is then used in a multi-user experiment. Twelve participants are asked to perform a mock retinal surgery by following painted vessels inside an eye phantom using a force sensing instrument while auditory feedback is provided. The results indicate that the users are able to handle the eye motion disturbances while maintaining the sclera forces within safe boundaries when audio feedback is provided.
