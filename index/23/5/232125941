Concurrency and synchronization are two topics that are becoming increasingly important as multicore systems and distributed systems are becoming the norm. However, prior research shows that students struggle with these topics, perhaps partially since they require a good understanding of language semantics and abstract reasoning. To aid students' learning, we developed Progvis to visualize these concepts and let students experiment with them. We also conducted a pilot study of whether the tool helps students to solve synchronization problems, and the results are promising.
