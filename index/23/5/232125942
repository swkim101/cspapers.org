The expense of textbooks is a common source of frustration among students. Furthermore, the lack of affordable textbooks can inadvertently limit who studies computer science. One way educators and faculty can mitigate these issues is through adopting (and writing) free online textbooks. This panel discusses the benefits, challenges, and development practices of free online textbooks. The panelists, who have authored three widely used textbooks, characterize the role of free textbooks in CS education, describe their experiences writing a free textbook, and offer advice to faculty interested in incorporating them into their courses.
