I propose a formalization of pure-strategy subgame perfect equilibria in general continuous-time games. The main idea is to formulate self-enforcing agreements corresponding to a strategic interaction directly, without setting up a whole extensive-form game. My method allows for non-Markov players' behavior, and it does not impose restrictions on players' strategies. The method applies to a broad class of games, including stochastic games, in which arbitrarily many players can have both observable and hidden actions. In many cases, my approach produces tractable and explicit solutions.
