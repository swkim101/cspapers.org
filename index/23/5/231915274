This paper presents an alternative impedance controller for a macro-mini robotic system in which the mini robot is unactuated. The approach is verified experimentally on a simple two-degree-of-freedom macro-mini robot. The dynamic analysis of the robot is first presented. Then, a standard impedance controller is derived and analysed. Such a controller is shown to be experimentally unstable when used with the present macro-mini mechanism. An alternative impedance controller is then proposed and analysed. While slightly more complex than the standard controller, it provides a more stable behaviour experimentally. The alternative controller also increases the effectiveness of the control by reducing the response to high-frequency motion such as hand tremor.
