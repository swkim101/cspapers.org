In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that estimates the pose of the robot end effector using depth vision. The input to our system is the segmented robot hand point cloud from a depth sensor. Then a neural network takes a point cloud as input and outputs the position and orientation of the robot end effector in the camera frame. The estimated pose can serve as the input of the controller of the robot to reach a specific pose in the camera frame. The training process of the neural network takes the simulated rendered point cloud generated from different poses of the robot hand mesh. At test time, one estimation of a single robot hand pose is reduced to 10ms on gpu and 14ms on cpu, which makes it suitable for close loop robot control system that requires to estimate hand pose in an online fashion. We design a robot hand pose estimation experiment to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm working in the real situation. The platform we used includes a Kinova Jaco 2 robot arm and a Kinect v2 depth sensor. We describe all the processes that use vision to improve the accuracy of pose estimation of the robot end-effector. We demonstrate the possibility of using point cloud to directly estimate the robotâ€™s end-effector pose and incorporate the estimated pose into the controller design of the robot arm.
