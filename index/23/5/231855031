Cities today have become highly dense, dynamic living areas for the majority of planet's population and also focal points of innovation, commerce, and growth in a highly modernized world. Due to its intensifying importance, cities need to transform into sustainable, smarter and credible places to enable a tenantable and comfortable life for their citizens. City data, which is the source of our digitized knowledge about the cities, is a highly important element to achive this goal as it is the main input to build complex city ecosystems and to solve particular problems that are encountered in the cities today. In this respect, this workshop will provide a major forum to identify the challenges and opportunities in terms of better managing city data and to reveal its discriminating importance in various applications in a city ecosystem. As city data becomes more widespread and prevailing, it poses novel research problems which importantly are open to the investigation of a broad community of researchers in various fields.
