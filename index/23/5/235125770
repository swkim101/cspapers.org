Face recognition has achieved significant progress in deep learning era due to the ultra-large-scale and well- labeled datasets. However, training on the outsize datasets is time-consuming and takes up a lot of hardware resource. Therefore, designing an efficient training approach is in- dispensable. The heavy computational and memory costs mainly result from the million-level dimensionality of the fully connected (FC) layer. To this end, we propose a novel training approach, termed Faster Face Classification (F2C), to alleviate time and cost without sacrificing the performance. This method adopts Dynamic Class Pool (DCP) for storing and updating the identities' features dy-namically, which could be regarded as a substitute for the FC layer. DCP is efficiently time-saving and cost-saving, as its smaller size with the independence from the whole face identities together. We further validate the proposed F2C method across several face benchmarks and private datasets, and display comparable results, meanwhile the speed is faster than state-of-the-art FC-based methods in terms of recognition accuracy and hardware costs. More-over, our method is further improved by a well-designed dual data loader including indentity-based and instance- based loaders, which makes it more efficient for updating DCP parameters.
