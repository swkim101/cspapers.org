We extend a number of classic results for finite one-to-one matching markets, such as group strategy-proofness, entry comparative statics, and respect for unambiguous improvements, to infinite markets via the compactness theorem of propositional logic. In addition, we show that two versions of the lattice structure of finite one-to-one matching markets carry over to infinite markets. At the same time, we prove that other results, such as weak Pareto optimality and strong stability property, do not extend to infinite markets.
