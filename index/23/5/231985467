Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), a framework of continuous-depth neural networks, have been widely applied, showing exceptional efficacy in coping with representative datasets. Recently, an augmented framework has been developed to overcome some limitations that emerged in the application of the original framework. In this paper, we propose a new class of continuous-depth neural networks with delay, named Neural Delay Differential Equations (NDDEs). To compute the corresponding gradients, we use the adjoint sensitivity method to obtain the delayed dynamics of the adjoint. Differential equations with delays are typically seen as dynamical systems of infinite dimension that possess more fruitful dynamics. Compared to NODEs, NDDEs have a stronger capacity of nonlinear representations. We use several illustrative examples to demonstrate this outstanding capacity. Firstly, we successfully model the delayed dynamics where the trajectories in the lower-dimensional phase space could be mutually intersected and even chaotic in a model-free or model-based manner. Traditional NODEs, without any argumentation, are not directly applicable for such modeling. Secondly, we achieve lower loss and higher accuracy not only for the data produced synthetically by complex models but also for the CIFAR10, a well-known image dataset. Our results on the NDDEs demonstrate that appropriately articulating the elements of dynamical systems into the network design is truly beneficial in promoting network performance.
