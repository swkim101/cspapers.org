Functional nanomaterials possess exceptional multi-physical (e.g., mechanical, electrical and optical) properties compared with their bulk counterparts. To facilitate both synthesis and device applications of these nanomaterials, it is highly desired to characterize their multi-physical properties with high accuracy and efficiency. The nanomanipulation techniques under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has enabled the testing of mechanical and electrical properties of various nanomaterials. However, the seamless integration of mechanical, electrical, and optical testing techniques into an SEM for triple-field-coupled characterization of single nanostructures is still unexplored. In this work, we report the first SEM-based nanomanipulation system for high-resolution mechano-optoelectronic testing of single semiconductor InGaN/GaN nanowires (NWs). A custom-made optical measurement setup was integrated onto a four-probe nanomanipulator inside an SEM, with two optical microfibers actuated by the nanoma-nipulator for NW excitation and emission measurement. A conductive tungsten nanoprobe and a conductive atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever probe were integrated onto the nanomanipulator for electrical nanoprobing of single NWs for electroluminescence (EL) measurement. The AFM probe also served as a force sensor for quantifying the contact force applied to the NW during nanoprobing. Using this unique system, we examined, for the first time, the effect of mechanical compression applied to an InGaN/GaN NW on its optoelectronic properties.
