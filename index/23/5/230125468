Physical Ising machines rely on nature to guide a dynamical system towards an optimal state which can be read out as a heuristical solution to a combinatorial optimization problem. Such designs that use nature as a computing mechanism can lead to higher performance and/or lower operation costs. Quantum annealers are a prominent example of such efforts. However, existing Ising machines are generally bulky and energy intensive. Such disadvantages may be acceptable if these designs provide some significant intrinsic advantages at a much larger scale in the future, which remains to be seen. But for now, integrated electronic designs of Ising machines allow more immediate applications. We propose one such design that uses bistable nodes, coupled with programmable and variable strengths. The design is fully CMOS compatible for on-chip applications and demonstrates competitive solution quality and significantly superior execution time and energy.
