We introduce a new neural network architecture that we call “grid-functioned” neural networks. It utilises a grid structure of network parameterisa-tions that can be specialised for different subdo-mains of the problem, while maintaining smooth, continuous behaviour. The grid gives the user ﬂexibility to prevent gross features from overshad-owing important minor ones. We present a full characterisation of its computational and spatial complexity, and demonstrate its potential, compared to a traditional architecture, over a set of synthetic regression problems. We further illustrate the beneﬁts through a real-world 3D skeletal animation case study, where it offers the same visual quality as a state-of-the-art model, but with lower computational complexity and better con-trol accuracy.
