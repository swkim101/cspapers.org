Compliance is important for humanoid robots, especially a position-controlled one, to perform tasks in complicated environments where unexpected or sudden contacts will result in large impacts which may cause instability or destroy the hardware of robots. This paper presents a compliance control method based on viscoelastic model for humanoid robots to survive on these conditions. The viscoelastic model is used to obtain the relationship between the differential of contact force/torque and linear/angular position. Thus a state equation of this model can be established and a state feedback controller adjusting the position to adapt to the contact force/torque can be designed to realize the compliant movement. The proposed compliance control method based on viscoelastic model has been employed in ankle compliance for stable walking on indefinite uneven terrain and arm compliance for falling protection on BHR-6P, a position-controlled humanoid robot, which validates its effectiveness.
