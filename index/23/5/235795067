 Agriculture is the foundation of human civilization. However, the rapid increase and aging of the global population pose challenges on this cornerstone by demanding more healthy and fresh food. Internet of Things (IoT) technology makes modern autonomous greenhouse a viable and reliable engine of food production. However, the educated and skilled labor capable of overseeing high-tech greenhouses is scarce. Artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing technologies are promising solutions for precision control and high-efficiency production in such controlled environments. In this paper, we propose a smart agriculture solution, namely iGrow: (1) we use IoT and cloud computing technologies to measure, collect, and manage growing data, to support iteration of our decision-making AI module, which consists of an incremental model and an optimization algorithm; (2) we propose a three-stage incremental model based on accumulating data, enabling growers/central computers to schedule control strategies conveniently and at low cost; (3) we propose a model-based iterative optimization algorithm, which can dynamically optimize the greenhouse control strategy in real-time production. In the simulated experiment, evaluation results show the accuracy of our incremental model is comparable to an advanced tomato simulator, while our optimization algorithms can beat the champion of the 2nd Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge. Compelling results from the A/B test in real greenhouses demonstrate that our solution significantly increases production (commercially sellable fruits) (+10.15%) and net profit (+87.07%) with statistical significance compared to planting experts.
