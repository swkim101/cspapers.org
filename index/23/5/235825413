Despite the success of existing tensor factorization methods, most of them conduct a multilin-ear decomposition, and rarely exploit powerful modeling frameworks, like deep neural networks, to capture a variety of complicated interactions in data. More important, for highly expressive, deep factorization, we lack an effective approach to handle streaming data, which are ubiquitous in real-world applications. To address these issues, we propose SBDT, a Streaming Bayesian Deep Tensor factorization method. We ﬁrst use Bayesian neural networks (NNs) to build a deep tensor factorization model. We assign a spike-and-slab prior over each NN weight to encourage sparsity and to prevent overﬁtting. We then use the multivariate delta method and moment matching to approximate the posterior of the NN output and calculate the running model evidence, based on which we develop an efﬁcient streaming posterior inference algorithm in the assumed-density-ﬁltering and expectation propagation framework. Our algorithm provides responsive incremental updates for the posterior of the latent factors and NN weights upon receiving newly observed tensor entries, and meanwhile identify and inhibit redundant/useless weights. We show the advantages of our approach in four real-world applications.
