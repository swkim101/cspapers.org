Sensor-based activity recognition for construction vehicles is useful for evaluating the skills of the operator, measuring work efficiency, and many other use cases. Therefore, many researches have explored robust activity-recognition models. However, it remains a challenge to apply the model to many construction sites because of the imbalance of the dataset. While it is natural to employ multi-label representation on imbalanced data with a large number of activity categories, multi-label robust classification for activity recognition has yet to be resolved because of the nature of the time-series property.In this work, we propose a novel multi-label long short-term memory (LSTM) model, which is effective for the sequence multi-labeling problem. The proposed model has connections to the temporal direction and attribute direction, which exploit both the temporal pattern and co-occurrence among attributes. In addition, by providing a bidirectional connection structure in the attribute direction, the model enables us to alleviate the dependency of the chain order in what we call "classifier chain", which is a classical approach to multi-label classification.To validate our methods, we conduct experiments using real-world construction-vehicle dataset.
