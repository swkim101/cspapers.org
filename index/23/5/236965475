We have developed service robot management system to facilitate effective collaboration between multiple units and types of robots in operation. This system is implemented by serverless architecture on cloud and using cellular based IoT communication. So it has not only usual cloud system advantage that it is not necessary to prepare dedicated server and network equipment, but it reduces management efforts of servers. We have tested the system with robots in a public facility, and successfully confirmed its performance and functionality.
