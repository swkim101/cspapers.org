A robot in the future may initially has a good learning capability but an empty library of movements. It gradually enriches its library of movements through human demonstrations. Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) has been proved to be an effective way to represent trajectories. Trajectories are classified into discrete and rhythmic ones, and parameters are set for each demonstrated trajectory. However, what kind of trajectory will be provided by robot users is sometimes unknown to robot developers, so trajectory pattern and the parameters can not be determined in advance. It's also impossible for non-technical robot users to set these parameters and determine the pattern of movements they are going to demonstrate. To make it easier for non-expert robot users to programme their robots by demonstration, this work presents an efficient way to deal with these two problems. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is proved by teaching a robot to clean the whiteboard in different ways and stack a set of cubic boxes in specific order.
