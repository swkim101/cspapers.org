Production plants are being re-designed to implement human-centered solutions. Especially considering high added-value operations, robots are required to optimize their behavior to achieve a task quality at least comparable to the one obtained by the skilled operators. A manual programming and tuning of the manipulator is not an efficient solution, requiring to adopt towards automated strategies. Adding external sensors (e.g., cameras) increases the robotic cell complexity and it doesnâ€™t solve the issue since it is usually difficult to build explicit reward functions measuring the robot performance, while it is easier for the user to define a qualitative comparison between two experiments. According to these needs, in this paper, the recently-developed preferences-based optimization approach GLISp is employed and adapted to tune the novel developed path-based velocity planner. The implemented solution defines an intuitive human-centered procedure, capable of transferring (through pairwise preferences between experiments) the task knowledge from the operator to the manipulator. A Franka EMIKA panda robot has been employed as a test platform to perform a robotic sealing task (i.e., material deposition task), validating the proposed methodology. The proposed approach has been compared with a programming by demonstration approach, and with the manual tuning of the path-based velocity planner. Achieved results demonstrate the improved deposition quality obtained with the proposed optimized path-based velocity planner methodology in a limited number of experimental trials (20).
