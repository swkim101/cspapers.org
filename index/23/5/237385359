We present Gradient Activation Maps (GAM) - a machinery for explaining predictions made by visual similarity and classification models. By gleaning localized gradient and activation information from multiple network layers, GAM offers improved visual explanations, when compared to existing alternatives. The algorithmic advantages of GAM are explained in detail, and validated empirically, where it is shown that GAM outperforms its alternatives across various tasks and datasets.
