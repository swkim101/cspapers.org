The explosive growth of fake news along with destructive effects on politics, economy, and public safety has increased the demand for fake news detection. Fake news on social media does not exist independently in the form of an article. Many other entities, such as news creators, news subjects, and so on, exist on social media and have relationships with news articles. Different entities and relationships can be modeled as a heterogeneous information network (HIN). In this paper, we attempt to solve the fake news detection problem with the support of a news-oriented HIN. We propose a novel fake news detection framework, namely Adversarial Active Learning-based Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AA-HGNN) which employs a novel hierarchical attention mechanism to perform node representation learning in the HIN. AA-HGNN utilizes an active learning framework to enhance learning performance, especially when facing the paucity of labeled data. An adversarial selector will be trained to query high-value candidates for the active learning framework. When the adversarial active learning is completed, AA-HGNN detects fake news by classifying news article nodes. Experiments with two real-world fake news datasets show that our model can outperform text-based models and other graph-based models when using less labeled data benefiting from the adversarial active learning. As a model with generalizability, AA-HGNN also has the ability to be widely used in other node classification-related applications on heterogeneous graphs.
