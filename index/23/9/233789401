KickVR is a training simulation designed to teach self-defense. With realistic training and a user-friendly guide, its aim is to help users learn how to better defend themselves in the real-world. Although the chances of being in a scenario where one may need self-defense are relatively low, self-defense is an important skill to have. The goal is to enable users to learn self-defense even if they do not have the time to attend in-person classes or do not have self-defense classes in their region. Virtual reality provides convenient access to self-defense training for users in their own homes. It also provides the feeling of realism by implementing the use of hand-tracking. The user’s real-world hands are rendered for the self-defense simulation rather than using Oculus hand controllers. This document will cover the current implemented features of KickVR and oﬀer suggestions on areas of improvement based on an internal and external evaluation of software limitations.
