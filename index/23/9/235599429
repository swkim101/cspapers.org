In this paper, we present LATTE, a novel framework that proposes MU-MIMO group selection optimization for multi-user video streaming over IEEE 802.11ac. Taking a cross-layer approach, LATTE first optimizes the MU-MIMO user group selection for the users with the same characteristics in the PHY/MAC layer. It then optimizes the video bitrate for each group accordingly. We present our design and its evaluation on smartphones over 802.11ac WiFi.
