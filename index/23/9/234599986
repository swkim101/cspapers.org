We introduce and formalize a concept of a maintenance commitment, a kind of social commitment characterized by states whose truthhood an agent commits to maintain. This concept of maintenance commitments enables us to capture a richer variety of real-world scenarios than possible using achievement commitments with a temporal condition. By developing a rule-based operational semantics, we study the relationship between agents' achievement and maintenance goals, achievement commitments, and maintenance commitments. We motivate a notion of coherence which captures alignment between an agents' achievement and maintenance cognitive and social constructs, and prove that, under specified conditions, the goals and commitments of both rational agents individually and of a multiagent system are coherent.
