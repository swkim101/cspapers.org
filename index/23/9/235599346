We advocate ThingSpire OS, a new IoT operating system based on WebAssembly for cloud-edge integration. By design, WebAssembly is considered as the first-class citizen in ThingSpire OS to achieve coherent execution among IoT device, edge and cloud. Furthermore, ThingSpire OS enables efficient execution of WebAssembly on resource-constrained devices by implementing a WebAssembly runtime based on Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation with a small footprint, achieves seamless inter-module communication wherever the modules locate, and leverages several optimizations such as lightweight preemptible invocation for memory isolation and control-flow integrity. We implement a prototype of ThingSpire OS and conduct preliminary evaluations on its inter-module communication performance.
