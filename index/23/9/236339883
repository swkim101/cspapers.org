Water plays a significant role among other existing natural resources. The daily demand for water supplies is increasingly on the rise as the population grows. To minimize the consumption of water in irrigation, several proposals were suggested. The currently existing system known as the automated irrigation system for effective water resource use with the prediction of the weather (AISWP) functions with a single farm that lacks the reliability in the precision of weather forecasting. So, a robot-based irrigation system has been proposed to improve the performance of the system. To minimize the water usage for crops, an automated irrigation system has been developed which irrigates the field in acres. An additional characteristic of the system has also been given for the soil pH measurement to allow the use of fertilizers accordingly. The solar-powered robot is managed wirelessly by a designated application. The robot is attached with various sensors and with a highresolution camera that tests crop conditions and senses the soil state. The application has been created to provide information about the soilâ€™s condition such as temperature level, humidity level, water level, and level of nutrients to the PC/Laptop with the real-time values via the GSM module.
