We study the problem of estimating the size of maximum matching and minimum vertex cover in sub linear time. Denoting the number of vertices by <tex>$n$</tex> and the average degree in the graph by <tex>$\overline{d}$</tex>, we obtain the following results for both problems which are all provably time-optimal up to polylogarithmic factors: <sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>The <tex>$\tilde{O}(\cdot)$</tex> notation hides polylog <tex>$n$</tex> factors throughout the paper. •A multiplicative <tex>$(2+\varepsilon)$</tex> -approximation that takes <tex>$\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^{2})$</tex> time using adjacency list queries. •A multiplicative-additive <tex>$(2,\ \varepsilon n)$</tex> -approximation that takes <tex>$\tilde{O}((\overline{d}+1)/\varepsilon^{2})$</tex> time using adjacency list queries. •A multiplicative-additive <tex>$(2,\ \varepsilon n)$</tex> -approximation that takes <tex>$\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^{3})$</tex> time using adjacency matrix queries. Our main contribution and the key ingredient of the bounds above is a near-tight analysis of the average query complexity of randomized greedy maximal matching which improves upon a seminal result of Yoshida, Yamamoto, and Ito <tex>$[\text{STOC}^{\prime} 09]$</tex>.
