Deformable solid objects such as clay or dough are prevalent in industrial and home environments. However, robotic manipulation of such objects has largely remained unexplored in literature due to the high complexity involved in representing and modeling their deformation. This work addresses the problem of shaping elasto-plastic dough by proposing to use a novel elastic end-effector to roll dough in a reinforcement learning framework. The transition model for the end-effector-to-dough interactions is learned from one hour of robot exploration, and doughs of different hydration levels are rolled out into varying lengths. Experimental results are encouraging, with the proposed framework accomplishing the task of rolling out dough into a specified length with 60% fewer actions than a heuristic method. Furthermore, we show that estimating stiffness using the soft end-effector can be used to effectively initialize models, improving robot performance by approximately 40% over incorrect model initialization.
