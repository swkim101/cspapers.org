This paper presents a Simple and effective unsupervised adaptation method for Robust Object Detection (SimROD). To overcome the challenging issues of domain shift and pseudo-label noise, our method integrates a novel domain-centric data augmentation, a gradual self-labeling adaptation procedure, and a teacher-guided fine-tuning mechanism. Using our method, target domain samples can be leveraged to adapt object detection models without changing the model architecture or generating synthetic data. When applied to image corruptions and high-level cross-domain adaptation benchmarks, our method outperforms prior baselines on multiple domain adaptation benchmarks. SimROD achieves new state-of-the-art on standard real-to-synthetic and cross-camera setup benchmarks. On the image corruption benchmark, models adapted with our method achieved a relative robustness improvement of 15-25% AP50 on Pascal-C and 5-6% AP on COCO-C and Cityscapes-C. On the cross-domain benchmark, our method outperformed the best baseline performance by up to 8% and 4% AP50 on Comic and Watercolor respectively.1
