This paper describes our experiences in developing a prototype of electronic commerce application using both HTML and VoiceXML languages. This virtual shop allows a customer to use her voice in input and see the results of her request on her PC screen, but also to interact on a traditional web form, and hear on her phone the effects of this action.
