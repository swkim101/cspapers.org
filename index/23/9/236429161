Modern desktop applications involve many asynchronous,concurrent interactions that make performance issues difﬁcult to diagnose. Although prior work has used causal tracing for de-bugging performance issues in distributed systems, we ﬁnd that these techniques suffer from high inaccuracies for desktop applications. We present Argus, a fast, effective causal tracing tool for debugging performance anomalies in desktop applications. Argus introduces a novel notion of strong and weak edges to explicitly model and annotate trace graph ambiguities, a new beam-search-based diagnosis algorithm to select the most likely causal paths in the presence of ambiguities, and a new way to compare causal paths across normal and abnormal executions. We have implemented Argus across multiple versions of macOS and evaluated it on 12 infamous spinning pinwheel issues in popular macOS applications. Argus diag-nosedthe rootcauses forallissues,10 ofwhichwere previously unknown, some of which have been open for several years. Ar-gus incurs less than 5% CPU overhead when its system-wide tracing is enabled, making always-on tracing feasible.
