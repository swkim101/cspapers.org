Storage management in virtualized environments is considered as one of the biggest cost factors. According to some estimates, majority of the cost and performance problems are related to storage devices. In this tutorial, we will discuss some of the key storage technologies deployed in virtual datacenters. We will discuss a set of unique challenges faced by administrators and users due to increasing number of layers of abstraction. Next we will discuss some tools and techniques to do workload characterization and monitor devices in order to understand and trouble-shoot IO problems. We will also present some of the recent solutions proposed by industry and academia to handle these problems followed by upcoming technological trends and directions for future research.
