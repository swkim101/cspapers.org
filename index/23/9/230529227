Probiotic cellular components could be an interesting alternative to live
probiotics, which could potentially cause safety problems in open aquatic environments.



The cell wall (CW), peptidoglycan (PG) and lipoteichoic (LTA) were extracted from
probiotic strain of Bacillus pumilus SE5, and these biomolecules were used to develop the possible
application in fish aquaculture.



Grouper (Epinephelus coioides) juveniles were fed with either a basal control diet or the
basal diet supplemented with CW, PG and LTA respectively for 60 days, and the growth performance,
digestive enzymes activities, serum immune responses and immune genes expression in
head kidney were determined.



Dietary supplement PG and LTA significantly improved final body weight (FBW), weight
gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER), while significantly
decreased feed conversion ratio (FCR) was noticed in all the treatments compared with the control
group. Dietary supplements of CW, PG and LTA enhanced the activities of trypsin, lipase and amylase
in the liver. Serum complement C3 and IgM levels as well as, AKP, ACP and SOD activities
elevated significantly in fish fed the PG and LTA containing diets. Furthermore, PG and LTA containing
diets, significantly up-regulated expression of TLR2, NOD2, IL-8, IgM and three antibacterial
peptides genes (epinecidin-1, hepcidin-1 and Î²-defensin) in the head kidney.



PG and LTA originated from probiotic B. pumilus SE5 could effectively enhance the
growth performance, feed utilization, digestive ability and boost innate and adaptive immune system
of E. coioides.
