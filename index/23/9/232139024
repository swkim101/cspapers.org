Scientific-style figures are commonly used on the web to present numerical information. Captions that tell accurate figure information and sound natural would significantly improve figure accessibility. In this paper, we present promising results on machine figure captioning. A recent corpus analysis of real-world captions reveals that machine figure captioning systems should start by generating accurate caption units. We formulate the caption unit generation problem as a controlled captioning problem. Given a caption unit type as a control signal, a model generates an accurate caption unit of that type. As a proof-of-concept on single bar charts, we propose a model, FigJAM, that achieves this goal through utilizing metadata information and a joint static and dynamic dictionary. Quantitative evaluations with two datasets from the figure question answering task show that our model can generate more accurate caption units than competitive baseline models. A user study with ten human experts confirms the value of machine-generated caption units in their standalone accuracy and naturalness. Finally, a post-editing simulation study demonstrates the potential for models to paraphrase and stitch together single-type caption units into multi-type captions by learning from data.
