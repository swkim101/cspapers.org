Scores of papers show, given some robots, how to improve the useful work they perform. Continuing this line, we consider the efficiency of robot experiments by examining the feasibility of conducting several experiments simultaneously, interleaving execution and sharing resources between them. This paper lays theoretical groundwork for that concept and demonstrates its feasibility and utility.
