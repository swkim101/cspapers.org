Deblurring night blurry images is difficult, because the common-used blur model based on the linear convolution operation does not hold in this situation due to the influence of saturated pixels. In this paper, we propose a non-blind deblurring network (NBDN) to restore night blurry images. To mitigate the side effects brought by the pixels that violate the blur model, we develop a confidence estimation unit (CEU) to estimate a map which ensures smaller contributions of these pixels in the deconvolution steps which are optimized by the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Moreover, unlike the existing methods using manually tuned hyper-parameters in their frameworks, we propose a hyper-parameter estimation unit (HPEU) to adaptively estimate hyper-parameters for better image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively.
