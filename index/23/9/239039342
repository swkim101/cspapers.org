We investigate a novel deep-learning-based approach to estimate uncertainty in stereo disparity prediction networks. Current state-of-the-art methods often formulate disparity prediction as a regression problem with a single scalar output in each pixel. This can be problematic in practical applications as in many cases there might not exist a single well defined disparity, for example in cases of occlusions or at depth-boundaries. While current neural-network-based disparity estimation approaches obtain good performance on benchmarks, the disparity prediction is treated as a black box at inference time. In this paper we show that by formulating the learning problem as a regression with a distribution target, we obtain a robust estimate of the uncertainty in each pixel, while maintaining the performance of the original method. The proposed method is evaluated both on a large-scale standard benchmark, as well on our own data. We also show that the uncertainty estimate significantly improves by maximizing the uncertainty in those pixels that have no well defined disparity during learning.
