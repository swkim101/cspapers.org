We investigate how a population of end-users with especially salient security and privacy risks — sex workers — conceptualizes and manages their digital safety. The commercial sex industry is increasingly Internet-mediated. As such, sex workers are facing new challenges in protecting their digital privacy and security and avoiding serious consequences such as stalking, blackmail, and social exclusion. Through interviews ( n =29) and a survey ( n =65) with sex workers in European countries where sex work is legal and regulated, we ﬁnd that sex workers have well-deﬁned safety goals and clear awareness of the risks to their safety: clients, deﬁcient legal protections, and hostile digital platforms. In response to these risks, our participants developed complex strategies for protecting their safety, but use few tools speciﬁcally designed for security and privacy. Our results suggest that if even high-risk users with clear risk conceptions view existing tools as insufﬁciently effective to merit the cost of use, these tools are not actually addressing their real security needs. Our ﬁndings underscore the importance of more holistic design of security tools to address both online and ofﬂine axes of safety.
