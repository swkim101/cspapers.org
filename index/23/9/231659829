This paper presents a novel approach for developing robotic grippers with variable stiffness hinges for dexterous grasps. This approach for the first time uses pneumatically actuated pouch actuators to fold and unfold morphable flaps of flexure hinges thus change stiffness of the hinge. By varying the air pressure in pouch actuators, the flexure hinge morphs into a beam with various open sections while the flaps bend, enabling stiffness variation of the flexure hinge. This design allows 3D printing of the flexure hinge using printable soft filaments. Utilizing the variable stiffness flexure hinges as the joints of robotic fingers, a light-weight and low-cost two-fingered tendon driven robotic gripper is developed. The stiffness variation caused due to the shape morphing of flexure hinges is studied by conducting static tests on fabricated hinges with different flap angles and on a flexure hinge with flaps that are bent by pouch actuators subjected to various pressures. Multiple grasp modes of the two-fingered gripper are demonstrated by grasping objects with various geometric shapes. The gripper is then integrated with a robot manipulator in a teleoperation setup for conducting a pick-and-place operation in a confined environment.
