A video can be represented by the composition of appearance and motion. Appearance (or content) expresses the information invariant throughout time, and motion describes the time-variant movement. Here, we propose self-supervised approaches for video Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to achieve the appearance consistency and motion coherency in videos. Specifically, the dual discriminators for image and video individually learn to solve their own pretext tasks; appearance contrastive learning and temporal structure puzzle. The proposed tasks enable the discriminators to learn representations of appearance and temporal context, and force the generator to synthesize videos with consistent appearance and natural flow of motions. Extensive experiments in facial expression and human action public benchmarks show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art video GANs. Moreover, consistent improvements regardless of the architecture of video GANs confirm that our framework is generic.
