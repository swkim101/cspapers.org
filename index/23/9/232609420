Due to recent advances in knowledge-based systems technology it is suggested that students in a systems development course be given exposure to the concept of designing and implementing knowledge-based systems.
The purpose of this paper is to describe the objective, scope, methods and procedures of knowledge-based projects. The first half of the paper introduces the knowledge-based approach and describes the structure and components of such a system. The second half of the paper deals with course design procedures. The scope, topics, project characteristics and experiences pertaining to such a project are covered here.
A practical Knowledge-based Systems Development Life Cycle (KSDLC) is also proposed for use in such a course. It is a suitable methodology as it resembles the traditional Systems Development Life Cycle.
