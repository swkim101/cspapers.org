Welcome to the 8th International Workshop on Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE 2015), collocated with ICSE 2015. 
 
Software is created for and with a wide range of stakeholders, from customers to management, from value-added providers to customer service personnel. These stakeholders work with teams of software engineers to develop and evolve software systems that support their activities. All of these people and their interactions are central to software development. Thus, it is crucial to investigate the dynamic and frequently changing Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE), both before and after deployment, in order to understand current software practices, processes, and tools. In turn, this enables us to design tools and support mechanisms that improve software creation, software maintenance, and customer communication. 
 
This workshop provides a unified forum for discussing high quality research studies, models, methods, and tools for human and cooperative aspects of software engineering. The series of CHASE workshops continue to be a meeting place for the academic, industrial, and practitioner communities interested in this area, and provide an opportunity to present and discuss works-in-progress.
