Despite the recent progress, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) are largely unsolved for agile micro autonomous underwater vehicles (µAUVs). Hereby, robust and accurate self-localization systems which fit µAUVs play a key role and their absence constitutes a severe bottleneck in micro underwater robotics research. In this work we present, first, a small-size low-cost high performance vision-based self-localization module which solves this bottleneck even for the requirements of highly agile robot platforms. Second, we present its integration into a powerful GNC-framework which allows the deployment of µAUVs in fully autonomous mission. Finally, we critically evaluate the performance of the localization system and the GNC-framework in two experimental scenarios.
