We prove normalization for (univalent, Cartesian) cubical type theory, closing the last major open problem in the syntactic metatheory of cubical type theory. Our normalization result is reduction-free, in the sense of yielding a bijection between equivalence classes of terms in context and a tractable language of β/η-normal forms. As corollaries we obtain both decidability of judgmental equality and the injectivity of type constructors.
