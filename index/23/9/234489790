The method of steganography commonly used to hide data or information is Least Significant Bit (LSB) method. One of the relevant research is LSB using sequential Encoding Decoding by David Pipkorn and Preston Weisbrot. In this research, an analysis of the LSB method using Sequential Encoding Decoding by doing some testing. The tests are on the aspect of message security using tools StegSpy and enhanced LSB algorithm, testing on image quality by calculating the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) value and see the image histogram, testing on robustness of message by doing some image processing operations on stego image, like cropping, rotating, and etc, and then testing on capacity to check size of cover image and stego image and calculates the maximum size of data that can be hidden. From the testing process, we know that there are deficiencies in the aspects of security, robustness and capacity of a message. And then in this research we try to change the location of messages that are hidden in the image bits, which previous research used the 8th bit of each bytes, changed to the 7th bit. To be able to correct deficiencies in the security aspect. After repairing and testing like before, obtained better results in the security aspect. This can be seen from the image of the enhanced LSB algorithm process, the message is not detected, but unfortunately the image quality is reduced, with the low PSNR value generated.
