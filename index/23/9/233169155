We study dynamic matching in a spatial setting. Drivers are distributed at random on some interval. Riders arrive in some (possibly adversarial) order at randomly drawn points. The platform observes the location of the drivers and can match newly arrived riders immediately or can wait for more riders to arrive. Unmatched riders incur a waiting cost of c per period. Furthermore, the platform can match riders and drivers irrevocably, and the cost of matching a driver to a rider is equal to the distance between them. Our goal is to investigate the value of 'slack supply'. For this purpose, we ask two questions: (1) What is the performance of a naive algorithm with extra drivers? and (2) How does this compare to the performance of a smart algorithm, but without the extra drivers? We prove that a naive algorithm with extra drivers performs better than the ex-post optimal algorithm in a balanced market. With n riders and drivers in the system, even the ex-post optimal matching does not have a cost less than Θ(√n). However, when there are (1+ε) drivers per rider (for any ε > 0$), the cost of matching by the greedy algorithm, which pairs each arriving rider to the closest available driver, is O(log(n)). In particular, if in total there are O(n5/6) excess drivers, then the greedy algorithm has a cost of o(√n) and hence beats the optimal algorithm. Our results shed light on the critical role of (small) excess supply in spatial matching markets.
