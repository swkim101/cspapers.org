This demonstration will showcase our efforts to develop a radio access network (RAN) slicing mechanism that is controllable via management software in an Open RAN framework. To our knowledge, our work represents the first effort that combines an open source Open RAN framework with an open source mobility stack, provides a top-to-bottom RAN application via the RAN intelligent control (RIC) provided by that framework and illustrates its functionality in a realistic wireless environment. Our software is publicly available and we provide a profile in the POWDER platform to enable others to replicate and build on our work.
