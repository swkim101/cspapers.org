Availability and security problems in cellular emergency call systems can cost people their lives, yet this topic has not been thoroughly researched. Based on our proposed Seed-Assisted Specification method, we start to investigate this topic by looking closely into one emergency call failure case in China. Using what we learned from the case as prior knowledge, we build a formal model of emergency call systems with proper granularity. By running model checking, four public-unaware scenarios where emergency calls cannot be correctly routed are discovered. Additionally, we extract configurations of two major U.S. carriers and incorporate them as model constraints into the model. Based on the augmented model, we find two new attacks leveraging the privileges of emergency calls. Finally, we present a solution with marginal overhead to resolve issues we can foresee.
