Deep learning on 3D point clouds has drawn much attention, due to its large variety of applications in intelligent perception for automated and robotic systems. Unlike structured 2D images, it is challenging to extract features and implement convolutional networks over these unordered points. Although a number of previous works achieved high accuracies for point cloud recognition, they tend to process local point information in such a way that semantic information is not fully encoded. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network for 3D point cloud processing that utilizes effective feature aggregation methods emphasizing both generalizability and relevance. In particular, our method uses fixed-radius grouping for pooling layers and spherical kernel convolution for semantics mining. To address the issue of gradient degradation and memory consumption of a deep network, a parallel feature feed-forward mechanism and bottleneck layers are implemented to reduce the number of parameters. Experiments show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results and competitive accuracy in both classification and part segmentation while maintaining an efficient architecture.
