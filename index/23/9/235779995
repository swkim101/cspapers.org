The CAN (Controller Area Network) signals transmitted in vehicles have great analytical value with the quick development of complex automotive software. The boom in big data creates an opportunity to transmit CAN signals from the in-vehicle network to the big data cloud platform, through which the signal analysis can be conducted. The signals are transmitted from the in-vehicle network to TelematicsBOX via CAN bus and then sent to the big data cloud platform. When using the CAN bus for signal transmission of the in-vehicle network, signals larger than 1 byte need to be unpacked into several 1-byte signals. The general solution of automotive software manufacturers usually uses the model-based development method to unpack the CAN signals, but such method is inefficient. To solve this problem, we develop a CAN signal unpacking tool called AutoToolCSU, which is based on a configured template through a GUI (Graphical User Interface). Compared to the model-based development method, AutoToolCSU not only greatly improves the development efficiency of CAN signal unpacking but also interfaces with the standard development processes of automotive software manufacturers.
