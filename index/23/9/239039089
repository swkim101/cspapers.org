Electromyography (EMG) is a wearable, noninvasive, commonly used method for measuring the human muscular activations from the surface of the skin. In this work, we present a pilot study that focuses on the formulation of a shared control framework to facilitate the simplified execution of Electromyography (EMG) based telemanipulation tasks with a robotic platform. The framework combines a Random Forests (RF) regression method with a compliance controller that relies on the force measurements collected with a force-torque sensor. The RF regression efficiently maps the myoelectric activations of the human muscles to corresponding human wrist positions. Then, a teleoperation process is used to control the robot arm end-effectorâ€™s position, utilizing the human wrist position estimations. The examined application involves semi-autonomous cleaning of a whiteboard surface with the proposed framework. The compliance controller guarantees that a desired contact force will always be maintained on the whiteboard surface during task execution. This ensures that any EMG based decoding inaccuracies will not drive the robot away from the cleaning plane. Essentially, the system projects the EMG based estimation on the cleaning plane. The shared control framework offers robust performance, with minimal training and calibration required.
