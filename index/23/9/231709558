Recently, some approaches are proposed to harness deep convolutional networks to facilitate superpixel segmentation. The common practice is to first evenly divide the image into a pre-defined number of grids and then learn to associate each pixel with its surrounding grids. However, simply applying a series of convolution operations with limited receptive fields can only implicitly perceive the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids. Consequently, existing methods often fail to provide an effective context when inferring the association map. To remedy this issue, we propose a novel Association Implantation (AI) module to enable the network to explicitly capture the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids. The proposed AI module directly implants the grid features to the surrounding of its corresponding central pixel, and conducts convolution on the padded window to adaptively transfer knowledge between them. With such an implantation operation, the network could explicitly harvest the pixel-grid level context, which is more in line with the target of superpixel segmentation comparing to the pixelwise relation. Furthermore, to pursue better boundary precision, we design a boundary-perceiving loss to help the network discriminate the pixels around boundaries in hidden feature level, which could benefit the subsequent inferring modules to accurately identify more boundary pixels. Extensive experiments on BSDS500 and NYUv2 datasets show that our method could achieve state-of-the-art performance.
