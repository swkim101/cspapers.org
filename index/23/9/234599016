Much of the theory for classical sparse recovery is based on conditions on the dictionary that are both necessary and sufﬁcient (e.g., nullspace property) or only sufﬁcient (e.g., incoherence and restricted isometry). In contrast, much of the theory for subspace-preserving recovery , the theoretical underpinnings for sparse subspace classiﬁcation and clustering methods, is based on conditions on the subspaces and the data that are only sufﬁ-cient (e.g., subspace incoherence and data inner-radius). This paper derives a necessary and sufﬁ-cient condition for subspace-preserving recovery that is inspired by the classical nullspace property. Based on this novel condition, called here the sub-space nullspace property , we derive equivalent characterizations that either admit a clear geometric interpretation that relates data distribution and subspace separation to the recovery success, or can be veriﬁed using a ﬁnite set of extreme points of a properly deﬁned set. We further exploit these characterizations to derive new sufﬁcient conditions, based on inner-radius and outer-radius measures and dual bounds, that generalize existing conditions and preserve the geometric interpretations. These results ﬁll an important gap in the subspace-preserving recovery literature.
