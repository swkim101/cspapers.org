Autonomous vehicles must balance a complex set of objectives. There is no consensus on how they should do so, nor on a model for specifying a desired driving behavior. We created a dataset to help address some of these questions in a limited operating domain. The data consists of 92 traffic scenarios, with multiple ways of traversing each scenario. Multiple annotators expressed their preference between pairs of scenario traversals. We used the data to compare an instance of a rulebook [1], carefully hand-crafted independently of the dataset, with several interpretable machine learning models such as Bayesian networks, decision trees, and logistic regression trained on the dataset. To compare driving behavior, these models use scores indicating by how much different scenario traversals violate each of 14 driving rules. The rules are interpretable and designed by subject-matter experts. First, we found that these rules were enough for these models to achieve a high classification accuracy on the dataset. Second, we found that the rulebook provides high interpretability without excessively sacrificing performance. Third, the data pointed to possible improvements in the rulebook and the rules, and to potential new rules. Fourth, we explored the interpretability vs performance trade-off by also training non-interpretable models such as a random forest. Finally, we make the dataset publicly available to encourage a discussion from the wider community on behavior specification for AVs. Please find it at github.com/bassam-motional/Reasonable-Crowd.
