In this paper, we propose a novel iterative learning control (ILC) scheme for precise state tracking of pneumatic muscle (PM) actuators. Two critical issues are considered in our scheme: 1) state constraints on PM position and velocity; 2) uncertainties of the PM model. Based on the three-element form, a PM model is constructed that takes both parametric and nonparametric uncertainties into consideration. By introducing the composite energy function (CEF) approach incorporated with a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), full state constraints of PM will not be violated and uncertainties are effectively compensated. Through rigorous analysis, we show that under proposed ILC scheme, uniform convergence of PM state tracking errors are guaranteed. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed scheme.
