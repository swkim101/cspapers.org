This work introduces a highly-scalable spectral graph densification framework for learning resistor networks with linear measurements, such as node voltages and currents. We prove that given O(logN) pairs of voltage and current measurements, it is possible to recover ultra-sparse N-node resistor networks which can well preserve the effective resistance distances on the graph. In addition, the learned graphs also preserve the structural (spectral) properties of the original graph, which can potentially be leveraged in many circuit design and optimization tasks. We show that the proposed graph learning approach is equivalent to solving the classical graphical Lasso problems with Laplacian-like precision matrices. Through extensive experiments for a variety of real-world test cases, we show that the proposed approach is highly scalable for learning ultrasparse resistor networks without sacrificing solution quality.
