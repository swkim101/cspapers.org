—We study and extend Route Origin Validation (ROV), the basis for the IETF defenses of interdomain routing. We focus on two important hijack attacks: subpreﬁx hijacks and non-routed preﬁx hijacks . For both attacks, we show that, with partial deployment, ROV provides disappointing security beneﬁts. We also present a new attack, superpreﬁx hijacks , which completely circumvent ROV’s defense for non-routed preﬁx hijacks. We then present ROV++, a novel extension of ROV, with signiﬁcantly improved security beneﬁts even with partial adoption. For example, with uniform 5% adoption for edge ASes (ASes with no customers or peers), ROV prevents less than 5% of subpreﬁx hijacks, while ROV++ prevents more than 90% of subpreﬁx hijacks. ROV++ also defends well against non-routed preﬁx attacks and the novel superpreﬁx attacks. We evaluated several ROV++ variants, all sharing the improvements in defense; this includes “Lite”, software-only variants, deployable with existing routers. Our evaluation is based on extensive simulations over the Internet topology. We also expose an obscure yet important aspect of BGP, much ampliﬁed by ROV: inconsistencies between the observable BGP path (control-plane) and the actual trafﬁc ﬂows (data-plane). These inconsistencies are highly relevant for security, and often lead to a challenge we refer to as hidden hijacks
