Given a subset A of the n-dimensional Boolean hypercube Fn2 , the sumset A + A is the set {a + a : a, a ∈ A} where addition is in Fn2 . Sumsets play an important role in additive combinatorics, where they feature in many central results of the field. The main result of this paper is a sublinear-time algorithm for the problem of sumset size estimation. In more detail, our algorithm is given oracle access to (the indicator function of) an arbitrary A ⊆ Fn2 and an accuracy parameter ε > 0, and with high probability it outputs a value 0 ≤ v ≤ 1 that is ±ε-close to Vol(A + A) for some perturbation A ⊆ A of A satisfying Vol(A \A′) ≤ ε. It is easy to see that without the relaxation of dealing with A rather than A, any algorithm for estimating Vol(A + A) to any nontrivial accuracy must make 2 queries. In contrast, we give an algorithm whose query complexity depends only on ε and is completely independent of the ambient dimension n.
