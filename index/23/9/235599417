This work presents the design and implementation of TyrLoc, an accurate multi-technology switching MIMO localization system that can be deployed on low-cost SDRs. TyrLoc only uses a single RF Chain to switch on each antenna in an antenna array within the coherence time asynchronously, thus mimicking a MIMO platform to pinpoint the positions of WIFI, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and LoRa devices. TyrLoc makes three key technical contributions. First, TyrLoc modifies the firmware of inexpensive PlutoSDR that controls the antenna switching pattern and tags the signal associated with each antenna. Second, it develops a two-stage fine-grained carrier frequency offset (CFO) calibration algorithm that harnesses the agile antenna switching pattern and is 10Ã— more accurate than the baseline method. Third, TyrLoc employs an interpolated transform approach to facilitate angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation in the presence of missing antennas. The AoA-based localization experiments in a multipath-rich indoor environment show that TyrLoc with eight antennas achieves the median errors of 63cm for WIFI, 39cm for BLE and 32cm for LoRa, respectively.
