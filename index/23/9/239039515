In this paper, we present an autonomous RGB-D and 2D ultrasound-guided robotic system for collecting 3D localized volumes of peripheral vessels. This compact design, with available commercial components, lends itself to platform utility throughout the human body. The fully integrated system works with force limits for future safety in human use. We propose a PID force controller for smooth and safe robot scanning following a priori 3D trajectory generated from a surface point cloud. System calibration is implemented to determine transformations among sensors, end-effector and robot base. A vascular localization pipeline that consists of detection and tracking is proposed to find the 3D vessel positions in real-time. Precision tests are performed with both predesignated and autonomously selected areas in an arm phantom. The average variance of the autonomously collected ultrasound images (to construct 3D volumes) between repeated tests is shown to be around 0.3 mm, similar to the theoretical spatial resolution a clinical ultrasound system. This fully integrated system demonstrates the capability of autonomous collection of peripheral vessels with built-in safety measures for future human testing.
