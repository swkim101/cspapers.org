Saturated cost partitioning and post-hoc optimization are two powerful cost partitioning algorithms for optimal classical planning. The main idea of saturated cost partitioning is to give each considered heuristic only the fraction of remaining operator costs that it needs to prove its estimates. We show how to apply this idea to post-hoc optimization and obtain a heuristic that dominates the original both in theory and on the IPC benchmarks.
