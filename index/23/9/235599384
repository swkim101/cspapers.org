Latency is a major issue towards practical use of augmented reality (AR) in mobile apps such as navigation and gaming. A string of work has appeared recently, proposing to offload a part of the AR-related processing pipeline to the edge [8]. One pitfall in these studies is the (simplified) assumption about the network delay. As a reality check and to gather insights to realize AR in real time, we seek in this work a better understanding of how a popular AR game, Pok√©mon Go, delivers its data in situ.
