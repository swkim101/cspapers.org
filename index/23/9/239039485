Foot devices have been ubiquitously used in surgery to control surgical equipment. Most common applications are foot switches for electro-surgery, endoscope positioning and tele-robotic consoles. Switches fall short of providing continuous control as required for precise use of instruments. We developed a haptic foot interface to provide continuous assistance in surgical procedures. This paper concerns the foot control of simultaneous five degrees of freedom (DoF) of a surgical laparoscopic gripper. We assess systematically precision at controlling position and orientation at the target and closing of the forceps. Our controller provides position:position mapping between the foot and the robotic tool, as well as haptic feedback, compensating for gravity of the lower limb of the operator so as to alleviate fatigue. A dynamic model compensation and closed loop force feedback is used to achieve high transparency and backdrivability. The assistance is based on a novel type of haptic fixtures combining spring-damper with selective dynamic compensation in the direction aligned with the task of grasping, so as to simplify control of certain poses, made difficult due to the coupling between human lower limbs’ DoF’s. We experimentally evaluated the control strategy with six users on a position control surgical task in simulation. Results show the proposed assistance greatly eases the foot grasping task leading to higher completeness, efficiency, and lower mental and physical load.
