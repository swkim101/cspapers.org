Handed Shearing Auxetics (HSA) are a promising structure for making electrically driven robots with distributed compliance that convert a motors rotation and torque into extension and force. These structures expand and contract by changing an internal angle between links, the evolution of the structure as this angle changes is known as the auxetic trajectory. We overcome past limitations on the range of actuation, blocked force, and stiffness by focusing on two key design parameters: the point of an HSA's auxetic trajectory that is energetically preferred, and the number of cells along the HSAs length. Modeling the HSA as a programmable spring, we characterize the effect of both on blocked force, minimum energy length, spring constant, angle range and holding torque. We also examined the effect viscoelasticity has on actuation forces over time. By varying the preferred auxetic trajectory point, we were able to make actuators that can push, pull, or do both. We expanded the range of forces possible from 5 N to 150 N, and the range of stiffness from 2 N/mm to 89 N/mm. For a fixed point on the auxetic trajectory, we found decreasing length can improve force output, at the expense of needing higher torques, and having a shorter throw. We also found that the viscoelastic effects can limit the amount of force a 3D printed HSA can apply over time.
