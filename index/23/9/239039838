We have implemented a force-based operational space controller on a physical musculoskeletal humanoid robot arm. The controller calculates muscle activations based on a biomimetic Hill-type muscle model. We propose a method to include the joint torque nullspace in the optimization process, which enables the robot to exploit the nullspace to gradually lower its overall muscle activation. We have verified in experiments that it can react compliantly to external disturbances while retaining its operational space task.
