With the ubiquity of data breaches, forgotten-about ﬁles stored in the cloud create latent privacy risks. We take a holistic approach to help users identify sensitive, unwanted ﬁles in cloud storage. We ﬁrst conducted 17 qualitative interviews to characterize factors that make humans perceive a ﬁle as sensitive, useful, and worthy of either protection or deletion. Building on our ﬁndings, we conducted a primarily quantitative online study. We showed 108 long-term users of Google Drive or Dropbox a selection of ﬁles from their accounts. They labeled and explained these ﬁles’ sensitivity, usefulness, and desired management (whether they wanted to keep, delete, or protect them). For each ﬁle, we collected many metadata and content features, building a training dataset of 3,525 labeled ﬁles. We then built Aletheia, which predicts a ﬁle’s perceived sensitivity and usefulness, as well as its desired management. Aletheia improves over state-of-the-art baselines by 26% to 159%, predicting users’ desired ﬁle-management decisions with 79% accuracy. Notably, predicting subjective perceptions of usefulness and sensitivity led to a 10% absolute accuracy improvement in predicting desired ﬁle-management decisions. Aletheia’s performance validates a human-centric approach to feature selection when using inference techniques on subjective security-related tasks. It also improves upon the state of the art in minimizing the attack surface of cloud accounts.
