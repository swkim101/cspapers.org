Vehicle Re-identification (Re-ID) aims to retrieve all instances of query vehicle images present in an image pool. However viewpoint, illumination, and occlusion variations along with subtle differences between two unique images pose a significant challenge towards achieving an effective system. In this paper, we emphasize upon enhancing the performance of visual feature based ReID system by improving feature embedding quality and propose (1) an attention-guided hierarchical feature extractor (HFE) that leverages the structure of a backbone CNN to extract coarse and fine-grained features and (2) to train the proposed network within a hard negative adversarial framework that generates samples exhibiting extreme variations, encouraging the network to extract important distinguishing features across varying scales. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework we use VERI-Wild, VRIC and Veri-776 datasets that exhibit extreme intra-class and minute inter-class differences and achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance.
