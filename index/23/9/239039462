In-hand manipulation is challenging for soft robotic hands, especially in the real world where robots encounter a variety of object sizes and shapes. As such, the role of the palm is crucial, providing stabilizing contact to objects during grasping and manipulation, and controlling the position of objects with respect to the fingertips. We demonstrate an actuated palm capable of enhancing the in-hand manipulation capabilities of a soft hand by better-utilizing limited finger dexterity. With a combination of physical and virtual experiments, we explore the effects of palm diameter and height on in-hand manipulation performance over a variety of object shapes and sizes, and three key manipulation primitive motions. The results of these experiments show that maintaining manipulation capabilities over a large range of object sizes requires the palmâ€™s diameter to decrease as a function of its height to prevent interference between the fingers and palm. Based on these insights, we design an actuated palm mechanism that achieves the desired relationship between palm height and diameter using one actuated degree of freedom. Finally, we show that this adjustable palm enables the hand to manipulate a larger range of object sizes and aspect ratios, and its utility is demonstrated in a mid-air shelving in-hand manipulation task.
