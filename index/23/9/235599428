High-precision tracking of a pen-like instrument's movements is desirable in a wide range of fields spanning education, robotics, and art, to name a few. The key challenge in doing so stems from the impracticality of embedding electronics in the tip of such instruments (a pen, marker, scalpel, etc.) as well as the difficulties in instrumenting the surface that it works on. In this paper, we present ITrackU, a movement digitization system that does not require modifications to the surface or the tracked instrument's tip. ITrackU fuses locations obtained using ultra-wideband radios (UWB), with an inertial and magnetic unit (IMU) and a pressure sensor, yielding multidimensional improvements in accuracy, range, cost, and robustness, over existing works. ITrackU embeds a micro-transmitter at the base of a pen which creates a trackable beacon, that is localized from the corners of a writing surface. Fused with inertial motion sensor and a pressure sensor, ITrackU enables accurate tracking. Our prototype of ITrackU covers a large 2.5m Ã— 2m area, while obtaining around 2.9mm median error. We demonstrate the accuracy of our system by drawing numerous shapes and characters on a whiteboard, and compare them against a touchscreen and a camera-based ground-truthing system. Finally, the produced stream of digitized data is minuscule in volume, when compared with a video of the whiteboard, which saves both network bandwidth and storage space.
