We present a deterministic (1+ε)-approximate maximum matching algorithm in poly(1/ε) passes in the semi-streaming model, solving the long-standing open problem of breaking the exponential barrier in the dependence on 1/ε. Our algorithm exponentially improves on the well-known randomized (1/ε)O(1/ε)-pass algorithm from the seminal work by McGregor [APPROX05], the recent deterministic algorithm by Tirodkar with the same pass complexity [FSTTCS18]. Up to polynomial factors in 1/ε, our work matches the state-of-the-art deterministic (logn / loglogn) · (1/ε)-pass algorithm by Ahn and Guha [TOPC18], that is allowed a dependence on the number of nodes n. Our result also makes progress on the Open Problem 60 at sublinear.info. Moreover, we design a general framework that simulates our approach for the streaming setting in other models of computation. This framework requires access to an algorithm computing a maximal matching and an algorithm for processing disjoint ( 1 / ε)-size connected components. Instantiating our framework in CONGEST yields a (logn, 1/ε) round algorithm for computing (1+ε)-approximate maximum matching. In terms of the dependence on 1/ε, this result improves exponentially state-of-the-art result by Lotker, Patt-Shamir, and Pettie [LPSP15]. Our framework leads to the same quality of improvement in the context of the Massively Parallel Computation model as well.
