In this paper, we present a technique for estimating the geometry and reflectance of objects using only a camera, flashlight, and optionally a tripod. We propose a simple data capture technique in which the user goes around the object, illuminating it with a flashlight and capturing only a few images. Our main technical contribution is the introduction of a recursive neural architecture, which can predict geometry and reflectance at 2k ×2k resolution given an input image at 2k×2k and estimated geometry and reflectance from the previous step at 2k−1×2k−1. This recursive architecture, termed RecNet, is trained with 256×256 resolution but can easily operate on 1024×1024 images during inference. We show that our method produces more accurate surface normal and albedo, especially in regions of specular highlights and cast shadows, compared to previous approaches, given three or fewer input images.
