Detection of redundant operators that can be safely
removed from the planning task is an essential technique
allowing to greatly improve performance of planners.
In this paper, we employ structure-preserving maps on labeled transition
systems (LTSs), namely endomorphisms well known from model theory, in order
to detect redundancy. Computing endomorphisms of an LTS induced by a
planning task is typically infeasible, so we show how to compute some of
them on concise representations of planning tasks such as finite domain
representations and factored LTSs.
We formulate the computation of endomorphisms as a constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) that can be solved by an off-the-shelf CSP solver.
Finally, we experimentally verify that the
proposed method can find a sizeable number of redundant operators on the
standard benchmark set.
