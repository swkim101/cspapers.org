Reproducing real world dynamics in simulation is critical for the development of new control and perception methods. This task typically involves the estimation of simu-lation parameter distributions from observed rollouts through an inverse inference problem characterized by multi-modality and skewed distributions. We address this challenging problem through a novel Bayesian inference approach that approximates a posterior distribution over simulation parameters given real sensor measurements. By extending the commonly used Gaus-sian likelihood model for trajectories via the multiple-shooting formulation, our gradient-based particle inference algorithm, Stein Variational Gradient Descent, is able to identify highly nonlinear, underactuated systems. We leverage GPU code gen-eration and differentiable simulation to evaluate the likelihood and its gradient for many particles in parallel. Our algorithm infers nonparametric distributions over simulation parame-ters more accurately than comparable baselines and handles constraints over parameters efficiently through gradient-based optimization. We evaluate estimation performance on several physical experiments. On an underactuated mechanism where a 7-DOF robot arm excites an object with an unknown mass configuration, we demonstrate how the inference technique can identify symmetries between the parameters and provide highly accurate predictions.
