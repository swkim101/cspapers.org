In this work, we focus on the autonomous navigation of snake robots in densely-cluttered environments, where collisions between the robot and obstacles are frequent, which could happen often in disaster scenarios, underground caves, or grassland/forest environments. This work takes the view that obstacles are not to be avoided, but rather exploited to support and direct the motion of the snake robot. We build upon a decentralized state-of-the-art compliant controller for serpenoid locomotion, and develop a bi-stable dynamical system that relies on inertial feedback to continuously steer the robot toward a desired direction. We experimentally show that this controller allows the robot to autonomously navigate dense environments by consistently locomoting along a given, global direction of travel in the world, which could be selected by a human operator or a higher level planner. We further equip the robot with an onboard vision system, allowing the robot to autonomously select its own direction of travel, based on the obstacle distribution ahead of its position (i.e., enacting feedforward control). In those additional experiments on hardware, we show how such an exteroceptive sensor can allow the robot to steer before hitting obstacles and to preemptively avoid challenging regions where proprioception-only (i.e., torque and inertial) feedback control would not suffice.
