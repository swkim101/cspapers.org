Controllable semantic image editing enables a user to change entire image attributes with few clicks, e.g., gradually making a summer scene look like it was taken in winter. Classic approaches for this task use a Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) to learn a latent space and suitable latent-space transformations. However, current approaches often suffer from attribute edits that are entangled, global image identity changes, and diminished photo-realism. To address these concerns, we learn multiple attribute transformations simultaneously, we integrate attribute regression into the training of transformation functions, apply a content loss and an adversarial loss that encourage the maintenance of image identity and photo-realism. We propose quantitative evaluation strategies for measuring controllable editing performance, unlike prior work which primarily focuses on qualitative evaluation. Our model permits better control for both single- and multiple-attribute editing, while also preserving image identity and realism during transformation. We provide empirical results for both real and synthetic images, highlighting that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for targeted image manipulation.
