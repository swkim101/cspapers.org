Code writing prompts are common on exams in programming courses. Such prompts often collect student answers via pseudocode. For some students this is uncomfortable because they are unable to compile and test their code like on assignments. Our study aims to learn how students perceive different types of programming assessment questions. We collected survey responses from students in a Data Structures course, one before and another after an exam with a coding question where students could elect for a pseudocode essay response or compile-and-test environment response. Results show most students initially preferred running code, but some reconsidered after the exam. The most common reason students preferred pseudocode was that they did not have enough time for correct syntax. This work has important implications for programming assessment and use of code writing prompts in the classroom.
