License plate recognition (LPR) is a fundamental component of various intelligent transportation systems, and is always expected to be accurate and efficient enough in real-world applications. Nowadays, recognition of single character has been sophisticated benefiting from the power of deep learning, and extracting position information for forming a character sequence becomes the main bottleneck of LPR. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel holistic position attention (HPA) in this paper that consists of position network and shared classifier. Specifically, the position network explicitly encodes the character position into the maps of HPA, and then the shared classifier performs the character recognition in a unified and parallel way. Here the extracted features are modulated by the attention maps before feeding into the classifier to yield the final recognition results. Note that our proposed method is end-to-end trainable, character recognition can be concurrently performed, and no post-processing is needed. Thus our LPR system can achieve good effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. The experimental results on four public datasets, including AOLP, Media Lab, CCPD, and CLPD, well demonstrate the superiority of our method to previous state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed.
