Although picking up objects a few centimeters in size is a common task, achieving such ability in a robot manipulator remains challenging. We take a step toward solving this problem by focusing on the task of picking a 1.0-cm screw from a bulk bin using only tactile information to achieve the task. Inspired by how humans pick up small objects from a bin, we propose a "grasp-separate" strategy for robotic picking, which involves grasping many objects first and then separating a single object through manipulation in the fingers, for robotic picking. Based on this strategy, we developed a tactile-based screw bin-picking system. We trained a convolution neural network to estimate the number of screws in the fingers first and built a controller that generates manipulation behaviors to separate a screw using reinforcement learning. To compensate for the low resolution of off-the-shelf tactile sensor arrays, we adopted active sensing, which uses observations obtained during a predefined simple movement. We show that this approach enhances the estimation accuracy and manipulation performance. Furthermore, to enable flexible finger motion, such as between the thumb and the index finger in a human hand, we propose a soft robot finger structure that leverages compliant materials. A soft actor-critic algorithm successfully found dexterous screw separation behaviors in compliant soft robotic fingers. In the evaluation, the system obtained an average success rate of 80%, which was difficult to achieve without the grasp-separate manipulation technique.
