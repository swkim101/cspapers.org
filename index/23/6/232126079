Online learning is becoming an essential pillar of today's education system. As reliance on this mode of education grows, so does the need for security in remote examinations and remote proctoring. One obstacle to remote proctoring is the difficulty in establishing a secure environment. Remote and automated proctoring services use several safeguards to discourage potential cheating. This work intends to build on the technologies used by proctoring services to investigate a profile (side) camera arrangement. While a front-facing camera captures only the examinee's head and shoulders, a profile-angle provides a view of the examinee and their environment by capturing the upper body, hands, and desk. As a result, this setup may discourage dishonest behaviors. Our exploratory pilot investigates this camera arrangement to provide insight into the use of profile cameras, providing guidance for instructors considering remote examinations and a foundation for future work on remote proctoring.
