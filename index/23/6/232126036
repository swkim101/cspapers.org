Computer science professionals have long been studying the gender gap and growing more aware of the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in the field. Recent years have also brought attention to issues of accessibility and inclusion. While faculty are often aware that our discipline lacks diversity, we have observed that many students are not aware of these issues. In order to raise students' awareness, we designed assignments focusing on diversity, inclusion, and accessibility that can be included throughout required courses in computer science curricula. This poster will provide example assignments and information about how to access and contribute to the assignment repository.
