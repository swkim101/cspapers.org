Primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), including liberal arts colleges, provide a faculty career path distinct from that of faculty at research universities. Since PhD advisors often lack PUI experience, and PhD students may lack access to mentors at PUIs, this paper serves as a resource for those who want to pursue a tenure-track position at a primarily undergraduate institution. The paper includes information about the benefits and challenges of PUI careers, why departments hire, how to interpret the job advertisement, how applications are read by the search committee, the interview stages, offers, and negotiations. While this paper does not address computing education directly, it addresses the R1 to PUI pipeline which impacts undergraduate education in computer science. The advice presented in the paper is based on common attributes of the tenure-track search process at four PUIs.
