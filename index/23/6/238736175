This research aimed to integrate a face recognition capability in a smart door prototype. Raspberry Pi 3B was used as the main controller, while a servo motor was utilized as a locking door actuator. The program was developed using Node-Red, Blynk and MQTT platform which are very powerful for developing Internet of Things devices. All of the programs were coded using Python. Haar Cascade and Local Binary Pattern Histogram methods were implemented on the face recognition stage. Google Assistant integration were done by using Dialogflow and firebase as Google Cloud services. Integration of Face Recognition and the smart door was successful. Smart door was unlocked if faces were recognized (average threshold = 60%). If a face was not recognized, an email notification containing a face image is sent to the house owner. The Google Assistant could handle user request successfully with a success rate of 92.8% from 147 trials.
