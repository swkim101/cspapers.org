Sampling-based algorithms solve the path planning problem by generating random samples in the searchspace and incrementally growing a connectivity graph or a tree. Conventionally, the sampling strategy used in these algorithms is biased towards exploration to acquire information about the search-space. In contrast, this work proposes an optimization-based procedure that generates new samples so as to improve the cost-to-come value of vertices in a given neighborhood. The application of the proposed algorithm adds an exploitativebias to sampling and results in a faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to other state-of-the-art sampling techniques. This is demonstrated using benchmarking experiments performed for 7 DOF Panda and 14 DOF Baxter robots.
