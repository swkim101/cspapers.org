This fun filled workshop will introduce participants to game development using MakeCode Arcade (Arcade), which is suited for K-12, outreach, and CS1. Hands-on activities will provide context for interesting computing ideas, like event driven programming, the concept of state, and principles of Human-Computer Interaction. We will start with a novice-friendly, block-based programming paradigm (similar to Scratch), but also show how Arcade's environment naturally scaffolds students into text-based languages as we progress to examples in JavaScript and Python (prior experience not needed). Other introductory tools often have shortcomings for games: a) game elements, like scoring and multiplayer capabilities, can be challenging to implement and b) finished games lack features associated with "real" games, like gamepad controls. This workshop will showcase Arcade features uniquely suited for games, such as scoring primitives and sprite data types, and how games can be deployed to low-cost consoles, comparable to Nintendo's Gameboy. Participants will: 1) complete example games using game elements, 2) see Arcade's use in remote education, 3) gain insight into succinct, meaningful activities for a variety of audiences (K-12, outreach, CS1), and 4) get educators' perspectives on the pros/cons of the Arcade platform. Activities will be completed via web browsers (Chrome preferred). Deployment to hardware will be demonstrated and participants can follow along if they own hardware, but it isn't required (to acquire hardware see the 'Hardware' section of https://arcade.makecode.com/).
