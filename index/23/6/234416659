The present work shows the development of a low-cost device to measure the type of electrochemical corrosion, using the electrochemical noise measurement technique, which improves the accuracy concerning commercial measurement devices by using high precision circuits, anti-aliasing filters, and a faraday cage to compensate the intrinsic noise level of the system. It was validated using three dummy cells with three different resistance values, 100Ω, 10KΩ, and 1MΩ, which simulate the impedance of the electrolyte on the noise levels of the electronics modules. To validate the performance of the anti-aliasing filters used in the system, three different acquisition frequencies of 1Hz, 100Hz, and 1 KHz were used. The better results obtained for the acquisition frequency of 1KHz in which the σi varies from 140 pA for the 100 Ω dummy cell to 200 pA for the 1 M Ω dummy cell, the σv varies from 120 µV for the 100 Ω dummy cell to 200 µV for the 1 M Ω dummy cell. Furthermore, the system was tested using a cell with three identical aluminum electrodes, submerged in a solution of distilled water with 3.5% NaCl for 6.5 hours. The results from this test show a general and localized corrosion in the form of pitting that characterizing this type of experiment.
