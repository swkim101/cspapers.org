The Nifty Assignments special session is about promoting and sharing the ideas and ready-to-use materials of successful assignments. Each presenter will introduce their assignment, give a quick demo, and describe its niche in the curriculum and its strengths and weaknesses. The presentations (and the descriptions below) merely introduce the assignment. A key part of Nifty Assignments is the mundane but vital role of distributing the materials - handouts, data files, starter code, rubrics, autograders - that make each assignment ready to adopt. Each assignment presented has complete materials freely available on the Nifty Assignments home page nifty.stanford.edu. If you have an assignment that works well and would be of interest to the CSE community, please consider applying to present at Nifty Assignments.
