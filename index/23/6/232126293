Reliable and valid exams are a crucial part of both sound research design and trustworthy assessment of student knowledge. Assessing and addressing item bias is a crucial step in building a validity argument for any assessment instrument. Despite calls for valid assessment tools in CS, item bias is rarely investigated. What kinds of item bias might appear in conventional CS1 exams? To investigate this, we examined responses to a final exam in a large CS1 course. We used differential item functioning (DIF) methods and specifically investigated bias related to binary gender and year of study. Although not a published assessment instrument, the exam had a similar format to many exams in higher education and research: students are asked to trace code and write programs, using paper and pencil. One item with significant DIF was detected on the exam, though the magnitude was negligible. This case study shows how to detect DIF items so that future researchers and practitioners can do these analyses.
