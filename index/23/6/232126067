As undergraduate enrollment in computer science (CS) courses continues to expand, concerns surrounding the supply of instructors and the quality of instruction become even more salient. Similarly, computing education and computational thinking programs are expanding in K12 schools but are hampered by concerns over teacher training and curriculum efficacy. This project sought to answer a question: is there a need for a more robust system of networking and resources for computer science education (CSEd) graduate students' The large response to initial community-building efforts indicates that this is likely the case. In just over one year, a global community of 190 graduate students and 90 CS faculty researchers and advisors have registered for a CSEd graduate focused community. Participant funding, while originally intended for in-person conference attendance and face-to-face meetings, has enabled this project to create study groups attended by 73 students and a virtual conference with 101 participants. These activities were established as a result of a needs assessment survey conducted in early 2020. This poster documents the rapid growth of this community and the need students feel for systematic support.
