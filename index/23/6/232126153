This poster describes ScaffoldSQL, an in-development tool for helping students learn Structured Query Language (SQL). ScaffoldSQL combines Parson's problems with an automated test suite to help students learn SQL syntax and semantics. The tool is designed to help instructors of database classes identify struggling and advanced students early, assisting in instructional pacing. The tool also provides individualized immediate feedback for students as they are learning without direct instructor intervention. The software has been created, but not formally tested in a classroom. Future work will focus on experimental validation of the approach and integrating ScaffoldSQL into learning management systems (LMSes) for ease of adoption by interested instructors.
