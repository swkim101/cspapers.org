Learning computer graphics requires a diverse range of skills, such as mathematics, programming, problem-solving and 3D reasoning skills. One fundamental area students struggle with is three-dimensional (3D) transformations, partially due to a lack of visuospatial skills. Augmented Reality has been proposed as a technique particularly suitable for tasks requiring 3D scene understanding. However, immersive augmented reality requires specialised equipment and is hence unsuitable for large classroom environments. In this research we investigate the extent to which mobile augmented reality can help with teaching and learning 3D transformations. We present a simple mobile AR tool for helping the understanding of 3D transformations by augmenting the camera view with 3D objects and their projected shadows on the coordinate planes, animating sequences of primitive transformations, and showing the relationship between graphics API code and textual descriptions of primitive operations. Our results suggest that augmented reality technology can improve motivation, help learners to visualise 3D transformations, and improve understanding and the ability to answer questions about 3D transformations. The findings may inform educators who are interested in using or developing augmented reality technology for teaching 3D concepts.
