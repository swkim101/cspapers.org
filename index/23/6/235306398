Automatic generation of Chinese fonts is a valuable but challenging task in areas of AI and Computer Graphics, mainly due to the huge amount of Chinese characters and their complex glyph structures. In this paper, we propose FontRL, a novel method for Chinese font synthesis by using deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first train a deep reinforcement learning model to obtain the Thin-Plate Spline (TPS) transformation that is able to modify the reference stroke skeleton in a mean font style into the skeleton of a required style for each stroke of every unseen Chinese character. Afterwards, we utilize a CNN model to predict the location and scale information of these strokes, and then assemble them to get the skeleton of the corresponding character. Finally, we convert each synthesized character skeleton into the glyph image via an image-to-image translation model. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FontRL compared to the state of the art.
