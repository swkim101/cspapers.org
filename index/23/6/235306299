Constraint acquisition systems assist the non-expert user in
modelling her problem as a constraint network. QUACQ is
a sequential constraint acquisition algorithm that generates
queries as (partial) examples to be classified as positive or
negative. The drawbacks are that the user may need to answer
a great number of such examples, within a significant waiting
time between two examples, to learn all the constraints. In
this paper, we propose PACQ, a portfolio-based parallel constraint
acquisition system. The design of PACQ benefits from
having several users sharing the same target problem. Moreover,
each user is involved in a particular acquisition session,
opened in parallel to improve the overall performance of the
whole system.We prove the correctness of PACQ and we give
an experimental evaluation that shows that our approach improves
on QUACQ.
