Interactive driving scenarios, such as lane changes, merges and unprotected turns, are some of the most challenging situations for autonomous driving. Planning in interactive scenarios requires accurately modeling the reactions of other agents to different future actions of the ego agent. We develop end-to-end models for conditional behavior prediction (CBP) that take as an input a query future trajectory for an ego-agent, and predict distributions over future trajectories for other agents conditioned on the query. Leveraging such a model, we develop a general-purpose agent interactivity score derived from probabilistic first principles. The interactivity score allows us to find interesting interactive scenarios for training and evaluating behavior prediction models. We further demonstrate that the proposed score is effective for agent prioritization under computational budget constraints.
