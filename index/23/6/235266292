We study the problems of counting the homomorphisms, the copies, and the induced copies of a <tex>$k$</tex>-vertex graph <tex>$H$</tex> in a <tex>$d$</tex>-degenerate <tex>$n$</tex>-vertex graph <tex>$G$</tex>. By leveraging a new family of graph-minor obstructions called F-gadgets, we establish explicit and exhaustive complexity classifications for counting copies and induced copies. For instance., we show that the copies of <tex>$H$</tex> in <tex>$G$</tex> can be counted in time <tex>$f(k, d)n^{\max(1,\mathsf{imn}(H))} \log n$</tex>, where <tex>$f$</tex> is some computable function and <tex>$\mathsf{imn} (H)$</tex> is the size of the largest induced matching of <tex>$H$</tex>; and that whenever the class of allowed patterns has arbitrarily large induced matchings, no algorithm runs in time <tex>$f(k, d)n^{o(\mathsf{imn}(H)/\log \mathsf{imn}(H))}$</tex> for any function <tex>$f$</tex>, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails. A similar result holds for counting induced copies, with the independence number <tex>$\alpha(H)$</tex> in place of <tex>$\mathsf{imn}(H)$</tex>. These results imply complexity dichotomies, into fixed-parameter tractable versus #W[1]-hard cases, which parallel the well-known dichotomies when <tex>$d$</tex> is not a parameter. Our results also imply the #W[1]-hardness of counting several patterns, such as <tex>$k$</tex>-matchings and <tex>$k$</tex>-trees, in <tex>$d$</tex> - degenerate graphs. We also give new hardness results and approximation algorithms for generalized pattern counting (i.e., counting patterns with a given property) in degenerate graphs.
