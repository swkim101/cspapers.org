Mobile robots of various types have been proposed for infrastructure inspection and disaster investigation. For such mobile robot applications, accessing the areas is of primary importance for missions. Therefore, various locomotive mechanisms have been studied. We introduce a novel mobile robot system, named DIR-3, combining a crawler robot and a microdrone. By rotating its arm back and forth, DIR-3, a very simple, lightweight crawler robot with a single 360-degree rotatable U-shaped arm, can climb up/down an 18 cm high step, 1.5 times its height.Furthermore, to inspect high places, which is considered difficult for conventional mobile robots, a drone mooring system for mobile robots is presented. The tethered microdrone of DIR-3 can be controlled freely as a flying camera by switching operating modes on the graphic user interface. The drone mooring system has a unique tension-controlled winding mechanism that enables stable landing on DIR-3 from any location in the air, in addition to measurement and estimation of relative positions of the drone. We evaluated the landing capability, position estimation accuracy, and following control of the drone using the winding mechanism. Results show the feasibility of the proposed system for inspection of cracks in a 5 m high concrete wall.
