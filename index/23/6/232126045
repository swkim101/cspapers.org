In this session, members of the ACM Data Science (DS) Task Force will present the final draft of Computing Competencies for Undergraduate Data Science Programs. Drafting this document has been a three-year process, in which the task force has released preliminary drafts, sought input from the community, and responded to the community's helpful feedback. Our intent is that the session be an exchange that will clarify the contents of the report and provide participants with ways to put the report into practice at their own institutions. This session should be of interest to all SIGCSE attendees, but especially to faculty developing college-level curricula in Data Science.
