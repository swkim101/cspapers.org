We delivered a large Introduction to Data Science course with a team of undergraduate Teaching Assistant-Researchers (TARs) who both helped students in the lab and collected qualitative observations about student learning. The TARs were concurrently participating in a senior-level Pedagogy of Data Science seminar. We present a strategy for collecting and systematizing our observations, and present actionable conclusions that can be used to improve future offerings of the course. We present evidence that suggests that participating in the study raised student performance on an end-of-semester test by 0.4σ (CI: [0.1σ, 1.8σ], p = 0.02), where σ is the class standard deviation.
