This poster presents pilot results of a professional development (PD) workshop designed by a Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) that focused on helping K-8 teachers integrate computer science (CS) concepts into other content areas using culturally responsive teaching (CRT) strategies. Preliminary results demonstrate that teachers significantly improved their self-efficacy to teach CS and self-confidence to use CRT in CS after the 4-week workshop. Results suggest that K-8 teachers can greatly benefit from PD experiences that focus on equitable CS instruction and pedagogy.
