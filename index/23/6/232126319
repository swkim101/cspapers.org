Feedback can transform a student's learning experience. It encourages them to reflect, deal with criticism, learn better, and stay motivated. However, the lack of meaningful feedback happens to be one of the biggest challenges that online learners face. In a traditional classroom setting, instructors get more facetime with students, this allows them to gauge students' understanding and offer frequent feedback accordingly. The same cannot be said about online classes because the interaction is limited. The move to online instruction necessitates more frequent feedback on performance for both faculty and students. By having access to performance data, teachers can observe data patterns, and adjust their instruction. In addition, norm-referenced and criterion-based data can help define the groups of students who need more intensive instruction. This workshop aims to show how relevant skill and conceptual knowledge descriptive tags can be introduced into a course through an online assignment grading platform. In addition, we will show how instructors can then analyze and develop interactive visuals of student and class performance. During the workshop, participants will gain experience developing assignments, grading assignments, tagging assignments, and producing data visuals to create individual feedback on course learning outcomes. Since this is a virtual workshop, participants will be responsible for providing their own equipment. Required supplies include 1) computer or laptop with working camera, microphone, and speakers 2) internet speeds adequate for streaming video.
