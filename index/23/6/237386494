Online A/B testing plays a critical role in the high-tech industry to guide product development and accelerate innovation. It performs a null hypothesis statistical test to determine which variant is better. However, a typical A/B test presents two problems: (i) a fixed-horizon framework inflates the false-positive errors under continuous monitoring; (ii) the homogeneous effects assumption fails to identify a subgroup with a beneficial treatment effect. In this paper, we propose a sequential test for sub group t reatment effects based on val ue difference, named SUBTLE, to address these two problems simultaneously. The SUBTLE allows the experimenters to “peek” at the results during the experiment without harming the statistical guarantees. It assumes heterogeneous treatment effects and aims to test if some subgroup of the population will benefit from the investigative treatment. If the testing result indicates the existence of such a subgroup, a subgroup will be identified using a readily available estimated optimal treatment rule. We examine the empirical performance of our proposed test on both simulations and a real dataset. The results show that the SUBTLE has high detection power with controlled type I error at any time, is more robust to noise covariates, and can achieve early stopping compared with the corresponding fixed-horizon test.
