This paper presents a novel robot-environment interaction in navigation tasks such that robots have neither a representation of their working space nor planning function, instead, an active environment takes charge of these aspects. This is realized by spatially deploying computing units, called cells, and making cells manage traffic in their respective physical region. Different from stigmegic approaches, cells interact with each other to manage environmental information and to construct instructions on how robots move.As a proof-of-concept, we present an architecture called AFADA and its prototype, consisting of modular cells and robots moving on the cells. The instructions from cells are based on a distributed routing algorithm and a reservation protocol. We demonstrate that AFADA enables a robot to move efficiently in a dynamic environment that stochastic changes its topology, comparing to self-navigation by a robot itself. This is followed by several demos, including multi-robot navigation, highlighting the power of offloading both representation and planning from robots to the environment. We expect that the concept of AFADA contributes to developing the infrastructure for multiple robots because it can engage online and lifelong planning and execution.
