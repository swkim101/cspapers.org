This poster describes an NSF S-STEM project that provides scholarships and student support S3 for computer science, physics, and math (CSPM) majors at a private comprehensive liberal arts college with an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 1800 students. In five years, the S3 program supported 19 computer science, 6 physics, and 7 math undergraduates. The S3 program featured a highly-interactive, first-year seminar that used mini-projects in CSPM to engage students. Students explored CSPM career opportunities with frequent guest speakers and discussions about internships and summer research opportunities. The program likely contributed to an increased percentage of CS degrees earned by female students, which grew from 17% to 25%.
