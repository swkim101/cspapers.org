Creating new lectures and aligning the contents to the students and their knowledge can be a challenging work for all levels of education: Knowledge dependencies between the different blocks of lectures are not always visible. The problem increases if content from third parties like colleagues or from the Internet is being used. The content curation tool described in this poster aims on this challenge and offers a way of automatic, skill-based lecture creation and dependency management. The objective is that the lecturer can enter the required skills as well as the type of teaching materials and the system will generate a complete course from available contents.
