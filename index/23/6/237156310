The Competition and Demonstration Track at NeurIPS is now an established forum that allows scientist and practitioners of machine learning to interact with each other and with cutting edge machine learning technology. On the one hand, competitions pose well-structured, relevant, and challenging problems to the community at large. Participants contribute to solving such problems, learn and have fun, as well as contributing to the advancement of the state of the art in these relevant domains. Demonstrations, on the other hand, oï¬€er a complementary dimension to the competitions, focusing on areas of machine learning which are highly interactive or demonstrable, or which create inspiring dialog between demo presenters and attendees. Demonstrators showcase their technology, encouraging the participation of NeurIPS attendees as users, instead of contributors of such technology, and raising new questions or perspectives about their uses. This volume compiles a selection of papers associated with the fourth edition of the Demonstration and Competition Track at NeurIPS 2020. The track comprised 16 competitions and 20 demonstrations. Competition and demonstration proposals were subject to a strict reviewing process to ensure the quality of the accepted events. After a selective process, the accepted competitions and demonstrations were featured at the NeurIPS 2020 main conference. A wide diversity of machine learning topics were covered with competitions and demonstrations. The latter included innovative ways of interacting with participants due to the virtual format of NeurIPS2020. As in
