In this project, we explore how academic integrity and teaching computer ethics have evolved within the SIGCSE community over the past 50 years. We apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify the topics in the records in 50 years of SIGCSE Symposia. We extract records that include these two themes and apply a temporal model identifying periods with an increase in the number of records that include these themes and a significant increase in 2017-2018.
