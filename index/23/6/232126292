Business analytics and data science are gaining popularity in industry and academia. Driven by the continuing demand from industry, universities in the US and abroad have started graduate certificates and degree-awarding programs at undergraduate, graduate, and executive education levels. Because of its broad and multi-faceted coverage of hard and soft subjects and skills, the teaching of business analytics and data science has not been easy. One proven way to make the learning of the foundational concepts and best practices more intuitive for students is to utilize a visual, workflow-driven software platform. The goal is to reduce the syntactic nature of data science so that more time and mental capacity can be spent on concepts. KNIME Analytics Platform (a free and open-source software environment) is an excellent candidate for intuitive teaching, learning, and practicing platform with a complete set of functionalities for business analytics, data science, and machine learning. The current tutorial will demonstrate the ease of modeling with KNIME. The audience can follow along by installing KNIME on their laptop via knime.org.
