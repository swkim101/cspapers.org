This hands-on online workshop will introduce high school and college instructors to CSAwesome, a free Java curriculum and ebook at course.csawesome.org for the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science (CS) A course. This course is equivalent to a college-level CS1 course in Java. CSAwesome is an official College Board approved curriculum and professional development provider and has been widely adopted by AP high school teachers. The free ebook on the Runestone platform includes executable Java code examples and a variety of practice problems with immediate feedback: multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, write-code, mixed-up code (Parsons), and clickable code. It also includes coding challenges and support for pair programming. The curriculum is designed to help transition students from AP Computer Science Principles, which is equivalent to a CS0 course. Teacher lesson plans and resources are freely available. During this workshop, participants will register for the free ebook and work through example activities using object-oriented programming. If possible, participants will be divided into breakout groups according to their Java expertise. Participants will also learn how to create a custom course on the Runestone platform, create and grade assignments, use the instructor's dashboard to view student progress, contribute to the question bank, and use an interleaved spaced practice tool. We will also discuss online/hybrid teaching and engagement strategies.
