The Computer-Science Student-Centered Instructional Continuum (CS-SCIC) is a new framework to support PreK-12 instructors in their lesson design. Educators are faced with choices when building lessons; there is a tension between direct instruction, constructivism and constructionism and difficulty in providing differentiated instruction. Theoretically aligned to Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, CS-SCIC places research-based instructional strategies on a simple learning continuum. Teachers use the continuum to discuss, review and design learning events. Used internationally, initial qualitative feedback from teachers who attended pilot CS-SIC workshops was emphatically positive. Future work includes more feedback from academia and formal research, including pre and post-professional development workshop surveys.
