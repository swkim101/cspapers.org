The MIPS assembly language is a popular choice for teaching assembly programming in Computer Organization courses. While there are emulator programs available for programming and running MIPS assembly language programs, they do not provide the programmer an opportunity to interact with actual computer hardware. In our Computer Organization course, we have used a chipKIT uC32 hobbyist computer to encourage hands-on, active learning in many aspects of our course. The chipKIT features a Microchip PIC32 microcontroller with a MIPS core. It can be programmed in C/C++ or assembly on the Arduino IDE using a Microchip MIPS toolchain. Our students work collaboratively in pairs on programs related to the current course topics. With the chipKIT students can write code to interact with a variety of input/output controllers and devices, program in assembly, learn bit twiddling techniques, explore input with polling techniques and vectored and priority interrupts, and learn firsthand how their programs interact with the hardware components of the computer. This poster introduces the chipKIT platform and some of the resources available for use with the chipKIT. It outlines the application of the chipKIT to our Computer Organization course and presents some plans for evaluating the usefulness and effectiveness of the chipKIT in the course.
