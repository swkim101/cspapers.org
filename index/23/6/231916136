The SPIR, Submersible Pylon Inspection Robot, is developed to provide an innovative and practical solution to keep workers safe during maintenance of underwater structures in shallow waters, which involves working in dangerous water currents, and high-pressure water-jet cleaning. More advanced than work-class Remotely Operated Vehicles technology, the SPIR is automated and required minimum involvement of humans into the working process, thus effectively lowered the learning curve required to conduct work. To make SPIR operate effectively in poor visibility and highly disturbed environments, the multiple new technologies are developed and implemented into the system, including SBL-SONAR-based navigation, 6-DOF stabilisation, and vision-based 3D mapping. Extensive testing and field trials in various bridges are conducted to verify the robotic system. The results demonstrate the suitability of the SPIR in substituting humans for underwater hazardous tasks such as autonomous cleaning and inspection of bridge and wharf piles
