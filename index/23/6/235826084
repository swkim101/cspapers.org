Game optimization has been extensively studied when decision variables lie in a ﬁnite-dimensional space, of which solutions correspond to pure strategies at the Nash equilibrium (NE), and the gradient descent-ascent (GDA) method works widely in practice. In this paper, we consider inﬁnite-dimensional zero-sum games by a min-max distributional optimization problem over a space of probability measures deﬁned on a continuous variable set, which is inspired by ﬁnding a mixed NE for ﬁnite-dimensional zero-sum games. We then aim to answer the following question: Will GDA-type algorithms still be provably efﬁ-cient when extended to inﬁnite-dimensional zero-sum games? To answer this question, we propose a particle-based variational transport algorithm based on GDA in the functional spaces. Speciﬁcally, the algorithm performs multi-step functional gradient descent-ascent in the Wasserstein space via pushing two sets of particles in the variable space. By characterizing the gradient estimation error from variational form maximization and the convergence behavior of each player with different ob-jective landscapes, we prove that a theoretical version of the generalized GDA algorithm converges to the NE or the value of the game efﬁciently for a class of games under the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition. To conclude, we provide complete statistical and convergence guarantees for solving an inﬁnite-dimensional zero-sum game via a provably efﬁcient particle-based method. Additionally, our work provides the ﬁrst thorough statistical analysis for the particle-based algorithm to learn an objective functional with a variational form us-ing universal approximators ( i.e. , neural networks
