Most of the existing scientific visualizations toward interpretive grammar aim to enhance customizability in either the computation stage or the rendering stage or both, while few approaches focus on the data presentation stage. Besides, most of these approaches leverage the existing components from the general-purpose programming languages (GPLs) instead of developing a standalone compiler, which pose a great challenge about learning curves for the domain experts who have limited knowledge about programming. In this paper, we propose IGScript, a novel script-based interaction grammar tool, to help build scientific data presentation animations for communication. We design a dual-space interface and a compiler which converts natural language-like grammar statements or scripts into a data story animation to make an interactive customization on script-driven data presentations, and then develop a code generator (decompiler) to translate the interactive data exploration animations back into script codes to achieve statement parameters. IGScript makes the presentation animations editable, e.g., it allows to cut, copy, paste, append, or even delete some animation clips. We demonstrate the usability, customizability, and flexibility of IGScript by a user study, four case studies conducted by using four types of commonly-used scientific data, and performance evaluations.
