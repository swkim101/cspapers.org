In this paper, we focus on the challenging few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) problem, which requires to transfer knowledge from old tasks to new ones and solves catastrophic forgetting. We propose the exemplar relation distillation incremental learning framework to balance the tasks of old-knowledge preserving and new-knowledge adaptation. First, we construct an exemplar relation graph to represent the knowledge learned by the original network and update gradually for new tasks learning. Then an exemplar relation loss function for discovering the relation knowledge between
different classes is introduced to learn and transfer the structural information in relation graph. A large number of experiments demonstrate that relation knowledge does exist in the exemplars and our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art class-incremental learning methods on the CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200 datasets.
