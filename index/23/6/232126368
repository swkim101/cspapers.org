Even in an introduction to computer science course, students commit academic misconduct. Traditional plagiarism detection software like MOSS fail to give great results for assignments whose solutions are only a few lines long. We change program variable names and then search student code for those variable names. If their code backups contain the variable names, they are flagged for cheating. Our tool was used in a CS1 course that had a Spring 2020 enrollment of 1800 students. We accused 164 students for the first homework, and enforced 142 penalties (86.6% of accused students) for the first homework. Over the semester we had 452 enforced cases of cheating on homeworks, labs, and projects out of 598 accusations (75.6% of accused students). In Summer 2020 we improved the tool to speed up response time and reduce false positive rate from 24.4% to 21.9%. We built open source software using Python that searches students' code for suspicious keywords and uploads it all to a spreadsheet. We also asked students to provide their past work at the beginning of the semester. This is important because it reduces student stress and reduces false positives. Our work helps the remedial nature of communicating to students they have been flagged for cheating by having the students know that someone is monitoring their work. Students are caught breaking the rules before they develop bad habits that hinder their learning and lead to persistent cheating.
