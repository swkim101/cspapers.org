While computer science (CS) education researchers have frequently examined what happens in courses, programs of study, or occupations in general, they have less frequently addressed finer-grained experiences that spark students' interest in CS. One excellent way to study these types of student experiences is the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). ESM involves collecting data on individuals' experiences at much more frequent intervals than traditional survey research. This aspect of ESM makes it well-suited to examine time-specific aspects of students' experiences, as well as changes due to the disruptive effects of COVID-19.
