Due to the rapid growth and strong competition of mobile application (app) market, app developers should not only offer users with attractive new features, but also carefully maintain and improve existing features based on users' feedbacks. User reviews indicate a rich source of information to plan such feature maintenance activities, and it could be of great benefit for developers to evaluate and magnify the contribution of specific features to the overall success of their apps. In this study, we refer to the features that are highly correlated to app ratings as key features, and we present KEFE, a novel approach that leverages app description and user reviews to identify key features of a given app. The application of KEFE especially relies on natural language processing, deep machine learning classifier, and regression analysis technique, which involves three main steps: 1) extracting feature-describing phrases from app description; 2) matching each app feature with its relevant user reviews; and 3) building a regression model to identify features that have significant relationships with app ratings. To train and evaluate KEFE, we collect 200 app descriptions and 1,108,148 user reviews from Chinese Apple App Store. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of KEFE in feature extraction, where an average F-measure of 78.13% is achieved. The key features identified are also likely to provide hints for successful app releases, as for the releases that receive higher app ratings, 70% of features improvements are related to key features.
