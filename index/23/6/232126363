Engaged preparation and study in combination with lectures are important for all courses but are particularly critical for online, hybrid, and inverted classrooms. Many instructors use online systems to deliver new course content and exercises, but students often delay assignments or game these systems (e.g., guessing on multiple-choice questions), often to the detriment of their learning. In an inverted CS1 course, many students self-reported high rates of gaming-the-system behavior, so we examine survey data to identify factors that contribute to engagement in these maladaptive behaviours. We supplement that analysis with interview data to gain a deeper understanding of the situation. We also implemented and evaluated a previously reported online intervention aimed at reducing gaming behavior. Unlike prior work, our intervention did not have a significant effect on guessing behavior. We discuss why the factors we identified might explain this result, as well as suggest future work to improve our understanding of gaming behaviours and inform the design of systems that encourage effective learning.
