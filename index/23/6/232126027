Are you a funding proposal author, a researcher thinking about your data, or someone who is interested in open science? Over the course of three hours we will explore opportunities and challenges associated with preserving and sharing your data, review what the NSF requires of project Data Management Plans and explore tools to help you prepare your data management plan and sustainability strategy. Data sustainability is crucial to contributions to the broader CS education research community and a potential solution to the need for more high-quality datasets available for secondary analyses. There are several challenges associated with maintaining and sharing data, including practical considerations (e.g., sustainable funding, hosting platforms) and ethical concerns (e.g., confidentiality, appropriate contextualization of data in future usage). It is our responsibility to engage with these difficulties and work towards responsible field-wide solutions. This workshop will 1) facilitate participants' discussions of a data sustainability framework, with attention to practical and ethical challenges; 2) introduce participants to tools designed to help enable better data management and data management plans; and 3) allow time for participants to reflect on their current projects? Data Management Plans and brainstorm ways to create processes for facilitating data sharing and sustainability. We invite you to bring plans you may have to the workshop.
