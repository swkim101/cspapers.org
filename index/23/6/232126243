The growing interest in teaching Computer Science (CS) to K-12 students has led to the development of blocks-based programming languages (BBPLs) for young students where a program can be created by connecting blocks in a structured way. One of the benefits of a BBPL is removing the necessity to recall the syntax rules of a language. However, the visual nature of these languages makes learning and creating code difficult for children with visual impairments and blindness (VIB). Although a few BBPLs were designed for children with VIB, such environments are rarely used by sighted children. Therefore, to investigate the requirements for designing and implementing an accessible blocks-based programming environment that can be used by both students with and without VIB, we developed a BBPL environment for middle school children. The environment consists of a two-dimensional grid where a character can be moved by creating a simple blocks program. Our future plans include performing several empirical experiments to evaluate our BBPL, including the educational impact of the environment on all students and accessibility support for students with VIB. To perform the study, we also plan to prepare lessons for training the students. The results of the study will inform the design of future BBPL environments, as well as contribute toward broadening participation in computing by enabling children with visual impairments to participate fully in CS education opportunities.
