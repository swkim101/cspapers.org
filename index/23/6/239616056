Scenic is an open-source11https://github.com/google-research/scenic JAX library with a focus on transformer-based models for computer vision research and beyond. The goal of this toolkit is to facilitate rapid experimentation, prototyping, and research of new architectures and models. Scenic supports a diverse range of tasks (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection) and facilitates working on multi-modal problems, along with GPU/TPU support for large-scale, multi-host and multi-device training. Scenic also offers optimized implementations of state-of-the-art research models spanning a wide range of modalities. Scenic has been successfully used for numerous projects and published papers and continues serving as the library of choice for rapid prototyping and publication of new research ideas.
