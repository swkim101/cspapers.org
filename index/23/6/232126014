Syntax is a barrier to success for many students in Introductory Computer Programming (CS1). A supplemental approach to standard CS1 curricula that has gained attention recently is a "syntax-scaffolded" or "syntax-first" approach where students practice necessary syntax before a lesson on problem solving or program design. In this study, we analyze student perceptions of a syntax-first teaching method. For the first five weeks of a university semester, we assigned students syntax exercises to complete before coming to class. At the end of the semester they were given a prompt asking them to write their thoughts about the exercises. A qualitative approach was used to investigate student responses and understand perceived value of the exercises. Our results show a strong positive reaction to a syntax-first approach as well as an awareness among students of the exercises' effect on their own learning.
