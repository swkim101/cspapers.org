To examine perceptions of faculty mentors of undergraduate research and their supervisors, this work discusses the results of surveys administered after 3 years of a summer CS-focused REU Site program. One survey was completed by administrators of faculty research mentors--deans and chairs--and the other was completed by faculty mentors. The surveys indicated a disconnect between how the groups assessed undergraduate research mentoring as an indicator of faculty productivity, and overt vs. covert recognition of undergraduate mentoring. Additional topics explored the effectiveness of internal communication of program outcomes and ways to improve it, as well as post-program continued mentoring engagement linking to perceptions of long-term student benefits.
