As more and more research is conducted in computer science education, particularly as CS content proliferates into primary and secondary education, we are providing to the community a free survey platform specifically designed for conducting research. In this session, we will demonstrate the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) survey platform hosted by CSEdResearch.org, which provides a way for researchers to choose a pre-defined instrument or mix and match a variety of existing scales that meets a researcher's particular study's needs. These instruments have previous evidence of validity and reliability and have been curated for their high quality. By using this platform, researchers can save considerable time (with the ability to select and create a full survey with several existing scales and distribute the survey in less than 10 minutes). In addition to demoing the free-to-use survey system, we will also provide information on how to express formal interest in using REDCap and the training and assistance we provide for researchers and evaluators.
