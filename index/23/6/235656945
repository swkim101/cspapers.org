Blind deblurring has received considerable attention in recent years. However, state-of-the-art methods often fail to process saturated blurry images. The main reason is that pixels around saturated regions are not conforming to the commonly used linear blur model. Pioneer arts suggest excluding these pixels during the deblurring process, which sometimes simultaneously removes the informative edges around saturated regions and results in insufficient information for kernel estimation when large saturated regions exist. To address this problem, we introduce a new blur model to fit both saturated and unsaturated pixels, and all informative pixels can be considered during the deblurring process. Based on our model, we develop an effective maximum a posterior (MAP)-based optimization framework. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets and challenging real-world examples show that the proposed method performs favorably against existing methods.
