We extend the expressivity of classical conditional reasoning by introducing context as a new parameter. The enriched conditional logic generalises the defeasible setting in the style of Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor, and allows for a more refined representation of an agent’s epistemic state, distinguishing, for example, between expectations and counterfactuals. In this paper we introduce the language for the enriched logic, and define an appropriate semantic framework for it. We analyse which properties generally associated with conditional reasoning are still satisfied by the new semantic framework, provide an appropriate representation result, and define an entailment relation based on Lehmann and Magidor’s notion of Rational Closure.
