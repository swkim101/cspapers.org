Transient execution vulnerabilities originate in the extensive speculation implemented in modern high-performance microprocessors. Identifying all possible vulnerabilities in complex designs is very challenging. One of the challenges stems from the lack of visibility into the transient micro-architectural state of the processor. Prior work has used covert channels to identify data leakage from transient state, which limits the systematic discovery of all potential leakage sources.This paper presents INTROSPECTRE, a pre-silicon framework for early discovery of transient execution vulnerabilities. IN- TROSPECTRE addresses the lack of visibility into the micro- architectural processor state by integrating into the register transfer level (RTL) design flow, gaining full access to the internal state of the processor. Full visibility into the processor state enables INTROSPECTRE to perform a systematic leakage analysis that includes all micro-architectural structures, allowing it to identify potential leakage that may not be reachable with known side channels. We implement INTROSPECTRE on an RTL simulator and use it to perform transient leakage analysis on the RISC-V BOOM processor. We identify multiple transient leakage scenarios, most of which had not been highlighted on this processor design before.
