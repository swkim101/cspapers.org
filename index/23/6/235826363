We study the problem of reward identiﬁability in the context of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). The reward identiﬁability question is critical to answer when reasoning about the effectiveness of using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) as computational models of real world decision makers in order to understand complex decision making behavior and perform counter-factual reasoning. While identiﬁability has been acknowledged as a fundamental theoretical question in IRL, little is known about the types of MDPs for which rewards are identiﬁable, or even if there exist such MDPs. In this work, we formalize the reward identiﬁcation problem in IRL and study how identiﬁability relates to properties of the MDP model. For deterministic MDP models with the MaxEntRL objective, we prove necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for identiﬁability. Building on these results, we present efﬁcient algorithms for testing whether or not an MDP model is identiﬁable.
