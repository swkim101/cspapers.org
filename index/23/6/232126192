As one develops instructional innovations, it is important not only to propagate them into new and different environments, but also to study their efficacy in these new locations with different demographics of students. Previously, we showed that introductory CS assignments based on various pencil-and-paper puzzles are valuable, but this study was done at a single university. In this poster, we report on propagation of puzzle-based assignments to many universities and collection of the resulting data from these different contexts. This allows us to study the efficacy of the assignments in these disparate environments. In order to ease adoption at other universities, we are also interested in the experience of the instructors in implementing the assignments in their courses. Our overall goal is to "close the feedback loop" by collecting and analyzing all of this data to improve both their effectiveness and adoptability. This poster presents details of the deployment and data collection process, including working with the respective IRBs, selecting and implementing the various assignments, collecting student grades and survey responses, and conducting instructor interviews, in the hopes that it will help other educators to more efficiently and effectively close the feedback loop for their own innovations.
