Structuring can be defined independently of what is being structured, and can be applied profitably to more than one domain. Using one mechanism to structure both values and assignments, we obtain equivalents for a variety of data and control structures. Structuring assignments is preferable to structuring control: the former is more conducive to a mathematical style of programming while the latter is more conducive to tracing.
