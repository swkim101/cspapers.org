This paper summarizes an experience in designing and delivering a course "Software Development Essentials", a second year computer science course designed to teach software engineering skills without a project component. This paper describes the motivation, design, and implementation of the course. This course was offered as a pilot course that enrolled approximately 65 students at the University of Virginia. The need for the course emerged as we found many later project-centric courses assumed students already had knowledge and skills related to build configuration, database usage, design, version control, and incremental development, despite none of them materials being covered in our intro programming sequence. Further, in the project-centric software engineering course (typically a third-year course), students often were expected to start on a project before concepts such as design principles, design patterns, and incremental development were covered. Thus, students were often learning these principles and techniques after they had already been working on a project for weeks, and often too late to implement these into the project naturally. This course is not intended to replace a software engineering course. Rather, this course is intended to prepare students for future project courses, including a software engineering course. In this paper, we describe our experience designing and delivering this course in the Spring semester 2020. We review both student and faculty feedback of the course, and what changes may be made when this course is made available in the future to a large population of students.
