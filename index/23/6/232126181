Concept maps are graphical representations of the hierarchical relationships among ideas. They are frequently used to assess individual students? understanding in a given domain. We present a methodology to create a collective concept map, which illustrates a group's, not an individual's, understanding of a concept. We draw on data from 15 grades 2-12 teachers and 23 grades 6-11 students from several schools within a metropolitan area in the U.S., who were participants in a summer cybersecurity workshop for beginner learners. Using collective concept maps, we study the initial views on the topic of cybersecurity between teachers and students.
