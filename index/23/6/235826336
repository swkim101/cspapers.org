PCA WITH O UTLIERS is the fundamental problem of identifying an underlying low-dimensional subspace in a data set corrupted with outliers. A large body of work is devoted to the information-theoretic aspects of this problem. However, from the computational perspective, its complexity is still not well-understood. We study this problem from the perspective of parameterized complexity by investigating how parameters like the di-mension of the data, the subspace dimension, the number of outliers and their structure, and approximation error, inï¬‚uence the computational complexity of the problem. Our algorithmic meth-ods are based on techniques of randomized linear algebra and algebraic geometry.
