While cybersecurity competitions are invaluable learning experiences for the individuals partaking in them, the competition environment might be able to help in understanding how individuals solve security problems. With this project, we have created a virtual network on the cloud that mimics a cybersecurity competition environment and will be used to log and analyze how students go about finding and resolving security challenges on Windows and Linux systems. This study will help educators to better train students in identifying security vulnerabilities and mitigating risk.
