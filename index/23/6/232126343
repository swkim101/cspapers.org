Collaborative group projects can be messy and our students are often underprepared for them. The CoLab.online web application is designed to give project-based instructors the data and support they need to help their students develop the skills necessary for success. It's feature set includes weekly self- and peer-assessment with the results plotted on interactive charts for the instructor. It is interesting because it focuses students on reporting on the groups' internal dynamics rather than on evaluating their peers. A unique linked-slider interface makes the zero-sum approach clear by driving teammates sliders proportionally in the opposite direction of the one being moved. Furthermore, students are asked to assess their groups on a weekly basis, offering instructors a comprehensive picture, plotted on interactive graphs to help identify which teams are struggling such that the instructor can focus their team support efforts on teams that most need their help. The talk aims to enlist collaborators interested in developing our students' collaborative skills. The current effort focusing on improving the visualizations and the instructor experience to best provide the data, warning and tools necessary to develop our students team skills.
