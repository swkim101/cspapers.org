While the population of girls in Texas grade 6-12 computer science courses has increased, gender parity remains elusive. This work explores the root cause of this phenomenon as understood by Texas teachers who are part of an NSF supported networked improvement community (NIC) focused on gender disparities. Using teacher-defined problem statements about the root cause of gender disparities, we uncovered 15 subcodes across six main attributions for the underrepresentation of female students. Teachers overwhelmingly described student-related issues, such as awareness and lack of role models, as the primary driver of gender disparities. We found that teachers' attributions of the root cause of gender disparities varied based on teacher gender and teacher experience.
