In this paper, we propose a novel noise-robust semi-supervised deep generative model by jointly tackling noisy labels and outliers simultaneously in a uniﬁed robust semi-supervised variational au-toencoder (URSVAE). Typically, the uncertainty of of input data is characterized by placing the uncertainty prior on the parameters of probability density distributions in order to ensure the robustness of the variational encoder towards out-liers. Subsequently, a noise transition model is integrated naturally into our model to alleviate the detrimental effects of noisy labels. Moreover, a robust divergence measure is employed to further enhance the robustness, where a novel variational lower bound is derived and optimized to infer the network parameters. By proving that the in-ﬂuence function of the proposed evidence lower bound is bounded, the enormous potential of the proposed model in the classiﬁcation in the presence of the compound noise is demonstrated. The experimental results highlight the superiority of the proposed framework by the evaluating on image classiﬁcation tasks and comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches.
