The current computing landscape is dominated by data-intensive applications, making data movement one of the most prominent performance bottlenecks. With repeated off-chip memory access to DRAM driving up power, and SRAM technology scaling and leakage power limiting the efficiency of embedded memories, there is a need for new memory systems that can enable denser, more energy-efficient future on-chip storage. The actively expanding field of emerging, embeddable non-volatile memory (eNVM) technologies is providing many potential candidates to satisfy this need. However, eNVM cell technologies are in vastly different stages of development and introduce distinct trade-offs in terms of density, read, write, and reliability characteristics.We present NVMExplorer (http://nvmexplorer.seas.harvard.edu/): a cross-stack design space exploration framework to compare and evaluate future on-chip memory solutions with system constraints and application-level impacts in-the-loop. This work uses NVMExplorer to evaluate eNVM-based storage for a range of application and system contexts including machine learning on the edge, graph analytics, and general purpose cache. Additionally, NVMExplorer provides an interactive and easily navigable set of data visualizations, which allow users to quickly answer their specific questions regarding eNVMs, filter according to system and application constraints, and efficiently iterate and refine the design space.
