Introducing programming concepts to a broad audience is critical both as an entry point for wider computer science participation and for exposure and technical literacy at an introductory undergraduate level. A historical perspective on the field of computing offers opportunities to reveal and explore technical concepts alongside critical discussions on who does the work of computing. We propose an introductory seminar course that incorporates entry-level programming assignments into a social history of computing. The course engages students in critical discussion of the themes, history, and ongoing implications of computing and technology while delving into technical detail about basic logic, programming languages, and the structure of modern computing systems.
