The presented multimicroprocessor system has been designed to treat certain problem classes such as large systems of differential equations or online process control. It consists of a main processor and an arbitrary number of modules, each with a microprocessor, a private memory and a communication memory. The most characteristic features of the SMS 101 organization are:- a phase structured interaction scheme (PSI-Scheme) which simplifies organizational problems- a data communication concept, that replaces common memory by simultaneously storing data in distributed memories.A first realization of the system comprises eight modules, but the organization allows an extension up to several hundreds of modules. Thus with present day technology a computing capacity can be achieved which is 2 or 3 magnitudes higher than that of conventional computers.
