Manual supernova direction prediction is time-consuming and often does not allow enough time for telescopes to catch the supernova event. Using machine learning, it is possible to develop an algorithm that can quickly determine the supernova direction. In this paper, a machine learning approach to predicting the direction of supernova events are applied with promising results. Neutrinos are subatomic particles that are at least six orders of magnitudes smaller than the mass of an electron. Following Colgate and White's theory of supernova neutrino production, neutrinos emitted by supernovas can be detected before the first electromagnetic emissions can be detected. However, neutrino interactions with matter are minimal and feeble. They have no electric charge. This makes them difficult to detect. As part of this research project, we are using simulated data representing detected neutrino events from the Super-K observatory. We used 80% of the data as a training set and 20% was a testing set. Both feature and label values were normalized into the range between 0 and 1. We used a Convolutional Neural Network to process inputs from a 1D array representing the image containing event data. The overall results of the model (67% of the time, model prediction is within 5 degrees of the actual event, and 99% of the time, model prediction is within 10 degrees of the actual event) were similar to the currently used prediction methods. However, once the models are trained, the detection can be much faster, as the results can be obtained within seconds.
