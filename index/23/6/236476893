We conduct a comprehensive measurement study of switch control plane latencies using four types of production SDN switches. Our measurements show that control actions, such as rule installation, have surprisingly high latency, due to both software implementation inefficiencies and fundamental traits of switch hardware. We also propose three measurement-driven latency mitigation techniques---optimizing route selection, spreading rules across switches, and reordering rule installations---to effectively tame the flow setup latencies in SDN.
