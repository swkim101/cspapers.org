This Birds-of-a-Feather session is for anyone interested in the NSF Scholarships in STEM (S-STEM) program, including current and former Principal Investigators (PIs) and those planning to apply. The S-STEM program funds scholarships and activities to support low-income, academically talented students in STEM. Any institution of higher education may apply, and the program supports a variety of projects. Designing and implementing a successful S-STEM project is challenging. The goal of this session is to catalyze a community of practice for S-STEM PIs. It will provide an opportunity to discuss lessons learned and best practices for proposal writing, project implementation, and providing student support. Specific topics to be discussed include the following: (1) Understanding the solicitation requirements and common proposal mistakes; (2) Scholar recruitment and data-driven approaches for selection; (3) Cohort building including activities for students from different majors or class years and integration of new students into existing cohorts; and (4) Remediation strategies including proactive interventions and peer support. Session leaders will introduce each topic; participants will then join a breakout group discussion of one topic. Lastly, participants will be invited to join a Slack workspace dedicated to S-STEM best practices and lessons.
