The CS-Ed Podcast's theme for season 2 is "Where should we go from here?" Three of the episodes focused on equity. This panel consists of all the podcast guests that spoke on this topic and the podcast host will serve as the moderator. In their episode, each panelist focused on a different aspect of equity, including cultural competence, supporting students of color, and how to make computer science education an integral and sustained part of learning through systemic change. This panel will be a conversation on equity by having the guests react to each other's episodes and to questions from the audience.
