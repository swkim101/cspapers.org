Estimating the complete 3D point cloud from an incomplete one lies at the core of many vision and robotics applications. Existing methods typically predict the complete point cloud based on the global shape representation extracted from the incomplete input. Although they could predict the overall shape of 3D objects, they are incapable of generating structure details of objects. Moreover, the partial input point sets obtained from range scans are often sparse, noisy and non-uniform, which largely hinder shape completion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling and hierarchical folding network (ASHF-Net) for robust 3D point cloud completion. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a denoising auto-encoder with an adaptive sampling module, aiming at learning robust local region features that are insensitive to noise. Second, we propose a hierarchical folding decoder with the gated skip-attention and multi-resolution completion goal to effectively exploit the local structure details of partial inputs. We also design a KL regularization term to evenly distribute the generated points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple 3D point cloud completion benchmarks.
