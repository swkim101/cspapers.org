This poster introduces a case study of redesigning an introductory CS course into fully online and its evaluation. The course redesigned is an introductory computer science course aiming to enhance non-CS major students' engagement. We applied flipped learning and active learning approach to the course design, utilizing interactive learning platforms. The proposed course offered a more immersive and satisfactory experience, even in a fully online course. The questionnaire results after the practice in the 2020 term showed that students rated significantly higher than that of 2019 in terms of difficulty level, amount of content, manner of delivery, course materials, consideration of course design, the structure according to the syllabus, learning outcomes, and satisfaction.
