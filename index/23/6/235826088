Inhomogeneous Poisson point processes are widely used models of event occurrences. We address adaptive sensing of Poisson Point processes , namely, maximizing the number of captured events subject to sensing costs. We encode prior assumptions on the rate function by modeling it as a member of a known reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). By partitioning the domain into separate small regions, and using heteroscedastic linear regression, we propose a tractable estimator of Poisson process rates for two feedback models: count-record , where exact locations of events are observed, and histogram feedback, where only counts of events are observed. We derive provably accurate anytime con-Ô¨Ådence estimates for our estimators for sequentially acquired Poisson count data. Using these, we formulate algorithms based on optimism that provably incur sublinear count-regret. We demonstrate the practicality of the method on problems from crime modeling, revenue maximization as well as environmental monitoring.
