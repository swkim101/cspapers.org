Canvas is one of the most widely used Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and, due to the pandemic, has become one of the primary tools many students use to access course content. Canvas provides everything that one would expect in a modern LMS: the ability to host and organize content; create, manage and grade assignments and quizzes; communicate via discussion boards and announcements; and integrate with external tools. But the devil is in the details, and Canvas suffers from significant shortcomings, some particular to computing courses, others that impede large course management and efficient instructor workflows. Participants in this BOF will share their successes, frustrations, failures, and workarounds using Canvas in computing courses. In the spirit of common commiseration, each participant will be welcome to highlight one "Canvas gripe", such as a specific example of poor usability or missing feature. (In the interest of time there's a limit of one gripe per person!)
