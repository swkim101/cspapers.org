In this workshop, participants will learn about how to integrate computational thinking and creative thinking activities that have been shown to significantly improve student learning and performance in their classes via rigorous research investigations. In particular, participants will be familiarized with the suite of Computational Creativity Exercises (CCEs) (which are non-programming-based, group-based, active learning exercises), practice hands-on how to complete such an CCE, learn about how to integrate and adapt them into their courses, and be exposed to the educational research studies behind the development, design, and administration of these CCEs. Participants will also learn how to conduct evidence-based educational research studies. Workshop sessions will include presentations, panel-based Q&A, an experience report, breakout group discussions, and hands-on activities. A suite of resources including the survey instruments, CCEs, implementation strategies, and research findings will be shared post-workshop.
