Synthetic data generation has been widely adopted in software testing, data privacy, imbalanced learning, machine learning explanation, etc. In such contexts, it is important to generate data samples located within “local” areas surrounding specific instances. Local synthetic data can help the learning phase of predictive models, and it is fundamental for methods explaining the local behavior of obscure classifiers. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a method based on generative operators allowing the synthetic neighborhood generation by applying specific perturbations on a given input instance. The key factor consists in performing a data transformation that makes applicable to any type of data, i.e., data-agnostic. Second, we design a framework for evaluating the goodness of local synthetic neighborhoods exploiting both supervised and unsupervised methodologies. A deep experimentation shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.
