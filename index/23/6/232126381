This panel explores experiences and insights from three successful propagators into how others can successfully encourage more wide-spread use of their innovations. Issues covered include designing for dissemination, techniques for recruiting potential adopters, suggestions for convincing faculty to try an innovation and continue using it, and identifying points of friction and overcoming resistance from administrators, students, and/or peers. These topics are discussed and illustrated with personal experiences and anecdotes from our illustrious panelists.
