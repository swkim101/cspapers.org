As with many other institutions, there is currently far more student interest in our undergraduate Computer Science major than we can accommodate. Our institution limits the capacity of the Computer Science major and uses a competitive, grades-based admission process for students to gain admission at the end of their first year of study. This competitive admission process has had a notable negative impact on the student experience in first-year, as students are especially driven to earn top grades. The competition also encourages students to prioritize academics over everything else. Although we are taking measures to improve the first-year experience, this competitive, grades-focused culture is still at risk of carrying forward into the subsequent years of our major. This is an issue on top of more widespread challenges faced by many CS programs in retaining students through to graduation. To improve the student experience of those admitted to a Computer Science major, we developed the Second-year Learning Community (SLC) program. This co-curricular program aims to foster a sense of community, and connect students to their peers and to other members of our academic and local tech communities. We report on our experience developing and offering the SLC program, including our program curriculum, and resources required. We also share feedback from participants, and outline lessons learned. Overall, the program was well-received by student participants, as well as by student and faculty mentors. It is a relatively low-cost initiative, and its success in Computer Science has led to expansion to nine other departments.
