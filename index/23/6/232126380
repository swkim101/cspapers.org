Long hours, lacking a sense of belonging, and fear of failure are just some of the stressors that affect Computer Science students and professionals alike, leading to burnout, anxiety, and depression. Although this issue is not unique to the field of computing, there is significant need for awareness and support around student mental health in the CS education community. However, while many CS educators recognize the importance of supporting their students' mental health, many feel ill-equipped to do so, are unsure if their approaches are helpful, and seek a community of educators with whom they can share ideas. Of particular concern is the mental health of students in underrepresented and marginalized groups within CS, particularly women, first-generation/low-income students, and members of the BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communities, as they struggle to cope with the unprecedented events of 2020, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the worldwide protests against systemic racial injustice, and the US Presidential election, all while participating in challenging academic courses. In this timely and important session, participants will have an opportunity to discuss the mental health issues that affect CS students, share resources that are available to students and educators, and describe their efforts to create and foster a culture of understanding and support for student mental health within their communities.
