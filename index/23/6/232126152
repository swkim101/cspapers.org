Labtainers are fully provisioned Linux-based computer science lab exercises with an initial emphasis on cybersecurity. Consistent lab execution environments and automated provisioning are provided by Docker containers. With over 50 lab exercises including multi-component networks that all run on a modestly performing laptop computer., Labtainers supports exploratory learning for both local and remote learners. They offer automated assessment of student lab activity and progress as well as individualized lab exercises to discourage sharing solutions. Free and open at: https://nps.edu/web/c3o/labtainers, Labtainers is distributed as a single virtual machine for either VirtualBox or VMWare. On an exercise-specific basis, the framework leverages Docker containers to instantiate one or more networked computers within that single VM. This hands-on workshop covers the basics of creating Labtainer-based labs, whether for security, networking, operating systems, or other computer science classes. The workshop also introduces how this lab framework helps remove three barriers to CS lab exercises: 1) administrative setup and resulting divergent behavior between student environments; 2) sharing of solutions amongst students; 3) assessing student work. Participants should have a computer running either VMWare or VirtualBox, with the Labtainers VM appliance installed.
