Multi-functional cells with cooperating teams of robots promise to be flexible, robust, and efficient and, thus, are a key to future factories. However, their programming is tedious and AI-based planning for multiple robots is computationally expensive. In this work, we present a modular and efficient two-layer planning approach for multi-robot assembly. The goal is to generate the program for coordinated teams of robots from an (enriched) 3D model of the target assembly. Although the approach is both motivated and evaluated with LEGO, which is a challenging variant of blocks world, the approach can be customized to different kinds of assembly domains.
