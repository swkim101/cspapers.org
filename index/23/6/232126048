The efforts for incorporating cultural competence in computer science curriculum will not only benefit the retention of marginalized students, but also, more importantly, educate students with a better understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion issues. This poster describes a programming lab for learning string matching algorithms and gaining knowledge of cultural competence at the same time. Specifically, this lab requires students to search a group of names from a word search puzzle and then order these names based on various naming conversions from different cultures. Overall, this poster demonstrates an example of infusing cultural competence into a programming lab.
