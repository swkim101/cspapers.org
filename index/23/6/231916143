This paper studies the adaptive reliable shortest path (RSP) planning problem in a Gaussian process (GP) regulated environment. With the reasonable assumption that the travel times of the underlying transportation network follow a multi-variate Gaussian distribution, we propose two algorithms namely, Gaussian process reactive path planning (GPRPP), and Gaussian process proactive path planning (GP4), to generate online adaptive routing policies for the reliable shortest path. Both algorithms take advantage of the posterior analytical representation of GPs given past and/or imagined future observations of certain links in the network, and calculate the corresponding adaptive routing strategy for RSP. Theoretical analysis and simulation results (on Sioux Falls Network and Singapore road networks) show the superior performance of GPRPP and GP4 over that of the state of the arts.
