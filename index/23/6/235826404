(Scalar case.) According to Definition 1 and Lemma 1, given large enough M , the domain (−∞,+∞) can be partitioned into M subintervals P = { [x0, x1], [x1, x2], · · ·, [xm−1, xm], · · ·, [xM−1, xM ] } , where −∞ = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xm−1 < xm < · · · < xM−1 < xM = +∞, such that any Kl-Lipschitz nonlinear activation function f̄ : R 7→ R on (−∞,+∞) become linear or near-linear on each subinterval. Therefore, f̄(x) can be rewrite as the piecewise function f̄ (x̂i)x w.r.t. variable x on M subintervals P , i.e., each piecewise function is approximately equivalent to a linear function with the slope of f̄ (x̂i) through the origin.
