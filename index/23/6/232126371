In this poster, we will present the initial results of a meta-aggregation study that synthesizes qualitative evidence to identify the charac- teristics of effective in-service teacher professional development programs (TPD) around computational thinking (CT) integration in K-12. In addition, we will discuss the importance of these char- acteristics in supporting teachers. We identified four synthesized findings representing the key characteristics of effective TPDs for CT integration in K-12 (e.g., improving teacher capacity in CT in- tegration, creating meaningful learning experiences, establishing research-practice partnership, and providing continuous and sus- tainable support).
