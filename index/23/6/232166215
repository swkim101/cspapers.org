Each presenter will introduce their assignment, give a quick demo, and describe its niche in the curriculum and its strengths and weaknesses. The presentations (and the descriptions below) merely introduce each assignment. For more detail, each assignment has its own web page, available from our home page http://nifty.stanford.edu, with assignment materials, handouts, data files, and whatnot. If you have an assignment that works well and would be of interest to the CSE community, consider applying to present at Nifty Assignments. Please see the nifty.stanford.edu home page for more information.
