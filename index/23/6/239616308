Given a directed, weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ undergoing edge insertions, the incremental single-source shortest paths (SSSP) problem asks for the maintenance of approximate distances from a dedicated source $s$ while optimizing the total time required to process the insertion sequence of $m$ edges. Recently, Gutenberg, Williams and Wein [STOC'20] introduced a deterministic $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ algorithm for this problem, achieving near linear time for very dense graphs. For sparse graphs, Chechik and Zhang [SODA'21] recently presented a deterministic $\tilde{O}(m^{5/3})$ algorithm, and an adaptive randomized algorithm with run-time $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n} + m^{7/5})$. This algorithm is remarkable for two reasons: 1) in very spare graphs it reaches the directed hopset barrier of $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{3/2})$ that applied to all previous approaches for partially-dynamic SSSP [STOC'14, SODA'20, FOCS'20] \emph{and} 2) it does not resort to a directed hopset technique itself. In this article we introduce \emph{propagation synchronization}, a new technique for controlling the error build-up on paths throughout batches of insertions. This leads us to a significant improvement of the approach in [SODA'21] yielding a \emph{deterministic} $\tilde{O}(m^{3/2})$ algorithm for the problem. By a very careful combination of our new technique with the sampling approach from [SODA'21], we further obtain an adaptive randomized algorithm with total update time $\tilde{O}(m^{4/3})$. This is the first partially-dynamic SSSP algorithm in sparse graphs to bypass the notorious directed hopset barrier which is often seen as the fundamental challenge towards achieving truly near-linear time algorithms.
