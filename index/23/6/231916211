Automatic latching for charging in a disturbed environment for Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USVs) is always a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a two-stage automatic latching system for USVs charging in berth. In Stage I, a vision-guided algorithm is developed to calculate an optimal latching position for charging. In Stage II, a novel latching mechanism is designed to compensate the movement misalignments from the water disturbance. A set of experiments have been conducted in real-world environments. The results show the latching success rate has been improved from 40% to 73.3% in the best cases with our proposed system. Furthermore, the vision-guided algorithm provides a methodology to optimize the design radius of the latching mechanism with respect to different disturbance levels accordingly. Outdoor experiments have validated the efficiency of our proposed automatic latching system. The proposed system improves the autonomy intelligence of the USVs and provides great benefits for practical applications.
