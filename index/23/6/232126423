As Computer Science undergraduate programs continue to increase in response to the still-unmet student demand, one growing trend is to engage current students as instructors of record, allowing for increases in course offerings and/or enrollments and giving these students extraordinary experiences in teaching. More and more programs are attempting to create sustainable and beneficial positions for student instructors as a way to handle current teaching needs as well as develop the next wave of teaching-track faculty. This BOF will enable a discussion of the why and how programs choose to engage students as instructors, including challenges, best practices, lessons learned, and tips for starting such a program. The discussion leaders can offer perspectives from differing approaches including student population (undergraduate vs. graduate), teaching context (summer vs. non-summer term, solo vs. shared teaching models), and support structures (administrative, mentorship, training) and will have former student teachers from their institutions participate in the small group discussions to reflect upon their experiences.
