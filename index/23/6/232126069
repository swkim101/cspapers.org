This paper discusses the results of partially replicating and modifying a study performed by Zingaro and Porter examining the relationship between fine grained clicker data from in class Peer Instruction and students' performance in quizzes and exams. Whereas Zingaro and Porter worked with a CS1 course, we worked with a sophomore software engineering course. We report overall answer correctness when students vote before and after PI discussion, track student response patterns from in-class to the quizzes and exam, and quantify absolute percentages of students that demonstrate longer-term learning from the PI process. Our results show that students who learn in class from PI perform well on the quizzes and the final exam, nearly as well as those who understood concepts prior to the classes in which those concepts were taught. We also found that those who fail to learn from the PI process in the class perform worse on quizzes and the final exam. We found PI to be an effective way to teach our software engineering course based on student learning before and after PI, a result unique to our study. Our results were consistent across the different topics in software engineering in which we employed PI.
