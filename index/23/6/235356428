Recent decentralized services such as Steemit and OpenBazaar have emerged to provide accountable social media and online e-commerce. However, despite being decentralized themselves, they still rely on a centralized or an insecure distributed search engine for end-user navigation, which makes such services vulnerable to censorship and privacy violation. This work presents D E S EARCH , the first decentralized search engine that guarantees the integrity and privacy of search results for decentralized services. D E S EARCH uses trusted hardware to build a network of pipelined lambdas , an enclave primitive for a small piece of outsourced job. Since each lambda only has a local view, D E S EARCH introduces a novel witness mechanism that implies the transitivity of lambdas to make this decentralized model externally verifiable. D E S EARCH enables fast verification for queries and can tolerate decentralized failures. We implement a D E S EARCH prototype for a decentralized social media and online market. Evaluation shows that D E S EARCH can scale horizontally in a decentralized environment and support 32 million requests per day on a 234 GB real-world dataset with 82M documents.
