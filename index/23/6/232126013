In order to fully prepare high-quality teachers to deliver on the promise of CS for All, teacher preparation programs must ensure teacher candidates have mastered both content and the pedagogy to teach that content well. University CS departments are well-positioned to teach the content, but "methods courses" are an important source of pedagogical and pedagogical content knowledge for future computer science teachers. This panel will describe a variety of approaches: Colleges of Education or CS departments; in-person, hybrid, or online course delivery; and standalone "CS Methods" courses or CS integrated in broader methods courses. Each panelist will describe their course. The moderator will elicit common features between the courses as well as the strengths and weaknesses between different approaches.
