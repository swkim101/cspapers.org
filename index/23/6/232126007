Community and technical colleges play a significant role in computing education by offering associate-degrees in a variety of ACM-recognized disciplines to a diverse student population. The ACM Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges (CCECC), a standing committee of the ACM Education Board, serves and supports community and technical college educators in all aspects of computing education, including curriculum and assessment development, advising on public policy and advocating for community and technical colleges throughout the world. The ACM CCECC has seen a growing need and interest to increase community college participation in ACM conferences, SIGs, and related activities. For example. community college educators are looking for avenues to identify funding opportunities for professional development and conferences; facilitate collaboration on grants and projects; and actively participate in webinars and informal discussions on topics tailored to community college computing educators. This Birds-of-a-Feather session will bring together those interested in community college computing education and open a dialog to identify and discuss unique issues of interest for this community. Discussion is open to topics across all computing disciplines to support community college educators and ultimately help increase their participation in SIGCSE and ACM activities.
