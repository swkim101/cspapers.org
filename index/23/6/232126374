Higher education institutions and their computer science departments have been strong supporters of K12 CS. One area that has not been explored in-depth is the use of concurrent enrollment (CE) programs to expand access to high school CS courses such as CS Principles or CS1. CE courses are those that are taught by an approved teacher in a high school. Unlike other programs that offer credit by exams (e.g., College Board's Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate), the context for concurrent enrollment varies with state and insitutional policies. However, CE programs also hold potential for broadening participation in computing with flexibility in timelines and assessments in alignment with local school contexts. We will facilitate discussion around what it takes to develop a CS CE program including teacher qualifications, aligning courses to majors or other college requirements, partnering with high schools, assessment standards, etc. CE programs also have the potential to support departmental Broadening Participation in Computing plans.
