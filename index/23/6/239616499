Let k,ℓ≥ 2 be two multiplicatively independent integers. Cobham’s famous theorem states that a set X⊆ ℕ is both k-recognizable and ℓ-recognizable if and only if it is definable in Presburger arithmetic. Here we show the following strengthening: let X⊆ ℕm be k-recognizable, let Y⊆ ℕn be ℓ-recognizable such that both X and Y are not definable in Presburger arithmetic. Then the first-order logical theory of (ℕ,+,X,Y) is undecidable. This is in contrast to a well-known theorem of Büchi that the first-order logical theory of (ℕ,+,X) is decidable.
