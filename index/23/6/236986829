Current state-of-the-art two-stage detectors generate oriented proposals through time-consuming schemes. This diminishes the detectors’ speed, thereby becoming the computational bottleneck in advanced oriented object detection systems. This work proposes an effective and simple oriented object detection framework, termed Oriented R-CNN, which is a general two-stage oriented detector with promising accuracy and efficiency. To be specific, in the first stage, we propose an oriented Region Proposal Network (oriented RPN) that directly generates high-quality oriented proposals in a nearly cost-free manner. The second stage is oriented R-CNN head for refining oriented Regions of Interest (oriented RoIs) and recognizing them. Without tricks, oriented R-CNN with ResNet50 achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy on two commonly-used datasets for oriented object detection including DOTA (75.87% mAP) and HRSC2016 (96.50% mAP), while having a speed of 15.1 FPS with the image size of 1024×1024 on a single RTX 2080Ti. We hope our work could inspire rethinking the design of oriented detectors and serve as a baseline for oriented object detection. Code is available at https://github.com/jbwang1997/OBBDetection.
