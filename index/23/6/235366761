In FaaS workﬂows, a set of functions implement application logic by interacting and exchanging data among themselves. Contemporary FaaS platforms execute each function of a workﬂow in separate containers. When functions in a workﬂow interact, the resulting latency slows execution. Faastlane minimizes function interaction latency by striving to execute functions of a workﬂow as threads within a single process of a container instance, which eases data sharing via simple load / store instructions. For FaaS workﬂows that operate on sensitive data, Faastlane provides lightweight thread-level isolation domains using Intel Memory Protection Keys (MPK). While threads ease sharing, implementations of languages such as Python and Node.js (widely used in FaaS applications) disallow concurrent execution of threads. Faastlane dynamically identiﬁes opportunities for parallelism in FaaS workﬂows and fork processes (instead of threads) or spawns new container instances to concurrently execute parallel functions of a workﬂow. We implemented Faastlane atop Apache OpenWhisk and show that it accelerates work-ﬂow instances by up to 15 × , and reduces function interaction latency by up to 99 . 95% compared to OpenWhisk.
