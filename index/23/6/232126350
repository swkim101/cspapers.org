Our goal is providing learning materials, which a learner already learned and will learn at coming terms, to make themself understand the relationship between the material they are just learning and others. For that reason, we analyzed the learning materials using chronological incremental TF-IDF [3] that considers the sequence of the materials. In this paper, we compared C-TF-IDF to normal TF-IDF for the learning materials of two courses, and found that C-TF-IDF is suitable for our purpose rather than N-TF-IDF.
