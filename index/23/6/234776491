With increasing frequency, users raise concerns about data privacy and protection in centralized Online Social Networks (OSNs), in which providers have the unprecedented privilege to access and exploit every user's private data at will. To mitigate these concerns, researchers have suggested to decentralize OSNs and thereby enable users to control and manage access to their data themselves. However, previously proposed decentralization approaches suffer from several drawbacks. To tackle their deficiencies, we introduce the Self-Organized Universe of People (SOUP). In this demonstration, we present a prototype of SOUP and share our experiences from a real-world deployment.
