This study examines the self-efficacy of prospective computer science teachers and the background factors that may be related to differences in their self-efficacy. The self-efficacy profiles of teachers were examined using cluster analysis, and three self-efficacy profiles were established. Then the differences between clusters were examined with respect to several categorical variables regarding their teaching background experiences. The results of this study show that teachers' self-efficacy for teaching computer science varies with their academic background, but not with other background characteristics like their amount of teaching experience or prior experience level with CS.
