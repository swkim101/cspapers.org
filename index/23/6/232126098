Debugging has been an expanding topic in K-12 computer science (CS) education research. However, few studies have focused on in-depth analysis of elementary students' debugging in block-based visual programming environments. Thus, using the video analysis technique, this basic interpretive qualitative study aimed to explore what debugging behaviors students exhibited and how these debugging behaviors mapped with an existing K-8 debugging learning trajectory (LT). Findings revealed five types of debugging behaviors and four primary challenges. These debugging behaviors mapped to five consensus goals in the K-8 debugging learning trajectory. Future research will focus on students' efficiency in using debugging strategies and understanding of debugging.
