For CS50 at Harvard, we have developed a suite of free, open-source tools to help students with writing, testing, and submitting programming assignments and to help teachers grade those assignments and check them for similarities. help50 parses often-cryptic error messages and explains them in beginner-friendly terms. check50 runs a set of automated tests on students' code, providing feedback on errors. style50 lints students' code, highlighting that don't adhere to the course's style guide. submit50 allows students to submit assignments to a GitHub repository, without students needing to have knowledge of git or version control themselves. And compare50 allows teachers to analyze submissions for similarity, looking for pairs or clusters of submissions that might be the result of improper collaboration. In this workshop, we'll introduce each of these tools and discuss how other teachers can use them in their own classrooms. Along the way, we'll discuss how to use the tools effectively, compare and contrast them with alternatives, identify how the tools have changed students' behavior for the better and for worse, and highlight pedagogical and technological changes we've made to redress the latter.
