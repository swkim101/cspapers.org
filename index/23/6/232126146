This workshop will be a tutorial on effective media production for computer science courses. We'll spend time breaking down the ways that you can use media in your courses, both live and pre-recorded. Good media production relies heavily on both well-planned curriculum and pre-production. As part of this, we'll focus on our work building courses around short 5-10 minute videos, which have been shown to encourage engagement from students. We'll discuss designing your content and process for efficient turn around, so that you can successfully build a course 'just in time'. The goal of the workshop is to share with participants the techniques we use in our own courses. We'll demo our workflows and favorite tools, with pointers on where to learn more. Along the way, we'll share how you can accomplish a well-produced video with minimal budgets, and where you can get the most out of adding hardware and software to your setup. This workshop will be highly interactive. For each topic, we'll start off with live demonstrations, but then spend time with hands-on questions from participants. Participants are encouraged to bring their questions and challenges to the workshop.
