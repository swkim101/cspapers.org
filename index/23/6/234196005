Hydrophilic nanomaterials have been extensively exploited their applications
in the field of hybrid water treatment membranes. However, some of the modification process
to nanomaterials may be complicated, and the nonselective pores caused by the poor compatibility
between nanoparticles and the polymer matrix impair the rejection efficiency for ultrafiltration application.
Thus, it is highly desirable to develop a kind of effective nano dopant with favorable
compatibility by a facile way for the preparation of ultrafiltration membranes.



The aim of this study was to fabricate a novel environmentally friendly and low-cost
nano additive with good compatibility for the preparation of ultrafiltration membranes.



Hydroxyapatite nanotubes were prepared via a biomimetic process, and then SA was
coated on the surface of hydroxyapatite nanotubes. Subsequently, a series of hybrid ultrafiltration
membranes were fabricated with different amounts of modified HANTs and polyethersulfone
(PES).



Exhaustive characterizations were conducted for the membranes, including hydrophilicity,
porosity, mean pore size, morphologies and UF performance test. The highest water flux of the hybrid
membranes displayed 1.9 times that of the original PES membrane. Meanwhile, the hybrid
membrane with 0.2% hydroxyapatite nanotubes obtained elevated antifouling ability, achieving a
flux recovery ratio of 85.6%.



The facile coating of SA endowed the nanotubes improved hydrophilicity and meanwhile
enhanced the compatibility between PES and HANTs. This work provides a facile way in the
construction of green nanofillers and promising results in the preparation of hybrid UF membranes.
