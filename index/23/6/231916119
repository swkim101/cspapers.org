Communication is one of the most popular and efficient means of multi-robot coordination. Due to potential real-world constraints, such as limited bandwidth and contested scenarios, a communication strategy requiring to send, for example, all n bits of an environment representation might not be feasible in situations where the robotsâ€™ data exchanges are frequent and large. To this end, we propose and implement lightweight, bandwidth-efficient, robot-to-robot communication protocols inspired by communication complexity results for data synchronization without exchanging the originally required n bits. We have tested our proposed approach both in simulation and with real robots. Simulation results show that the proposed method is computationally fast and enables the robots to synchronize the data (near) accurately while exchanging significantly smaller amounts of information (in the order of log n bits). Real-world experiments with two mobile robots show the practical feasibility of our proposed approach.
