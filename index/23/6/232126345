With the widespread use of WiFi nowadays, it is important to show students how WiFi access points can be exploited in practice. The theory behind exploiting WEP and WPA2 has been available for a number of years. However, it has not been easy to offer students the opportunity to apply these theories in a real environment. In this workshop, you will learn about the WEP weakness, the different hacking scenarios where WEP access points have connected clients versus no connected clients, and the WPA2 weakness. In addition, you will have the opportunity to hack up to four WEP access points in addition to a WPA2 access point. Then, you will learn how to build and configure an exploitable WiFi environment, with necessary access points, for your students to hack. You will learn how Raspberry Pis can be used to act as the necessary clients for the access points and have access to the Raspberry Pi scripts, as well as all access point configuration directions. We will discuss pros and cons of the different architectures which allow students' remote access to the vulnerable environment. Note: Participants must have a computer with at least 25GB of disk space available and VirtualBox installed.
