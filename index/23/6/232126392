Several studies have shown mixed results when presenting enhanced (simplified or extended) error messages to introductory programming students. In this work, we detail a pilot study using a tool specifically designed to capture data about students presented with different error messages. Initial data indicates that the tool is capable of capturing relevant data, and that future studies may show an impact of modifying error messages.
