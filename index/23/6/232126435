How do you design more responsible computing technologies? You start by training computer science (CS) students, the creators of tomorrow's tech, to think critically about their own action and responsibilities from the first day of their introductory programing course. The standard approach to the CS1 level curriculum needs evolve to make room for ethics instruction presenting students with difficult questions, provocative simulations, and time for personal reflection about ethics and the professional responsibilities of current and future computer scientists, software engineers and other technologists. This poster describes curriculum development work from the Computing Ethics Narratives (CEN) conducted by CS students and faculty engaged in critical thinking about ethical issues related to computing and technological innovation and its widespread influence on individuals and society. The presentation will provide examples of three computing ethics modules that have been piloted into CS1 and CS 2 level courses in both online and in-person settings. Early results of the pilot study are shared along with future work.
