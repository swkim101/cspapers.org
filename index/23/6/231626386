Mobile sensing and information technology have enabled us to collect a large amount of mobility data from human decision-makers, for example, GPS trajectories from taxis, Uber cars, and passenger trip data of taking buses and trains. Understanding and learning human decision-making strategies from such data can potentially promote individual's well-being and improve the transportation service quality. Existing works on human strategy learning, such as inverse reinforcement learning, all model the decision-making process as a Markov decision process, thus assuming the Markov property. In this work, we show that such Markov property does not hold in real-world human decision-making processes. To tackle this challenge, we develop a Trajectory Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (TrajGAIL) framework. It captures the long-term decision dependency by modeling the human decision processes as variable length Markov decision processes (VLMDPs), and designs a deep-neural-network-based framework to inversely learn the decision-making strategy from the human agent's historical dataset. We validate our framework using two real world human-generated spatial-temporal datasets including taxi driver passenger-seeking decision data and public transit trip data. Results demonstrate significant accuracy improvement in learning human decision-making strategies, when comparing to baselines with Markov property assumptions.
