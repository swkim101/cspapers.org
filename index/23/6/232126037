The benefits of increasing diversity in computing are well known, but the computing profession continues to struggle to become diverse.

This poster presents initial results of a survey of 288 undergraduate students to ascertain preferences for computing domains. The poster provides evidence of aspects of computing that appeal to underrepresented groups, including women.
