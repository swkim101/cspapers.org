Graph sparsiﬁcation is a powerful tool to approximate an arbitrary graph and has been used in machine learning over graphs. As real-world networks are becoming very large and naturally distributed, distributed graph sparsiﬁcation has drawn considerable attention. In this work, we design communication-efﬁcient distributed algorithms for constructing spectral vertex sparsiﬁers, which closely preserve effective resistance distances on a subset of vertices of interest in the original graphs, under the well-established message passing communication model. We prove that the communication cost approximates the lower bound with only a small gap. We further provide algorithms for constructing pair-wise spanners which approximate the shortest distances between each pair of vertices in a target set, instead of all pairs, and incur communication costs that are much smaller than those of existing algorithms in the message passing model. Experiments are performed to validate the communication efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms under the guarantee that the constructed sparsiﬁers have a good approximation quality.
