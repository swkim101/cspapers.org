In this paper, we propose a set-inversion approach to validate the controller of a nonlinear system that should satisfy some state constraints. We introduce the notion of follow set which corresponds to the set of all output vectors such that the desired dynamics can be followed without violating the state-constraints. This follow set can then be used to choose feasible trajectories that a mobile robot will be able to follow. An illustrative example with a robot towing a trailer is presented. This example is motivated by the safe control of a boat towing a marine magnetic sensor to find wrecks.
