We extend DatalogMTL—Datalog with operators from metric temporal logic—by adding stratified negation as failure. The new language provides additional expressive power for representing and reasoning about temporal data and knowledge in a wide range of applications. We consider models over the rational timeline, study their properties, and establish the computational complexity of reasoning. We show that, as in negation-free DatalogMTL, fact entailment in our language is PSPACE-complete in data and EXPSPACE-complete in combined complexity. Thus, the extension with stratified negation does not lead to higher complexity.
