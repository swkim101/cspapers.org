The necessity and benefits of broadening participation in computing and the roles that computing programs must play in addressing this challenge have been well documented. Elevating the social value of computing has been advocated as an approach to increasing the appeal of computing to both women and other underrepresented groups. This poster adds empirical support for that approach. It reports on the analysis of projects selected by students over four years of a two-semester senior capstone. In this capstone students select Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities with which to engage. The students learned about FOSS principles and processes and were introduced to humanitarian FOSS (HFOSS). They completed pre-semester surveys and engaged in a three-stage project selection process. The types of projects that students considered (FOSS or HFOSS) support the assertion that computing with social value is appealing to both females and students in underrepresented groups. Analysis of pre-semester attitude surveys adds additional insight and suggests further avenues for investigation.
