We propose a model of winners allocation. In this model, we are given are two elections where the sets of candidates may intersect. The goal is to find two disjoint winning committees from respectively the two elections that are subjected to certain reasonable restrictions. For our model, we first propose several desirable properties. Then, we investigate the implication relationships among these properties. Finally, we study the complexity of computing winners allocations providing these properties. For hardness results, we also study some fixed-parameter algorithms.
