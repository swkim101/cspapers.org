General education requirements delineate the core requirements that all students of a particular university must complete in order to graduate. These requirements are often indicative of how an institution views its core mission, leading to vastly different requirements at schools serving different student populations. Among institutions with a computing requirement, the expectations vary widely; some schools mandate programming courses for all students, while others require only a computer literacy course. As movements like CS for All seek to increase students' exposure to computing, potentially affecting general education requirements, it would be beneficial for universities to have a clear picture of what computing requirements exist and how common they are. We therefore propose an analysis to address the question of what computing's role is in the general education requirements of 4-year institutions in the United States. How common are computing requirements in the general education requirements? What is the nature of the requirement (e.g., programming vs. computer literacy) How do these requirements differ by institutional profile? We plan to analyze the course catalogues and general education requirements of approximately 100 randomly selected institutions. We will collect data on requirements that reference computing, including the number of courses or credits required in computing and in the entire general education core. We also plan to record specific courses that satisfy the computing requirement, as well as recommended courses for completing the requirement when the catalog contains such information.
