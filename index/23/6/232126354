Recently, many faculty have begun to engage students in free and open source software (FOSS) development both for pedagogical advantage and in response to increased student demand. Faculty see FOSS as providing authentic computing artifacts to enrich course content. Students see FOSS projects as a way to contribute to something real and develop their skills while building a portfolio of their work to share with potential employers. Despite these benefits, CS teachers and students have expressed frustration with the challenges of engaging with existing FOSS projects. This BOF will provide a forum for faculty and members of FOSS communities to exchange ideas and methods for engaging students in FOSS, including what did and did not work. The kinds of questions that often arise include whether to let students choose their own projects or select projects for them, and whether to establish mentoring relationships with the project community in advance, or to let students develop these relationships for themselves. Other questions often heard are whether to let students form their own work groups, assign the groups, or if students may work by themselves on a project. Conversely, there are FOSS projects that have questions on how to best engage qualified students. Participant input collected initially will be used to prioritize among the questions above.
