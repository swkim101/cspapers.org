We surveyed 533 CS2 students taught in an inverted classroom model either in an active learning classroom (ALC) or a traditional lecture hall, with both groups shifting to an online setting towards the end of term. Students perceived the ALC as more conducive to group work than a traditional classroom, while the online environment was perceived similarly by both groups of students, with those transitioning from an ALC having a less positive perception of collaborative engagement in an online context.
