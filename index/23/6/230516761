For mitigating joint impact torques, researchers have reduced joint stiffness by series elastic actuators, reflected inertia by low gear ratios, and friction torque from drive-trains. However, these impact mitigation methods may impair the control performance of contact forces or may increase motor and robot mass. This paper proposes a design method for achieving a balance between impact mitigation performance and force control fidelity. We introduce an inertia-to-square-torque ratio as a new index for integrating the parameters of torque generation (motor continuous torque limits, gear ratios, etc.) and the parameters of impact mitigation (joint stiffness, reflected inertia, etc.). In the process, we make a hypothesis that a motor mass is negatively correlated with the ratio. Based on the hypothesis, we calculate a joint breakdown region of impact torques, joint stiffnesses, and motor masses. Finally, we decide the drive-train specifications of JAXON3-P and demonstrate that the proposed method provides high impact mitigation and force control capabilities through several experiments including the jumping motion of 0.3 m COG height.
