Students often skip through instructional material without paying enough attention to the content, resulting in less understanding. Inspired by the Programmed Instruction (PI) technique, we implemented extensions to an eTextbook system to support instructional slideshows with a large number of interspersed questions. Students must answer a question correctly to pass to the next slide. This completely changes how students interact with the material. Our initial results show a significant increase in students' grades when they used PI for a Formal Languages course.
