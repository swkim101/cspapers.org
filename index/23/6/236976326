We study the problem of learning a Hamiltonian H to precision $\varepsilon$, supposing we are given copies of its Gibbs state $\rho =\exp(-\beta H)/\mathrm{Tr}(\exp(-\beta H))$ at a known inverse temperature $\beta$. Anshu, Arunachalam, Kuwahara, and Soleimanifar [AAKS21] recently studied the sample complexity (number of copies of $\rho$ needed) of this problem for geometrically local N-qubit Hamiltonians. In the high-temperature (low $\beta$) regime, their algorithm has sample complexity poly (N, 1/$\beta$, 1/$\varepsilon$) and can be implemented with polynomial, but suboptimal, time complexity. In this paper, we study the same question for a more general class of Hamiltonians. We show how to learn the coefficients of a Hamiltonian to error $\varepsilon$ with sample complexity $S=O(\log N/(\beta\varepsilon)^{2}$) and time complexity linear in the sample size, O(SN). Furthermore, we prove a matching lower bound showing that our algorithmâ€™s sample complexity is optimal, and hence our time complexity is also optimal. In the appendix, we show that virtually the same algorithm can be used to learn H from a real-time evolution unitary $e^{-i t H}$ in a small t regime with similar sample and time complexity.
