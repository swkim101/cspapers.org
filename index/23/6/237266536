The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) has promoted the widespread applications of person re-identification (ReID). However, ReID systems inherit the vulnerability of DNNs to malicious attacks of visually in-conspicuous adversarial perturbations. Detection of adversarial attacks is, therefore, a fundamental requirement for robust ReID systems. In this work, we propose a Multi-Expert Adversarial Attack Detection (MEAAD) approach to achieve this goal by checking context inconsistency, which is suitable for any DNN-based ReID systems. Specifically, three kinds of context inconsistencies caused by adversarial attacks are employed to learn a detector for distinguishing the perturbed examples, i.e., a) the embedding distances between a perturbed query person image and its top-K retrievals are generally larger than those between a benign query image and its top-K retrievals, b) the embedding distances among the top-K retrievals of a perturbed query image are larger than those of a benign query image, c) the top-K retrievals of a benign query image obtained with multiple expert ReID models tend to be consistent, which is not preserved when attacks are present. Extensive experiments on the Market1501 and DukeMTMC-ReID datasets show that, as the first adversarial attack detection approach for ReID, MEAAD effectively detects various adversarial attacks and achieves high ROC-AUC (over 97.5%).
