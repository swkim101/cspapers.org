Computing theory analyzes abstract computational models to rigorously study the computational difficulty of various problems. Introductory computing theory can be challenging for undergraduate students, and the overarching goal of our research is to help students learn these computational models. The most common pedagogical tool for interacting with these models is the Java Formal Languages and Automata Package (JFLAP). We developed a JFLAP server extension, which accepts homework submissions from students, evaluates the submission as correct or incorrect, and provides a witness string when the submission is incorrect. Our extension currently provides witness feedback for deterministic finite automata, nondeterministic finite automata, regular expressions, context-free grammars, and pushdown automata. In Fall 2019, we ran a preliminary investigation on two synchronized sections (Control and Study) of the required undergraduate course Introduction to Computer Science Theory. The Study section (n=29) used our extension for five targeted homework questions, and the Control section (n=35) submitted these problems using traditional means. The Study section strongly outperformed the Control section with respect to the percent of perfect homework grades for the targeted homework questions. Our most interesting result was student persistence: with only the short witness string as feedback, students voluntarily persisted in submitting attempts until correct.
