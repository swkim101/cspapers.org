Prior work has shown that the adjustment challenges faced by international students in English-speaking universities are primarily attributable to English language proficiency and culture. Although studies in computing education have documented the barriers that non-native English speakers face while learning CS using online programming platforms, little research has been done on their experiences in CS courses within a university setting. In this study, we seek to understand the experiences of non-native English speakers learning CS at a English-speaking university in the United States. Through weekly surveys and course grades from four CS courses, we investigate the differences between non-native and native English speakers with respect to the time spent studying outside of class, confidence levels at the start of a course, types of learning resources used, and expected and actual overall grades. We found that although non-native speakers require a higher minimum grade to be satisfied and often spend a longer time on average studying outside of class compared to native speakers, there was no difference in the actual grade received between the two groups. While there was no significant difference in the type of resources used (online vs in-person), there was a significant difference in the confidence level between native and non-native English speakers.
