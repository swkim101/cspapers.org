Technology is expanding worldwide and, in conjunction, so are opportunities for creative computing to aid communities and the need for an expanded workforce. Yet, there is a global disparity in where youth are learning programming, with the majority of computing instruction occurring in developed countries and urban areas, if it occurs at all in developing countries. In this work, we sought to counteract this trend by bringing computing, specifically physical computing in the form of robotics, to youth and young adults in rural El Salvador. In this paper, we present the robotics activities completed with youth in a small, Salvadoran community. Based on field notes of the activities and interviews with the youth who participated, we present both the successes and difficulties we faced carrying out this educational outreach program. We further explore the challenges faced due to this unique environment and lessons learned that can help inform the expansion of computing opportunities in developing nations.
