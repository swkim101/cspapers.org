The promise of Deep Neural Network (DNN) powered Internet of Thing (IoT) devices has motivated a tremendous demand for automated solutions to enable fast development and deployment of efficient (1) DNNs equipped with instantaneous accuracy-efficiency trade-off capability to accommodate the time-varying resources at IoT devices and (2) dataflows to optimize DNNsâ€™ execution efficiency on different devices. Therefore, we propose InstantNet to automatically generate and deploy instantaneously switchable-precision networks which operates at variable bit-widths. Extensive experiments show that the proposed InstantNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art designs. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/RICE-EIC/InstantNet.
