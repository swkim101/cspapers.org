Production systems operating on a growing domain of analytic services often require generating warm-start solution models for emerging tasks with limited data. One potential approach to address this challenge is to adopt meta learning to generate a base model that can be adapted to solve unseen tasks with minimal Ô¨Åne-tuning. This however requires the training processes of previous solution models of existing tasks to be synchronized. This is not possible if these models were pre-trained separately on private data owned by different entities and cannot be synchronously re-trained. To accommodate for such scenarios, we develop a new personalized learning framework that synthesizes customized models for un-seen tasks via fusion of independently pre-trained models of related tasks. We also establish performance guarantee for the proposed framework and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically.
