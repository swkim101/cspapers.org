We study extensions of the Election Isomorphism problem, focused on the existence of isomorphic subelections. Specifically, we propose the Subelection Isomorphism and the Maximum Common Subelection problems and study their computational complexity and approximability. Using our problems in experiments, we provide some insights into the nature of several statistical models of elections.
