This special session furthers the work associated with SIGCSE Reads and the growing community of SIGCSE members who connect to each other through science fiction. The goal of this session is to provide a practical experience addressing one of the five common goals presented previously: a learning experience for participants in how science fiction can be used in computing classrooms to teach ethics and develop CS students' facility for considering ethical situations with deeper critical thinking. Materials will be available so that the exercise can be translated to other classrooms. By providing this experience in a virtual format, participants will be able to translate it to their own setting, whether virtual or face-to-face. Building on an initial description of ethical frameworks, the exercise will be followed by discussion about ways to adapt, adjust and modify the exercise to incorporate other fictional works, to fit into a variety of courses, or to address different levels of learners.
