Bayesian networks are probabilistic graphical models with a wide

range of application areas including gene regulatory networks inference, risk

analysis and image processing. Learning the structure of a Bayesian

network (BNSL) from discrete data is known to be an NP-hard task with

a superexponential search space of directed acyclic graphs. In this

work, we propose a new polynomial time algorithm for discovering a

subset of all possible cluster cuts, a greedy algorithm for

approximately solving the resulting linear program, and a generalized

arc consistency algorithm for the acyclicity constraint. We embed

these in the constraint programming-based branch-and-bound solver

CPBayes and show that, despite being suboptimal, they improve

performance by orders of magnitude. The resulting solver also compares

favorably with GOBNILP, a state-of-the-art solver for the BNSL

problem which solves an NP-hard problem to discover each cut and

solves the linear program exactly.
