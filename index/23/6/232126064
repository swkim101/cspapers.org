In a review of student programming work (through playback of their submissions via online IDE), it was noted that students could be quite close to a successful solution and repeatedly start over, deleting all of the work done to that point in time. The words of Thomas Edison expressed the problem associated with this current branding: "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." While this is meant to imply that failure has led towards success, the idea that something "won't work" captures the mindset that students are facing when using the word 'failure' in regards to programming. In fact, iterations of programs move students incrementally closer to their goal. The notion of a binary concept like pass/fail being applied to programming leaves less room for creativity and exploration. Amongst new programming students, after reaching this point of 'passing', student fear of modifying and 'playing' with working programs has been noted. In order to address the concerns of students and help shift student mindsets away from 'failure' towards 'incremental improvement', a rebranding exercise must take place.
