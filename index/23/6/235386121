POWDER is a highly flexible, deeply programmable, and city-scale scientific instrument that enables cutting-edge research in wireless technologies. Researchers interact with the POWDER platform via the Internet to conduct their experiments, with zero penalty for remote access. In this two-part demonstration, the POWDER implementers show how to use the platform. First, they present the workflow that researchers follow to conduct experiments. Second, they highlight some of the hardware and software building blocks available through POWDER, including components related to over-the-air wireless and mobile networking, 5G, and massive MIMO.
