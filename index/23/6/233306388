ChromoUpdate is a texture transfer system for fast design iteration. For the early stages of design, ChromoUpdate provides a fast grayscale preview that enables a texture to be transferred in under one minute. Once designers are satisfied with the grayscale texture, ChromoUpdate supports designers in coloring the texture by transitioning individual pixels directly to a desired target color. Finally, if designers need to make a change to the color texture already transferred, ChromoUpdate can quickly transition individual pixels from one color to a new target color. ChromoUpdate accomplishes this by (1) using a UV projector rather than a UV LED, which enables pixels to be saturated individually rather than resetting the entire texture to black, and (2) providing two new texture transfer algorithms that allow for fast grayscale previews and color-to-color transitions. Our evaluation shows a significant increase in texture transfer speed for both the grayscale preview (89%) and color-to-color updates (11%).
