Abstract Strategy Games are games of no chance with complete information - all players (usually two) know all there is about the current position; nothing is hidden. Examples of popular games are Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, Checkers, Connect-4, Reversi, Mancala, Nim, Dots-and-Boxes, and Go; there are thousands more. In addition to the cultural history and remarkably beautiful mathematics locked within the strategies and game trees, we have found they form a wonderfully fertile, rich, and engaging source of activities around which to teach fundamentals of computer science. This panel will explore the ways in which we have used these games with our students, through interactive tutorials and reflection that will each surface a particular CS concept. After sharing best practices, we will invite the audience to contribute their own experiences.
