The primary purpose of PATHS (Path Ambassadors to High Success), an NSF-funded S-STEM scholarship program, is to create new pathways and strengthen existing pathways for academically talented, low-income Colorado high school and community college students to study computer science (CS) at Colorado School of Mines (Mines). PATHS has achieved the following major project goals: 1) Increase number of academically talented, low-income students studying CS in Colorado; 4) Increase retention of these students; 3) Establish an active on-campus community to support PATHS scholars and similar students; 4) Engage scholars to perform CS recruitment and outreach at area high schools and community colleges; 5) Evaluate PATHS activities through comparative analysis to provide new insights on best practices for attracting and retaining academically talented, low-income CS students; 6) Broaden participation of historically underrepresented groups in CS; and 7) Develop a new flexible degree program combining other STEM fields and CS. PATHS students are diverse (e.g., 40.8% from underrepresented groups in computing) and academically successful (e.g., mean GPA is 3.4). Thus far, the program has awarded scholarships to 49 students and retained 93.9% of the students. Of the 49 students, six have graduated and three of the six have also pursued a CS Master's degree.
