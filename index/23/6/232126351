The number of high schools offering computer science (CS) courses continues to increase. Unfortunately, we are still finding disparity of access and participation of Black and African American students. CS education should be inclusive to everyone to ensure all high school learners are equipped for the future. The Microsoft Philanthropies TEALS (Technology Education and Literacy in Schools) Program aims to improve this social injustice by bringing CS education to 620 schools serving primarily Black and African American students over the next 5 years. TEALS helps to build sustainable CS courses by pairing industry professionals with classroom teachers. Our efforts are to ensure the schools we support are representative of the demographics in their region and the enrollment in the CS classes are representative of the demographics in the school. We are doing this with local partners to listen, learn, build stronger CS communities, and increase impact. We will discuss our approach to improve CS access, recruitment, retention, and our goal to generate a diverse pipeline of students for the future workforce.
