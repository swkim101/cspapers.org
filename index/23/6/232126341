The goal of this research is to contribute a new component to challenge existing automated verification tools. This component is a generic copy capability extension to an existing map concept. It is designed with proper formal specifications and loop invariants so that it is amenable to verification. The map concept and the extension both avoid explicit references and aliasing. The copy capability is implemented using a loop that goes through the entire map, pulling out each value in the map to copy, and then placing that value back into the original map and its copy, thereby keeping the original map the same while creating the copy. Verification of the extension using the RESOLVE verifying compiler successfully generates verification conditions, though they are not proved automatically at this time. The copy extension can serve as an instructive example to teach Computer Science students about formal verification of iterative code with loop invariants.
