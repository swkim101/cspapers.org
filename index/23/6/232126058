Data structures and algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts introduced in the early stages of any undergraduate computing degree. Many students find DSA concepts challenging to learn, partly due to their abstract nature but also due to issues of low motivation. We examine these and other common difficulties faced by educators teaching DSA, and present a novel solution which combines a game-based learning approach with the use of engaging visualizations of algorithms in 2.5D. Game-based learning and algorithm visualizations are often employed in existing educational tools, but are rarely combined. Our game, DeCode, presents DSA concepts as in-game objects and animations within a 2.5D game-based world alongside traditional game-like mechanics such as progression. Feedback from an initial pilot study (n=51) suggests that students regard DeCode as an enjoyable and effective tool for learning DSA concepts. We also find evidence that DeCode's visualizations help students find efficient solutions to problems that have received prior attention in the literature, such as shifting all of the elements in an array.
