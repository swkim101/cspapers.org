Elementary schools throughout the United States are attempting to integrate computational thinking (CT) into their instruction, often without guidance from research about effective approaches for achieving particular CT goals. This cross-case study investigated the school-wide integration of CT in three elementary schools in a large urban school district in the Northeast that has a district-led CS for All initiative. Data included interviews with teachers, professional development providers, and school administrators as well as surveys from teachers and classroom observations in each participating school. Findings revealed three distinct approaches to integration: (a) single teacher leader-driven model, (b) scaffolded professional development model, and (c) intensive coaching model. These approaches reflect the visions set by administrators and teachers, methods used by professional development providers, and cultures of each school. Across the case studies, common pedagogical approaches included strategic use of both unplugged and plugged activities with a range of computational tools, a focus on collaborative project-based learning, and the use of CT-specific academic language to anchor new CT learning within the academic disciplines. The study highlighted advantages and challenges within each integration approach with implications for schools considering CT integration.
