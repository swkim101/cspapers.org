When did you know you wanted to be a teacher? Apparently for me it was second grade. Teachers were goddesses (I have to use the female noun here since I did not encounter a male teacher until I was in algebra in junior high school.) You respected them, and they knew it all. I wanted to be like that! Nineteen years later, after finishing high school, college, and graduate school, my wish came true. Come with me on a lifetime journey, always learning, always educating. I will share a variety of experiences that helped shape me personally and professionally. Hopefully they will help expand your horizons, offering you insights as to how to become an even better educator.
