Deep learning has been recently successfully applied to an ever larger number of problems, ranging from pattern recognition to complex decision making. However, several concerns have been raised, including guarantees of good generalization , which is of foremost importance. Despite numerous attempts, conventional statistical learning approaches fall short of providing a satisfactory explanation on why deep learning works.
