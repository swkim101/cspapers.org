Exact cover refers to the problem of finding subfamily

F of a given family of sets S whose universe

is D, where F forms a partition of D. Knuth’s Algorithm

DLX is a state-of-the-art method for solving

exact cover problems. Since DLX’s running

time depends on the cardinality of input S, it can be

slow if S is large. Our proposal can improve DLX

by exploiting a novel data structure, DanceDD,

which extends the zero-suppressed binary decision

diagram (ZDD) by adding links to enable efficient

modifications of the data structure. With DanceDD,

we can represent S in a compressed way and perform

search in linear time with the size of the structure

by using link operations. The experimental results

show that our method is an order of magnitude

faster when the problem is highly compressed.
