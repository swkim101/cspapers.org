This paper presents a reactive legged locomotion generation scheme that enables our quadruped robot CEN-TAURO to adapt to varying payloads while walking. The center-of-mass (CoM) trajectories are generated in real time in a model predictive control (MPC) fashion, trading off large stability margins against evenly stretched legs. Vertex-based zero-moment-point (ZMP) constraints are imposed to ensure quasi-static walking stability. A Kalman filter is then implemented to estimate the CoM states and the impact of external payloads which can vary online and affect/disturb the locomotion differently. The CoM estimation is used to update the MPC motion planner at every replanning instant so that the robot can react to unknown and time-varying payloads on the fly.We validate the proposed scheme through experimental trials where the robot walks on flat ground or steps on different surface levels while carrying heavy payloads. It is shown that the proposed reactive locomotion strategy enables the robot to carry 20 kg payloads, which is close to the maximum capacity of the robot arms.
