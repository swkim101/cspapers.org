Hurricanes are one of the most catastrophic natural forces with potential to inflict severe damages to properties and loss of human lives from high winds and inland flooding. Accurate long-term forecasting of the trajectory and intensity of advancing hurricanes is therefore crucial to provide timely warnings for civilians and emergency responders to mitigate costly damages and their life-threatening impact. In this paper, we present a novel online learning framework called JOHAN that simultaneously predicts the trajectory and intensity of a hurricane based on outputs produced by an ensemble of dynamic (physical) hurricane models. In addition, JOHAN is designed to generate accurate forecasts of the ordinal-valued hurricane intensity categories to ensure that their severity level can be reliably communicated to the public. The framework also employs exponentially-weighted quantile loss functions to bias the algorithm towards improving its prediction accuracy for high category hurricanes approaching landfall. Experimental results using real-world hurricane data demonstrated the superiority of JOHAN compared to several state-of-the-art learning approaches.
