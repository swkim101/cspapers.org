Visualization recommendation is important for exploratory analysis and making sense of the data quickly by automatically recommending relevant visualizations to the user. In this work, we propose the first end-to-end ML-based visualization recommendation system that leverages a large corpus of datasets and their relevant visualizations to learn a visualization recommendation model automatically. Then, given a new unseen dataset from an arbitrary user, the model automatically generates visualizations for that new dataset, derives scores for the visualizations, and outputs a list of recommended visualizations to the user ordered by effectiveness. We also describe an evaluation framework to quantitatively evaluate visualization recommendation models learned from a large corpus of visualizations and datasets. Through quantitative experiments, a user study, and qualitative analysis, we show that our end-to-end ML-based system recommends more effective and useful visualizations compared to existing state-of-the-art rule-based systems.
