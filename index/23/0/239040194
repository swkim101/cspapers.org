Feature-based lidar odometry methods have attracted increasing attention due to their low computational cost. However, theoretically analysis of the effect of extracted features on pose estimation is still lacked. In this paper, we propose a method of key-feature selection for lightweight lidar inertial odometry, KFS-LIO, to further enhance the real-time performance by selecting the most effective subset of lidar feature constraints. Aiming at explaining the correlation between the feature distribution and state errors, a quantitative evaluation method of lidar constraints is introduced. In addition, to avoid recalculating the reprojection matrices in de-skewing step, we use the intermediate variables in IMU preintegration to compensate for lidar motion distortion. The experimental results demonstrate that KFS-LIO can reduce half of the LOAM features and provide comparable accuracy with the state-of-the-art odometry.
