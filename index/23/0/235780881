This work presents MapleBoard: a set of opensource hardware tools to implement predictable cache coherence protocols in hardware. MapleBoard consists of the following: (1) a novel domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying coherence protocols and synthesizing the corresponding hardware; and, (2) a real-time multicore hardware platform that seamlessly integrates the coherence protocols synthesized from the DSL. This platform has a memory hierarchy, a real-time bus interconnect between cores, and various predictable arbiters. As a demonstration of MapleBoardâ€™s efficacy, we explore hardware implementations of data bus organizations, and their impact on the worstcase communication latency (WCL). An important discovery we make is that a dedicated data bus (DDB) organization that allows bidirectional data communication offers lower analytical WCL bounds than any state-of-the-art predictable cache coherence protocols. The analytical WCL bounds are improved by 84%, 90% and 94% for 2-core, 4-core and 8-core systems respectively compared to prior works. We synthesize MapleBoard on the Xilinx Virtex Ultrascale+ VCU1525 board, and validate using both synthetic workloads and SPLASH-2 benchmark suite.
