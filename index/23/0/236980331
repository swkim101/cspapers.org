Detecting crop rows from video frames in real time is a fundamental challenge in the field of precision agriculture. Deep learning based semantic segmentation method, namely U-net, although successful in many tasks related to precision agriculture, performs poorly for solving this task. The reasons include paucity of large scale labeled datasets in this domain, diversity in crops, and the diversity of appearance of the same crops at various stages of their growth. In this work, we discuss the development of a practical real-life crop row detection system in collaboration with an agricultural sprayer company. Our proposed method takes the output of semantic segmentation using U-net, and then apply a clustering based probabilistic temporal calibration which can adapt to different fields and crops without the need for retraining the network. Experimental results validate that our method can be used for both refining the results of the U-net to reduce errors and also for frame interpolation of the input video stream.
