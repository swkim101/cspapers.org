Recommendation systems are used widely across many industries, such as e-commerce, multimedia content platforms and social networks, to provide suggestions that a user will most likely consume or connect; thus, improving the user experience. This motivates people in both industry and research organizations to focus on personalization or recommendation algorithms, which has resulted in a plethora of research papers. While academic research mostly focuses on the performance of recommendation algorithms in terms of ranking quality or accuracy, it often neglects key factors that impact how a recommendation system will perform in a real-world environment. These key factors include but are not limited to: business metric definition and evaluation, recommendation quality control, data and model scalability, model interpretability, model robustness and fairness, and resource limitations, such as computing and memory resources budgets, engineering workforce cost, etc. The gap in constraints and requirements between academic research and industry limits the broad applicability of many of academia's contributions for industrial recommendation systems. This workshop aspires to bridge this gap by bringing together researchers from both academia and industry. Its goal is to serve as a venue through which academic researchers become aware of the additional factors that may affect the adoption of an algorithm into real production systems, and how well it will perform if deployed. Industrial researchers will also benefit from sharing the practical insights, approaches, and frameworks as well.
