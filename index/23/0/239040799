In this paper, the configuration transformation of Wheel-Legged Robot (WLR) is studied, which can enable the robot to change its multilinks configuration on Inverted Equilibrium Manifold (IEM), while keeping balance with a small location drift on the floor. First of all, the general form of dynamics equation of planar Articulated Wheeled Inverted Pendulum (AWIP) with a wheel and n âˆ’ 1 rigid links, is derived. The Partial Feedback Linearization (PFL) combined with a Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is used to design the inverse dynamics controller of AWIP, while considering full dynamics terms. The well-known WLR model is used as a simple example of AWIP to accomplish the configuration transformation task. An optimization based configuration transformation algorithm is proposed to realize a comprehensive optimization of the shortest path in joint space and the minimum location drift of WLR on the floor. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through simulation to implement the configuration transformation task.
