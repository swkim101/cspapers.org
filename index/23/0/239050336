We consider a matching problem in a bipartite graph $G=(A\cup B,E)$ where nodes in $A$ are agents having preferences in partial order over their neighbors, while nodes in $B$ are objects without preferences. We propose a polynomial-time combinatorial algorithm based on LP duality that finds a maximum matching or assignment in $G$ that is popular among all maximum matchings, if there exists one. Our algorithm can also be used to achieve a trade-off between popularity and cardinality by imposing a penalty on unmatched nodes in $A$. We also provide an $O^*(|E|^k)$ algorithm that finds an assignment whose unpopularity margin is at most $k$; this algorithm is essentially optimal, since the problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete and $\mathsf{W}_l[1]$-hard with parameter $k$. We also prove that finding a popular assignment of minimum cost when each edge has an associated binary cost is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard, even if agents have strict preferences. By contrast, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for the variant of the popular assignment problem with forced/forbidden edges. Finally, we present an application in the context of housing markets.
