Standard frame-based cameras that sample light intensity frames are heavily impacted by motion blur for high-speed motion and fail to perceive scene accurately in high-dynamic range environments. Event-based cameras, on the other hand, overcome these limitations by asynchronously detecting the variation in individual pixel intensities. However, event cameras only capture pixels in motion, leading to sparse information. Hence, estimating the overall dense behavior of pixels is difficult. To address aforementioned issues associated with both sensors, we present Fusion-FlowNet, a sensor fusion framework for energy -efficient optical flow estimation. Fusion-FlowNet utilizes both frame- and event-based sensors, leveraging their complementary characteristics. Our proposed network architecture is also a fusion of Spiking Neural Net-works (SNNs) and Analog Neural Networks (ANNs) where each network is designed to simultaneously process asynchronous event streams and regular frame-based images, respectively. We perform end-to-end training using unsupervised learning to avoid expensive video annotations. Our method generalizes well across distinct environments (rapid motion and challenging lighting conditions) and demonstrates state-of-the-art optical flow prediction on the Multi-Vehicle Stereo Event Camera (MVSEC) dataset. Furthermore, the usage of SNNs in our architecture offers substantial savings in terms of the number of network parameters and computational energy cost.
