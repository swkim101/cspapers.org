Data is one of the most critical resources in the AI Era. While substantial research has been dedicated to training machine learning models using various types of data, much less efforts have been invested in the exploration of assessing and governing data assets in end-to-end processes of machine learning and data science, that is, the pipeline where data is collected and processed, and then machine learning models are produced, requested, deployed, shared and evolved. To provide a state-of-the-art overall picture of this important and novel area and advocate the related research and development, we present a tutorial addressing two essential problems. First, in the pipeline of machine learning, how can data and machine learning models be priced properly so that contributions from various parties can be assessed and recognized in a fair manner? Second, in the collaboration among many parties in building, distributing and sharing machine learning models, how can data as assets be managed? Accordingly, the first part of our proposal surveys data and model pricing in the pipeline of machine learning, while the second part discusses data asset governance for collaborative artificial intelligence. Each part is self-contained. At the same time, the two parts echo each other and connect a series of interesting and important problems into a dynamic big picture.
