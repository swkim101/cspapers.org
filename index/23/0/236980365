The MLHat workshop aims to bring together academic researchers and industry practitioners to discuss the open challenges, potential solutions, and best practices to deploy machine learning at scale for security defense. The workshop will discuss related topics from both defender perspectives (white-hat) and the attacker perspectives (black-hat). We call the workshop MLHats, to serve as a place for people who are interested in using machine learning to solve practical security problems. The workshop will focus on defining new machine learning paradigms under various security application contexts and identifying exciting new future research directions. At the same time, the workshop will also have a strong industry presence to provide insights into the challenges in deploying and maintaining machine learning models and the much-needed discussion on the capabilities that the state-of-the-arts failed to provide.
