Building an intelligent dialogue system capable of naturally and coherently conversing with humans has been a long-standing goal of artificial intelligence. In the past decade, with the development of machine/deep learning technology and the explosive growth of available conversation data in social media, numerous neural models have been developed for context-response matching tasks in retrieval-based dialogue systems, with more fluent and informative responses compared with generative models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in response selection for retrieval-based dialogues. In particular, we first formulate the problem of response selection and review state-of-the-art context-response matching models categorized by their architecture.

Then we summarize some recent advances on the research of response selection, including incorporation with extra knowledge and exploration on more effective model learning. Finally, we highlight the challenges which are not yet well addressed in this task and present future research directions.
