This paper offers a multi-layer planning approach for autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) that must adhere to good seamanship practices and the International Regulations for Prevention of Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) [1]. The approach combines novel situational awareness logic with motion primitive-based planners in a receding horizon framework. Further, ship domain and ship arena concepts are used to develop risk metrics that capture COLREGS compliance and the notion of good seamanship. By relying on metrics-driven motion planning as opposed to rule-based conditions, the proposed framework scales naturally to non-trivial single-vessel and multi-vessel situations. The planner is evaluated using adaptive, simulation-based testing to statistically compare the performance to other standard methods. Finally, proof-of-concept field experiments are presented on a subscale platform.
