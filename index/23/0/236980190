This workshop aims to serve as a forum for the presentation of research related to data quality assessment and remediation in AI/ML pipeline. Data quality is a critical issue in the data preparation phase and involves numerous challenging problems related to detection, remediation, visualization and evaluation of data issues. The workshop aims to provide a platform to researchers and practitioners to discuss such challenges across different modalities of data like structured, time series, text and graphical. The aim is to attract perspectives from both industrial and academic circles.
