Most existing person re-identification methods are effective in short-term scenarios because of their appearance dependencies. However, these methods may fail in long-term scenarios where people might change their clothes. To this end, we propose an adversarial feature disentanglement network (AFD-Net) which contains intra-class reconstruction and inter-class adversary to disentangle the identity-related and identity-unrelated (clothing) features. For intra-class reconstruction, the person images with the same identity are represented and disentangled into identity and clothing features by two separate encoders, and further reconstructed into original images to reduce intra-class feature variations. For inter-class adversary, the disentangled features across different identities are exchanged and recombined to generate adversarial clothes-changing images for training, which makes the identity and clothing features more independent. Especially, to supervise these new generated clothes-changing images, a re-feeding strategy is designed to re-disentangle and reconstruct these new images for image-level self-supervision in the original image space and feature-level soft-supervision in the disentangled feature space. Moreover, we collect a challenging Market-Clothes dataset and a real-world PKU-Market-Reid dataset for evaluation. The results on one large-scale short-term dataset (Market-1501) and five long-term datasets (three public and two we proposed) confirm the superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art methods.
