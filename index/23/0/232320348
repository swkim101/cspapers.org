A fundamental question in the theory of reinforcement learning is: suppose the optimal $Q$-function lies in the linear span of a given $d$ dimensional feature mapping, is sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) possible? The recent and remarkable result of Weisz et al. (2020) resolved this question in the negative, providing an exponential (in $d$) sample size lower bound, which holds even if the agent has access to a generative model of the environment. One may hope that this information theoretic barrier for RL can be circumvented by further supposing an even more favorable assumption: there exists a \emph{constant suboptimality gap} between the optimal $Q$-value of the best action and that of the second-best action (for all states). The hope is that having a large suboptimality gap would permit easier identification of optimal actions themselves, thus making the problem tractable; indeed, provided the agent has access to a generative model, sample-efficient RL is in fact possible with the addition of this more favorable assumption. This work focuses on this question in the standard online reinforcement learning setting, where our main result resolves this question in the negative: our hardness result shows that an exponential sample complexity lower bound still holds even if a constant suboptimality gap is assumed in addition to having a linearly realizable optimal $Q$-function. Perhaps surprisingly, this implies an exponential separation between the online RL setting and the generative model setting. Complementing our negative hardness result, we give two positive results showing that provably sample-efficient RL is possible either under an additional low-variance assumption or under a novel hypercontractivity assumption (both implicitly place stronger conditions on the underlying dynamics model).
