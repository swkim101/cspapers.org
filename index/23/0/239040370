This paper aims to present a drone swarm light show design platform to support STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics) education for K-12 children. With this platform, children can use this platform to design a drone swarm light show easily. To this end, the architecture of this platform contents three layers: UI layer, command layer, and physical layer. The UI layer has an easy-to-use interface for children. Children can feed parameters about the light show by clicking buttons and dragging sliders of four tracks. All actions designed for the swarm in the UI layer will be generated automatically in the form of the droneâ€™s desired trajectories through the command layer. The physical layer includes a router for communication and a drone swarm for the light show. Our experimental results demonstrate that this platform works efficiently and suits for being applied to real STEAM education.
