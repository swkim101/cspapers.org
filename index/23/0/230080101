Cooperative robotics is a trending topic nowadays as it makes possible a number of tasks that cannot be performed by individual robots, such as heavy payload transportation and agile manipulation. In this work, we address the problem of cooperative transportation by heterogeneous, manipulator- endowed robots. Specifically, we consider a generic number of robotic agents simultaneously grasping an object, which is to be transported to a prescribed set point while avoiding obstacles. The procedure is based on a decentralized leader-follower Model Predictive Control scheme, where a designated leader agent is responsible for generating a trajectory compatible with its dynamics, and the followers must compute a trajectory for their own manipulators that aims at minimizing the internal forces and torques that might be applied to the object by the different grippers. The Model Predictive Control approach appears to be well suited to solve such a problem, because it provides both a control law and a technique to generate trajectories, which can be shared among the agents. The proposed algorithm is implemented using a system comprised of a ground and an aerial robot, both in the robotic Gazebo simulator as well as in experiments with real robots, where the methodological approach is assessed and the controller design is shown to be effective for the cooperative transportation task.
