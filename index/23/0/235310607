The use of virtual collections of data is often essential in several

data and knowledge management tasks. In the literature, the standard

way to define virtual data collections is via views, i.e., virtual

relations defined using queries. In data and knowledge bases, the

notion of views is a staple of data access, data integration and

exchange, query optimization, and data privacy. In this work, we

study views in Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) systems.

OBDA is a powerful paradigm for accessing data through an

ontology, i.e., a conceptual specification of the domain of interest

written using logical axioms. Intuitively, users of an OBDA system

interact with the data only through the ontology's conceptual lens. We

present a novel framework to express natural and sophisticated forms

of views in OBDA systems and introduce fundamental reasoning tasks for

these views. We study the computational complexity of these tasks and

present classes of views for which these tasks are tractable or at

least decidable.
