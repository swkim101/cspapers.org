Abusive behavior in online retail websites and communities threatens the experience of regular community members. Such behavior often takes place within a complex, dynamic, and large-scale network of users interacting with items. Detecting abuse is challenging due to the scarcity of labeled abuse instances and complexity of combining temporal and network patterns while operating at a massive scale. Previous approaches to dynamic graph modeling either do not scale, do not effectively generalize from a few labeled instances, or compromise performance for scalability. Here we present BiDyn, a general method to detect abusive behavior in dynamic bipartite networks at scale, while generalizing from limited training labels. BiDyn develops an efficient hybrid RNN-GNN architecture trained via a novel stacked ensemble training scheme. We also propose a novel pre-training framework for dynamic graphs that helps to achieve superior performance at scale. Our approach outperforms recent large-scale dynamic graph baselines in an abuse classification task by up to 14% AUROC while requiring 10x less memory per training batch in both open and proprietary datasets.
