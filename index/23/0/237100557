This paper presents a conversational lifelog mining system, ConvLogMiner, which detects personal life events from the human online conversation in real-time. Given a daily conversation of two speakers, ConvLogMiner identifies the new life events specific to each speaker that occur in the latest utterances. The lifelogs mined by our system are useful to provide complementary information to support lifestyle analysis and memory assistance service.
