Language scaling aims to deploy Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications economically across many countries/regions with different languages. Language scaling has been heavily invested by industry since many parties want to deploy their applications/services to global markets. At the same time, scaling out NLP applications to various languages, essentially a data science problem, remains a grand challenge due to the huge differences in the morphology, syntaxes, and pragmatics among different languages. We present a comprehensive survey and tutorial on language scaling. We start with a clear problem description for language scaling and an intuitive discussion on the overall challenges. Then, we outline two major categories of approaches to language scaling, namely, model transfer and data transfer. We present a taxonomy to summarize various methods in literature. A large part of the tutorial is organized to address various types of NLP applications. Finally, we discuss several important challenges in this area and future directions.
