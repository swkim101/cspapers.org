As a fundamental component in the autonomous driving technology stack, High Definition Maps (HD map) provide high-precision descriptions of the environment. It enables extremely accurate perception and localization while improving the efficiency of path planning. However, the HD mapâ€™s extremely large data volume poses great challenges for the real-time and safety requirements of autonomous driving. Based on our real-world deployment experiences, we first demonstrate how the existing data transmission mechanism is weak in supporting HD map services. To address this problem, we propose an HD map data service mechanism on top of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) data transmission under a tight time and energy budget. By this mechanism, the selected road side unit (RSU) nodes cooperate on map provisioning tasks and transmit HD map data proportionately. Furthermore, we model the real-time map data service into a partial knapsack problem and develop a greedy data transmission algorithm. Experimental results confirm that the proposed mechanism can ensure the real-time HD map data service meanwhile meeting the energy limits.
