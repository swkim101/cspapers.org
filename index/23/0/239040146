It is challenging to develop an online path planning algorithm for Ackermann-steering vehicles to find collision-free and kinematically-feasible paths, that is efficient for dense environments, adaptable to various environments, and suitable for environments with narrow passages. In this paper, we propose a kinematically constrained RRT-based path planning algorithm integrating with a trajectory parameter space (TP-space) with three novel improvements to meet the above requirements. In specific, we introduce a new way to choose candidate nodes to expand the tree for an RRT-based algorithm, which can significantly increase the success rate of the expansion and improve the efficiency of the algorithm. We also introduce a procedure to incrementally adjust the step size for the expansion, which enables the algorithm to automatically adapt to various environments. At last, we integrate rapidly-exploring random vines (RRV) with a TP-space to handle kinematic constraints and improve the performance of the algorithm to expand the tree through a narrow passage. We also prove that the algorithm is probabilistic complete and asymptotically near-optimal. An ablation study shows that all three improvements can notably improve the performance of the RRT-based path planning algorithm. We also evaluate the algorithm in various environments. The experimental results show that our algorithm achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art. The source code is available at https://github.com/PengJieb/fastbkrrt.
