Python is becoming a popular language for building online web services in many companies. To improve online service robustness, this paper presents a new framework, called P Y L IVE , to enable on-the-ﬂy code change. P Y L IVE leverages the unique language features of Python, meta-object protocol and dynamic typing, to support dynamic logging, proﬁling and bug-ﬁxing without restarting online services. P Y L IVE requires no modiﬁcation to the underlying runtime systems (i.e., Python interpreters), making it easy to be adopted by online services with little portability concern. We evaluated P Y L IVE with seven Python-based web applications that are widely used for online services. From these applications, we collected 20 existing real-world cases, including bugs, performance issues and patches for evaluation. P Y L IVE can help resolve all the cases by providing dynamic logging, proﬁling and patching with little overhead. Additionally, P Y L IVE also helped diagnose two new performance issues in two widely-used open-source applications.
