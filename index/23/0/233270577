Forest fire disasters are recently getting lots of attention due to climate change globally. Globally, climate changes are rapidly changing the fire patterns on Earth. Effective fire management requires accurate information about the fire occurrence, its spread, and impact on the environment. Prediction of fire activities in the forest guides the authorities to make optimal, efficient, and sound decisions in fire management. This paper aims to summarize recent trends in the forest fire events prediction, detection, spread rate, and mapping of the burned areas. Furthermore, fire emissions in terms of smoke also put the Earth's public health and ecological system at greater risk.
