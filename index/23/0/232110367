We consider the problem of computing a (pure) Bayes-Nash equilibrium in the first-price auction with continuous value distributions and discrete bidding space. We prove that when bidders have independent subjective prior beliefs about the value distributions of the other bidders, computing an $\varepsilon$-equilibrium of the auction is PPAD-complete, and computing an exact equilibrium is FIXP-complete.
