InfOCF-Web provides implementations of system P and system Z inference, and of inference relations based on c-representation with respect to various inference modes and different classes of minimal models. It has an easy-to-use online interface for computing ranking models of a conditional knowledge R, and for answering queries and comparing inference results of nonmonotonic inference relations induced by R.
