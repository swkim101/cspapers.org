The 1st Workshop on City Brain Research examines the current challenges and recent breakthroughs related to intelligent urban transportation. The workshop will be organized in a novel form --- offering debates on three main components involved in the transportation policy development cycle: data collection, policy learning, and the effects on human behavior. The organizers intend to invite speakers and attendees from different backgrounds, ranging from computer science, transportation, to urban planning. The final outcomes include live discussions of the three consistent topics, a comprehensive annual report summarizing current practices and future directions, and a detailed tutorial on the workshop day.
