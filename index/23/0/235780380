Intelligent unmanned systems (IUSs) are distributed systems composed of multiple agents that share information or cooperate to accomplish specific complex tasks. Agents of the IUS are capable of perception, cognition, control, decision-making, and action. In some cases, the environmental situation and task objectives faced by the IUSs are constantly changing with time. Thus, IUSs are time-sensitive systems. To accelerate the task execution time and response speed, IUSs use artificial intelligence technology to increase the speed and quality of the ‘observation-orientation-decision-action’ (OODA) cycle of task execution. IUSs will tend to decompose the system into different functional units in the future, and individuals take different task roles from the functional perspective of OODA. The system is evolving from a linear OODA cycle of individuals to a cooperative OODA (Co-OODA) with different node roles. At present, the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is the mainstream method to solve IUSs cooperation problems. However, it does not adapt to the Co-OODA with different roles; and cannot maximize the Co-OODA system’s potential. This paper introduces the role-based Co-OODA system. Furthermore, we propose and design a role-based deep reinforcement learning framework and its corresponding information sharing mechanism.
