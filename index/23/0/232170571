In this paper, we introduce a complete system for autonomous flight of quadrotors in dynamic environments with onboard sensing. Extended from existing work, we develop an occlusion-aware dynamic perception method based on depth images, which classifies obstacles as dynamic and static. For representing generic dynamic environment, we model dynamic objects with moving ellipsoids and fuse static ones into an occupancy grid map. To achieve dynamic avoidance, we design a planning method composed of modified kinodynamic path searching and gradient-based optimization. The method leverages manually constructed gradients without maintaining a signed distance field (SDF), making the planning procedure finished in milliseconds. We integrate the above methods into a customized quadrotor system and thoroughly test it in real-world experiments, verifying its effective collision avoidance in dynamic environments.
