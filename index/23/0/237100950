Gaussian Bayesian networks are widely used for modeling the behavior of continuous random variables. Lifting exploits symmetries when dealing with large numbers of isomorphic random variables. It provides a more compact representation for more efficient query answering by encoding the symmetries using logical variables. This paper improves on an existing lifted representation of the joint distribution represented by a Gaussian Bayesian network (lifted joint), allowing overlaps between the logical variables. Handling overlaps without grounding a model is critical for modelling real-world scenarios.

Specifically, this paper contributes (i) a lifted joint that allows overlaps in logical variables and (ii) a lifted query answering algorithm using the lifted joint. Complexity analyses and experimental results show that - despite overlaps - constructing a lifted joint and answering queries on the lifted joint outperform their grounded counterparts significantly.
