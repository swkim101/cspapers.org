With advancement of recent network and chip technologies, IoT devices are becoming smarter with increasing compute power, bandwidth, and storage available on the device. This enables intelligent decision making and information transferring on the devices and unleashes the power of AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) that supports scenarios such as smart city/agriculture/manufacturing/health care and self-driving scenarios. The AIoT Workshop is a forum for researchers, scientists, engineers, and practitioners to share and learn AI powered IoT solutions. The AIoT is a multi-disciplinary area, which include but not limited to IoT, AI/ML, embedded systems, and networking. The 4th AIoT workshop will be hosted virtually in conjunction with the 27th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2021). The workshop program consists of keynote(s), invited talks, accepted technical paper presentations, as well as an indoor location competition panel.
