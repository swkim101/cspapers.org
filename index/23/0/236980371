Real-world super platforms such as Google and WeChat usually have different recommendation scenarios to provide heterogeneous items for users' diverse demands. Multi-domain recommendation (MDR) is proposed to improve all recommendation domains simultaneously, where the key point is to capture informative domain-specific features from all domains. To address this problem, we propose a novel Adversarial feature translation (AFT) model for MDR, which learns the feature translations between different domains under a generative adversarial network framework. Precisely, in the multi-domain generator, we propose a domain-specific masked encoder to highlight inter-domain feature interactions, and then aggregate these features via a transformer and a domain-specific attention. In the multi-domain discriminator, we explicitly model the relationships between item, domain and users' general/domain-specific representations with a two-step feature translation inspired by the knowledge representation learning. In experiments, we evaluate AFT on a public and an industrial MDR datasets and achieve significant improvements. We also conduct an online evaluation on a real-world MDR system. We further give detailed ablation tests and model analyses to verify the effectiveness of different components. Currently, we have deployed AFT on WeChat Top Stories.
