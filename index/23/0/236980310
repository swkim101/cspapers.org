Live-streaming platforms have recently gained significant popularity by attracting an increasing number of young users and have become a very promising form of online shopping. Similar to the traditional online shopping platforms such as Taobao, live-streaming platforms also suffer from online malicious fraudulent behaviors where many transactions are not genuine. The existing anti-fraud models proposed to recognize fraudulent transactions on traditional online shopping platforms are inapplicable on live-streaming platforms. This is mainly because live-streaming platforms are characterized by a unique type of heterogeneous live-streaming networks where multiple heterogeneous types of nodes such as users, live-streamers, and products are connected with multiple different types of edges associated with edge features. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on a heterogeneous graph neural network for LIve-streaming Fraud dEtection (called LIFE). LIFE designs an innovative heterogeneous graph learning model that fully utilizes various heterogeneous information of shopping transactions, users, streamers, and items from a given live-streaming platform. Moreover, a label propagation algorithm is employed within our LIFE framework to handle the limited number of labeled fraudulent transactions for model training. Extensive experimental results on a large-scale Taobao live-streaming platform demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the baseline models in terms of fraud detection effectiveness on live-streaming platforms. Furthermore, we conduct a case study to show that the proposed method is able to effectively detect fraud communities for live-streaming e-commerce platforms.
