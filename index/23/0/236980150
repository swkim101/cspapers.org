The 4th Workshop on Heterogeneous Information Network Analysis and Applications (HENA 2021) is co-located with the 27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners in the field and provide a forum for sharing new techniques and applications in heterogeneous information network analysis. This workshop has an exciting program that spans a number of subtopics, such as heterogeneous network embedding and graph neural networks, data mining techniques on heterogeneous information networks, and applications of heterogeneous information network analysis. The workshop program includes several invited speakers, lively discussion on emerging topics, and presentations of accepted research papers.
