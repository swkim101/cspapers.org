User-Generated text is a rich source of user insights and experiences that can be very helpful in many different daily life situations, such as when deciding what product to buy, what hotel to stay, what company to apply for a job, what region to buy a house, etc. This kind of text also plays a very relevant role in current research efforts in academic research groups, technology companies, as well as big publishers, telecommunications players, recruiting and job-market focuses organizations, etc. The goal of this new workshop is to bring together researchers interested in the application of novel techniques in AI/ML/NLP and Knowledge Discovery to address challenges around harnessing text-heavy user-generated data that is available to organizations and over the Web. The workshop program contains invited speakers, contributed talks, poster sessions and a discussion panel
