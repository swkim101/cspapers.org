When demand increases beyond the system capacity, riders in ride-hailing/ride-sharing systems often experience long waiting time, resulting in poor customer satisfaction. This paper proposes a spatiotemporal pricing framework (AP-RTRS) to alleviate this challenge and shows how it naturally complements state-of-the-art dispatching and routing algorithms. Specifically, the pricing optimization model regulates demand to ensure that every rider opting to use the system is served within reasonable time: it does so either by reducing demand to meet the capacity constraints or by prompting potential riders to postpone service to a later time. The pricing model is a model-predictive control algorithm that works at a coarser temporal and spatial granularity compared to the real-time dispatching and routing, and naturally integrates vehicle relocations. Simulation experiments indicate that the pricing optimization model achieves short waiting times without sacrificing revenues or geographical fairness.
