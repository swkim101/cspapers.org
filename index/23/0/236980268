The first international Workshop on Programming Language Processing presents interdisciplinary contributions that address programming language procession problems with machine learning and data mining techniques. Recently, there are lots of successful natural language processing methods. But the mining of programming languages could not exactly follow the manner of natural language processing. The difference between natural language and programming language brings in new research challenges and opportunities. The workshop will bring together researchers from machine learning, data mining and software engineering to discuss and debate the path forward for mining the value of programming languages.
