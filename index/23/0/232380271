Search-based methods that use motion primitives can incorporate the systemâ€™s dynamics into the planning and thus generate dynamically feasible MAV trajectories that are globally optimal. However, searching high-dimensional state lattices is computationally expensive. Local multiresolution is a commonly used method to accelerate spatial path planning. While paths within the vicinity of the robot are represented at high resolution, the representation gets coarser for more distant parts. In this work, we apply the concept of local multiresolution to high-dimensional state lattices that include velocities and accelerations. Experiments show that our proposed approach significantly reduces planning times. Thus, it increases the applicability to large dynamic environments, where frequent replanning is necessary.
