Deep neural networks (DNNs) have became one of the most high performing tools in a broad range

of machine learning areas. However, the multilayer non-linearity of the network architectures prevent

us from gaining a better understanding of the models’ predictions. Gradient based attribution

methods (e.g., Integrated Gradient (IG)) that decipher input features’ contribution to the prediction

task have been shown to be highly effective yet requiring a reference input as the anchor for explaining

model’s output. The performance of DNN model interpretation can be quite inconsistent with

regard to the choice of references. Here we propose an Adversarial Gradient Integration (AGI) method

that integrates the gradients from adversarial examples to the target example along the curve of steepest

ascent to calculate the resulting contributions from all input features. Our method doesn’t rely on

the choice of references, hence can avoid the ambiguity and inconsistency sourced from the reference

selection. We demonstrate the performance of our AGI method and compare with competing methods

in explaining image classification results. Code is available from https://github.com/pd90506/AGI.
