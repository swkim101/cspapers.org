Many recommender systems deployed in the real world rely on categorical user-profiles and/or pre-calculated recommendation actions that stay static during a user session. Recent trends suggest that recommender systems should model user intent in real time and constantly adapt to meet user needs at the moment or change user behavior in situ. In addition, there have been many advances that make online and adaptive recommender systems (OARS) feasible, scalable, and more sophisticated. This workshop aims to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia and industry to discuss the challenges and approaches to implement OARS algorithms and systems and improve user experiences by better modeling and responding to user intent.
