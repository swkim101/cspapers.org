Driven by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, demand for oropharyngeal swab sampling (OP-swabs) is surging. However, medical staff can easily become infected by the virus during the sampling process. In an effort to combat this, we developed a novel, intrinsically safe rigid- flexible coupling (RFC) manipulator to improve the safety and reliability of OP-swab sampling to test for COVID-19, which is presented herein. Suitable sampling areas and the necessary contact force for OP-swab sampling tasks are carefully investigated, and three typical sampling paths outlined that could be performed by a robotic system. This is followed by a detailed description of an intrinsically safe bionic micro-pneumatic actuator (MPA) that was designed and fabricated as the main component of the RFC manipulator. The developed RFC manipulatorâ€™s kinematic modeling, motion planning, and force control capacities were designed for OP-swab sampling scenarios. The system was then validated using both an oral cavity phantom and human volunteers, with comparative experiments on the swab quality of the OP-swab sampling approach conducted in both robotic and manual modes. The results indicate that fully-automated sampling based on this design would be feasible.
