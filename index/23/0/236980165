Fast and efficient access to environmental and life data is key to the successful disaster response. Vehicular crowdsourcing (VC) by a group of unmanned vehicles (UVs) like drones and unmanned ground vehicles to collect these data from Point-of-Interests (PoIs) e.g., possible survivor spots and fire site, provides an efficient way to assist disaster rescue. In this paper, we explicitly consider to navigate a group of UVs in a 3-dimensional (3D) disaster workzone to maximize the amount of collected data, geographical fairness, energy efficiency, while minimizing data dropout due to limited transmission rate. We propose DRL-DisasterVC(3D), a distributed deep reinforcement learning framework, with a repetitive experience replay (RER) to improve learning efficiency, and a clipped target network to increase learning stability. We also use a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) with multi-head-relational attention (MHRA) for spatial modeling, and add auxiliary pixel control (PC) for spatial exploration. We designed a novel disaster response simulator, called "DisasterSim", and conduct extensive experiments to show that DRL-DisasterVC(3D) outperforms all five baselines in terms of energy efficiency when varying the numbers of UVs, PoIs and SNR threshold.
