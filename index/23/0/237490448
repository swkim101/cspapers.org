We study the online influence maximization (OIM) problem in social networks, where in multiple rounds the learner repeatedly chooses seed nodes to generate cascades, observes the cascade feedback, and gradually learns the best seeds that generate the largest cascade. We focus on two major challenges in this paper. First, we work with node-level feedback instead of edge-level feedback. The edge-level feedback reveals all edges that pass through information in a cascade, whereas the node-level feedback only reveals the activated nodes with timestamps. The node-level feedback is arguably more realistic since in practice it is relatively easy to observe who is influenced but very difficult to observe from which relationship (edge) the influence comes. Second, we use standard offline oracles instead of offline pair-oracles. To compute a good seed set for the next round, an offline pair-oracle finds the best seed set and the best parameters within the confidence region simultaneously, and such an oracle is difficult to compute due to the combinatorial core of the OIM problem. So we focus on how to use the standard offline influence maximization oracle which finds the best seed set given the edge parameters as input. In this paper, we resolve these challenges for the famous independent cascade (IC) diffusion model. The past research only achieves edge-level feedback, while we present the first optimal regret algorithm for the node-level feedback. For the first challenge above, we apply a novel adaptation of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach to learn the graph parameters and its confidence region (a confidence ellipsoid). For the second challenge, we adjust the update procedure to dissect the confidence ellipsoid into confidence intervals on each parameter, so that the standard offline influence maximization oracle is enough.
