Hypertree width is a prominent hypergraph invariant with many

 algorithmic applications in constraint satisfaction and

 databases. We propose a novel characterization for hypertree width

 in terms of linear elimination orderings. We utilize this

 characterization to generate a new SAT encoding that we evaluate on

 an extensive set of benchmark instances. We compare it to

 state-of-the-art exact methods for computing optimal hypertree

 width. Our results show that the encoding based on the new

 characterization is not only significantly more compact than known

 encodings but also outperforms the other methods.
