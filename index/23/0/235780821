Detecting heart diseases has been a research interest for centuries. Many of these approaches are based on heartbeat analysis using a stethoscope and some of these are digitally analyzed. In an ordinary system, doctors use an acoustic stethoscope to detect any aberration in the heartbeat and predict atypical conditions of the human heart. One major problem is that the frequency range and intensity of the heart sounds are flat as well as the sound may contain noise. Hence, even a cardiac specialist doctor may encounter difficulties to analyze the heart sound perfectly. This paper describes a new methodology to detect heart diseases by examining heart sounds in real-time. We consider the guts sound as our input data. Our methodology uses a deep learning approach to determine whether a patient has any disease or is healthy. To achieve that, we integrated an electronic stethoscope and a software solution known as a heartbeat audio classifier. Our proposed system solution should be able to differentiate normal heartbeats and heart murmurs with a prediction of probable heart problem type in real-time. We believe our approach assists in reducing the cardiac arrest rate.
