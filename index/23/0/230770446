We study FO+, a fragment of first-order logic on finite words, where monadic predicates can only appear positively. We show that there is an FO-definable language that is monotone in monadic predicates but not definable in FO+. This provides a simple proof that Lyndonâ€™s preservation theorem fails on finite structures. We additionally show that given a regular language, it is undecidable whether it is definable in FO+.
