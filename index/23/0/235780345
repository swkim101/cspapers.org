Wireless sensing devices compose the major physical components of Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems which in recent years we have witnessed their rapid deployment in both consumer and industrial applications to support diverse sensing and control services [1]. Most of those sensing devices however are battery powered, and they require significant economic and human resources to replace or charge the batteries frequently to maintain proper operations. To overcome this issue, an ever-growing number of IoT devices are now being powered by harvesting ambient energy sources, which are mostly unreliable and not controllable. By contrast, emerging RF-based energy harvesting technologies [2] provide key benefits in terms of being wireless and controllable to provide sustainable energy supply. The IoT systems relying on RF-based energy harvesting technologies are in general called wireless powered communication networks (WPCN).
