Route planning and recommendation have attracted much attention for decades. In this paper, we study a continuous optimal route combination problem: Given a dynamic road network and a stream of trip queries, we continuously find an optimal route combination for each new query batch over the query stream such that the total travel time for all routes is minimized. Each route corresponds to a planning result for a particular trip query in the current query batch. Our problem targets a variety of applications, including traffic-flow management, real-time route planning and continuous congestion prevention. The exact algorithm bears exponential time complexity and is computationally prohibitive for application scenarios in dynamic traffic networks. To address this problem, a self-aware batch processing algorithm is developed in this paper. Extensive experiments offer insight into the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.
