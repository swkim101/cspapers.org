Real time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system which is designed to execute tasks in a guaranteed time. In this paper, we introduce SylixOS - a powerful and open source RTOS. As an industrial RTOS, SylixOS has been used in aerospace, military and many more embedded devices. We introduce the development path and some advanced features of SylixOS. In addition, SylixOS also supports the multiprocess. We discuss how SMP scheduling algorithms can be applied in SylixOS. Performance evaluations of SylixOS are presented to assess the real-time efficiency of SylixOS.
