The present work focuses on the development of an efficient path controller to guide a fixed-wing UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) to follow a closed curve and avoid unknown dynamic obstacles. Our strategy is composed of two layers: a top level layer responsible for guidance and a lower level layer responsible for tracking the references given by the top level. To solve the guidance problem, we propose a vector field strategy that switches between two forms: a vector field to converge and circulate the target curve and a vector field to avoid obstacles by circulating the closest one. To make the fixed-wing UAV follow the velocity provided by the guidance vector field we consider a Model Predictive Control scheme. The feedback linearization allows efficient computation of control commands as a linear MPC controller can be employed. Our results are validated in simulations that take into account the 6DOF (Degrees of Freedom) model with constraints of the aircraft, wind disturbance and uncertainties on the measurements.
