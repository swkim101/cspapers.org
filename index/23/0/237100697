Diagnosis and treatment for Parkinson’s disease rely on the evaluation of motor functions, which is expensive and time consuming when performing at clinics. It is also difficult for patients to record correct movements at home without the guidance from experienced physicians. To help patients with Parkinson’s disease get better evaluation from inhome recorded movement videos, we developed an interactive video acquisition and learning system for clinical motor assessments. The system provides real-time guidance with multi-level body keypoint tracking and analysis to patients, which guarantees correct understanding and performing of clinical tasks. We tested its effectiveness on healthy subjects, and the efficiency and usability on patient groups. Experiments showed that our system enabled high quality video recordings following clinical standards, benefiting both patients and physicians. Our system provides a novel learningbased telemedicine approach for the care of patients with Parkinson’s disease.
