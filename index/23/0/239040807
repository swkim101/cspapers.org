Biological observations on tetrapods locomotion deduce that anti-phase synchronization (APS) between fore and rear parts is beneficial for achieving a high-speed walking. On the other hand, theoretical analysis and experimental studies on quadruped robots suggest that a flexible spine potentially improves the gait efficiency and adaptability via smoothing the ground collisions. However, these two mechanisms have never been placed together by a comprehensive investigation in terms of their synergetic effect. Namely, an advanced principle is still lacking in combining the APS and the spine flexibility for quadruped walking robots. To address this issue, we construct a mathematical model for a quadruped dynamic walker under different spine conditions. First, the APS effect is generated via entrainment-based control method under a rigid spine condition. Then, flexible spines realized by three kinds of springs are compared with the rigid one via theoretical analysis. The results suggest that the APS mechanism and the flexible spine can be synergized via an appropriate deformation control. The theoretical findings not only uncover locomotion control mechanisms for quadruped walking robots, but also provide additional understandings of tetrapods dynamic walking from a mechanical engineering point of view.
