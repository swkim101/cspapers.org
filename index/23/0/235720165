In this paper, we consider the absorption effect for the problem of single image reflection removal. We show that the absorption effect can be numerically approximated by the average of refractive amplitude coefficient map. We then reformulate the image formation model and propose a two-step solution that explicitly takes the absorption effect into account. The first step estimates the absorption effect from a reflection-contaminated image, while the second step recovers the transmission image by taking a reflection-contaminated image and the estimated absorption effect as the input. Experimental results on four public datasets show that our two-step solution not only successfully removes reflection artifact, but also faithfully restores the intensity distortion caused by the absorption effect. Our ablation studies further demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on the recovery of overall intensity and has good model generalization capacity.
