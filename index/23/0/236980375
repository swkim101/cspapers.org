The existing multi-view clustering algorithms require that a sample in a view is completely or partially mapped onto one or more samples in a different corresponding view. However, this requirement could not be satisfied in many practical applications. Fortunately, there is a common cognition that the graph structure formed from each view should be as consistent as possible. Thus, this paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering method for unknown mapping relationships between cross-view samples based on the framework of non-negative matrix factorization, as an attempt to solve this problem. The objective function is designed by effectively building reconstruction error terms, local structural constraint terms, and cross-view mapping loss terms by exploring cross-view relationships. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only performs well to reveal the real mapping relationships between cross-view samples but also outperforms the comparison algorithms on the obtained clustering results.
