GUI testing is an essential part of regression testing for Android apps. For regression GUI testing to remain effective, it is important that obsolete GUI test scripts get repaired after the app has evolved. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named GUIDER to automated repair of GUI test scripts for Android apps. The key novelty of the approach lies in the utilization of both structural and visual information of widgets on app GUIs to better understand what widgets of the base version app become in the updated version. A supporting tool has been implemented for the approach. Experiments conducted on the popular messaging and social media app WeChat show that GUIDER is both effective and efficient. Repairs produced by GUIDER enabled 88.8% and 54.9% more test actions to run correctly than those produced by existing approaches to GUI test repair that rely solely on visual or structural information of app GUIs.
