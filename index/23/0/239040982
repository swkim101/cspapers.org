In spite of recent high attention of the biohybrid robot system, the previous researches focused on actuation system depend on simple on/off control without feedback control. To solve this problem, we proposed a soft sensor for feedback control of a bio-actuator driven by skeletal muscle. The proposed soft sensor can measure contraction forces of the proposed bio-actuator [1]. The bio-actuator was constructed with tendon structure and culture template made by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). It generated contraction forces at 0.3 mN when applying electrical stimulation. To measure that kind of small amount of contraction forces (0.3 mN), we fabricated a soft sensor using liquid metal, Galinstan, and HTV-2000. At first, we measured the Young’s modulus of the bioactuator and sensor and then fabricated the soft sensor having 68.52 kPa of Young’s modulus that is similar the bioactuator (45.8 kPa). Next, we simulated the sensor to estimate the resistance change according to the applied force. Since the resistance change is too small, we design the circuit to amplify the signal. Then, we detect very small resistance at milli-ohm. In addition, we analyzed time response to detect signal of actuator faster than 200 ms. As a result, the proposed sensor can measure the force of bioactuator without time delay.
