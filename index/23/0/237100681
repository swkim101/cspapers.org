This paper reviews current AI solutions towards road traffic congestion alleviation. Three specific AI technologies are discussed, (1) intersection management protocols for coordinating vehicles through a roads intersection in a safe and efficient manner, (2) road pricing protocol that induce optimized traffic flow, and (3) partial or full autonomous driving that can stabilize traffic flow and mitigate adverse traffic shock waves. The paper briefly presents the challenges affiliated with each of these applications along with an overview of state-of-the-art solutions. Finally, real-world implementation gaps and challenges are discussed.
