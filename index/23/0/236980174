Time series data are ubiquitous. Rapid advances in diverse sensing technologies, ranging from remote sensors to wearables and social sensing, are generating a rapid growth in the size and complexity of time series archives. This has resulted in a fundamental shift away from parsimonious, infrequent measurement to nearly continuous monitoring and recording. This demands development of new tools and solutions. The goals of this workshop are to: (1) highlight the significant challenges that underpin learning and mining from time series data (e.g. irregular sampling, spatiotemporal structure, and uncertainty quantification), (2) discuss recent algorithmic, theoretical, statistical, or systems-based developments for tackling these problems, and (3) synergize the research activities and discuss both new and open problems in time series analysis and mining.
