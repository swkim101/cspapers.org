Facing the difficulty and inefficiency of creating and maintaining High-Definition (HD) maps in our commercial deployments, we have developed an edge-based crowdsourcing task distribution framework for HD Map in autonomous driving. Our key observation is that: HD map data crowdsourcing exhibits the diminishing marginal utility thus there exists an inflection point for maximum utility, meanwhile its premature convergence of utility will leave some map updates not notified in time. Based on this observation, we develop a periodic crowdsourcing task distribution framework. It discretizes the demands for collecting source data into different periods and uses an optimal stopping rule to terminate the data collection for the maximum crowdsourcing utility. The experimental results verify that our crowdsourcing framework can achieve high time coverage and high efficiency with lower cost.
