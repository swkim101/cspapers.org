Traditional deep learning methods are based on the condition that the data is of high-quality, which means the data information is highly available. However, data in these scenes often have the characteristics of large background noise, lack of sample content, small target, serious occlusion and a small number of samples. The application of related tasks in real open scenarios is very important, so it is urgent to make full use of these incomplete information data accurately.
