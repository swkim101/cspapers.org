Budget allocation for online advertising suffers from multiple complications, including significant delay between the initial ad impression to the call to action as well as cold-start prediction problems for ad campaigns with limited or no historical performance data. To address these issues, we introduce the Contextual Budgeting System (CBS ), a budget allocation framework using a multi-agent system of contextual & continuous Multi-Armed Bandits. Our proposed solution decomposes the problem into a convex optimization problem whose objective is drawn using Thompson Sampling. In order to efficiently deal with context and cold-start, we propose a transfer learning mechanism using supervised learning methods that augment simple parametric models. We apply an implementation of this algorithm to all spending for new driver acquisition at Lyft and measure a (22 Â± 10)% improvement in the mean Cost Per user Acquisition (CPA) over a previous non-contextual model, based on Markov Chain Monte-Carlo, generating tens of millions of dollars annually in efficiency improvements while also increasing total user acquisition.
