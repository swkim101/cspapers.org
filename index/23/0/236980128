Human-natural systems involve complex interdependent processes, but domain specific processes are traditionally studied in non-overlapping research silos. The Predictive Risk Investigation SysteM (PRISM) for multi-layer dynamic interconnection analysis is a group of collaborators across multiple domains who work to discover data driven connections specifically among domain risks. We bring our inter-disciplinary approach to risk assessment to our KDD'21 workshop. Our workshop is a step toward a holistic approach to systemic risk analysis by welcoming speakers in applied and technical research at the forefront of risk and complex systems.
