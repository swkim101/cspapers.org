The autonomous robots consisting of an immovable lander and a rover are widely deployed to explore extraterrestrial planets. However, these robots have two main limitations: (1) the separate design for lander and rover respectively results in heavy mass and big volume of the whole system, which increases the launching cost sharply; (2) the roverâ€™s detection area has to be restricted to the vicinity of the immovable lander. To overcome these problems, we designed a novel six-legged mobile repetitive lander called "HexaMRL", which integrates the functions of both lander and rover, including folding, deploying, repetitive soft-landing, and walking. A hybrid compliant mechanism taking advantages of both active and passive compliances was adopted on its leg. An integrated drive unit (IDU) was utilized to imitate the dynamics of a spring and a damper to absorb the landing impact energy, while the structure remains intact. Moreover, a control method based on state machine for soft-landing on the Moon was proposed. HexaMRL achieved repetitive soft-landing on a 5-DoF lunar gravity testing platform (5-DoF-LGTP) with a vertical landing velocity of 1.9 m/s and a payload of 140 kg. The drive torque safety margin is improved by 23.4%p based on the hybrid compliant leg comparing with the standalone active compliant leg.
