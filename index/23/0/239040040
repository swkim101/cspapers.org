Despite their soft and compliant bodies, most of today’s soft robots have limitations when it comes to elongation or extension of their main structure. In contrast to this, a new type of soft robot called the eversion robot can grow longitudinally, exploiting the principle of eversion. Eversion robots can squeeze through narrow openings, giving the possibility to access places that are inaccessible by conventional robots. The main drawback of these types of robots is their limited bending capability due to the tendency to move along a straight line. In this paper, we propose a novel way to fuse bending actuation with the robot’s structure. We devise an eversion robot whose body forms both the central chamber that acts as the backbone as well as the actuators that cause bending and manoeuvre the manipulator. The proposed technique shows a significantly improved bending capability compared to externally attaching actuators to an eversion robot showing a 133% improvement in bending angle. Due to the increased manoeuvrability, the proposed solution is a step towards the employment of eversion robots in remote and difficult-to-access environments.
