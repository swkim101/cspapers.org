Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a commonly diagnosed movement disorder with more than 10 million patients worldwide. Its clinical evaluation relies on a rating system called MDS-UPDRS, which includes subjective and error-prone motor examinations. This paper proposes an objective and interpretable visual system (PD-Net ) to quantitatively evaluate motor function of PD patients using video footage. The PD-Net consists of three modules: 1) a pose detector to infer 21 hand keypoints directly from RGB videos, 2) a movement analysis module to study temporal patterns of hand keypoints and discover motor symptoms, and 3) a scoring module to predict MDS-UPDRS ratings with retrieved symptoms. Trained with an in-house clinical dataset, PD-Net can effectively handle the unique challenges of PD examination videos, such as clinically-defined gestures, distinct self-occlusion/foreshortening effect and contextual background. And it detects hand keypoints of PD patients with an average accuracy of 84.1%, a 32.9% improvement over OpenPose. When compared to the ratings of experienced clinicians, PD-Net achieves an overall MDS-UPDRS rating score accuracy of 87.6% and Cohen's kappa of 0.82 on a testing dataset of 509 examination videos at a level exceeding human raters. This study demonstrates a clinically applicable automated video analysis system for PD clinical evaluation, which can facilitate early detection, routine monitoring, and treatment assessment.
