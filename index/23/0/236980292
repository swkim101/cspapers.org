This paper studies the problem of learning message propagation strategies for graph neural networks (GNNs). One of the challenges for graph neural networks is that of defining the propagation strategy. For instance, the choices of propagation steps are often specialized to a single graph and are not personalized to different nodes. To compensate for this, in this paper, we present learning to propagate, a general learning framework that not only learns the GNN parameters for prediction but more importantly, can explicitly learn the interpretable and personalized propagate strategies for different nodes and various types of graphs. We introduce the optimal propagation steps as latent variables to help find the maximum-likelihood estimation of the GNN parameters in a variational Expectation- Maximization (VEM) framework. Extensive experiments on various types of graph benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed frame- work can significantly achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, and can effectively learn personalized and interpretable propagate strategies of messages in GNNs.
