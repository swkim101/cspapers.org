We give an algorithm, that given an n-vertex graph <tex>$G$</tex> and an integer k, in time 2<sup>O(k)</sup>n either outputs a tree decomposition of <tex>$G$</tex> of width at most 2k + 1 or determines that the treewidth of <tex>$G$</tex> is larger than k. This is the first 2-approximation algorithm for treewidth that is faster than the known exact algorithms. In particular, our algorithm improves upon both the previous best approximation ratio of 5 in time 2<sup>O(k)</sup>n and the previous best approximation ratio of 3 in time 2<sup>O(k)</sup>n<sup>O(1)</sup>, both given by Bodlaender et al. [FOCS 2013, SICOMP 2016]. Our algorithm is based on a local improvement method adapted from a proof of Bellenbaum and Diestel [Comb. Probab. Comput. 2002].
