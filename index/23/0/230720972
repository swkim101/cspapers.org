This paper presents an approach to replicate computational ﬂuid dynamics simulations of air pollution using deep learning. The study area is in London, where a tracer aims to replicate a busy trafﬁc junction. Our method, which integrates Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and autoencoders (AE), is a computationally cheaper way to generate a latent space representation of the original unstructured mesh model. Once the PCA is applied on the original model solution, a Fully-Connected AE is trained on the full-rank PCs. This yields a compression of the original data by 10 6 . The number of trainable parameters is also reduced using this method. A LSTM-based approach is used on the latent space to produce faster forecasts of the air pollution tracer
