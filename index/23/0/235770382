Local databases underpin important features in many mobile applications, such as responsiveness in the face of poor connectivity. However, failure to use such databases correctly can lead to high resource consumption or even security vulnerabilities. We present SAND, an extensible static analysis approach that checks for misuse of local databases, also known as SQL antipatterns, in mobile apps. SAND features novel abstractions for common forms of application/database interactions, which enables concise and precise specification of the antipatterns that SAND checks for. To validate the efficacy of SAND, we have experimented with a diverse suite of 1,000 Android apps. We show that the abstractions that power SAND allow concise specification of all the known antipatterns from the literature (12-74 LOC), and that the antipatterns are modeled accurately (99.4-100% precision). As for performance, SAND requires on average 41 seconds to complete a scan on a mobile app.
