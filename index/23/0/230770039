Smart contracts are distributed, self-enforcing programs executing on top of blockchain networks. They have the potential to revolutionize many industries such as financial institutes and supply chains. However, smart contracts are subject to code-based vulnerabilities, which casts a shadow on its applications. As smart contracts are unpatchable (due to the immutability of blockchain), it is essential that smart contracts are guaranteed to be free of vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, smart contract languages such as Solidity are Turing-complete, which implies that verifying them statically is infeasible. Thus, alternative approaches must be developed to provide the guarantee. In this work, we develop an approach which automatically transforms smart contracts so that they are provably free of 4 common kinds of vulnerabilities. The key idea is to apply run-time verification in an efficient and provably correct manner. Experiment results with 5000 smart contracts show that our approach incurs minor run-time overhead in terms of time (i.e., 14.79%) and gas (i.e., 0.79%).
