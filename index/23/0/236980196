Machine learning on graphs has been extensively studiedin both academic and industry. However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different graph-related tasks. To solve this critical challenge, automated machine learning (AutoML) on graphs which combines the strength of graph machine learning and AutoML together, is gaining attentions from the research community. In this tutorial, we discuss AutoML on graphs, primarily focusing on hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for graph machine learning. We further overview libraries related to automated graph machine learning and in depth discuss AutoGL, the first dedicated open-source library for AutoML on graphs. In the end, we share our insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning. To the best of our knowledge, this tutorial is the first to systematically and comprehensively review automated machine learning on graphs, possessing a great potential to draw a large amount of interests in the community.
