The digital advertising field has always had challenging ML problems, learning from petabytes of data that is highly imbalanced, reactivity times in the milliseconds and more recently compounded with the complex user's path to purchase across devices, across platforms and even online/real-world behavior. The AdKDD workshop continues to be a forum for researchers in advertising, during and after KDD. Our website which hosts slides and abstracts receives approximately 2,000 monthly visits. In surveys during AdKDD 2019 and 2020, over 60% agreed that AdKDD is the reason they attended KDD and over 90% indicated they would attend next year. The 2021 edition is particularly timely because of ongoing developments in ad tracking. We will aim to discuss notions of privacy and tracking enforced by GDPR and through company policies. In addition, we will seek papers that discuss fairness in the context of advertising, to what extent does hyper-personalization work, and on whether the ad industry as a whole needs to think through more effective business models such as incrementality. Ad tech is in an interesting place of evolution/maturity now and we would like to use the AdKDD forum to get the researchers to think not only about the ML aspects but also spark conversations about the societal ones.
