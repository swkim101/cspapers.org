Graphs are a powerful and versatile data structure that easily captures real life relationship. Multi-graph Multi-label learning (MGML) is a supervised learning task, which aims to learn a Multi-label classifier to label a set of objects of interest (e.g. image or text) with a bag-of-graphs representation. However, prior techniques on the MGML are developed based on transferring graphs into instances that does not fully utilize the structure information in the learning, and focus on learning the unseen labels only at the bag level. There is no existing work studying how to label the graphs within a bag that is of importance in many applications like image or text annotation. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we present a novel coarse and fine-grained Multi-graph Multi-label (cfMGML) learning framework which directly builds the learning model over the graphs and empowers the label prediction at both the coarse (aka. bag) level and fine-grained (aka. graph in each bag) level. In particular, given a set of labeled multi-graph bags, we design the scoring functions at both graph and bag levels to model the relevance between the label and data using specific graph kernels. Meanwhile, we propose a thresholding rank-loss objective function to rank the labels for the graphs and bags and minimize the hamming-loss simultaneously at one-step, which aims to address the error accumulation issue in traditional rank-loss algorithms. To tackle the non-convex optimization problem, we further develop an effective sub-gradient descent algorithm to handle high-dimensional space computation required in cfMGML. Experiments over various real-world datasets demonstrate cfMGML achieves superior performance than the state-of-arts algorithms.
