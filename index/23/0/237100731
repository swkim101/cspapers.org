We propose Dr.Aid, a logic-based AI framework for automated compliance checking of data governance rules over data-flow graphs. The rules are modelled using a formal language based on situation calculus and are suitable for decentralized contexts with multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) processes. Dr.Aid models data rules and flow rules and checks compliance by reasoning about the propagation, combination, modification and application of data rules over the data flow graphs. Our approach is driven and evaluated by real-world datasets using provenance graphs from data-intensive research.
