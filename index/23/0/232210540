As Video Streaming and Analytics (VSA) systems become increasingly popular, serious privacy concerns have risen on exposing too much unnecessary private information to the VSA providers. Yet, it is challenging to protect privacy while still preserving desired VSA features, i.e., effective analytics, forensic support, resource efficiency, and real-time execution. In this paper, we present a VSA privacy enhancement system (PECAM), which addresses the above challenge with no change in the VSA back-end. PECAM leverages a novel Generative Adversarial Network to perform the privacy-enhanced securely-reversible video transformation. PECAM also incorporates a couple of system optimizations into its VSA workflow to reduce network bandwidth usage and enable real-time processing on cameras. We implement our PECAM prototype on commodity hardware and evaluate its performance via both security study and extensive experiments. Results demonstrate that PECAM can effectively enhance the visual privacy of VSA in the presence of an adversary, and its transformed videos, when taken as input for various VSA back-end tasks, maintain a 96% accuracy of corresponding original videos. Additionally, it performs 12.3× and 1.8× better than baseline methods in terms of the computing cost and network bandwidth usage, respectively.
