My research in the past few years has focused on fostering trust in algorithmic systems. I often analyze scenarios where a variety of desirable trust-oriented goals must be simultaneously satisfied;

for example, ensuring that an allocation mechanism is both fair and efficient, or that a model explanation framework is both effective and differentially private.

This interdisciplinary approach requires tools from a variety of computer science disciplines, such as game theory, economics, ML and differential privacy.
