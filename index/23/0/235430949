Deep learning has continued to show promising results for malware classiﬁcation. However, to identify key malicious behaviors, malware analysts are still tasked with reverse engineering unknown malware binaries using static analysis tools, which can take hours. Although machine learning can be used to help identify important parts of a binary, supervised approaches are impractical due to the expense of acquiring a sufﬁciently large labeled dataset. To increase the productivity of static (or manual) reverse engineering, we propose D EEP R EFLECT : a tool for localizing and identifying malware components within a malicious binary. To localize malware components, we use an unsupervised deep neural network in a novel way, and classify the components through a semi-supervised cluster analysis, where analysts incrementally provide labels during their daily work ﬂow. The tool is practical since it requires no data labeling to train the localization model, and minimal/noninvasive labeling to train the classiﬁer incrementally. In our evaluation with ﬁve malware analysts on over 26k malware samples, we found that D EEP R EFLECT reduces the numberoffunctionsthatananalystneedstoreverseengineerby85%onaverage.Ourapproachalsodetects80%ofthemalware componentscomparedto43%whenusingasignature-based tool(CAPA).Furthermore,D EEP R EFLECT performs better with our proposed autoencoder than SHAP (an AI explanation tool). This is signiﬁcant because SHAP, a state-of-the-art method, requires a labeled dataset and autoencoders do not.
