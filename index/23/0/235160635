This paper presents simplification techniques for nested symbolic expressions obtained by hierarchical analysis procedures. An algorithm is presented where potential ranges of variation in the symbolic parameter values are considered toperform simplifications. In our approach, the relative significance of each expression at the different nested levels is evaluated prior to performing simplification. Thus, only those terms with little influence on the top expression are eliminated.
