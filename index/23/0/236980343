In this paper, we study the problem of leveraging dialogue agents learned from reinforcement learning (RL) that can interact with patients for automatic disease screening. This application requires efficient and effective inquiry of appropriate symptoms to make accurate diagnosis recommendations. Existing studies have tried to use RL to perform both symptom inquiry and diagnosis simultaneously, which needs to deal with a large, heterogeneous action space that affects the learning efficiency and effectiveness. To address the challenge, we propose to leverage the models learned from the dialogue data to customize the settings of the reinforcement learning for more efficient action space exploration. In particular, a supervised diagnosis model is built and involved in the definition of state and reward. We also develop the clustering method to form a hierarchy in the action space. These customizations can make the learning task focus on checking the most relevant symptoms, which effectively boost the confidence of diagnosis. Besides, a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with the pretraining strategy is used to reduce the dimension of action space and help the model to converge. For empirical evaluations, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results have demonstrated the superiority of our approach in diagnostic accuracy and interaction efficiency compared with other baseline methods.
