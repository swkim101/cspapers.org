Google Chrome, one of the world's most popular web browsers, features an extension framework allowing third-party developers to enhance Chrome's functionality. Chrome extensions are distributed through the Chrome Web Store (CWS), a Google-operated online marketplace. In this paper, we describe how we developed and deployed three recommender systems for discovering relevant extensions in CWS, namely non-personalized recommendations, related extension recommendations, and personalized recommendations. Unlike most existing papers that focus on novel algorithms, this paper focuses on sharing practical experiences when building large-scale recommender systems under various real-world constraints, such as privacy constraints, data sparsity and skewness issues, and product design choices (e.g., user interface). We show how these constraints make standard approaches difficult to succeed in practice. We share success stories that turn negative live metrics to positive ones, including: 1) how we use interpretable neural models to bootstrap the systems, help identifying pipeline issues, and pave the way for more advanced models; 2) a new item-item based algorithm for related recommendations that works under highly skewed data distributions; and 3) how the previous two techniques can help bootstrapping the personalized recommendations, which significantly reduces development cycles and bypasses various real-world difficulties. All the explorations in this work are verified in live traffic on millions of users. We believe that the findings in this paper can help practitioners to build better large-scale recommender systems.
