This paper presents Contact Mode Guided Manipulation Planning (CMGMP) for 3D quasistatic and quasi-dynamic rigid body motion planning in dexterous manipulation. The CMGMP algorithm generates hybrid motion plans including both continuous state transitions and discrete contact mode switches, without the need for pre-specified contact sequences or pre-designed motion primitives. The key idea is to use automatically enumerated contact modes of environment-object contacts to guide the tree expansions during the search. Contact modes automatically synthesize manipulation primitives, while the sampling-based planning framework sequences those primitives into a coherent plan. We test our algorithm on fourteen 3D manipulation tasks, and validate our models by executing some plans open-loop on a real robot-manipulator system11The video is available at https://youtu.be/JuLlliG3vGc.
