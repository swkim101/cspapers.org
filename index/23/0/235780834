Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems aim to interconnect a large number of heterogeneous industrial sensing and actuation devices through both wired and wireless communication technologies and further connect them to the Internet to achieve ubiquitous sensing, computing and control services [1]. As a representative IIoT technology, 6TiSCH [2] targets at gluing together the 802.15.4e data link layer (offering industrial performance in terms of timing, reliability and power consumption) and an IP-enabled upper layer stack to achieve both deterministic network performance and seamless integration with Internet services. In recent years, 6TiSCH has been receiving increasing attentions from both industry and academia. We have witnessed its wide deployment in many industrial domains, including advanced manufacturing, industrial process control, smart grids, and healthcare.
