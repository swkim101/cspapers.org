This study proposes a hybrid vision/force control scheme for interaction with the inner surface of the bottle-like object. Based on the geometry of the object, a new generalized constraint called the bottleneck (BN) constraint is proposed, which ensures the tool passes through a fixed 3-D region and avoid collisions with the boundary of the region. To realize the hybrid vision/force control under the BN constraint, a novel dynamic controller is designed inspired by the hierarchical operational space, which can complete the different tasks defined in the decoupled subspace. To enhance the robustness of the algorithm, we develop a data-driven method and an adaptive method to estimate the Jacobian matrix online in force space and image space, respectively. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously proved by the Lyapunov theory. Experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method.
