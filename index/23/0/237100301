In this note, we introduce the local version of the operator for belief promotion proposed by Schwind et al. We propose a set of postulates and provide a representation theorem that characterizes the proposal. This family of operators is related to belief promotion in the same way that updating is related to revision, and we provide several results that allow us to show this relationship formally. Furthermore, we also show the relationship of the proposed operator with features of credibility-limited revision theory.
