Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are well-suited to the sequential inference tasks often found in embedded sensing systems. While RNNs have displayed high accuracy on many tasks, they are poorly equipped for inference under energy budgets that are unknown at design time. Existing RNNs meet energy constraints in sensor environments by training models to subsample input sequences. The tight coupling between the sampling strategy and the RNN prevents these systems from generalizing to new energy budgets at runtime. To address this problem, we present a novel RNN architecture called the Budget RNN. Budget RNNs use a leveled architecture to decouple the sampling strategy from the RNN model, allowing a single Budget RNN to change its subsampling behavior at runtime. We further propose a runtime feedback controller to optimize the modelâ€™s accuracy for a given energy budget. Across a set of budgets, the Budget RNN inference system achieves a mean accuracy of roughly 3 points higher than standard RNNs. Alternatively, Budget RNNs can achieve comparable accuracy to existing RNNs while under 20% smaller budgets.
