Drug discovery is a long and costly process, taking on average 10 years and 2.5 billion dollars to develop a new drug. Artificial intelligence has the potential to significantly accelerate the process of drug discovery by analyzing a large amount of data generated in the biomedical domain such as bioassays, chemical experiments, and biomedical literature. Recently, there is a growing interesting in developing AI techniques for drug discovery in many different communities including machine learning, data mining, and biomedical community. In this tutorial, we will provide a detailed introduction to key problems in drug discovery such as molecular property prediction, de novo molecular design and molecular optimization, retrosynthesis reaction and prediction, and drug repurposing and combination, and also key technique advancements with artificial intelligence for these problems. This tutorial can be served as introduction materials for both computer scientist interested in drug discovery as well as drug discovery practitioners for learning the latest AI techniques along this direction.
