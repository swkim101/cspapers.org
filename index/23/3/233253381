The Bengali Wikipedia has recently crossed the milestone of 100,000 articles after a journey of almost 17 years in December 2020. In this journey, the Bengali language edition of the worldâ€™s largest encyclopedia has experienced multiple changes with a promising increase in the overall performance considering the growth of community members and content. This paper analyzes the various associating factors throughout this journey including the number of active editors, number of content pages, pageview, etc., along with the connection to outreach activities with these parameters. The gender gap has been a worldwide problem and is quite prevalent in Bengali Wikipedia as well, which seems to be unchanged over the years and consequentially, leaving a conspicuous disparity in the movement. The paper inspects the present scenario of Bengali Wikipedia through quantitative factors with a relative comparison with other regional languages.
