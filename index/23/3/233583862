When connecting to power grid, Squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG), whose stator connected with grid directly, is very sensitive to voltage variation and has limited ability to resist to drop of grid voltage. Supervising the uncertainity and intermettance in wind speed and grid faults is a major challenge to agree with the modern grid code requirements. The objective of this study is the extraction of the maximum wind power (MPPT) by robust fuzzy controller for nonlinear systems which is reconized enough to stabilize a nonlinear system with parametric uncertainties and wind disturbance. The systems in question are Takagi-Sugeno type characterized by a nonlinear representation and the corresponding algorithm uses the local system models. This is obtained from the around operating points and is established by human expertise in the form of IF-THEN rules type. The algorithm was developed with a Squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG) as shown by the model of the wind energy systems to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed algorithm maximizes power output and maintain a stable system in the parameter uncertainties.
