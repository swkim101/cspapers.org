Trust relationship prediction among people provides valuable supports for decision making, information dissemination, and product promotion in online social networks. Network embedding has achieved promising performance for link prediction by learning node representations that encode intrinsic network structures. However, most of the existing network embedding solutions cannot effectively capture the properties of a trust network that has directed edges and nodes with in/out links. Furthermore, there usually exist rich user attributes in trust networks, such as ratings, reviews, and the rated/reviewed items, which may exert significant impacts on the formation of trust relationships. It is still lacking a network embedding-based method that can adequately integrate these properties for trust prediction. In this work, we develop an AtNE-Trust model to address these issues. We firstly capture user embedding from both the trust network structures and user attributes. Then we design a deep multi-view representation learning module to further mine and fuse the obtained user embedding. Finally, a trust evaluation module is developed to predict the trust relationships between users. Representation learning and trust evaluation are optimized together to capture high-quality user embedding and make accurate predictions simultaneously. A set of experiments against the real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
