To mitigate the rabbit hole effect in recommendations, conventional distribution-aware recommendation systems aim to ensure that a user’s prior interest areas are reflected in the recommendations that the system makes. For example, a user who historically prefers comedies to dramas by 2:1 should see a similar ratio in recommended movies. Such approaches have proven to be an important building block for recommendation tasks. However, existing distribution-aware approaches enforce that the target taste distribution should exactly match a user’s prior interests (typically revealed through training data), based on the assumption that users’ taste distribution is fundamentally static. This assumption can lead to large estimation errors. We empirically identify this taste distortion problem through a data-driven study over multiple datasets. We show how taste preferences dynamically shift and how the design of a calibration mechanism should be designed with these shifts in mind. We further demonstrate how to incorporate these shifts into a taste enhanced calibrated recommender system, which results in simultaneously mitigated both the rabbit hole effect and taste distortion problem.
