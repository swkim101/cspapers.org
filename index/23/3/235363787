BERT has set a new state-of-the-art performance on entity resolution (ER) task, largely owed to fine-tuning pre-trained language models and the deep pair-wise interaction. Albeit being remarkably effective, it comes with a steep increase in computational cost, as the deep-interaction requires to exhaustively compute every tuple pair to search for co-references. For ER task, it is often prohibitively expensive due to the large cardinality to be matched. To tackle this, we introduce a siamese network structure that independently encodes tuples using BERT but delays the pair-wise interaction via an enhanced alignment network. This siamese structure enables a dedicated blocking module to quickly filter out obviously dissimilar tuple pairs, and thus drastically reduces the cardinality of fine-grained matching. Further, the blocking and entity matching are integrated into a multi-task learning framework for facilitating both tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models (including BERT) in both efficiency and effectiveness.
