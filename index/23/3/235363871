The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most severe challenges the world faces today. In order to contain the transmission of COVID-19, people around the world have been advised to practise social distancing. However, maintaining social distance is a challenging problem, as we often do not know beforehand how crowded the places we intend to visit are. In this paper, we demonstrate crowded.sg, an AI-empowered platform that leverages on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), crowdsourced images, and computer vision techniques to provide social distancing decision support.
