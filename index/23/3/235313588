We tackle the task of video moment retrieval (VMR), which aims to localize a specific moment in a video according to a textual query. Existing methods primarily model the matching relationship between query and moment by complex cross-modal interactions. Despite their effectiveness, current models mostly exploit dataset biases while ignoring the video content, thus leading to poor generalizability. We argue that the issue is caused by the hidden confounder in VMR, i.e., temporal location of moments, that spuriously correlates the model input and prediction. How to design robust matching models against the temporal location biases is crucial but, as far as we know, has not been studied yet for VMR. To fill the research gap, we propose a causality-inspired VMR framework that builds structural causal model to capture the true effect of query and video content on the prediction. Specifically, we develop a Deconfounded Cross-modal Matching (DCM) method to remove the confounding effects of moment location. It first disentangles moment representation to infer the core feature of visual content, and then applies causal intervention on the disentangled multimodal input based on backdoor adjustment, which forces the model to fairly incorporate each possible location of the target into consideration. Extensive experiments clearly show that our approach can achieve significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and generalization.
