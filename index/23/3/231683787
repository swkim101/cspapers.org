Let <tex>$G= (V, E)$</tex> be a given edge-weighted graph and let its realization <tex>$\mathcal{G}$</tex> be a random subgraph of <tex>$G$</tex> that includes each edge <tex>$e\in E$</tex> independently with probability <tex>$p$</tex>. We study a stochastic matching problem where the goal is to non-adaptively pick a sparse subgraph <tex>$Q$</tex> of <tex>$G$</tex> (without knowing the realization <tex>$\mathcal{G}$</tex>), such that the maximum weight matching among the realized edges of <tex>$Q$</tex> (i.e. graph <tex>$Q\cap \mathcal{G}$</tex>) in expectation approximates the maximum weight matching of the whole realization <tex>$\mathcal{G}$</tex>. In this paper, we prove that for any <tex>$\varepsilon\in(0,1)$</tex>, every graph <tex>$G$</tex> has a subgraph <tex>$Q$</tex> that has maximum degree only <tex>$O_{\varepsilon, p}(1)$</tex> and guarantees a (<tex>$1-\varepsilon$</tex>) -approximation. That is, the maximum degree of <tex>$Q$</tex> depends only on <tex>$\varepsilon$</tex> and <tex>$p$</tex> (both of which are known to be necessary) and not for example on the number of nodes in <tex>$G$</tex>, the edge-weights, etc. The stochastic matching problem has been studied extensively on both weighted and unweighted graphs. Previously, only existence of (close to) half-approximate subgraphs was known for weighted graphs [Yamaguchi and Maehara, SODA'18; Behnezhad et al., SODA'19]. Our result substantially improves over these works, matches the state-of-the-art for unweighted graphs [Behnezhad et al., STOC'20], and settles the approximation factor.
