In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for the Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) problem that can be run with more than 28 agents while using a complete set of coalitions as input. The current state-of-the-art limit for exact algorithms to solve the CSG problem within a reasonable time is 27 agents. Our algorithm uses a novel representation of the search space and a new code-based search technique. We propose an effective heuristic search method to efficiently explore the space of coalition structures using our code based technique and show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms by multiple orders of magnitude.
