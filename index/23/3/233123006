The premise of our most recent work is tha.t a. recognition system can a.nd should incorporate both the symbolic labeling of the potential func­ tionality of an object and the steps to confirm said functionality through interaction. Hence. �tie task· at ha.nd is as follows. A researcher selects a.n ob­ ject and places it in the observation a.rea of a robot a.rm. An initial intensity a.nd range image are ac­ quired. This initial state is the input to a.· two­ stage recognition system which first performs the symbolic labeling of the object's potential func­ tionality and produces a plan for interaction for the object. The second stage involves the interac­ tion tests. guided by the plan for interaction. to confirm the object's functional use in a task. This paper describes the current state of the system.
