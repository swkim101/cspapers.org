A significant portion of the veteran population suffers from PTSD, a mental illness that is often accompanied by social anxiety disorder. Student veterans are especially vulnerable as they struggle to adapt to a new, less structured college lifestyle. In order to assist psychologists and social workers in the treatment of social anxiety disorder we use machine learning to analyze transcribed interview text and apply topic modelling to highlight common stress factors for student veterans. The results detailed in this paper also have broader impacts in fields such as pedagogy and public health.
