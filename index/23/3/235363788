The project developed a device to assist blind and visually impaired
users in complying with social distance rules. The main challenge
was how to identify people from other objects and notify the user
accordingly. Equally ambiguous was how to best notify the user that a
person was violating the social distance rules.
The hardware used is a Raspberry Pi running an image classification
algorithm and hooked to a depth camera. The use of prediction labels and
accuracy combined with the distance calculated by the depth camera made
it possible to detect when a person was getting closer than 2 meters
(6 ft) to the user.
The device was tested both in daylight and at night, and with different 
lighting conditions. The device responded with a accuracy close to 1.9 meters. which is very acceptable.
Testing showed that the camera is capable of identifying people coming 
from a 30 degrees angle from either side at around 1.9 meters of distance, 
giving a good range of object detection.
