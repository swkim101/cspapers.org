As autonomous vehicle technology is getting its momentum, it is important to have a simulation platform that helps the rapid prototyping of the related technologies and applications. In this paper, we share our experiences of using the simulation-based development approach to facilitate the rapid development by using the open-source software to run autonomous vehicle simulation on commodity PCs. In addition, we introduce the efforts we made for developing the autonomous driving technologies adapting to the traffic conditions in Asia urban areas, where two-wheelers are popular transport vehicles. Lastly, in order to promote the autonomous driving researches, we share our documents for the simulation procedures so that students and junior engineers can get into the related research fields more easily.
