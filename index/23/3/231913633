Lightning prediction is a complicated and challenging task requiring meteorologists to integrate information from multiple data sources to make decisions. Although some data-driven models have been proposed to make prediction automatically, most of them are based on a single data source or several basically-homogeneous data sources, making them hard to adapt to complex and diverse data in practice. In this work, we propose a heterogeneous spatiotemporal network (HSTN) for lightning prediction, aiming at mining knowledge from several heterogeneous spatiotemporal (ST) data sources. Specifically, HSTN comprises three modules: Gaussian diffusion module, ST encoder and ST decoder. Noting that most of meteorological data can be formatted into either a dense ST tensor or a sparse ST tensor, the ST encoder, with the help of the Gaussian diffusion module, is designed to extract information from both two types of tensors. On the other hand, ST decoder is responsible for merging all information from the other modules and generate the final prediction. By organically combining the three modules, HSTN can handle complex input with heterogeneity in both space and time domains. We conduct experimental evaluations on a real-world lightning dataset. The results demonstrate that HSTN achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with several established baselines.
