This paper focuses on the design and comparison of different deep neural networks for the real-time prediction of locomotor intentions by using data from inertial measurement units. The deep neural network architectures are convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional recurrent neural networks. The input to the architectures are features in the time domain, which have been derived either from one inertial measurement unit placed on the upper right leg of ten healthy subjects, or two inertial measurement units placed on both the upper and lower right leg of ten healthy subjects. The study shows that a WaveNet, i.e., a full convolutional neural network, achieves a peak F1-score of 87.17% in the case of one IMU, and a peak of 97.88% in the case of two IMUs, with a 5-fold cross-validation.
