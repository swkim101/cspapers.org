Keyphrase Generation compresses a document into some highly-summative phrases, which is an important task in natural language processing. Most state-of-the-art adopt greedy search or beam search decoding methods. These two decoding methods generate a large number of duplicated keyphrases and are time-consuming. Moreover, beam search only predicts a fixed number of keyphrases for different documents. In this paper, we propose an adaptive generation model-AdaGM, which is mainly inspired by the importance of the first words in keyphrase generation. In AdaGM, a novel reset state training mechanism is proposed to maximize the difference in the predicted first words. To ensure the discreteness and get an appropriate number of keyphrases according to the content of the document adaptively, we equip beam search with a highly effective filter mechanism. Experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the proposed model can generate marginally less duplicated and more accurate keyphrases.
