We propose and implement a novel intelligent tutoring system, called RadarMath, to support intelligent and personalized learning for math education. The system provides the services including automatic grading and personalized learning guidance. Specifically, two automatic grading models are designed to accomplish the tasks for scoring the text-answer and formula-answer questions respectively. An education-oriented knowledge graph with the individual learnerâ€™s knowledge state is used as the key tool for guiding the personalized learning process. The system demonstrates how the relevant AI techniques could be applied in today's intelligent tutoring systems.
