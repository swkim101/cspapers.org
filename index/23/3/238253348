Post-hoc explanation methods, e.g., Grad-CAM, enable humans to inspect the spatial regions responsible for a particular network decision. However, it is shown that such explanations are not always consistent with human priors, such as consistency across image transformations. Given an interpretation algorithm, e.g., Grad-CAM, we introduce a novel training method to train the model to produce more consistent explanations. Since obtaining the ground truth for a desired model interpretation is not a well-defined task, we adopt ideas from contrastive self-supervised learning, and apply them to the interpretations of the model rather than its embeddings. We show that our method, Contrastive Grad-CAM Consistency (CGC), results in Grad-CAM interpretation heatmaps that are more consistent with human annotations while still achieving comparable classification accuracy. Moreover, our method acts as a regularizer and improves the accuracy on limited-data, fine-grained classification settings. In addition, because our method does not rely on annotations, it allows for the incorporation of unlabeled data into training, which enables better generalization of the model.
