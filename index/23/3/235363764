Equivalence of deterministic finite automata (DFAs) has been researched for several decades, but equivalence of nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) is not as studied. Equivalence of two NFAs is a PSPACE-complete problem. NFA equivalence is a challenging theoretical problem with practical applications such as lexical analysis. Quantified boolean formulas (QBFs) naturally encode PSPACE-complete problems, and we share our preliminary work towards determining NFA equivalence via QBFs.
