This paper investigates whether the power of the models pre-trained on text data, such as BERT, can be transferred to general token sequence classiﬁcation applications. To verify pre-trained models’ transferability, we test the pre-trained models on text classiﬁcation tasks with meanings of tokens mismatches, and real-world non-text token sequence classiﬁcation data, including amino acid, DNA, and music. We ﬁnd that even on non-text data, the models pre-trained on text converge faster, perform better than the randomly initialized models, and only slightly worse than the models using task-speciﬁc knowledge. We also ﬁnd that the representations of the text and non-text pretrained models share non-trivial similarities.
