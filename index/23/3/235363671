The Contour to Classification game is a browser-based game that teaches middle school students basic concepts in supervised learning. The game is an online variant of the Neural Network game that was presented at AAAI Fall Symposium Teaching AI in K-12 track in 2019. We share preliminary findings from implementing the online version of the original Neural Network game in a pilot research study and describe the game’s evolution to the Contour to Classification game. The new game uses a simulation of a neural network to engage students, through digital drawing and selection interactions, in the classification of images. The players act as nodes in a multi-step process of compositing salient smaller features to form larger features and ultimately a partial contour of an object that is used to make a prediction. After evaluating the prediction, information is sent back through the network in processes mimicking back propagation and gradient descent. Additional rounds of the game can be played to witness how the network evolves and gets “better” at classifying images from contours. Through this game, we aimed for students to learn the structure, components, and functioning of a neural network, and the processes involved in supervised learning. The Contour to Classification game supports online student learning by providing the image classification experience using purely visual inputs to each layer. We will conclude with a discussion of if and how the evolving design addresses classroom needs and scaling considerations.
