We perform an empirical study of Gin Rummy knocking strategies, drawing insight from a population of AI players that vary in both discarding and knocking strategies. For our best performing player, simple linear regression yielded a knocking strategy that both affirmed the features expert players give attention to in making knock decisions, and yet called into question the way such features are conventionally used.
