Compiling the votes of a subelectorate consists of storing the votes of a subset of voters in a compressed form, such that the winners can still be determined when additional votes are included. This leads to the notion of compilation complexity, which has already been investigated for single-winner voting rules. We perform a compilation complexity analysis of several common multi-winner voting rules.
