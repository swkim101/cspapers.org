We demonstrate a health-friendly speaker verification system for voice-based identity verification on mobile devices. The system is built upon a speech processing module, a ResNet-based local acoustic feature extractor and a multi-head attention-based embedding layer, and is optimized under an additive margin softmax loss for discriminative speaker verification. It is shown that the system achieves superior performance no matter whether there is mask wearing or not. This characteristic is important for speaker verification services operating in regions affected by the raging coronavirus pneumonia. With this demonstration, the audience will have an in-depth experience of how the accuracy of bio-metric verification and the personal health are simultaneously ensured. We wish that this demonstration would boost the development of next-generation bio-metric verification technologies.
