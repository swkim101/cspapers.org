For achieving kinematically suitable configurations and highly dynamic task execution, an efficient way is to consider robot performance indices in the whole-body control (WBC) of robots. However, current WBC methods have not considered the intrinsic features of parallel robots, especially motion/force transmissibility (MFT). This paper proposes an MFT-enhanced WBC scheme for parallel-legged robots. Introducing the performance indices of MFT into a WBC is challenging due to the nonlinear relationship between MFT indices and the robot configuration. To overcome this challenge, we establish the MFT preferable space of the robot offline and formulate it as a polyhedron in the joint space at the acceleration level. Then, the WBC employs the polyhedron as a soft constraint. As a result, the robot possesses high-speed and high-acceleration capabilities by satisfying this constraint. The offline preprocessing relieves the online computation burden and helps the WBC achieve a 1kHz servo rate. Finally, we validate the performance and robustness of the proposed method via simulations and experiments on a parallel-legged bipedal robot.
