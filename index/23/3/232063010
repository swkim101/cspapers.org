Among the plethora of Peer-to-peer file sharing mechanisms, BitTorrent (BT) is considered as the most popular due to its structured architecture. Internet service provider (ISP) may localize the traffic that will reduce the bandwidth burden in the feeder fiber and also save file transfer time significantly. With the growing popularity of passive optical network (PON), it is an ideal candidate for the upcoming future access network that can provide better environment for P2P application services. In this paper, we intend to design the BT-based P2P local aware intra-traffic file sharing architecture over software-defined TWDM-PON using colorless ONU to achieve traffic localization of BT traffic. Further, simulation results show that the proposed architecture improves the Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of mean packet delay, system throughput and traffic drop percentage.
