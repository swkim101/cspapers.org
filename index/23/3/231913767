One of the main challenges of the active assistive devices is how to estimate the motion of the missing/impaired limbs and joints in line with the remaining limbs. To do so, a motion planner is required. This study proposes a motion planner that can be used for active prosthetic/orthotic knees. The aim is to continuously estimate the knee joint positions based on the thigh motion, using as few inputs as possible. Data from thigh-mounted IMU (thigh acceleration and angle) are used as inputs to estimate knee joint positions as outputs. It is aimed to continuously estimate the outputs as opposed to the state-machine approaches which divide the gait cycles into different sections and require switching rules. The performance of the motion planner is investigated for five walking speeds (0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 m/s). The strengths and limitations of the motion planer are investigated at different scenarios.
