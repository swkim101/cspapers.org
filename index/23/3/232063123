In this paper, we present an improved consensus protocol for real-time blockchain systems. Our protocol is distributed, based on MinBFT [9] and make an extension. The protocol we proposed can satisfy the real-time constraint. We have also given a proof on circumstances under which the real-time constraint can be met. Our protocol is flexible, servers can rejoin the blockchain system after temporarily losing the normal function (i.e., Byzantine faults). The experimental results shows that the throughput of our consensus protocol is inversely proportional to the capability of the fault tolerance, i.e., the reliability of the system. We explained why and gave a suggestion about how to get a trade-off between throughput and reliability. We made a discussion in the final.
