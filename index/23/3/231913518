This paper discusses the application of video motion capturing technology (VMocap) to a competitive team sports game. The setting introduces a specific set of constraints: large scale markerless motion capturing, big recording volume, transmitting and processing gigabytes of data, operation without interfering with players or distracting spectators and staff, etc... In this paper, we present how we tackled and successfully solved all of these constraints. That enabled us to analyze the sportsmen without any intrusions, while giving their peak performance, hence opening a new field for Mocap application. International volleyball game was recorded in full length with the described system. During the course of the event, we compressed 54TB of raw image data real-time, capturing 6 hours of high framerate video per camera, without disturbing any of the game operations. Using the data, we were able to reconstruct the motion, muscle activity and behavior of the athletes present on the court.
