We report on the use of open-source natural language processing capabilities in a web-based interface to allow undergraduate students to apply what they have learned about formal natural language structures. The learning activities encourage students to interpret data in new ways, think originally about natural language, and critique the back-end NLP models and algorithms visualized on the user front end. This work is of relevance to AI resources developed for education by focusing on inclusivity of students from many disciplinary backgrounds. Specifically, we comprehensively extended a web-based system with new resources. To test the students' reactions to NLP analyses that offer insights into both the strengths and limitations of AI systems, we incorporated a range of automated analyses focused on language-independent processing or meaning representations which still represent challenges for NLP. We conducted a survey-based evaluation with students in open-ended case-based assignments in undergraduate coursework. Responses indicated that the students reinforced their knowledge, applied critical thinking about language and NLP applications, and used the application not to solve the assignment for them, but as a tool in their own effort to address the task. We further discuss how using interpretable visualizations of system decisions is an opportunity to learn about ethical issues in NLP, and how making AI systems interpretable may broaden multidisciplinary interest in AI in early educational experiences.
