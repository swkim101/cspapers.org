Building models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks remains a daunting task for many, requiring significant technical expertise, efforts, and resources. In this demonstration, we present AutoText, an end-to-end AutoAI framework for text, to lower the barrier of entry in building NLP models. AutoText combines state-of-the-art AutoAI optimization techniques and learning algorithms for NLP tasks into a single extensible framework. Through its simple, yet powerful UI, non-AI experts (e.g., domain experts) can quickly generate performant NLP models with support to both control (e.g., via specifying constraints) and understand learned models.
