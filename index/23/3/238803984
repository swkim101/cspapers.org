Sinapic acid (SA), belonging to the phenylpropanoid family, and its derivatives are secondary metabolites found in the plant kingdom. In recent years, they have drawn attention because of their various biological activities, including neuroprotective effects. In this study, SA was incorporated into two different nanoparticle systems, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC). The influence of different concentrations of SA on the nanoparticle systems was evaluated. It was studied the efficacy of the nanoparticle systems to release the active ingredient at cell level through the use of models of biological membranes represented by multilamellar vesicles (MLV) of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and conducting kinetic studies by placing in contact SLN and NLC, both unloaded and loaded with two different amounts of SA, with the same biological membrane model. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used for these studies. The results indicated a different distribution of SA within the two nanoparticle systems and that NLC are able to incorporate and release SA inside the structure of the biological membrane model.
