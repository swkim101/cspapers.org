Self-supervised learning of video representations has received great attention. Existing methods typically require frames to be decoded before being processed, which increases compute and storage requirements and ultimately hinders largescale training. In this work, we propose an efficient self-supervised approach to learn video representations by eliminating the expensive decoding step. We use a three-stream video architecture that encodes I-frames and P-frames of a compressed video. Unlike existing approaches that encode I-frames and P-frames individually, we propose to jointly encode them by establishing bidirectional dynamic connections across streams. To enable self-supervised learning, we propose two pretext tasks that leverage the multimodal nature (RGB, motion vector, residuals) and the internal GOP structure of compressed videos. The first task asks our network to predict zeroth-order motion statistics in a spatio-temporal pyramid; the second task asks correspondence types between I-frames and P-frames after applying temporal transformations. We show that our approach achieves competitive performance on compressed video recognition both in supervised and self-supervised regimes.
