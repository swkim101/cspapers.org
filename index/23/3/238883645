A model of a robotic workstation will be presented where an operator and an industrial robot are expected to collaborate to carry out manufacturing operations such as assembly tasks. Such workstations are also referred to as Collaborative workstations. The model is the result of an analysis of two laboratory workstations what was developed to demonstrate safety strategies for collaborative workstations.
