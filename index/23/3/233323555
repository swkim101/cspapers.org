The Bluetooth standard is ubiquitously supported by computers, smartphones, and IoT devices. Due to its complexity, implementations require large codebases, which are prone to security vulnerabilities, such as the recently discovered BlueBorne and BadBluetooth attacks. While deﬁned by the standard, most of the Bluetooth functionality, as deﬁned by different Bluetooth proﬁles, is not required in the common usage scenarios. Starting from this observation, we implement L IGHT B LUE , a framework performing automatic, proﬁle-aware debloating of Bluetooth stacks, allowing users to automatically minimize their Bluetooth attack surface by removing unneeded Blue-tooth features. L IGHT B LUE starts with a target Bluetooth application, detects the associated Bluetooth proﬁles, and applies a combination of control-ﬂow and data-ﬂow analysis to remove unused code within a Bluetooth host code. Furthermore, to debloat the Bluetooth ﬁrmware, L IGHT B LUE extracts the used Host Controller Interface (HCI) commands and patches the HCI dispatcher in the Bluetooth ﬁrmware automatically, so that the Bluetooth ﬁrmware avoids processing unneeded HCI commands. We evaluate L IGHT B LUE on four different Bluetooth hosts and three different Bluetooth controllers. Our evaluation shows that L IGHT B LUE achieves between 32% and 50% code reduction in the Bluetooth host code and between 57% and 83% HCI command reduction
