We present a novel framework for mesh reconstruction from unstructured point clouds by taking advantage of the learned visibility of the 3D points in the virtual views and traditional graph-cut based mesh generation. Specifically, we first propose a three-step network that explicitly employs depth completion for visibility prediction. Then the visibility information of multiple views is aggregated to generate a 3D mesh model by solving an optimization problem considering visibility in which a novel adaptive visibility weighting in surface determination is also introduced to suppress line of sight with a large incident angle. Compared to other learning-based approaches, our pipeline only exercises the learning on a 2D binary classification task, i.e., points visible or not in a view, which is much more generalizable and practically more efficient and capable to deal with a large number of points. Experiments demonstrate that our method with favorable transferability and robustness, and achieve competing performances w.r.t. state-of-the-art learning-based approaches on small complex objects and outperforms on large indoor and outdoor scenes.
