Thousands of scientific publications discuss evidence on the
efficacy of non-cancer generic drugs being tested for cancer.
However, trying to manually identify and extract such evidence is intractable at scale. We introduce a natural language
processing pipeline to automate the identification of relevant
studies and facilitate the extraction of therapeutic associations
between generic drugs and cancers from PubMed abstracts.
We annotate datasets of drug-cancer evidence and use them
to train models to identify and characterize such evidence at
scale. To make this evidence readily consumable, we incorporate the results of the models in a web application that allows users to browse documents and their extracted evidence.
Users can provide feedback on the quality of the evidence extracted by our models. This feedback is used to improve our
datasets and the corresponding models in a continuous integration system. We describe the natural language processing
pipeline in our application and the steps required to deploy
services based on the machine learning models.
