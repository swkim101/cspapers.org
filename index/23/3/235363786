AI for social good (AI4SG) is a research theme that aims to use and advance AI to improve the well-being of society. My work on AI4SG builds a two-way bridge between the research world and the real world. Using my unique experience in food waste and security, I propose applied AI4SG research that directly addresses real-world challenges which have received little attention from the community. Drawing from my experience in various AI4SG application domains, I propose bandit data-driven optimization, the first iterative prediction-prescription framework and a no-regret algorithm PROOF. I will apply PROOF back to my applied work on AI4SG, thereby closing the loop in a single framework.
