In practice, safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS) are often implemented using high quality-of-service (QoS) resources to provide maximum performance in all scenarios. Such implementations are oblivious to the changing criticality levels of CPS based on their physical dynamics (e.g., steady or transient state). Considering that high-QoS resources are constrained for cost-sensitive CPS, such criticality-oblivious implementations are highly inefficient. Towards a tighter dimensioning of these resources, state-of-the-art approaches have considered multi-QoS resources and studied criticality-aware dynamic resource allocation along the lines of mixed-criticality systems. However, these approaches have high implementation overheads. Moreover, in safety-critical domains like automotive and avionics, certification of such dynamic policies is challenging and the implementation platforms typically do not support dynamic reconfiguration. To address these challenges, we present GoodSpread that uses a static scheduling strategy and offers the same performance guarantees while saving resources (more than 50 % in certain cases) compared to the existing dynamic schemes. The main idea here is to spread the high-QoS resources as uniformly as possible over time in order to accommodate the uncertainty of when the criticality level might change. Our proposed strategy studies the physical dynamics to determine the spread factor, i.e., how often the high-QoS resources need to be provisioned. We further propose an extensibility-driven optimization approach to obtain a static schedule that will accommodate future workloads on the remaining resources with maximum flexibility.
