Motivated by the recent successful application of span-based models to entity-based information extraction tasks, we investigate span-based models for event coreference resolution, focusing on determining (1) whether the successes of span-based models of entity coreference can be extended to event coreference; (2) whether exploiting the dependency between event coreference and the related subtask of trigger detection; and (3) whether automatically computed entity coreference information can benefit span-based event coreference resolution. Empirical results on the standard evaluation dataset provide affirmative answers to all three questions.
