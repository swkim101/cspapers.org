Reﬂective ampliﬁcation attacks are a powerful tool in the arsenal of a DDoS attacker, but to date have almost exclusively targeted UDP-based protocols. In this paper, we demonstrate that non-trivial TCP-based ampliﬁcation is possible and can be orders of magnitude more effective than well-known UDP-based ampliﬁcation. By taking advantage of TCP-non-compliance in network middleboxes, we show that attackers can induce middleboxes to respond and amplify network traf-ﬁc. With the novel application of a recent genetic algorithm, we discover and maximize the efﬁcacy of new TCP-based reﬂective ampliﬁcation attacks, and present several packet sequences that cause network middleboxes to respond with substantially more packets than we send. We scanned the entire IPv4 Internet to measure how many IP addresses permit reﬂected ampliﬁcation. We ﬁnd hundreds of thousands of IP addresses that offer ampliﬁcation factors greater than 100 × . Through our Internet-wide measurements, we explore several open questions regarding DoS attacks, including the root cause of so-called “mega ampliﬁers”. We also report on network phenomena that causes some of the TCP-based attacks to be so effective as to technically have inﬁnite ampliﬁcation factor (after the attacker sends a constant number of bytes, the reﬂector generates trafﬁc indeﬁnitely). We have made our code publicly available.
