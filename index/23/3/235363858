DeepRobust is a PyTorch platform for generating adversarial examples and building robust machine learning models for different data domains. Users can easily evaluate the attack performance against different defense methods with DeepRobust and get performance analyzing visualization. In this paper, we introduce the functions of DeepRobust with detailed instructions. We believe that DeepRobust is a useful tool to measure deep learning model robustness and to find the suitable countermeasures against adversarial attacks. The platform is kept updated and can be found at https://github.com/DSE-MSU/DeepRobust. More details of instruction can be found in the documentation at https://deeprobust.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
