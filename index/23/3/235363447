We design and implement an intelligent assistant, called PB-Advisor, to advise teachers and parents on students' problem behaviors. It utilizes a task-oriented dialogue system to identify the need deficiency underlying students' problem behaviors, and relies on a community question answering system to provide advice on typical problem behavior management. In addition, it also provides various learning resources, and illustrates the relations between influential factors on typical problem behaviors through data analysis. With PB-Advisor, teachers and parents without psychological expertise can easily find proper advice on studentsâ€™ problem behaviors.
