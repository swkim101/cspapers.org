Vision systems that deploy Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Recent research has shown that checking the intrinsic consistencies in the input data is a promising way to detect adversarial attacks (e.g., by checking the object co-occurrence relationships in complex scenes). However, existing approaches are tied to specific models and do not offer generalizability. Motivated by the observation that language descriptions of natural scene images have already captured the object co-occurrence relationships that can be learned by a language model, we develop a novel approach to perform context consistency checks using such language models. The distinguishing aspect of our approach is that it is independent of the deployed object detector and yet offers very high accuracy in terms of detecting adversarial examples in practical scenes with multiple objects. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art methods in detecting adversarial attacks.
