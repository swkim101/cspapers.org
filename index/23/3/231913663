Semantic text matching, which matches target texts to source texts, is a general problem in many areas, such as information retrieval, question answering, and recommendation. The challenges to existing research on this topic include 1) out-of-vocabulary and low-frequency keywords and 2) direct utilization of sparse matching matrix of source and target. The out-of-vocabulary and low-frequency keywords could lead to the mismatch of similar keywords in source and target texts. The sparse matching matrix cannot provide enough clues to match the source with the target. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep neural semantic text matching model. Our model adopts an interactive attention network to achieve information exchange between the source text and the target text, and dynamically explores the matching matrix and learns new representations of source and target texts. Experimental results on three different text matching datasets demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform competitive baselines. Furthermore, our model demonstrates great advantage in alleviating the sparse matching problem and learning out-of-vocabulary words with the local context, which widely exists in a broad spectrum of NLP applications.
