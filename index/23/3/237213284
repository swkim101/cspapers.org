Directly regressing all 6 degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) for the object pose (i.e. the 3D rotation and translation) in a cluttered environment from a single RGB image is a challenging problem. While end-to-end methods have recently demonstrated promising results at high efficiency, they are still inferior when compared with elaborate PnP/RANSAC-based approaches in terms of pose accuracy. In this work, we address this shortcoming by means of a novel reasoning about self-occlusion, in order to establish a two-layer representation for 3D objects which considerably enhances the accuracy of end-to-end 6D pose estimation. Our framework, named SO-Pose, takes a single RGB image as input and respectively generates 2D-3D correspondences as well as self-occlusion information harnessing a shared encoder and two separate decoders. Both outputs are then fused to directly regress the 6DoF pose parameters. Incorporating cross-layer consistencies that align correspondences, self-occlusion and 6D pose, we can further improve accuracy and robustness, surpassing or rivaling all other state-of-the-art approaches on various challenging datasets.
