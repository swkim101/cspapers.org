As human beings are entering the era in which AI be-comes the new engine to drive social, economic, and sci-entific advancement, education is intensively being re-quired to adapt to this trend, to equip current and next generation with necessary knowledge, skills, and think-ing. Although AI education has achieved relative success in universities and cultivated a large number of talents and companies in the past decade, it hasn't made signifi-cant progress in K-12 education. We identify the key challenges as two gaps, one is about transferring practice from university education to K-12 education, and the other is about the inequal distribution of AI educational resources. To fill these gaps and to efficiently facilitate K-12 AI education, especially in countries like China, we designed and implemented a Web-based platform, which as a focal and sharing point of K-12 educational resources to provide essential AI learning and exercising components to both students and instructors. With this platform, we've successfully conducted a series of initial trials and gained positive feedbacks. We believe a wider-range application of the platform will achieve promising results for K-12 AI education.
