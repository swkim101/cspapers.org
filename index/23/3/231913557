This paper presents a teaching by demonstration method for contact tasks with periodic movement on planar surfaces of unknown pose. To learn the motion on the plane, we utilize frequency oscillators with periodic movement primitives and we propose modified adaptation rules along with an extraction method of the taskâ€™s fundamental frequency by automatically discarding near-zero frequency components. Additionally, we utilize an online estimate of the normal vector to the plane, so that the robot is able to quickly adapt to rotated hinged surfaces such as a window or a door. Using the framework of progressive automation for compliance adaptation, the robot transitions seamlessly and bi-directionally between hand guidance and autonomous operation within few repetitions of the task. While the level of automation increases, a hybrid force/position controller is progressively engaged for the autonomous operation of the robot. Our methodology is verified experimentally in surfaces of different orientation, with the robot being able to adapt to surface orientation perturbations.
