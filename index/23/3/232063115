The laser direct imaging exposure machine directly images the CAM data on the printed circuit board (PCB) substrate, thus do without film procedures in the exposure process, reducing the deviation caused by film expansion and undergo distortion during fabrication, and improving the productivity of PCB production. As the line width of the circuit diagram continues to become smaller, a smaller spot is required to expose a small line width, but because the laser spot size cannot be reduced without limit, the circuit diagram line width is reduced to smaller than the spot, which will cause insufficient exposure accuracy. It is the main motivation of the present invention to use a larger laser spot size to expose a small line width, and to improve the accuracy of the circuit line diagram. Based on this, this paper proposes a laser source target light dose reversed mapping output strategy. Through trial exposure, the initial spot position map, connected component labeling (CCL) and parallelized 0-1 integer programming are found out laser spot exposure position map, are reconstructed with a new spot distribution. It can achieve the accuracy requirement of exposing small line width and line spacing with a twice laser spot size. In addition, the mathematical calculation amount of the target light dose reversed mapping are very huge matrix, and calculating the image pixels point by point is very time-consuming. This paper proposes a method to effectively reduce the amount of calculation and acceleration.
