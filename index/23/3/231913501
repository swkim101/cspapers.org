In this study, we developed a selective driving joint forceps (SDJF) for laparoscopic surgery. The SDJF has a mechanism that the driving joints can be selected arbitrarily, therefore each joint doesn’t require an individual actuator for operating. The developed SDJF has six joints that can be operated using only four actuators. Each joint has 2-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) of flexion. Therefore, the SDJF has the same working area as the forceps having six driving joints (each joints can bend ±30° around the X and Y axes). The mechanism of the SDJF is realized by fixing each joint with a collar made of shape memory polymer. The proposed mechanism not only reduces the number of actuators required for joint operation, but also has the rigidity of the forceps, which is important in surgery. In addition, a driving section of the forceps is driven by pneumatic cylinders, therefore, the forceps joint has high-back-drivability, lightweight and high-output. We measured the heating and cooling time required to change the driving joint, dynamic response and rigidity of the prototype SDJF.
