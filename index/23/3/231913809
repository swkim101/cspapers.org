In the last decade, soft robots have been at the forefront of a robotic revolution. Due to the flexibility of the soft materials employed, soft robots are equipped with a capability to execute new tasks in new application areas -beyond what can be achieved using classical rigid-link robots. Despite these promising properties, many soft robots nowadays lack the capability to exert sufficient force to perform various real-life tasks. This has led to the development of stiffness-controllable inflatable robots instilled with the ability to modify their stiffness during motion. This new capability, however, poses an even greater challenge for robot control. In this paper, we propose a model-based kinematic control strategy to guide the tip of an inflatable robot arm in its environment. The bending of the robot is modelled using an Euler-Bernoulli beam theory which takes into account the variation of the robot’s structural stiffness. The parameters of the model are estimated online using an observer based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The parameters’ estimates are used to approximate the Jacobian matrix online and used to control the robot’s tip considering also variations in the robot’s stiffness. Simulation results and experiments using a fabric-based planar 3-degree-of-freedom (DOF) inflatable manipulators demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed control algorithm.
