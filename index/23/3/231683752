We present an algorithm that takes as input a graph <tex>$G$</tex> with weights on the vertices, and computes a maximum weight independent set <tex>$S$</tex> of <tex>$G$</tex>. If the input graph <tex>$G$</tex> excludes a path <tex>$P_{k}$</tex> on <tex>$k$</tex> vertices as an induced subgraph, the algorithm runs in time <tex>$n^{O(k^{2}\log^{3}n)}$</tex>. Hence, for every fixed <tex>$k$</tex> our algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time. This resolves in the affirmative an open problem of [Thomassé, SODA'20 invited presentation]. Previous to this work, polynomial time algorithms were only known for <tex>$P_{4}$</tex>-free graphs [Corneil et al., DAM'81], <tex>$P_{5}$</tex>-free graphs [Lokshtanov et al., SODA'14], and <tex>$P_{6}$</tex>-free graphs [Grzesik et al., SODA'19]. For larger values of <tex>$t$</tex>, only <tex>$2^{O(\sqrt{kn\log n})}$</tex> time algorithms [Bacsó et al., Algorithmica'19] and quasipolynomial time approximation schemes [Chudnovsky et al., SODA'20] were known. Thus, our work is the first to offer conclusive evidence that Independent Set on <tex>$P_{k}$</tex> - free graphs is not NP-complete for any integer <tex>$k$</tex>. Additionally we show that for every graph <tex>$H$</tex>, if there exists a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for Independent Seton <tex>$C$</tex>-free graphs for every connected component <tex>$C$</tex> of <tex>$H$</tex>, then there also exists a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for Independent Set on <tex>$H$</tex>-free graphs. This lifts our quasi-polynomial time algorithm to <tex>$T_{k}$</tex>-free graphs, where <tex>$T_{k}$</tex> has one component that is a <tex>$P_{k}$</tex>, and <tex>$k-1$</tex> components isomorphic to a fork (the unique 5-vertex tree with a degree 3 vertex).
