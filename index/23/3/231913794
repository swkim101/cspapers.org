Visual robot perception has been challenging to successful robot manipulation in noisy, cluttered and dynamic environments. While some perception systems fail to provide an adequate semantics of the scene, others fail to present appropriate learning models and training data. Another major issue encountered in some robot perception systems is their inability to promptly respond to robot control programs whose realtimeness is crucial.This paper proposes an architecture to robot vision for manipulation tasks that addresses the three issues mentioned above. The architecture encompasses a generator of training datasets and a learnable scene describer, coined as RobotVQA for Robot Visual Question Answering. The architecture leverages the power of deep learning to predict and photo-realistic virtual worlds to train. RobotVQA takes as input a robot sceneâ€™s RGB or RGBD image, detects all relevant objects in it, then describes in realtime each object in terms of category, color, material, shape, openability, 6D-pose and segmentation mask. Moreover, RobotVQA computes the qualitative spatial relations among those objects. We refer to such a scene description in this paper as scene graph or semantic graph of the scene. In RobotVQA, prediction and training take place in a unified manner. Finally, we demonstrate how RobotVQA is suitable for robot control systems that interpret perception as a question answering process.
