This research optimizes the absorption of solar energy in solar panels by designing mechanical systems that can move solar panels in the direction of incoming sunlight. Light-sensitive sensors are used to track the sun. The solar tracking system is designed using two axes, namely rotation axis and the tilt axis. Both axes are driven by servo motors based on light-sensitive sensors. The system was developed using an ATmega328 microcontroller unit. The test results found that using solar tracking the amount of energy produced was greater than static solar panels. Radiation generated between solar tracking and static sun can increase by 55.2%.
