With the rapid technological change of society with Artificial Intelligence, elementary schools' goal should be to prepare the next generations according to competencies. We propose an AI curriculum to cultivate students' AI literacy to answer the question of ‘why and what to teach’ on AI. The proposed AI curriculum focuses on achieving AI literacy based on three competencies: AI Knowledge, AI Skill, and AI Attitude. We anticipate that the proposed curriculum will equip students with core competencies for the future with AI.
