This paper proposes ROS-lite, a robot operating system (ROS) development framework for embedded many- core platforms based on network-on-chip (NoC) technology. Many-core platforms support the high processing capacity and low power consumption requirement of embedded systems. In this study, a self-driving software platform module is parallelized to run on many-core processors to demonstrate the practicality of embedded many-core platforms. The experimental results show that the proposed framework and the parallelized applications have met the deadline for low-speed self-driving systems.
