The ever-increasing demand for wireless applications has resulted in an unprecedented radio frequency (RF) spectrum shortage. Ironically, at the same time, actual utilization of the spectrum is sparse in practice [1]. To exploit previously underutilized frequency bands to accommodate new unlicensed applications and achieve highly efficient usage of the spectrum, the Federal Communications Committee (FCC) has repurposed many frequency bands for dynamic spectrum sharing. This includes the 6 GHz band to be shared between Wi-Fi 6 and the incumbent users [2] as well as the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band [3].
