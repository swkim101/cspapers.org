UAVs or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are an upcoming technology which has eased human lifestyles in many ways. Due to this trend future skies have a risk of getting congested. In such a situation time optimal collision avoidance would be extremely vital to travel in a shortest possible time by avoiding collisions. The paper proposes a novel method for time optimal collision avoidance for UAVs. The proposed algorithm is constructed as a three-stage approach based on the Collision Cone method with slight modifications. A sliding mode controller is used as the control law for the navigation. Mathematical proofs are included to verify the time optimality of the proposed method. The efficiency and the applicability of the work carried out is confirmed by both simulation and experimental results. An automated Matrice 600 Pro hexacopter has been used for the experiments.
