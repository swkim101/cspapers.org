Various investigations on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been conducted. However, only a few of these studies were related to quality of service (QoS). QoS control for WSNs is defined as the control of the number of active sensors. Effective control of the number of active sensors is important to prevent wastage in power resources and bandwidth as well as to satisfy the application demands. In a real network environment, controlling the number of active sensors is a difficult task because of the death and renewal of sensors, which cause frequent changes in the nodes. Two distributed algorithms were previously proposed for QoS control of WSNs. Two methods can be used for the effective control of sensor status: the Gur Game and ACK algorithms. This research proposed a new control algorithm called the Sensor Activity Control Strategy (SACS), which provides high-power saving of sensors. The SACS requires less time that the Gur Game and ACK algorithms to achieve the targets.
