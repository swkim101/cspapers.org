A large overhead in the analytics process is the time required to find relevant data. We present an ontology-driven data discovery application, implemented over IBMâ€™s Cognitive Enterprise Data Platform (CEDP). CEDP contains a large collection of heterogeneous data assets from enterprise-wide data sources. The application accelerates the time required for data consumers to search and find data relevant for their analytics applications.
