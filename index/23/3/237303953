App usage prediction is important for smartphone system optimization to enhance user experience. Existing modeling approaches utilize historical app usage logs along with a wide range of semantic information to predict the app usage; however, they are only effective in certain scenarios and cannot be generalized across different situations. This paper address this problem by developing a model called Contextual and Semantic Embedding model for App Usage Prediction (CoSEM) for app usage prediction that leverages integration of 1) semantic information embedding and 2) contextual information embedding based on historical app usage of individuals. Extensive experiments show that the combination of semantic information and history app usage information enables our model to outperform the baselines on three real-world datasets, achieving an MRR score over 0.55,0.57,0.86 and Hit rate scores of more than 0.71, 0.75, and 0.95, respectively.
