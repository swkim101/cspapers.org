The wheelchair is the major means of transport for elderly and physically disabled people in their daily lives. However it cannot overcome architectural barriers such as curbs and stairs. In this study, we developed an inverted-pendulum-type robotic wheelchair for climbing stairs. The wheelchair has a seat slider and two rotary links between the front and rear wheels on each side. When climbing up stairs, the wheelchair rotates the rotary links while maintaining an inverted state of a movable body by controlling the position of the center of gravity using the seat slider. In previous research, we proposed the control method for climbing up stairs using the rotary links and seat slider, confirming a period of approximately 5 s to rotate the rotary links. In this paper, we propose a control method for going down stairs, and experimentally verify the control effectiveness and stability.
