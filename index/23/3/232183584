Knowledge graphs have been used throughout the history of information retrieval for a variety of tasks. Technological advances in knowledge acquisition and alignment technology from the last few years gave rise to a body of new approaches for utilizing knowledge graphs in text retrieval tasks. It is therefore time to consolidate the community efforts in studying how knowledge graph technology can be employed in information retrieval systems in the most effective way. It is also time to start a dialogue with researchers working on knowledge acquisition and alignment to ensure that resulting technologies and algorithms meet the demands posed by information retrieval tasks. The goal of this workshop is to bring together a community of researchers and practitioners who are interested in using, aligning, and constructing knowledge graphs and similar semantic resources for information retrieval applications.
