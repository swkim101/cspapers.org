Contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) is a classic online learning problem, where a learner/agent selects actions (i.e., arms) given contextual information and discovers optimal actions based on reward feedback. Applications of contextual bandit have been increasingly expanding, including advertisement, personalization, resource allocation in wireless networks, among others. Nonetheless, the reward feedback is delayed in many applications (e.g., a user may only provide service ratings after a period of time), creating challenges for contextual bandits. In this paper, we address delayed feedback in contextual bandits by using semi-supervised learning â€” incorporate estimates of delayed rewards to improve the estimation of future rewards. Concretely, the reward feedback for an arm selected at the beginning of a round is only observed by the agent/learner with some observation noise and provided to the agent after some a priori unknown but bounded delays. Motivated by semi-supervised learning that produces pseudo labels for unlabeled data to further improve the model performance, we generate fictitious estimates of rewards that are delayed and have yet to arrive based on already-learnt reward functions. Thus, by combining semi-supervised learning with online contextual bandit learning, we propose a novel extension and design two algorithms, which estimate the values for currently unavailable reward feedbacks to minimize the maximum estimation error and average estimation error, respectively.
