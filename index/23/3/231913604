This paper presents a framework providing a full pipeline to execute a complex physical interaction behaviour of a humanoid bipedal robot, both from a theoretical and a practical standpoint. Building from a multi-contact control architecture that combines contact planning and reactive force distribution capabilities, the main contribution of this work consists in the integration of a sample-based motion planning layer conceived for transitioning movements where obstacle and self-collisions avoidance is involved. To plan these motions we use Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) projected on the contacts manifold and validated through the Centroidal Statics (CS) model, to ensure static balance on non-coplanar surfaces. Finally, we successfully validate the presented planning and control architecture on the humanoid robot COMAN+ performing a wall-plank task.
