The modular assembly and actuation of 3D printed milliscale cuboid robots using a globally applied magnetic field is presented. Cuboids are composed of a rectangular resin shell embedded with two spherical permanent magnets that can independently align with any applied magnetic field. Placing cuboids within short distances of each other allows for modular assembly and disassembly by changing magnetic field direction. Assembled cuboids are demonstrated to stably self-propel under sequential field inputs allowing for both rolling and pivot walking motion modes. Swarms of cuboids could be actuated within the working space and exhibit near identical behavior. Specialized ‘trap robots’ were developed to capture objects, transport them within the working space, and subsequently release the payload in a new location. Cuboids with male and female connectors were developed to exhibit the selective mating between cuboids. The results show that cuboids are a diverse and adaptable platform that has the potential to be scaled down to the sub-millimeter regime for use in medical or small-scale assembly applications.
