This mini-script seeks to generate concerns around an emerging field of work related to space exploration and the rest of society generated by the idea of human colonies in extraterrestrial environments (space stations, moons, and planets). There exists abundant literature on terraforming from biogeochemical conditions, however, there is very limited research about human behavior, interactions, and specific studies of relationships with robots and artificial intelligence into the environments presented previously. For this reason, and with the intention of not replicating the same problems derived from our human condition (violence, extractivism, corruption, etc) preliminary ideas are exposed to think and contribute to the emerging field of cosmoeducation or exo-humanities and others “exo –disciplines” oriented to alternated social systems and human behavioral for a new era of exploration. Initial work path for exo-social science and structural definition of exploration research in human-robot interactions and behavioral (HRIB); Human AI interactions and Behavioral (HAIIB) and Human Post Human interactions and Behavioral (HPHIB).
