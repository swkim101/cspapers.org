This paper presents ITRIX (IT Recovery Instructions
eXtraction)- a solution that automates the complex manual
process of creating executable recovery plans from textual
documents describing IT environment disaster recovery procedure.
The solution applies natural language processing and
deep learning to identify textual content that contain recovery
instructions and information relevant to disaster recovery.
This enables rapid creation and review of recovery plans resulting
in 80% reduction in time taken to generate them.
