BBR is a new congestion control algorithm and is seeing increased adoption especially for video traffic. BBR solves the bufferbloat problem in legacy loss-based congestion control algorithms where application performance drops considerably when router buffers are deep. BBR regulates traffic such that router queues don’t build up to avoid the bufferbloat problem while still maintaining high throughput. However, our analysis shows that video applications experience significantly poor performance when using BBR under deep buffers. In fact, we find that video traffic sees inflated latencies because of long queues at the router, ultimately degrading video performance. To understand this dichotomy, we study the interaction between BBR and DASH video. Our investigation reveals that BBR under deep buffers and high network burstiness severely overestimates available bandwidth and does not converge to steady state, both of which results in BBR sending substantially more data into the network, causing a queue buildup. This elevated packet sending rate under BBR is ultimately caused by the router’s ability to absorb bursts in traffic, which destabilizes BBR’s bandwidth estimation and overrides BBR’s expected logic for exiting the startup phase. We design a new bandwidth estimation algorithm and apply it to BBR (and a still-unreleased, newer version of BBR called BBR2). Our modified BBR and BBR2 both see significantly improved video QoE even under deep buffers.
