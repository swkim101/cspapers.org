We aim to tackle the challenging Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD), where data-scarce categories are presented during the model learning. The failure modes of FasterRCNN in FSOD are investigated, and we find that the performance degradation is mainly due to the classification incapability (false positives) caused by category confusion, which motivates us to address FSOD from a novel aspect of classification refinement. Specifically, we address the intrinsic limitation from the aspects of both architectural enhancement and hard-example mining. We introduce a novel few-shot classification refinement mechanism where a decoupled Few-Shot Classification Network (FSCN) is employed to improve the final classification of a base detector. Moreover, we especially probe a commonly-overlooked but destructive issue of FSOD, i.e., the presence of distractor samples due to the incomplete annotations where images from the base set may contain novel-class objects but remain unlabelled. Retreatment solutions are developed to eliminate the incurred false positives. For FSCN training, the distractor is formulated as a semi-supervised problem, where a distractor utilization loss is proposed to make proper use of it for boosting the data-scarce classes, while a confidence-guided dataset pruning (CGDP) technique is developed to facilitate the few-shot adaptation of base detector. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art FSOD performance on public datasets, e.g., Pascal VOC and MS-COCO.
