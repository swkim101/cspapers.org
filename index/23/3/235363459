Slides are commonly used to present information and tell stories. In academic and research communities, slides are typically used to summarize findings in accepted papers for presentation in meetings and conferences.
These slides for academic papers usually contain common and essential topics such as major contributions, model design, experiment details and future work. In this paper, we aim to automatically generate slides for academic papers. We first conducted an in-depth analysis of how humans create slides. We then mined frequently used slide topics. Given a topic, our approach extracts relevant sentences in the paper to provide the draft slides. Due to the lack of labeling data, we integrate prior knowledge of ground truth sentences into a log-linear model to create an initial pseudo-target distribution. Two sentence extractors are learned collaboratively and bootstrap the performance of each other. Evaluation results on a labeled test set show that our model can extract more relevant sentences than baseline methods. Human evaluation also shows slides generated by our model can serve as a good basis for preparing the final presentations.
