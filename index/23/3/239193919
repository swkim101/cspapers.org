We present dSpace, an open and modular programming framework that aims to simplify and accelerate the development of smart space applications. To achieve this, dSpace provides two key building blocks~digivices that implement device control and actuation and digidata that process IoT data to generate events and insights. In addition, dSpace introduces novel abstractions - mount, yield, and pipe - via which digivices and digidata can be composed into higher-level abstractions. We apply dSpace to home automation systems and show how developers can easily and flexibly leverage these abstractions to support a wide range of home automation scenarios. Finally, we show how the dSpace concepts can be realized using a microservices-based architecture and implement dSpace as a Kubernetes-compatible framework.
