This thesis focuses attention on achieving Distributed Situation Awareness (DSA) with minimal resources (energy, processing cost, etc.) using small low-capacity agents (e.g., UAVs) coordinated in a decentralised fashion while conducting searching activity. This is in contrast to the existing works involving convoluted communication and information processing.
