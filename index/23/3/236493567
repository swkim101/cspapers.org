Adversarial training has been empirically proven to be one of the most effective and reliable defense methods against adversarial attacks. However, the majority of existing studies are focused on balanced datasets, where each class has a similar amount of training examples. Research on adversarial training with imbalanced training datasets is rather limited. As the initial effort to investigate this problem, we reveal the facts that adversarially trained models present two distinguished behaviors from naturally trained models in imbalanced datasets: (1) Compared to natural training, adversarially trained models can suffer much worse performance on under-represented classes, when the training dataset is extremely imbalanced. (2) Traditional reweighting strategies which assign large weights to underrepresented classes will drastically hurt the modelâ€™s performance on well-represented classes. In this paper, to further understand our observations, we theoretically show that the poor data separability is one key reason causing this strong tension between under-represented and well-represented classes. Motivated by this finding, we propose the Separable Reweighted Adversarial Training (SRAT) framework to facilitate adversarial training under imbalanced scenarios, by learning more separable features for different classes. Extensive experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
