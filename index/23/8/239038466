A remote team of robots may be teleoperated by multiple users to explore unstructured environments and to tackle unforeseen emergencies therein. During a large-scale environmental search, each user may visually observe a unique hazard endangering the remote robot connected to their local robot. Therefore, each user may want to tele-drive the remote robot team to a location different than the target locations of other users. This paper resolves the possible conflicts among the multiple user commands through a distributed clustering algorithm that allocates to each user a number of remote robots proportional to the urgency of their request. A pivotal design challenge in the teleoperation context is to ensure that the remote robots allocated to each user are topologically reachable from the userâ€™s local robot within the induced communication subnetwork. The proposed design overcomes this challenge through a reachability-constrained integer linear program that modulates the interconnections of the remote robots on the fly. A comparative experiment on a platform with 2 local and 12 remote robots validates the practical efficacy of the proposed clustering algorithm.
