—Endpoint monitoring solutions are widely deployed in today’s enterprise environments to support advanced attack detection and investigation. These monitors continuously record system-level activities as audit logs and provide deep visibility into security incidents. Unfortunately, to recognize behaviors of interest and detect potential threats, cyber analysts face a semantic gap between low-level audit events and high-level system behaviors. To bridge this gap, existing work largely matches streams of audit logs against a knowledge base of rules that describe behaviors. However, specifying such rules heavily relies on expert knowledge. In this paper, we present W ATSON , an automated approach to abstracting behaviors by inferring and aggregating the semantics of audit events. W ATSON uncovers the semantics of events through their usage context in audit logs. By extracting behaviors as connected system operations, W ATSON then combines event semantics as the representation of behaviors. To reduce analysis workload, W ATSON further clusters semanti- cally similar behaviors and distinguishes the representatives for analyst investigation. In our evaluation against both benign and malicious behaviors, W ATSON exhibits high accuracy for behavior abstraction. Moreover, W ATSON can reduce analysis workload by two orders of magnitude for attack investigation.
