We investigate the achievable stability region for redundancy systems and a quite general workload model with different job types and heterogeneous servers, reflecting job-server affinity relations which may arise from data locality issues and soft compatibility constraints. Under the assumption that job types are known beforehand we establish for New-Better-than-Used (NBU) distributed speed variations that no replication gives a strictly larger stability region than replication. Strikingly, this does not depend on the underlying distribution of the intrinsic job sizes, but observing the job types is essential for this statement to hold. In case of non-observable job types we show that for New-Worse-than-Used (NWU) distributed speed variations full replication gives a larger stability region than no replication.
