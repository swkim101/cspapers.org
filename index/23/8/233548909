This paper presents the implementation of a Complex fractional order PID (CPID) and a Real fractional order PID (RPID) controllers. The analysis and design of both controllers were carried out in a previous work done by the author, where the design specifications were classified into easy (case 1) and hard (case 2) design specifications. The main contribution of this paper is combining Crone approximation and linear phase Crone approximation to implement the CPID controller. The designed controllers - RPID and CPID - are implemented to control flowing water with low pressure circuit (FWLPC), which is a First Order Plus Dead Time (FOPDT) system. Simulation results demonstrate that while the implemented RPID controller fails to stabilize the system in case 2, the implemented CPID controller stabilizes the system in both cases and achieves better transient response specifications.
