In physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), robots need to detect and react to intended and unintended contacts in a safe manner. Proprioceptive sensing capabilities and collision detection and identification techniques differ among commercially available robots, which means that also their sensitivity to detect dynamic collisions with the environment or the human co-worker differ. Up to now, there exists no standardized procedure for assessing the contact sensitivity of a robotic system. In this paper, we propose the concept of contact sensitivity maps (CSM), a relationship between the robot's dynamic impact properties and the reliability of its collision handling. The CSM allows the robot user to determine for which robot workspace areas and dynamic collision parameters (mass, velocity) reliable contact detection and reaction can be expected. We propose a standardized benchmarking procedure and test setup for deriving CSMs. Finally, we analyze and compare the experimental results of the Universal Robots UR10e, UR5e, and Franka Emika Panda, where we observe significant differences in contact sensitivity.
