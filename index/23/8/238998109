In the last few years, several methods have been proposed to build meta-embeddings. The general aim was to obtain new representations integrating complementary knowledge from different source pre-trained embeddings thereby improving their overall quality. How-ever, previous meta-embeddings have been evaluated using a variety of methods and datasets, which makes it difﬁcult to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the merits of each approach. In this paper we propose a uniﬁed common framework, including both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, for a fair and objective meta-embeddings evaluation. Fur-thermore, we present a new method to generate meta-embeddings, outperforming previous work on a large number of intrinsic evaluation benchmarks. Our evaluation framework also allows us to conclude that previous extrinsic evaluations of meta-embeddings have been overestimated.
