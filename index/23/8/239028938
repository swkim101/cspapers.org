Similar to satellite-based localization systems, messages sent by aircraft with the ADS-B protocol can be used to estimate the location of a mobile receiver. However, for a robust localization using a least-squares approach, ADS-B messages have to be collected over a long time. We propose a localization method based on matching the received signal with known ADS-B messages from distributed receivers. Our proposed method only requires three seconds of recording. Compared to satellite-based localization methods, this approach also works indoors as the signals sent by aircraft are much stronger.
