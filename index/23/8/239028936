Practical experimentation and prototyping are core steps in the development of any wireless technology. Often times, however, this crucial step is confined to small laboratory setups that do not capture the scale of commercial deployments and do not ensure result reproducibility and replicability, or it is skipped altogether for lack of suitable hardware and testing facilities. Recent years have seen the development of publicly-available testing platforms for wireless experimentation at scale. Examples include the testbeds of the PAWR program and Colosseum, the world's largest wireless network emulator. With its 256 software-defined radios, 24 racks of powerful compute servers and first-of-its-kind channel emulator, Colosseum allows users to prototype wireless solutions at scale, and guarantees reproducibility and replicability of results. This tutorial provides an overview of the Colosseum platform. We describe the architecture and components of the testbed as a whole, and we then showcase how to run practical experiments in diverse scenarios with heterogeneous wireless technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi and cellular). We also emphasize how Colosseum experiments can be ported to different testing platforms, facilitating full-cycle experimental wireless research: design, experiments and tests at scale in a fully controlled and observable environment and testing in the field. The tutorial concludes with considerations on the flexible future of Colosseum, focusing on its planned extension to emulate larger scenarios and channels at higher frequency bands (mmWave).
