Recent studies have shown that graph learning models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and network alignment methods are no exception. How to enhance the robustness of network alignment against adversarial attacks remains an open research problem. In this paper, we propose a robust network alignment solution, RNA, for offering preemptive protection of existing network alignment algorithms, enhanced with the guidance of effective adversarial attacks. First, we analyze how popular iterative gradient-based adversarial attack techniques suffer from gradient vanishing issues and show a fake sense of attack effectiveness. Based on dynamical isometry theory, an attack signal scaling (ASS) method with established upper bound of feasible signal scaling is introduced to alleviate the gradient vanishing issues for effective adversarial attacks while maintaining the decision boundary of network alignment. Second, we develop an adversarial perturbation elimination (APE) model to neutralize adversarial nodes in vulnerable space to adversarial-free nodes in safe area, by integrating Dirac delta approximation (DDA) techniques and the LSTM models. Our proposed APE method is able to provide proactive protection to existing network alignment algorithms against adversarial attacks. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the existence of an optimal distribution for the APE model to reach a lower bound. Last but not least, extensive evaluation on real datasets presents that RNA is able to offer the preemptive protection to trained network alignment methods against three popular adversarial attack models.
