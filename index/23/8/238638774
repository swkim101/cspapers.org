With the portable and affordable gaze input devices being marketed for end users, gaze-based interactions were getting increasingly popular. Unfortunately, the understanding about the dominant task of gaze input, i.e. eye pointing task, was still not sufficient although a performance model had been specifically proposed in previous study because of that 1) the original model was based on a specific circular target condition, without the ability to predict the performance of acquiring conventional rectangular targets and that 2) there was a lack of explanation from the perspective of the anatomical structure of the eyes. In this paper, we proposed a 2D extension to take account of more general target conditions. Carrying out two experiments, we evaluated the effectiveness of the new model and furthermore we found that the index of difficulty that we redefined for 2D eye pointing (IDeye) was able to properly reflect the asymmetrical impacts of target width and height, and consequently the IDeye model could more accurately and properly predict the performance when acquiring 2D targets than Fittsâ€™ law, no matter what kind of saccades or eye orientations (i.e. saccadic eye movement directions) was employed to acquire the desired targets. According to the results, we provided more useful implications and recommendations for gaze-based applications.
