Robotic manipulators are increasingly being used to perform additive manufacturing. The accuracy of a built part is dependent on the trajectory execution error of the manipulator. For articulated manipulators, the trajectory execution error and achievable build accuracy vary considerably over the workspace. Therefore, the build accuracy depends on where the part is placed in the manipulator workspace. If the part is small compared to the manipulator workspace, its placement can be optimized to improve the accuracy. This paper provides experimental evidence that the placement of the parts changes its build accuracy. We model the trajectory execution error of the manipulator for additive manufacturing. We validate these errors by comparing the predicted errors with the experimental errors. Finally, we present an algorithm to optimize the part placement for improving built part accuracy during robot-based additive manufacturing.
