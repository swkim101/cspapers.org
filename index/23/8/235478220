TLS clients rely on a supporting PKI in which certiﬁcate authorities (CAs)—trusted organizations—validate and cryptographically attest to the identities of web servers. A client’s conﬁdence that it is connecting to the right server depends entirely on the set of CAs that it trusts. However, as we demonstrate in this work, the identity speciﬁed in CA certiﬁcates is frequently inaccurate due to lax naming requirements, ownership changes, and long-lived certiﬁcates. This not only mud-dles client selection of trusted CAs, but also prevents PKI operators and researchers from correctly attributing CA certiﬁcate issues to CA organizations. To help Web PKI participants understand the organizations that control each CA certiﬁcate, we develop Fides, a system that models and clusters CA operational behavior in order to detect CA certiﬁcates under shared operational control. We label the clusters that Fides uncovers, and build a new database of CA ownership that corrects the CA operator for 241 CA certiﬁcates, and expands coverage to 651 new CA certiﬁcates, leading to a more complete picture of CA certiﬁcate control.
