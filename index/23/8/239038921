A well known and well-studied feature of boatsâ€™ dynamic is the effect of steering-induced roll. This property is used by a technique called Rudder Roll Stabilization (RRS) to stabilise ships in waves in order to make the navigation safer and more pleasant. This technique is based on the generation of induced roll. Because of its specific application, studies have been limited to commercial vessels using a Single Propeller-Rudder System (SPRS). This study not only broadens the technique to any propulsion and steering mechanisms that can be used with RRS by introducing the thrust asymmetry, but it also incorporates the effect of the centrifugal forces that were previously left off. To prove the capabilities of the new concept, a test is effectuated employing an RC demonstrator fitted with a Differential Jet Pump System (DJPS), performing a turning circle test manoeuvre.
