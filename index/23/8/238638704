Touch point distribution models are important tools for designing touchscreen interfaces. In this paper, we investigate how the finger movement direction affects the touch point distribution, and how to account for it in modeling. We propose the Rotational Dual Gaussian model, a refinement and generalization of the Dual Gaussian model, to account for the finger movement direction in predicting touch point distribution. In this model, the major axis of the prediction ellipse of the touch point distribution is along the finger movement direction, and the minor axis is perpendicular to the finger movement direction. We also propose using projected target width and height, in lieu of nominal target width and height to model touch point distribution. Evaluation on three empirical datasets shows that the new model reflects the observation that the touch point distribution is elongated along the finger movement direction, and outperforms the original Dual Gaussian Model in all prediction tests. Compared with the original Dual Gaussian model, the Rotational Dual Gaussian model reduces the RMSE of touch error rate prediction from 8.49% to 4.95%, and more accurately predicts the touch point distribution in target acquisition. Using the Rotational Dual Gaussian model can also improve the soft keyboard decoding accuracy on smartwatches.
