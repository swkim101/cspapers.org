Android applications have a long history of being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks due to insecure custom TLS certiﬁcate validation implementations. To resolve this, Google deployed the Network Security Conﬁguration (NSC), a conﬁguration-based approach to increase custom certiﬁ-cate validation logic security, and implemented safeguards in Google Play to block insecure applications. In this paper, we perform a large-scale in-depth investigation of the effectiveness of these countermeasures: First, we investigate the security of 99,212 NSC settings ﬁles in 1,335,322 Google Play apps using static code and manual analysis techniques. We ﬁnd that 88.87% of the apps using custom NSC settings downgrade security compared to the default settings, and only 0.67% implement certiﬁcate pinning. Second, we penetrate Google Play’s protection mechanisms by trying to publish apps that are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. In contrast to ofﬁcial announcements by Google, we found that Play does not effectively block vulnerable apps. Finally, we performed a static code analysis study of 15,000 apps and ﬁnd that 5,511 recently published apps still contain vulnerable certiﬁcate validation code. Overall, we attribute most of the problems we ﬁnd to insuf-ﬁcient support for developers, missing clariﬁcation of security risks in ofﬁcial documentation, and inadequate security checks for vulnerable applications in Google Play.
