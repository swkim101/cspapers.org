Demands on leg degrees of freedom and control precision for bipedal robotics are steadily increasing, especially for the tasks involving walking on a rough terrain. In this paper we present an alternative, as well as a working proof-of-concept. Meet gyrubot: a 5-link almost planar bipedal robot with a torso complemented by a nonanthropomorphic stabilization system, capable of blindly walking through uneven areas. Despite being almost planar, the robot does not need any support in the frontal plane! This paper describes the mechanical design and the architecture of the controllers. We also provide the experimental evidence of the ability of gyrubot to navigate across non-flat terrains.
