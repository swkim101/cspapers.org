Software is created for and with a wide range of stakeholders, from customers to management, from value-added providers to customer service personnel. These stakeholders work with teams of software engineers to develop and evolve software systems that support their activities. All of these people and their interactions are central to software development. It is crucial to investigate the dynamic and frequently changing Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE), both before and after deployment, in order to understand current software practices, processes, and tools and their impact on important local and global issues. In turn, this enables us to design tools and support mechanisms that improve software creation, software maintenance, customer communication, and the cooperative and human aspects of the use and evolution of the deployed software systems. Researchers and practitioners have long recognized the need to investigate these aspects, however, their articles are scattered across conferences and communities. CHASE will provide a unified forum for discussing high quality research studies, models, methods, and tools for human and cooperative aspects of software engineering. This will be the 10th in a series of workshops held at ICSE focusing on this theme. Based on our experience, we believe it will be a meeting place for the academic, industrial, and practitioner communities interested in this area, and will give opportunities to present and discuss works-in-progress.
