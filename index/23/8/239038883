Testing mobile robots is difficult and expensive, and many faults go undetected. In this work we explore whether fuzzing, an automated test input generation technique, can more quickly find failure inducing inputs in mobile robots. We developed a simple fuzzing adaptation, BASE-FUZZ, and one specialized for fuzzing mobile robots, PHYS-FUZZ. PHYS-FUZZ is unique in that it accounts for physical attributes such as the robot dimensions, estimated trajectories, and time to impact measures to guide the test input generation process. The results of evaluating PHYS-FUZZ suggest that it has the potential to speed up the discovery of input scenarios that reveal failures, finding 56.5% more than uniform random input selection and 7.0% more than BASE-FUZZ during 7 days of testing.
