Facial paralysis is the most common facial nerve disorder. It causes functional and aesthetic deficits that often lead to emotional distress and affect psychosocial well-being. One form of treatment is mirror therapy, which has shown potential but has several mirror-related drawbacks that limit its effectiveness. We propose FaraPy, the first mobile augmented reality mirror therapy system for facial paralysis that provides real-time feedback and tracks user progress over time. We developed an efficient convolutional neural network to detect muscle activations and intensities as users perform facial exercises in front of a mobile device camera. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art model on benchmark data for detecting facial action unit intensity. Our user study (n=20) shows high user satisfaction and greater preference for our interactive system over traditional mirror therapy.
