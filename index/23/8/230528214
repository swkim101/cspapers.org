Among the huge number of fluorescent compounds described recently, pyrazole derivatives
could play a paramount role in the design of probes for bioimaging applications–an important
and simple tool for modern biology because of their easy synthetic methodologies, remarkable optical
properties and chelating points. In this mini-review, we highlighted some pyrazole derivatives
that have shown remarkable performance in this area; from the detection of chromium (III) with
limits of detection of 37 × 10-12 M to sensing glutathione in biological samples, as well as small
molecule labeling of drugs and identifying unhealthy cells such as HeLa and labeling subcellular
organelles. Evidently, this important class of N-heterocyclic compounds is part of interesting applications.
