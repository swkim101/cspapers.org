Interface designers often refer to UI behavior examples found in the wild (e.g., commercial websites) for reference or design inspiration. While past research has looked at retargeting interface and webpage design, limited work has explored the challenges in retargeting interactive visual behaviors. We introduce Umitation, a system that helps designers extract, edit, and adapt example front-end UI behaviors to target websites. Umitation can also help designers specify the desired behaviors and reconcile their intended interaction details with their existing UI. In a qualitative evaluation, we found evidence that Umitation helps participants extract and retarget dynamic front-end UI behavior examples quickly and expressively.
