Designing a robot or structure that can fold into a target shape is a process that involves challenges originated from multiple sources. For example, the designer of self-folding robots must consider foldability from geometric and kinematic aspects to avoid self-collisions and undesired deformations. Recent works have shown success in estimating foldability of a design using robot motion planners. However, many foldable structures are actuated using physically coupled reactions, e.g., folding originated from thermal, chemical, or electromagnetic loads. Therefore, a reliable folding process must consider additional constraints that result from these critical and coupled phenomena. This work investigates the idea of efficiently incorporating computationally intensive physics simulations within the folding motion planner to affect the physical folding results. We will use the manufacturing process of laser-forming origami as an example to demonstrate the benefits of considering the physical properties of the foldable structure beyond its kinematics. We show that designs produced by the proposed method can be fabricated more efficiently.
