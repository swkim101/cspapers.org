Graph neural networks (GNNs) emerged recently as a standard toolkit for learning from data on graphs. Current GNN designing works depend on immense human expertise to explore different message-passing mechanisms, and require manual enumeration to determine the proper message-passing depth. Inspired by the strong searching capability of neural architecture search (NAS) in CNN, this paper proposes Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) with novel-designed search space. The GNAS can automatically learn better architecture with the optimal depth of message passing on the graph. Specifically, we design Graph Neural Architecture Paradigm (GAP) with tree-topology computation procedure and two types of fine-grained atomic operations (feature filtering & neighbor aggregation) from message-passing mechanism to construct powerful graph network search space. Feature filtering performs adaptive feature selection, and neighbor aggregation captures structural information and calculates neighborsâ€™ statistics. Experiments show that our GNAS can search for better GNNs with multiple message-passing mechanisms and optimal message-passing depth. The searched network achieves remarkable improvement over state-of-the-art manual designed and search-based GNNs on five large-scale datasets at three classical graph tasks.
