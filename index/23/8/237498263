Video super-resolution (VSR) aims to improve the spatial resolution of low-resolution (LR) videos. Existing VSR methods are mostly trained and evaluated on synthetic datasets, where the LR videos are uniformly downsampled from their high-resolution (HR) counterparts by some simple operators (e.g., bicubic downsampling). Such simple synthetic degradation models, however, cannot well describe the complex degradation processes in real-world videos, and thus the trained VSR models become ineffective in real-world applications. As an attempt to bridge the gap, we build a real-world video super-resolution (RealVSR) dataset by capturing paired LR-HR video sequences using the multi-camera system of iPhone 11 Pro Max. Since the LR-HR video pairs are captured by two separate cameras, there are inevitably certain misalignment and luminance/color differences between them. To more robustly train the VSR model and recover more details from the LR inputs, we convert the LR-HR videos into YCbCr space and decompose the luminance channel into a Laplacian pyramid, and then apply different loss functions to different components. Experiments validate that VSR models trained on our RealVSR dataset demonstrate better visual quality than those trained on synthetic datasets under real-world settings. They also exhibit good generalization capability in cross-camera tests. The dataset and code can be found at https://github.com/IanYeung/RealVSR.
