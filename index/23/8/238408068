Autonomous robots deal with unexpected scenarios in real environments. Given input images, various visual perception tasks can be performed, e.g., semantic segmentation, depth estimation and normal estimation. These different tasks provide rich information for the whole robotic perception system. All tasks have their own characteristics while sharing some latent correlations. However, some of the task predictions may suffer from the unreliability dealing with complex scenes and anomalies. We propose an attention-based failure detection approach by exploiting the correlations among multiple tasks. The proposed framework infers task failures by evaluating the individual prediction, across multiple visual perception tasks for different regions in an image. The formulation of the evaluations is based on an attention network supervised by multi-task uncertainty estimation and their corresponding prediction errors. Our proposed framework11Code link https://github.com/ethz-asl/uncertainty_with_multiple_tasks. generates more accurate estimations of the prediction error for the different task's predictions.
