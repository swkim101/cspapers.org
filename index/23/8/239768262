This paper introduces a discrete-continuous action space to learn insertion primitives for robotic assembly tasks. Primitives are sequences of elementary actions with certain exit conditions, such as “pushing down the peg until contact”. Since the primitive is an abstraction of robot control commands and encodes human prior knowledge, it reduces the exploration difficulty and yields better learning efficiency. In this paper, we learn robot assembly skills via primitives. Specifically, we formulate insertion primitives as parameterized actions: hybrid actions consisting of discrete primitive types and continuous primitive parameters. Compared with the previous work using a set of discretized parameters for each primitive, the agent in our method can freely choose primitive parameters from a continuous space, which is more flexible and efficient. To learn these insertion primitives, we propose Twin-Smoothed Multi-pass Deep Q-Network (TS-MP-DQN), an advanced version of MP-DQN with twin Q-network to reduce the Q-value over-estimation. Extensive experiments are conducted in the simulation and real world for validation. From experiment results, our approach achieves higher success rates than three baselines: MP-DQN with parameterized actions, primitives with discrete parameters, and continuous velocity control. Furthermore, learned primitives are robust to sim-to-real transfer and can generalize to challenging assembly tasks such as tight round peg-hole and complex shaped electric connectors with promising success rates.
