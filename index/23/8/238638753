We propose ModularHMD, a new mobile head-mounted display concept, which adopts a modular mechanism and allows a user to perform ad-hoc peripheral interaction with real-world devices or people during VR experiences. ModularHMD is comprised of a central HMD and three removable module devices installed in the periphery of the HMD cowl. Each module has four main states: occluding, extended VR view, video see-through (VST), and removed/reused. Among different combinations of module states, a user can quickly setup the necessary HMD forms, functions, and real-world visions for ad-hoc peripheral interactions without removing the headset. For instance, an HMD user can see her surroundings by switching a module into the VST mode. She can also physically remove a module to obtain direct peripheral visions of the real world. The removed module can be reused as an instant interaction device (e.g., touch keyboards) for subsequent peripheral interactions. Users can end the peripheral interaction and revert to a full VR experience by re-mounting the module. We design ModularHMDâ€™s configuration and peripheral interactions with real-world objects and people. We also implement a proof-of-concept prototype of ModularHMD to validate its interactions capabilities through a user study. Results show that ModularHMD is an effective solution that enables both immersive VR and ad-hoc peripheral interactions.
