A good educational process is one that is able to encompass existing communities, not expection for children with special needs. But the lack of adequate facilities makes them lack of maximum learning. SooLics (Smart Room for Learns Physics) with Augmented Reality Sound Technology based on Camera as a learning room for children with visual blindness is a room specifically designed for children with visual blindness to improve understanding about physics. In contrast to the usual learning room, Augmented Reality Sound Technology is used for visualization of physical matter that has been prepared in the room as a “visual aid” for children with visual blindness. We use Research and Development (R&D) methode which is consists of defining studies (define), the design phase (design), and development. This research uses a camera which is specially designed to be used as a scan media for markers on augmented reality technology that has been prepared and installed in the room and the results are sound about physics matter. This room is designed so that blind children can learns independently.
