Navigation through dynamic pedestrian environments in a socially compliant manner is still a challenging task for autonomous vehicles. Classical methods usually lead to unnatural vehicle behaviours for pedestrian navigation due to the difficulty in modeling social conventions mathematically. This paper presents an end-to-end path planning system that achieves autonomous navigation in dynamic environments through imitation learning. The proposed system is based on a fully convolutional neural network that maps the raw sensory data into a confidence map for path extraction. Additionally, a classification network is introduced to reduce the unnecessary re-plannings and ensures that the vehicle goes back to the global path when re-planning is not needed. The imitation learning based path planner is implemented on an autonomous wheelchair and tested in a new real-world dynamic pedestrian environment. Experimental results show that the proposed system is able to generate paths for different driving tasks, such as pedestrian following, static and dynamic obstacles avoidance, etc. In comparison to the state-of-the-art method, our system is superior in terms of generating human-like trajectories.
