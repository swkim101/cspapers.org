This paper presents an integrated methodology and experimental validation of an autonomous framework for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) merely equipped with a conventional monocular camera and a pressure sensor to accomplish high-performance autonomy. Optimal pose of the UUV is solved iteratively by Levenburg-Marquardt optimization for the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem. To guarantee a consistent localization system, a properly-tuned EKF with extra outlier removal approaches including applying Chi-square tests of innovations adequately removes measurement noises, mean-while provides unknown navigation state estimations. A classic adaptive controller is developed to enable autonomous mobility. Real-time experiments are designed to demonstrate underwater autonomous performance with a miniature commercial UUV, BlueROV2 Heavy.
