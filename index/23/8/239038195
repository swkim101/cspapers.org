As a life-threatening disease, stroke can lead to long-term problems affecting the patients’ daily living ability. A common problem facing post-stroke patients is foot drop. An emerging modality of interest for correcting the foot drop is to combine both actuated ankle-foot orthosis (AAFO) and functional electrical stimulation (FES). Such hybrid assistive system not only ensure effective assistance but also can avoid fast muscular fatigue due to excessive muscular stimulation. Due to the significant changes in the ankle joint’s kinematics and kinetics with gait cycles, optimization control strategies for hybrid AAFO and FES systems are highly demanded. However, it is challenging to develop accurate gait phase detection algorithms to guide the control of AAFO and FES while ensuring robustness with respect to the diversity and variability of patients’ gaits. In this paper, we present a novel swing sub-phase detection algorithm based on a moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator. The proposed detection algorithm uses only information collected from the affected leg by means of two inertia measurement units (IMU) and the AAFO. Moreover, a gait-phase based control strategy is developed to optimize the assistive effect of a hybrid AAFO and FES system. Experimental results with five healthy show the potential of the proposed approaches in ensuring both satisfactory ankle joint trajectory tracking and effective reduction in stimulation intensity, compared to the use of conventional FES assistance.
