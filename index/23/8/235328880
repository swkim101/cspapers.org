We present S TORM , a web framework that allows developers to build MVC applications with compile-time enforcement of centrally speciﬁed data-dependent security policies. S TORM ensures security using a Security Typed ORM that reﬁnes the (type) abstractions of each layer of the MVC API with logical assertions that describe the data produced and consumed by the underlying operation and the users allowed access to that data. To evaluate the security guarantees of S TORM , we build a formally veriﬁed reference implementation using the Labeled IO (LIO) IFC framework. We present case studies and end-to-end applications that show how S TORM lets developers specify diverse policies while centralizing the trusted code to under 1% of the application, and statically enforces security with modest type annotation overhead, and no run-time cost. Abstract Our artifact contains (a snapshot of) the source code for the implementation of S TORM from § 5, the formally veriﬁedrefer-ence implementation λ S TORM described in § 6), the various policies, case-studies and applications used in our evaluation § 7. The artifact provides a we provide show Next, the shows how
