In industrialized wine production, brewing and aging are two key steps. These two processes require the liquors to be bottled for a long time, sometimes more than ten years. The liquor is vulnerable and highly susceptible to microbial contamination during storage, causing undetectable deterioration. During the production process, wineries control the indoor temperature and carbon dioxide concentration to slow down other microorganisms' reproduction speed. These methods, however, do not prevent pathogenic microorganism growth. Currently, microbial culture methods are not suitable for real-time liquor quality monitoring in wineries. Therefore, we have designed a lightweight monitoring system called Lili, which uses light signals to monitor real-time liquor quality changes. Lili detects the changes in surface tension and absorption spectrum caused by microbial metabolites and growth during deterioration. Lili employs eight LEDs and one photodiode to achieve fine-grained surface tension and absorption spectrum measurements. By analyzing these changes, Lili realizes real-time quality monitoring. In this paper, the characteristic offset degree measurement and the absorption spectrum dimension expansion are two critical technologies. In addition, we implemented countermeasures against ambient light noise and sloshing interference. Lili's surface tension and absorption spectrum measurement errors are only 0.89 mN/m and 2.4%, respectively, making it useful to identify the contamination duration, microorganism content and microorganism composition. These two data points can be used to determine potential issues with liquor quality when the liquor becomes health-threatening or even just contaminated, with an accuracy of 97.5%.
