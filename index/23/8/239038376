The barcode navigation based on QR (quick response) codes is widely employed in industrial logistics due to its accurate localization and flexible movement paths. However, the regular repair of damaged barcodes and robot speed control when approaching the barcodes are required. In this study, we presented an improved magnetic spot navigation approach to replace the barcode navigation for automated guided vehicles (AGVs). The fusion of the high-precision magnetic tracking method and odometer based on AGV encoders can overcome the disadvantages of barcode navigation. The magnetic tracking approach provides the AGV pose relative to the nearest magnet spot, instead of the low-precision longitudinal and lateral measurement via a magnetic ruler. Besides, with the benefit of the adaptive weighted fusion algorithm, the distance between the adjacent barcode can be set from 500 to 1000 mm via magnetic spots. Experimental results show that the mean path accuracy and mean magnet spot localization accuracy of the improved magnetic spot navigation were 110 ± 30 mm and 14.5 ± 0.87 mm, respectively. The proposed approach provides a novel possibility for large-area and high-precision navigation in AGVs-based industrial logistics, especially for large outdoor scenarios.
