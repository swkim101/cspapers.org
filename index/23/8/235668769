In modern real-time multicore systems, understanding and adequately managing shared caches is essential to ensure the temporal isolation of critical tasks. Recent research has identified and extensively studied the sources of unpredictability imputable to shared caches, heavily promoting techniques such as cache partitioning and internal resources management. In this article, we highlight the existence of an enigmatic source of inter-core interference: the CPU-brainfreeze. Experiments realized on a development board show that benchmarks (selected from the San-Diego Vision Benchmark Suite) can exhibit up to a 10-fold increase in their execution time. The same experiment shows that for extreme cases, the core cluster can be stalled indefinitely.
