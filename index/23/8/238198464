This paper presents a self-supervised method for learning reliable visual correspondence from unlabeled videos. We formulate the correspondence as finding paths in a joint space-time graph, where nodes are grid patches sampled from frames, and are linked by two type of edges: (i) neighbor relations that determine the aggregation strength from intra-frame neighbors in space, and (ii) similarity relations that indicate the transition probability of inter-frame paths across time. Leveraging the cycle-consistency in videos, our contrastive learning objective discriminates dynamic objects from both their neighboring views and temporal views. Compared with prior works, our approach actively explores the neighbor relations of central instances to learn a latent association between center-neighbor pairs (e.g., "hand â€“ arm") across time, thus improving the instance discrimination. Without fine-tuning, our learned representation outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on a variety of visual tasks including video object propagation, part propagation, and pose keypoint tracking. Our self-supervised method also surpasses some fully supervised algorithms designed for the specific tasks.
