Collaborative Filtering (CF), as one of the most popular approaches, is widely employed in recommender systems but suffers from the cold-start problem, where interactions are very limited for new users in the system. To deal with this issue, previous work has largely focused on utilizing various auxiliary information such as user profiles and social relationships to infer user preferences. However, the auxiliary information is not always available due to reasons such as user privacy concerns, making the CF approaches have to count on the limited interactions. Moreover, real-world situations require both accurate and quick recommendations for newly arrived users dynamically. Therefore, it is of critical importance to enable fast learning for new users during the training time of CF models. In this paper, we present a novel learning paradigm, named MetaCF, to learn an accurate CF model that makes fast adaptation on new users with limited interactions. Inspired by meta-learning, MetaCF treats the fast adaptation on a new user as a task and aims to learn a suitable model for initializing the adaption. To pursue a well-generalized model, MetaCF is equipped with a Dynamic Subgraph Sampling that accounts for the dynamic arrival of new users by dynamically generating representative adaptation tasks for existing users. Moreover, to stabilize the adaption procedure that faces the shortage of training samples, MetaCF further optimizes the learning rates for adaption in a fine-grained manner. MetaCF is applicable to any differentiable CF-based models where we demonstrate it on two representative ones, FISM [1] and NGCF [2]. Extensive experiments on three datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin in the cold-start scenario where user-item interactions are limited.
