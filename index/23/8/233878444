We present ClaimLinker, a Web service and API that links arbitrary text to a knowledge graph of fact-checked claims, offering a novel kind of semantic annotation of unstructured content. Given a text, ClaimLinker matches parts of it to fact-checked claims mined from popular fact-checking sites and integrated into a rich knowledge graph, thus allowing the further exploration of the linked claims and their associations. The application is based on a scalable, fully unsupervised and modular approach that does not require training or tuning and which can serve high quality results at real time (outperforming existing unsupervised methods). This allows its easy deployment for different contexts and application scenarios.
