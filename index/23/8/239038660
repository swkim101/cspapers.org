Microbubble-induced acoustic microstreaming for efficient on-chip micromanipulation is widely developed in biological applications. However, it is still challenging to simultaneously transport, trap, and rotate single cells using one device in a biocompatible manner, while expensive and bulky traditional acoustic driving system also increases its limitation. This paper presents a portable acoustofluidic device for multifunctional cell manipulation and 3D reconstruction, using acoustically oscillating bottom bubble array. Based on the Arduino-based driving system, multiple bubble-induced microvortices were generated and utilized to achieve multifunctional manipulation in a noninvasive manner. Self-propelled transportation of single or multiple cells is first accomplished by bottom bubble array; Controllable trapping, 3D rotation (in the x-y or x-z plane) of DU145 cells are further performed by every single microbubble. Through experiments, rotation direction, speed and axis can be modulated by tuning the driving frequency and voltage. Finally, 3D cell reconstruction combining imaging processing algorithm with out-of-plane rotation enables a sufficient illustration of cell structures and surface morphology, providing an efficient properties measurement function. All these aspects of this device show great potentials in bioengineering, biophysics and biomedicine.
