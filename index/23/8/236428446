We revisit the fundamental problem of learning Axis-Aligned-Rectangles over a finite grid $X^d\subseteq{\mathbb{R}}^d$ with differential privacy. Existing results show that the sample complexity of this problem is at most $\min\left\{ d{\cdot}\log|X| \;,\; d^{1.5}{\cdot}\left(\log^*|X| \right)^{1.5}\right\}$. That is, existing constructions either require sample complexity that grows linearly with $\log|X|$, or else it grows super linearly with the dimension $d$. We present a novel algorithm that reduces the sample complexity to only $\tilde{O}\left\{d{\cdot}\left(\log^*|X|\right)^{1.5}\right\}$, attaining a dimensionality optimal dependency without requiring the sample complexity to grow with $\log|X|$.The technique used in order to attain this improvement involves the deletion of"exposed"data-points on the go, in a fashion designed to avoid the cost of the adaptive composition theorems. The core of this technique may be of individual interest, introducing a new method for constructing statistically-efficient private algorithms.
