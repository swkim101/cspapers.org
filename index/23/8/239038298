We propose an efficient method to estimate the relative pose of a multi-camera system from a minimum of two affine correspondences (ACs). Our solution is novel as it computes the 6DOF relative pose by utilizing a first-order rotation approximation. We directly derive a single polynomial based on the constraint between ACs and the generalized camera model. Then a closed-form solution is found analytically and it produces an accurate relative pose estimation efficiently. Benefiting from the low number of exploited correspondences and the speed of the solver, it speeds up robust estimators, e.g. RANSAC, significantly. The proposed method is evaluated both on synthetic data and real-world image sequences from the KITTI benchmark. It is shown that the proposed solver is superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy.
