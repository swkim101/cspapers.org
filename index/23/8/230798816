Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have made it increasingly applicable to supplement expert’s decision-making in the form of a decision support system on various tasks. For instance, an AI-based system can provide therapists quantitative analysis on patient’s status to improve practices of rehabilitation assessment. However, there is limited knowledge on the potential of these systems. In this paper, we present the development and evaluation of an interactive AI-based system that supports collaborative decision making with therapists for rehabilitation assessment. This system automatically identifies salient features of assessment to generate patient-specific analysis for therapists, and tunes with their feedback. In two evaluations with therapists, we found that our system supports therapists significantly higher agreement on assessment (0.71 average F1-score) than a traditional system without analysis (0.66 average F1-score, p < 0.05). After tuning with therapist’s feedback, our system significantly improves its performance from 0.8377 to 0.9116 average F1-scores (p < 0.01). This work discusses the potential of a human-AI collaborative system to support more accurate decision making while learning from each other’s strengths.
