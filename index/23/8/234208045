The results of spectral-kinetic studies in the field of nanophotochromism of the coreâ€’
shell type hybrid compounds are integrated. The properties of photochromic nanoparticles based
on photochromic spirocompounds (spiropyrans and spirooxazines), chromenes, and diarylethenes
and nanoparticles of noble metals (Ag and Au), diamonds, graphene and its oxide, silica, fullerenes,
and quantum dots are considered. Preparation methods of photochromic nanoparticles have
been developed.
