Load-carrying capability is an essential criterion in legged robots' practical application. This paper proposes an unpowered hydraulic auxiliary system to improve the legged robot's loading capability and energy efficiency. For humans, it has been widely hypothesized that intra-abdominal pressure can reduce potential injurious compressive force imposed on spinal discs when a person lifts heavy objects. Inspired by this human biomechanical phenomenon, we design a novel loading-carrying strategy using hydraulic cylinders, valves and accumulators. Different from ordinary powered hydraulic systems, this design provides continuous support force to share the load applied on knee joint actuator without consuming extra energy. The bent-leg theoretical model is constructed to validate the design and analysis. A bipedal hydraulic-assisted electric leg prototype (HyELeg) is fabricated and tested for squatting and walking gaits. The results show that with hydraulic assistance, the prototype can save energy by 45.9% for squatting with a load of 125% of its own body weight, and the walking performance is enhanced by 16.9% in energy efficiency with carrying a load of 67.5% of its own body weight.
