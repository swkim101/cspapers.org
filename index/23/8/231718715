Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning architecture that leverages a large number of workers to jointly learn a model with decentralized data. FL has received increasing attention in recent years thanks to its data privacy protection, communication efficiency and a linear speedup for convergence in training (i.e., convergence performance increases linearly with respect to the number of workers). However, existing studies on linear speedup for convergence are only limited to the assumptions of i.i.d. datasets across workers and/or full worker participation, both of which rarely hold in practice. So far, it remains an open question whether or not the linear speedup for convergence is achievable under non-i.i.d. datasets with partial worker participation in FL. In this paper, we show that the answer is affirmative. Specifically, we show that the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm (with two-sided learning rates) on non-i.i.d. datasets in non-convex settings achieves a convergence rate $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{mKT}} + \frac{1}{T})$ for full worker participation and a convergence rate $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{nKT}} + \frac{1}{T})$ for partial worker participation, where $K$ is the number of local steps, $T$ is the number of total communication rounds, $m$ is the total worker number and $n$ is the worker number in one communication round if for partial worker participation. Our results also reveal that the local steps in FL could help the convergence and show that the maximum number of local steps can be improved to $T/m$. We conduct extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 to verify our theoretical results.
