Polyculture farming is a sustainable farming technique based on synergistic interactions between differing plant types that make them more resistant to diseases and pests and better able to retain water. Reduced uniformity can reduce use of pesticides, fertilizer, and water, but is more labor intensive and more challenging to automate. We describe a scaled physical testbed (1.5m√ó3.0m) that uses a high resolution camera and soil sensors to monitor polyculture plants to facilitate tuning of plant growth, companion effects, and irrigation parameters for a first-order garden simulator. We use this simulator to develop a novel seed placement algorithm that increases coverage and diversity, and a learned pruning policy. In simulation experiments, the seed placement algorithm yields 60% more coverage and 10% more diversity than random seed placement and the learned pruning policy runs 1000X faster than a procedural lookahead policy to achieve high leaf coverage and plant diversity on adversarial gardens that include plant species with diverse growth rates. These models and policies provide the groundwork for a fully-automated system under development.
