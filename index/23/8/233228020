The advent of Wikidata represented a breakthrough as a collaborative and constantly advancing knowledgebase. As it was originally envisioned, it simplified the linkage and data reuse among different Wikimedia projects. Catalan Wikipedia is one example project where Wikidata has been heavily adopted by its community base: that is the case of integration with article infoboxes or in automatically generated lists. In the following article we highlight the possibilities of taking advantage of structured data from Wikidata for evaluating new biographical articles, so facilitating users to get engaged into diversity challenges or track potential vandalism and errors.
