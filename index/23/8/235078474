In Goal Recognition Design (GRD), the objective is to modify a domain to facilitate early detection of the goal of a subject agent. Most previous work studies this problem in the offline setting, in which the observing agent performs its interventions before the subject begins acting. In this paper, we generalize GRD to the online setting in which time passes and the observerâ€™s actions are interleaved with those of the subject. We illustrate weaknesses of existing metrics for GRD and propose an alternative better suited to online settings. We provide a formal definition of this Active GRD (AGRD) problem and study an algorithm for solving it. AGRD occupies an interesting middle ground between passive goal recognition and strategic two-player game settings.
