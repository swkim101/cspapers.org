Representation learning algorithms automatically learn the features of data. Several representation learning algorithms for graph data, such as DeepWalk, node2vec, and Graph-SAGE, sample the graph to produce mini-batches that are suitable for training a DNN. However, sampling time can be a significant fraction of training time, and existing systems do not efficiently parallelize sampling. Sampling is an "embarrassingly parallel" problem and may appear to lend itself to GPU acceleration, but the irregularity of graphs makes it hard to use GPU resources effectively. This paper presents NextDoor, a system designed to effectively perform graph sampling on GPUs. NextDoor employs a new approach to graph sampling that we call transit-parallelism, which allows load balancing and caching of edges. NextDoor provides end-users with a high-level abstraction for writing a variety of graph sampling algorithms. We implement several graph sampling applications, and show that NextDoor runs them orders of magnitude faster than existing systems.
