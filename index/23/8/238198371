Justice-centered approaches to equitable computer science (CS) education frame CS learning as a means for advancing peace, antiracism, and social justice rather than war, empire, and corporations. However, most research in justice-centered approaches in CS education focus on K-12 learning environments. In this position paper, we review justice-centered approaches to CS education, problematize the lack of justice-centered approaches to CS in higher education in particular, and describe a justice-centered approach for undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms. Our approach emphasizes three components: (1) ethics: critiques the sociopolitical values of data structure and algorithm design as well as the underlying logics of dominant computing culture; (2) identity: draws on culturally responsive-sustaining pedagogies to emphasize student identity as rooted in resistance to the dominant computing culture; and (3) political vision: ensures the rightful presence of political struggles by reauthoring rights to frame CS learning as a force for social justice. Through a case study of this Critical Comparative Data Structures and Algorithms pedagogy, we argue that justice-centered approaches to higher CS education can help all computing students not only learn about the ethical implications of nominally technical concepts, but also develop greater respect for diverse epistemologies, cultures, and experiences surrounding computing that are essential to creating the socially-just worlds we need.
