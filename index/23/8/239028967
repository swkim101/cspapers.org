MU-MIMO is a high-speed technique in IEEE 802.11ac and upcoming 802.11ax technologies that improves spectral efficiency by allowing concurrent communication between one Access Point and multiple users. In this paper, we present MuVIS, a novel framework that proposes MU-MIMO-aware optimization for multi-user multimedia applications over IEEE 802.11ac/ax. Taking a cross-layer approach, MuVIS first optimizes the MU-MIMO user group selection for the users with the same characteristics in the PHY/MAC layer. It then optimizes the video bitrate for each group accordingly. We present our design and its evaluation on smartphones and laptops over 802.11ac WiFi.
