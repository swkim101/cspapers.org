—Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) has been widely adopted as the de facto standard for air-trafﬁc surveillance. Aviation regulations require all aircraft to actively broadcast status reports containing identity, position, and movement information. However, the lack of security measures exposes ADS-B to cyberattacks by technically capable adversaries with the purpose of interfering with air safety. In this paper, we develop a non-invasive trust evaluation system to detect attacks on ADS-B-based air-trafﬁc surveillance using real-world ﬂight data as collected by an infrastructure of ground-based sensors. Taking advantage of the redundancy of geographically distributed sensors in a crowdsourcing manner, we implement veriﬁcation tests to pursue security by wireless witnessing. At the core of our proposal is the combination of veriﬁcation checks and Machine Learning (ML)-aided classiﬁcation of reception patterns—such that user-collected data cross-validates the data provided by other users. Our system is non-invasive in the sense that it neither requires modiﬁcations on the deployed hardware nor the software protocols and only utilizes already available data. We demonstrate that our system can successfully detect GPS spooﬁng, ADS-B spooﬁng, and even Sybil attacks for airspaces observed by at least three benign sensors. We are further able to distinguish the type of attack, identify affected sensors, and tune our system to dynamically adapt to changing air-trafﬁc conditions.
