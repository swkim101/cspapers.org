In this paper, we present a spherical magnetic joint for the inverted locomotion of a multi-legged robot. The permanent magnet’s spherical shape allows the robot to attach its foot to a steel surface without energy consumption. However, the robot’s inverted locomotion requires foot flexibility for placement and gait construction of the robot. Therefore, the spherical magnetic joint mechanism was designed and implemented for the robot feet to deal with angular placement. For decoupling the foot from the steel surface, the attractive force is adjusted by tilting the adjustable sleeve mechanism at an adequate angle between the surface and foot tip. Experimental results show that the spherical magnetic joint can maintain the attractive force at any angle, and the sleeve mechanism can reduce 20% of the reaction force for pulling the legs from the steel surfaces. Furthermore, the designed gait for inverted locomotion with a spherical magnetic joint was tested and compared to prove the concept of the spherical magnetic joint and sleeve mechanism.
