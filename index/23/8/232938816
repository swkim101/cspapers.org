Empirical skills are playing an increasingly important role in the computing profession and our society. In addition to being problem-solvers and designers/engineers, computer scientists must also be capable experimenters in order to develop, test, and evaluate complex hardware and software systems. The widespread use of computers as tools for interdisciplinary research also demands a strong grounding in the scientific method.This panel is designed to promote discussion about innovative methods for integrating empirical skills within the traditional computer science curriculum. Each panelist will define a set of core empirical concepts and skills that they see as essential to computer scientists, with a brief rationale for each. In conjunction, they will describe classroom practices that serve to demonstrate the key concepts and/or develop skills they have identified. Sufficient time will be allocated for discussion and contributions from the audience.
