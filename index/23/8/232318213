Today's data centers face extreme challenges in providing low latency. However, fair sharing, a principle commonly adopted in current congestion control protocols, is far from optimal for satisfying latency requirements.
 We propose Preemptive Distributed Quick (PDQ) flow scheduling, a protocol designed to complete flows quickly and meet flow deadlines. PDQ enables flow preemption to approximate a range of scheduling disciplines. For example, PDQ can emulate a shortest job first algorithm to give priority to the short flows by pausing the contending flows. PDQ borrows ideas from centralized scheduling disciplines and implements them in a fully distributed manner, making it scalable to today's data centers. Further, we develop a multipath version of PDQ to exploit path diversity.
 Through extensive packet-level and flow-level simulation, we demonstrate that PDQ significantly outperforms TCP, RCP and D3 in data center environments. We further show that PDQ is stable, resilient to packet loss, and preserves nearly all its performance gains even given inaccurate flow information.
