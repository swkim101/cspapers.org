It is inevitable for human to bear the gravitational and inertial force when carrying loads. The impact force exerted on human body is originated from the inertial force which can increase the energy expenditure and cause injury to human body. This paper proposes a semi-active hover backpack with controllable air damper to minimize the inertial force. The skyhook damper model of hover backpack is established which is the dynamic target of the practical backpack. Sliding mode control is designed to eliminate the tracking error and the effectiveness of the control method is analyzed. Simulation and experiment are conducted and comparative results are stated. The results demonstrate that the semi-active hover backpack with sliding mode control can reduce the inertial force.
