In this paper, we propose an augmented Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) mechanism wherein additional information of local interaction patterns between a node with its neighbors (specifically, in the form of distribution of cosine similarity values of a pre-trained node vector with its neighbors) is used to enrich a node's representation prior to training a GCN. This provides additional information about the structural properties of a node, which the standard convolution operation in a GCN can then leverage for obtaining potentially improved effectiveness in a down-stream task. Our experiments demonstrate that adding these node interaction patterns (NIPs) along with an additional noise-contrastive pairwise document similarity objective within a GCN improves the linked document classification task.
