The storage structure on the data block of the current blockchain systems is still a linked list. This traditional structure is one-way and is not efficient for query operation. In view of this, we proposed a novel searching structure based on a height balanced Binary Search Tree (BST). The data structure we proposed not only retains the characteristics of the traditional ledgers but also adds the function of quick query. Through the new data structure, we can quickly find the starting position of the search and start searching for all transaction records within a specified range of time from this position. We also made an analysis and comparisons in the final.
