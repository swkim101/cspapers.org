Credit rating is the dominant criterion to determine whether a loan application will be approved. However, with the change of loan model and the rise of financial technology, existing approaches to credit rating are facing challenges. Therefore, how to improve existing approaches to credit rating has become an important research issue. In this paper, we study the issue of applying social analytics to credit rating. Using Facebook as the data source, we adopt the CART decision tree deduction to analyze social media data of tested users and compare our result of analysis with that of existing approaches.Our study shows that those who have better credit rating also possess certain common characteristics in their social media data. In addition, the application of social analytics can complement existing approaches to credit rating. Our research results can not only be used as an auxiliary to existing approaches, but also be used by the lender to strengthen the risk assessment of the borrower. The proposed approach can increase the flexibility on the amount and interest rate of loans, so as to improve the overall performance of loans.
