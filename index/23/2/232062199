A complete weighted graph G = (V, E, w) is called Δβ-metric, for some β ≥ 1/2, if G satisfies the β-triangle inequality, i.e., w(u, v) ≤ β • (w(u, x) + w(x, v)) for all vertices u, v, x ∈ V . Given a Δβ-metric graph G = (V, E, w), the Δβ-WEIGHTED DENSEST k-SUBGRAPH (Δβ-WDkS) problem is to find an induced subgraph G[C] with exactly k vertices such that the total edge weight of G[C] is maximized. For β = 1, this problem, Δ-WDkS, is known NP-hard and admits a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithms. In this paper, we show that for any β > 1/2, Δβ-WDkS is NP-hard. We also show how to modify any α-approximation algorithm for Δ-WDkS to obtain a δα,β-approximation algorithm for Δβ-WDkS with δα,β > α for every β < 1. Moreover, we prove that Δβ-WDkS can be approximated to within a factor $\frac{1}{{2\beta }}$ for any $\beta > \frac{1}{2}$.
