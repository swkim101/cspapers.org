A hypergolic system is a combination of organic fuel and oxidizer that ignites spontaneously upon contact without any external ignition source. Although their main usage pertains to rocket bipropellants, it is only recently that hypergolics have been established from our group as a revolutionary preparative method for the synthesis of different types of carbon nanostructures depending on the organic fuel-oxidizer pair. In an effort to further enrich this concept, the present work describes new hypergolic pairs based on 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,3-cyclooctadiene as the organic fuels and fuming nitric acid as the strong oxidizer. Both carbon-rich compounds (ca. 90% C) share a similar chemical structure with unsaturated cyclopentadiene that is also known to react hypergolically with fuming nitric acid. The particular pairs ignite spontaneously upon contact of the reagents at ambient conditions to produce carbon nanosheets in suitable yields and useful energy in the process. The nanosheets appear amorphous with an average thickness of ca. 2 nm and containing O and N heteroatoms in the carbon matrix. Worth noting, the carbon yield reaches the value of 25% for 1,3-cyclooctadiene, i.e., the highest reported so far from our group in this context. As far as the production of useful energy is concerned, the hot flame produced from ignition can be used for the direct thermal decomposition of ammonium dichromate into Cr2O3 (pigment and catalyst) or the expansion of expandable graphite into foam (absorbent and insulator), thus demonstrating a mini flame-pyrolysis burner at the spot.
