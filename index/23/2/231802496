The classic wisdom-of-the-crowd problem asks how a principal can "aggregate" information about an unknown state of the world from agents without understanding the information structure among them. Such aggregation obviously has large social and private value, especially when it concerns important social or economic events. Therefore, it is important to understand the limits of such an exercise: without specific assumptions on the information agents have, how can we aggregate it? Classic results by Prelec et al. [2017] (henceforth PSM) and Arieli et al. [2017] show that that even when agents' signals are i.i.d. conditional on the state, knowing the first-order beliefs of even an infinite set of agents is generally not sufficient to learn the state. In the terminology of econometrics, there is an "identification problem."
