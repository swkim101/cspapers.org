This paper proposes a system which can monitor the behavior and growth of pigs in a pig shed. This system adopts Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for image recognition on the head, tail, and whole body of pigs. It can track the position of each pig in the pig shed, and detect their feeding and drinking behaviors. When the feed intake or water intake of pig is abnormal, our system can detect it in time. Our system can also record the changes of pigâ€™s body area, which can be used to observe their growth. If any pig is sick or suffers from growth retardation, special care can be taken accordingly.
