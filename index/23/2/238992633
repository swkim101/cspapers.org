Molecular programming uses the computational power of DNA and other biomolecules to create nanoscale systems. Many of these will be safety-critical, such as bio-compatible diagnostic sensors and targeted drug-delivery devices. Design of these programmed molecular systems needs to assure safe outcomes from very many, very small, fault-prone components operating simultaneously in a dynamic environment. Some of this can be achieved by adapting existing software engineering methods, but molecular programming also presents new challenges that will require new methods. This talk discusses an example of such a challenge, describes how we design safety-critical building blocks, and presents work in progress to ascertain how robust a molecular program is. Similar approaches also will help design safe non-molecular systems with highly distributed, autonomous, fault-prone components operating in dynamic environments.
