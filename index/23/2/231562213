Scenario Planning is a commonly used Enterprise Risk Management
(ERM) technique to help decision makers with longterm
plans by considering multiple alternative futures. It is
typically a manual, highly labor intensive process involving
dozens of experts and hundreds to thousands of person-hours.
We previously introduced a Scenario Planning Advisor prototype
(Sohrabi et al. 2018a,b) that focuses on generating
scenarios quickly based on expert-developed models. We
present the evolution of that prototype into a full-scale, cloud deployed
ERM solution that: (i) can automatically (through
NLP) create models from authoritative documents such as
books, reports and articles, such that what typically took hundreds
to thousands of person-hours can now be achieved in
minutes to hours; (ii) can gather news and other feeds relevant
to forces in the risk models and group them into storylines
without any other user input; (iii) can generate scenarios
at scale, starting with dozens of forces of interest from models
with thousands of forces in seconds; (iv) provides interactive
visualizations of scenario and force model graphs, including
a full model editor in the browser.
The SPA solution is deployed under a non-commercial

and includes a user guide to help new users get
started. A video demonstration is available at
