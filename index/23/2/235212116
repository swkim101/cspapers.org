We present a novel approach for unsupervised activity segmentation which uses video frame clustering as a pretext task and simultaneously performs representation learning and online clustering. This is in contrast with prior works where representation learning and clustering are often performed sequentially. We leverage temporal information in videos by employing temporal optimal transport. In particular, we incorporate a temporal regularization term which preserves the temporal order of the activity into the standard optimal transport module for computing pseudo-label cluster assignments. The temporal optimal transport module enables our approach to learn effective representations for unsupervised activity segmentation. Furthermore, previous methods require storing learned features for the entire dataset before clustering them in an offline manner, whereas our approach processes one mini-batch at a time in an online manner. Extensive evaluations on three public datasets, i.e. 50-Salads, YouTube Instructions, and Breakfast, and our dataset, i.e., Desktop Assembly, show that our approach performs on par with or better than previous methods, despite having significantly less memory constraints.
