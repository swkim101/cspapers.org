The method of this study using model analysis of maximum spanning tree (MST) graph assisted by descriptive and inferential statistics technique. The data obtained are analysed using descriptive statistical analysis to find out the basic information of the data and inferential statistical analysis to get the value of coefficient correlation. Then, the MST graph is formed using Kruskalâ€™s algorithm by interpreting the vertices as a subject and the edges as the value of coefficient correlation. The subject that have the closest relationship to any subject is a graph vertex with the greatest degree. Based on the MST graph model, the result of this study shows that the subject which has closest relationship with another subject is Science in 2017, while in 2018 are English and Mathematics.
