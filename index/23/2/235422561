We present an efficient stochastic algorithm (RSG+) for canonical correlation analysis (CCA) using a reparametrization of the projection matrices. We show how this reparametrization (into structured matrices), simple in hindsight, directly presents an opportunity to repurpose/adjust mature techniques for numerical optimization on Riemannian manifolds. Our developments nicely complement existing methods for this problem which either require O(d 3) time complexity per iteration with O ( 1 t ) convergence rate (where d is the dimensionality) or only extract the top 1 component with O ( 1 t ) convergence rate. In contrast, our algorithm offers an improvement: it achieves O(d 2 k) runtime complexity per iteration for extracting the top k canonical components with O ( 1 t ) convergence rate. While our paper focuses more on the formulation and the algorithm, our experiments show that the empirical behavior on common datasets is quite promising. We also explore a potential application in training fair models with missing sensitive attributes.
