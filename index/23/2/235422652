We present Magic Layouts; a method for parsing screen-shots or hand-drawn sketches of user interface (UI) layouts. Our core contribution is to extend existing detectors to exploit a learned structural prior for UI designs, enabling robust detection of UI components; buttons, text boxes and similar. Specifically we learn a prior over mobile UI layouts, encoding common spatial co-occurrence relationships between different UI components. Conditioning region proposals using this prior leads to performance gains on UI layout parsing for both hand-drawn UIs and app screen-shots, which we demonstrate within the context an interactive application for rapidly acquiring digital prototypes of user experience (UX) designs.
