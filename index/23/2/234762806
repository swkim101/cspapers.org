The enhanced competition paradigm is an attempt at bridging the gap between simple and optimal auctions. In this line of work, given an auction setting with m items and n bidders, the goal is to find the smallest n' ≥ n such that selling the items to n' bidders through a simple auction generates (almost) the same revenue as the optimal auction. Recently, Feldman, Friedler, and Rubinstein [EC, 2018] showed that an arbitrarily large constant fraction of the optimal revenue from selling m items to single bidder can be obtained via simple auctions with a constant number of bidders. However, their techniques break down even for two bidders, and can only show a bound of n' = O(n · łog m/n). Our main result is that n' = O(n) bidders suffices for all values of m and n. That is, we show that, for all m and n, an arbitrarily large constant fraction of the optimal revenue from selling m items to n bidders can be obtained via simple auctions with O(n) bidders. Moreover, when the items are regular, we can achieve the same result through auctions that are prior-independent, i.e., they do not depend on the distribution from which the bidders' valuations are sampled.
