With the Web augmenting every day and computers increasingly getting more powerful, research in the field of computational argumentation becomes more and more important. One of its research branches is argument retrieval, which aims at finding and presenting users the best arguments for their queries. Several systems already exist for this purpose, all having the same goal but reaching it in different ways. In line with existing work, an argument consists of a claim supported or attacked by a premise. Now that argument retrieval has become a separate task in the CLEF lab Touché, displaying the ranking is becoming increasingly important. In this paper we present QuARk, a GUI that allows users to retrieve arguments from a focused debate collection for their queries. Since we strictly distinguished between frontend and backend and kept the communication between them simple, QuARk can be extended to integrate various argument retrieval systems, assuming some modifications are made. In order to demonstrate the GUI, we show the integration of a complex retrieval algorithm that we also presented in the CLEF lab Touché. Our retrieval process consists of two parts. In the first step, it finds the most similar claims to the query. Therefore, the user can select between different standard IR similarity methods. The second step ranks the premises directly related to the claims. Therefore, the user can choose to rank the arguments either by quantitative, qualitative, or a combined measure.
