Graph alignment aims to identify node correspondence across multiple graphs, with significant implications in various domains. As supervision information is often not available, unsupervised methods have attracted a surge of research interest recently. Most of existing unsupervised methods assume that corresponding nodes should have similar local structure, which, however, often does not hold. Meanwhile, rich node attributes are often available and have shown to be effective in alleviating the above local topology inconsistency issue. Motivated by the success of graph convolution networks (GCNs) in fusing network and node attributes for various learning tasks, we aim to tackle the graph alignment problem on the basis of GCNs. However, directly grafting GCNs to graph alignment is often infeasible due to multi-faceted challenges. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel unsupervised graph alignment framework WAlign. We first develop a lightweight GCN architecture to capture both local and global graph patterns and their inherent correlations with node attributes. Then we prove that in the embedding space, obtaining optimal alignment results is equivalent to minimizing the Wasserstein distance between embeddings of nodes from different graphs. Towards this, we propose a novel Wasserstein distance discriminator to identify candidate node correspondence pairs for updating node embeddings. The whole process acts like a two-player game, and in the end, we obtain discriminative embeddings that are suitable for the alignment task. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework WAlign.
