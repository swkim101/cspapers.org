In this paper we consider the relationship between monomial-size and bit-complexity in Sums-of-Squares (SOS) in Polynomial Calculus Resolution over rationals $({\text{PCR}}/\mathbb{Q})$. We show that there is a set of polynomial constraints Qn over Boolean variables that has both SOS and ${\text{PCR}}/\mathbb{Q}$ refutations of degree 2 and thus with only polynomially many monomials, but for which any SOS or ${\text{PCR}}/\mathbb{Q}$ refutation must have exponential bit-complexity, when the rational coefficients are represented with their reduced fractions written in binary.
