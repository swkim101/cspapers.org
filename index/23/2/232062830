Measurement-based Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) estimations require appropriate benchmarks that are composed both by programs and representative measurement protocols. The representativeness is defined with respect to both the programs and processors executing them. In this paper we consider the representativeness with respect to a multicore processor and we provide preliminary conclusions on how appropriate benchmarks could be proposed.
