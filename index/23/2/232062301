In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal multi-dimensional modeling framework of data warehouse for tracing events in various applications, like digital contact tracing for COVID19-related applications. Such framework provides a progressive evolution from traditional static data management to modern dynamic data analysis with spatiotemporal tracking capabilities for future IoT applications, such that entity-centered or user-centered resource integration and business intelligence applications can be rigorously developed, managed and properly tracked.
