This study analyzes the mistakes that students are prone to make in writing programs in programming courses. And use GDB and Valgrind tools to realize the dynamic analysis techniques applied to studentsâ€™ programs. In the analysis process, this study is combined with spectrum-base fault localization technology to enhance the accuracy of finding faults in dynamic analysis. In this study, the analyzed results are arranged and given to the students with corresponding feedback, so that the students can understand the content of the fault more clearly when modifying the program, and classify and statistics the types of faults. This study will sort out the faults that occur frequently for each student, and which topics are easy for students to make some mistakes, and will remind the students when they upload the program, so that the students will be vigilant every time they write the program.
