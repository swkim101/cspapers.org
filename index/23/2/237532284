To bridge the ever-increasing gap between deep neural networks' complexity and hardware capability, network quantization has attracted more and more research attention. The latest trend of mixed precision quantization takes advantage of hardware's multiple bit-width arithmetic operations to unleash the full potential of network quantization. However, existing approaches rely heavily on an extremely time-consuming search process and various relaxations when seeking the optimal bit configuration. To address this issue, we propose to optimize a proxy metric of network orthogonality that can be efficiently solved with linear programming, which proves to be highly correlated with quantized model accuracy and bit-width. Our approach significantly reduces the search time and the required data amount by orders of magnitude, but without a compromise on quantization accuracy. Specifically, we achieve 72.08% Top-1 accuracy on ResNet-18 with 6.7Mb parameters, which does not require any searching iterations. Given the high efficiency and low data dependency of our algorithm, we use it for the post-training quantization, which achieves 71.27% Top-1 accuracy on MobileNetV2 with only 1.5Mb parameters.
