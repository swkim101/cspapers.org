Energy-aware app adaptation enables mobile apps to dynamically adjust data delity such as streaming video quality to meet a user-speci ed goal for battery duration. Traditional energy-aware app adaptation is reactive in nature where the operating system monitors the app energy drain and signals the app to adapt upon detecting energy drain deviation from the pre-speci ed energy budget which can cause high oscillation and poor quality-of-experience (QoE). In this paper, we observe that modern power-hungry apps such as video streaming and o oading-based apps already come with sophisticated app adaptation to deal with resource changes such as network dynamics and propose proactive energy-aware adaptation where the user-speci ed energy budget is integrated with the app adaptation logic. The potential bene t of such an approach is that app energy drain adaptation is no longer an “after-e ect”, and hence the approach is likely to reduce the oscillation in app adaptation and improve the app QoE. In this paper, we study the design, implementation and performance tradeo s of reactive and proactive energy-aware app adaptation in the context of one of the most powerhungry classes of mobile apps, ABR-based video streaming. Our study shows that proactive energy-aware ABR video streaming is easy to implement by leveraging the built-in adaptation of modern apps and can improve the QoE of reactive approach by 44.8% and 19.2% in streaming 360o videos to Pixel 2 and Moto Z3 phones under low power budget.
