We present the IR Anthology, a corpus of information retrieval publications accessible via a metadata browser and a full-text search engine. Following the example of the well-known ACL Anthology, the IR Anthology serves as a hub for researchers interested in information retrieval. Our search engine ChatNoir indexes the publications' full texts, enabling a focused search and linking users to the respective publisher's site for personal access. Listing more than 40,000 publications at the time of writing, the IR Anthology can be freely accessed at https://IR.webis.de.
