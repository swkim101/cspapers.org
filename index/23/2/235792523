Personalized news recommendation is a critical technology to help users find interested news, and how to precisely match users' interests and candidate news lies in the core of news recommendation. Existing studies generally learn user's interest vector by aggregating his/her browsed news and then match it with the candidate news vector, which may lose the textual semantic matching signals for recommendation. In this paper, we propose an Attentive Multi-field Matching (AMM) framework for news recommendation which captures the semantic matching representations between each browsed news and candidate news, and then aggregates them as final user-news matching signal. In addition, our method incorporates multi-field information and designs a within-field and cross-field matching mechanism, which leverages complementary information from different fields (e.g., titles, abstracts and bodies) and obtain the multi-field matching representations. To achieve a comprehensive semantic understanding, we employ the most popular language model BERT to learn the matching representation of each browsed-candidate news pair, and incorporate the attention mechanism in aggregating procedure to characterize the importance of each matching representation for the final user-news matching signal. Experiments on the real world datasets validate the effectiveness of AMM.
