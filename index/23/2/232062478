In recent years, the popularity of Wi-Fi networks and 5G technology has enabled many Internet of Vehicles (IoV) related application technologies to be gradually realized. However, due to the excessive delay of peer to peer control and handoff, and the insufficient transmission range, it is difficult to achieve practical applications. In addition, the stability of the connection is also an important consideration that needs to be solved urgently. The paper proposes "A robust wireless transmission network based on the TCP protocol". Through the architecture design of Redundant Wi-Fi Device, it can achieve: (1) Eliminate handoff delay, increase the speed of network construction. (2) Achieve smoother handoff connection with dual Wi-Fi architecture design, and then realize the high-speed vehicle-mounted network construction architecture. (3) Support task connection mode, provide special connection network construction services for park applications, and use ordinary connection mode on general roads without special connection requirements. (4) Realize a strong network architecture with detectable, recoverable, and rapid error feedback, and improve the stability and reliability of the network.
