SDN/NFV (Software Defined Network/Network Function Virtualization) are key technology enablers for 5G Core Networks. They will introduce new actors into the telecom ecosystem including Virtual Network Function (VNF) vendor, VNF market place, VNF as a Service (VNFaaS) provider and Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure as a Service (NFVIaaS) provider. These new actors will promote competition hence demand for more flexible pricing with new charging models. This research explores these charging models according to the new charging factors identified in SDN/NFV based on the MANO (MANagement and Orchestration) architecture defined by ETSI NFV Industry Specification Group. The results of our research provide a methodology for service providers and telecom operators to price their SDN/NFV products and services.
