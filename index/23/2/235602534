Green security concerns the protection of the world's wildlife, forests, and fisheries from poaching, illegal logging, and illegal fishing. Unfortunately, conservation efforts in green security domains are constrained by the limited availability of defenders, who must patrol vast areas to protect from attackers. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been developed for green security and other security settings, such as US Coast Guard patrols and airport screenings, but effective deployment of AI in these settings requires learning adversarial behavior and planning in complex environments where the true dynamics may be unknown. My research develops novel techniques in machine learning and game theory to enable the effective development and deployment of AI in these resource-constrained settings. Notably, my work has spanned the pipeline from learning in a supervised setting, planning in stochastic environments, sequential planning in uncertain environments, and deployment in the real world. The overarching goal is to optimally allocate scarce resources under uncertainty for environmental conservation.
