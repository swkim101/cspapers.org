Building connections between mathematical expressions and their visual representations increases conceptual understanding and flexibility. However, students rarely practice visualizing abstract mathematical relationships because developing diagrammatic problems is challenging, especially at scale. To address this issue, we introduce Edgeworth, a system that automatically generates correct and incorrect diagrams for a given question prompt. It does so by mutating declarative mathematical statements with visual semantics. We evaluated the system by recreating diagrammatic problems in a widely used geometry textbook.
