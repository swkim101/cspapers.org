We present a search engine aimed to help clinicians find targeted treatments for children with cancer. Childhood cancer is a leading cause of death and clinicians increasingly seek treatments that are tailored to an individual patient, particularly their tumour genetics. Finding treatments that are specific to paediatrics and match individual genetics is a real challenge amongst the vast and growing body of medical literature and clinical trials. We aim to help clinicians through a search system tailored to this problem. The system retrieves PubMed articles and clinical trials. Entity extraction is done to highlight genes, drugs and cancers --- three key information types clinicians care about. Query suggestion helps clinicians formulate otherwise difficult queries and results are presented as a knowledge graph to help result interpretability. The proposed system aims to both significantly reduce the effort of searching for targeted treatments and potentially find life saving treatments that may have otherwise been missed.
