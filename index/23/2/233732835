Data center network faults are hard to debug due to their scale and complexity. With the prevalence of hard-to-reproduce transient faults, root-cause analysis of network faults is extremely difﬁcult due to unavailability of historical data, and inability to correlate the distributed data across the network. Often, it is not possible to ﬁnd the root cause using only switch-local information. To ﬁnd the root cause of such transient faults, we need: 1) Visibility : ﬁne-grained, packet-level and network-wide observability, 2) Retrospection : ability to get historical information before the fault occurs, and 3) Correlation : ability to correlate the information across the network. In this work, we present the design and implementation of S yNDB, a tool with the aforementioned capabilities to enable root cause analysis of network faults. We implement and evaluate S yNDB with realistic topologies using large scale simulation and programmable switches. Our evaluations show that S yNDB can capture and correlate packet records over sufﬁciently large time windows ( ∼ 4 ms), thus facilitating the root cause analysis of various network faults.
