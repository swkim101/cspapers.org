Strided memory accesses are an important type of operations for In-Memory Databases (IMDB) applications. Strided memory accesses often demand data at word granularity with fixed strides. Hence, they tend to produce sub-optimal performance on DRAM memory (the de facto standard memory in modern computer systems) that accesses data at cacheline granularity. Recently proposed optimizations either introduce significant reliability degradation or are limited to non-volatile crossbar memory structures. In this paper, we propose a low-cost DRAM-based optimization scheme SAM for accelerating strided memory accesses. SAM consists of several designs. The primary design, termed SAM-IO, is to exploit under-utilized I/O resources in commodity DRAM chips to support high-performance strided memory accesses with near-zero hardware overhead. Based on SAM-IO, an enhanced design, termed SAM-en, is further proposed by combining several innovations to achieve overall efficiency on energy and area. Our evaluation of the proposed designs shows that SAM not only achieves high performance improvement (up to ∼ 4.2 ×) but also maintains high-level reliability protection for server systems.
