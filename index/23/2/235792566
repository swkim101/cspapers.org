Social influence is essential to social recommendation. Current influence-based social recommendation focuses on the explicit influence on observed social links. However, in real cases, implicit social influence can also impact users' preference in an unobserved way. In this work, we concern two kinds of implicit influence: Local Implicit Influence of persons on unobserved interpersonal relations, and Global Implicit Influence of items broadcasted to users. We improve the state-of-the-art GNN-based social recommendation methods by modeling two kinds of implicit influences separately. Local implicit influence is involved by predicting unobserved social relationships. Global implicit influence is involved by defining global popularity of each item and personalize the impact of the popularity on each user. In a GCN network, explicit and implicit influence are integrated to learn the social embedding of users and items in social recommendation. Experimental results on Yelp initially demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed model.
