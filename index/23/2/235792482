In information retrieval (IR), documents that match the query are retrieved. Search engines usually conflate word variants into a common stem when indexing documents because queries and documents do not need to use exactly the same word variant for the documents to be relevant. Stemmers are known to be effective in many languages for IR. However, there are still languages where stemmers or morphological analyzers are missing; this is the case for Amharic which is the working language of Ethiopia. Morphological analysis is the key to derive stems, roots (primary lexical units) and grammatical markers of words such as person, tense and negation markers. This paper presents morphologically annotated Amharic lexicons as well as stem-based and root-based morphologically annotated corpora which could be used by the research community as benchmark collections either to evaluate morphological analyzers or information retrieval for Amharic. Such resources are believed to foster research in Amharic IR.
