Memory leaks in operating system (OS) kernels can cause critical performance and security issues. However, it is quite challenging to detect memory leaks due to the inherent complexity and large-scale code base of real-world OS kernels. In this work, inspired by the observation that software bugs are often hidden in rarely-tested program paths, we focus on detecting memory leaks on early-exit (E-E) paths in OS kernels. To this end, we conduct a systematic study of memory management operations involved on E-E paths in OS kernels. Based on the ﬁndings, we design a novel leak detector for OS kernels: MLEE, which intelligently discovers memory leaks on E-E paths by cross-checking the presence of memory deallocations on different E-E paths and normal paths. MLEE successfully reports 120 new memory leak bugs in the Linux kernel. It is the ﬁrst time these memory leaks are uncovered by a leak detector for OS kernels.
