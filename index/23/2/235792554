Unbiased recommender learning has been actively studied to alleviate the inherent bias of implicit datasets under the missing-not-at-random assumption. Existing studies solely address the bias of positive feedback but do not account for the bias of missing feedback, which heavily affects their sub-optimal performance gains. This paper proposes a dual recommender learning framework that simultaneously eliminates the bias of clicked and unclicked data. Specifically, the proposed loss function adopts two propensity weighting to effectively estimate the true positive and negative preferences from clicked and unclicked data. We also prove that the proposed loss function converges to the ideal loss function for both clicked and unclicked data. Because of the model-agnostic property, it can be applied to any existing unbiased learning models. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unbiased models up to 5.54-24.56% for MAP@1 on three datasets.
