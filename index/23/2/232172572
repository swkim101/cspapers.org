In this paper we prove an analogue of the classic Bollobás lemma for approximate counting. In fact, we match an analogous result of Fomin et al. [JACM 2016] for decision. This immediately yields, for a number of fundamental problems, parameterized approximate counting algorithms with the same running times as what is obtained for the decision variant using the representative family technique of Fomin et al. [JACM 2016]. For example, we devise an algorithm for approximately counting (a factor (1± ) approximation algorithm) k-paths in an n-vertex directed graph (#k-Path) running in time O((2.619 + n) · 1 2 · (n+m)). This improves over an earlier algorithm of Brand et al. [STOC 2018] that runs in time O(4 · kO(1) · 1 2 · (n+m)). Additionally, we obtain an approximate counting analogue of the efficient computation of representative families for product families of Fomin et al. [TALG 2017], again essentially matching the running time for decision. This results in an algorithm with running time O((3.841 + |I|) · 1 6 · |I|) for computing a (1 + ) approximation of the sum of the coefficients of the multilinear monomials in a degree-k homogeneous n-variate polynomial encoded by a monotone circuit (#Multilinear Monomial Detection). When restricted to monotone circuits (rather than polynomials of non-negative coefficients), this improves upon an earlier algorithm of Pratt [FOCS 2019] that runs in time 4.075 · 1 2 log 1 · n O(1). ∗University of California, Santa Barbara, USA. daniello@ucsb.edu †The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, HBNI, Chennai, India, and University of Bergen, Norway. saket@imsc.res.in ‡Ben-Gurion University, Beersheba, Israel. meiravze@bgu.ac.il
