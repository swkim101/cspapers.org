Recently, BERT has shown overwhelming performance in sequential recommendation by using a bidirectional attention mechanism. Although the bidirectional model effectively captures dynamics from user interaction, its training strategy does not fit well to the inference stage in sequential recommendation which generally proceeds in a left-to-right way. To address this problem, we introduce a new recommendation system built upon BART, which is widely used in NLP tasks. BART uses a left-to-right decoder and injects noise into its bidirectional encoder, which can reduce the gap between training and inference. However, direct usage of BART for recommendation system is challenging due to its model property and domain difference. BART is an auto-regressive generative model, and its noising transformation techniques are originally developed for text sequence. In this paper, we present a novel sequential recommendation model, Entangled BART for Recommendation (E-BART4Rec) that entangles bidirectional encoder and auto-regressive decoder with noisy transformations for user interaction. Unlike BART, where the final output only depends on its output of the decoder, E-BART4Rec dynamically integrates the output of the bidirectional encoder and auto-regressive decoder based on a gating mechanism that calculates the importance of each output. We also employ noisy transformation that imitates the real users' behaviors, such as item deletion, item cropping, item reverse, and item infilling, to the input of the encoder. Extensive experiments on widely used real-world datasets demonstrate that our models significantly outperform the baselines.
