There is increasing recognition of the need for human-centered AI that learns from human feedback. However, most current AI systems focus more on the model design, but less on human participation as part of the pipeline. In this work, we propose a Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) graph reasoning paradigm and develop a corresponding dataset named HOOPS for the task of KG-driven conversational recommendation. Specifically, we first construct a KG interpreting diverse user behaviors and identify pertinent attribute entities for each user--item pair. Then we simulate the conversational turns reflecting the human decision making process of choosing suitable items tracing the KG structures transparently. We also provide a benchmark method with reported performance on the dataset to ascertain the feasibility of HitL graph reasoning for recommendation using our developed dataset, and show that it provides novel opportunities for the research community.
