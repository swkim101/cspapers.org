A large gap exists between fully-supervised object detection and weakly-supervised object detection. To narrow this gap, some methods consider knowledge transfer from additional fully-supervised dataset. But these methods do not fully exploit discriminative category information in the fully-supervised dataset, thus causing low mAP. To solve this issue, we propose a novel category transfer framework for weakly supervised object detection. The intuition is to fully leverage both visually-discriminative and semantically-correlated category information in the fully-supervised dataset to enhance the object-classification ability of a weakly-supervised detector. To handle overlapping category transfer, we propose a double-supervision mean teacher to gather common category information and bridge the domain gap between two datasets. To handle non-overlapping category transfer, we propose a semantic graph convolutional network to promote the aggregation of semantic features between correlated categories. Experiments are conducted with Pascal VOC 2007 as the target weakly-supervised dataset and COCO as the source fully-supervised dataset. Our category transfer framework achieves 63.5% mAP and 80.3% CorLoc with 5 overlapping categories between two datasets, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
