Soft robotic manipulators have been created and investigated for a number of applications due to their advantages over rigid robots. In minimally invasive surgery, for instance, soft robots have successfully demonstrated a number of benefits due to the compliant and flexible nature of the material they are made of. However, these type of robots struggle with performing tasks that require on-demand stiffness i.e. exerting higher forces to the surrounding environment. A number of semi-active and active mechanisms have been investigated to change and control the stiffness of soft robotic manipulators. Embedding these mechanisms in soft manipulators for spacerestricted applications can be challenging though.To better understand the inherent passive stiffness properties of soft manipulators, we propose a screw theory-based stiffness analysis for fluidic-driven continuum soft robotic manipulators. First, we derive the forward kinematics based on a parameter-based piece-wise constant curvature model. It is worth noting, our stiffness analysis can be conducted based on any freespace forward kinematic model. Then our stiffness analysis and mapping methodology is conducted based on screw theory. Initial results of our approach demonstrate the feasibility comparing computational and experimental data.
