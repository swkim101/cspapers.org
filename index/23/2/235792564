Games of skill are an excellent source of recreation and relaxation. Games are also the safest and readily accessible constructs for social interaction and community affairs which potentially opens up new avenues for realising personal worth, social acceptance, respect & recognition. However, when these games are played with real money, ensuring game prudence, whereby users play real-money skill games only for entertainment purposes, and do so well within their resourceful means, becomes necessary. It becomes paramount for the wellness of players and also to ensure online gaming is only available for sheer entertainment. In this proposal, we present an automated, data driven, AI powered, Responsible Game Play (RGP) framework cum tool which has been integrated in our online skill gaming platform. RGP pipeline is a combination of: a) a couple of anomaly detection Rule Based Engines; b) a Deep Learning Pipeline which models the game play characteristics of healthy and engaged players to identify potentially risky players, and c) a ML based Local Expert which leverages users' longitudinal behavioral patterns and constructs new features using the adjacent AI OPS and Signal Processing Domains. We integrate the psychometric assessment to nudge and coarse correct at-risk players proactively, ahead of time
