This paper will discuss the development of an automated testing and quality analysis environment based on the DevOps development process, and the advanced development of an automated debugging system. It can automatically correct the problems from reports of program quality analysis and pass rules to achieve the purpose of reducing testing, developer burdens and funding costs. In addition, it can also prevent the problem of program vulnerability which exploited by hackers to attack system. The main tasks are as follows: 1) Integrate the current new-style software testing tools, continuous integration tools, version control tools, and code quality analysis tools to build an automated analysis and testing platform, enhance the effectiveness of software automated testing, accelerate software development, testing, and deployment time, and Improve system reliability and quality. 2) With the Spoon code conversion tool, an automated debugging system is developed to automatically correct the code errors that developers often make, such as memory leaks, security threats, etc. Correct errors in real time to meet the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the software, so as to avoid future attacks due to vulnerabilities, leading to problems that require refactoring of the system.
