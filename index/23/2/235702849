Human multimodal emotion recognition involves time-series data of different modalities, such as natural language, visual motions, and acoustic behaviors. Due to the variable sampling rates for sequences from different modalities, the collected multimodal streams are usually unaligned. The asynchrony across modalities increases the difficulty on conducting efficient multimodal fusion. Hence, this work mainly focuses on multimodal fusion from unaligned multimodal sequences. To this end, we propose the Progressive Modality Reinforcement (PMR) approach based on the recent advances of crossmodal transformer. Our approach introduces a message hub to exchange information with each modality. The message hub sends common messages to each modality and reinforces their features via crossmodal attention. In turn, it also collects the reinforced features from each modality and uses them to generate a reinforced common message. By repeating the cycle process, the common message and the modalities’ features can progressively complement each other. Finally, the reinforced features are used to make predictions for human emotion. Comprehensive experiments on different human multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks clearly demonstrate the superiority of our approach.
