By reading reviews and product attributes, e-commerce question-answering task aims to automatically generate natural-sounding answers for product-related questions. Existing methods, however, typically assume that each review and each product attribute are semantically independent, ignoring the relation among all these multi-type texts. In this paper, we propose a review-attribute heterogeneous graph neural network (abbreviated as RAHGNN) to model the logical relation of all multi-type text. RAHGNN consists of four components: a review-attribute heterogeneous graph constructor, a question-aware input encoder, a heterogeneous graph relation analyzer, and a context-based answer decoder. Specifically, after constructing the heterogeneous graph with reviews and product attributes, we derive the initial representation of each review node and attribute node based on question attention network and key-value memory network respectively. RAHGNN analyzes the relation according to the subgraph structure and subgraph semantic meaning using node-level attention and semantic-level attention. Finally, the answer is generated by the recurrent neural network with the relation representation as context input. Extensive experimental results on a large-scale real-world e-commerce dataset not only show the superior performance of RAHGNN over state-of-the-art baselines, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for multi-type text relation in product-aware answer generation.
