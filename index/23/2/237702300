The paper investigates the mechanisms of microwave absorption in microcellular foamed conductive composites dedicated to protection against electromagnetic interferences (EMI). A multi-layered electromagnetic one-dimensional (1D) model mimicking the microcellular foam structure is built and validated using previous measurements carried out on various fabricated composite foams. Our model enables us to perform a parametric analysis of the absorption behaviour in a foamed composite, using as parameters the size of the hollow cell, the thickness of the cellâ€™s walls and its conductivity, as well as the overall thickness of the composite and the frequency. Our investigations demonstrate that multiple reflections of the microwave signal between the cellular walls are not the main mechanism responsible for absorption, although they are often reported as a cause of enhanced absorption in the literature. On the contrary, our work demonstrates that the enhancement of the absorption observed in foamed conductive composite compared to unfoamed composite is mainly due to the presence of air in the microcells of the composite.
