In-flight objects capture is extremely challenging. The robot is required to complete trajectory prediction, interception position calculation and motion planning within tens of milliseconds. As in-flight uneven objects are affected by various kinds of forces, which leads to the time-varying acceleration, motion prediction for them is difficult. In order to compensate the systemâ€™s non-linearity, we propose using a recurrent neural network model, which we call the Neural Acceleration Estimator (NAE), to estimate the varying acceleration by observing a small fragment of previous deflected trajectory without any prior information. Moreover, end-to-end training with Differantiable Filter (NAE-DF) gives a supervision for measurement uncertainty and further improves the prediction accuracy. Experimental results show that motion prediction with NAE and NAE-DF is superior to other methods and has a good generalization performance on unseen objects. We test our methods on a robot, performing velocity control in real world and respectively achieve 83.3% and 86.7% success rate on a ploy urethane banana and a gourd. We also release an object in-flight dataset containing 1,500 trajectorys for uneven objects, which can be found on the project website:https://sites.google.com/view/neural-motion-prediction.
