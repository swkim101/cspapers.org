While decidability of type systems may be a reasonable sacrifice to make in exchange for greatly increased expressivity in some cases, having a type checker that is guaranteed to terminate while maintaining a high degree of expressivity can be beneficial. Over the last few years there have been several papers and theses written describing decidable variants of DOT, however, these variants all present similar challenges in limitations on expressivity. We aim to increase the expressivity of these variants without sacrificing decidability.
