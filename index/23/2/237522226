Dynamic information ﬂow analysis (DIFA) supports various security applications such as malware analysis and vulnerability discovery. Yet traditional DIFA approaches have limited utility for distributed software due to applicability , portability , and scalability barriers. We present F LOW D IST , a DIFA for common distributed software that overcomes these challenges. F LOW D IST works at purely application level to avoid platform customizations hence achieve high portability . It infers implicit, interprocess dependencies from global partially ordered execution events to address applicability to distributed software. Most of all, it introduces a multi-staged reﬁnement-based scheme for application-level DIFA, where an otherwise expensive data ﬂow analysis is reduced by method-level results from a cheap pre-analysis, to achieve high scalability while remaining effective. Our evaluation of F LOW D IST on 12 real-world distributed systems against two peer tools revealed its superior effectiveness with practical efﬁciency and scalability. It has found 18 known and 24 new vulnerabilities, with 17 conﬁrmed and 2 ﬁxed. We also present and evaluate two alternative designs of F LOW D IST for both design justiﬁcation and diverse subject accommodations.
