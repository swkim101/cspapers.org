The expense of telecommunications infrastructure has always been a heavy burden for telecom operators. With the network function virtualization, network functions on the dedicated network equipment can be virtualized and deployed on virtual machines. These virtual machines are usually hosted by the x86 computer so that the capital expenditures can be reduced. However, the penalty of virtualization is the performance degradation which is unacceptable to telecom operators who require a high quality of service. This paper attempts to address this problem and examine the enhanced techniques on OpenStack such as the impact of CPU Pinning and Hugepage on a virtual machine which is launched on the OpenStack. Experimental results show that the enhanced techniques can effectively improve the computing performance of the virtual machine with low overhead.
