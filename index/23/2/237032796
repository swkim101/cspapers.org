Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have introduced benefits in many areas of the energy sector. Today, power line sensor deployment is manually executed on passive power lines using helicopters, introducing great risks, costs and difficulties for the power distribution companies and the human operators.In this paper, we present a novel modular mechanical system utilizing pneumatic as the actuation source to deploy a sensor unit to a power line using a UAV, with aid of an autonomous alignment algorithm. The results show that the UAV can facilitate the sensor unit, and is capable of deploying it to the power line in an autonomous manner. The works leave opportunity for expanding to further applications in the future.
