Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is designated as a global pandemic. Elderly men with underlying
medical conditions are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and usually develop severe/
critical illness, therefore more attention we should be paid to them.



Describe methods that may help old patients with COVID-19 recover.



A case of a 91-year-old male COVID-19 patient in Haihe Hospital, Tianjin, China, has
been reported here who survived after receiving supportive medical treatment and psychological
assistance.



In addition to medical interventions, psychological support may be needed to better treat
COVID-19 patients, including the elderly.



Special care should be provided for elderly COVID-19 patients. Mutual understanding
and support between patients and health-care workers are essential during this pandemic.
