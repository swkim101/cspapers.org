When dealing with the haptic teleoperation of multi-limbed mobile manipulators, the problem of mitigating the destabilizing effects arising from the communication link between the haptic device and the remote robot has not been properly addressed. In this work, we propose a passive control architecture to haptically teleoperate a legged mobile manipulator, while remaining stable in the presence of time delays and frequency mismatches in the master and slave controllers. At the master side, a discrete-time energy modulation of the control input is proposed. At the slave side, passivity constraints are included in an optimization-based whole-body controller to satisfy the energy limitations. A hybrid teleoperation scheme allows the human operator to remotely operate the robotâ€™s end- effector while in stance mode, and its base velocity in locomotion mode. The resulting control architecture is demonstrated on a quadrupedal robot with an artificial delay added to the network.
