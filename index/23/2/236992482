Implementing the ﬁlesystem in user space reduces development complexity [28, 30] and decreases dependency on the underlying OS platform. Implementing the ﬁlesystem at the user level as opposed to inside the OS kernel, however, has traditionally meant lower performance [11,17,22]. This performance overhead is increasingly limiting with high performance storage devices based on new persistent memory technology (e.g. 3D XPoint [13]) and advanced networking techniques (e.g. RDMA [14]). User space ﬁle systems have also been associated with poor reliability, availability and ser-viceability (RAS) characteristics [26]. As a result, there is a tendency to consider user space ﬁlesystems as prototypes and proof-of-concepts. In this paper, we systematically analyze the concerns with deploying user space ﬁlesystem to provide production ﬁle storage services. We present XFUSE, a ﬁlesys-tem in user space framework that addresses the performance and RAS concerns, and that enables ﬁle storage services to be effectively deployed at the user level. Our performance analysis indicates that XFUSE enables ﬁlesystem requests made through standard kernel interfaces to be processed at the user level with latency in the 4 microseconds range, and offers throughput exceeding 8 GB/s.
