In this paper, we investigate Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) problem, which aims to transfer the knowledge from source to target under unaligned label space. The main challenge of UniDA lies in how to separate common classes (i.e., classes shared across domains), from private classes (i.e., classes only exist in one domain). Previous works treat the private samples in the target as one generic class but ignore their intrinsic structure. Consequently, the resulting representations are not compact enough in the latent space and can be easily confused with common samples. To better exploit the intrinsic structure of the target domain, we propose Domain Consensus Clustering (DCC), which exploits the domain consensus knowledge to discover discriminative clusters on both common samples and private ones. Specifically, we draw the domain consensus knowledge from two aspects to facilitate the clustering and the private class discovery, i.e., the semantic-level consensus, which identifies the cycle-consistent clusters as the common classes, and the sample-level consensus, which utilizes the cross-domain classification agreement to determine the number of clusters and discover the private classes. Based on DCC, we are able to separate the private classes from the common ones, and differentiate the private classes themselves. Finally, we apply a class-aware alignment technique on identified common samples to minimize the distribution shift, and a prototypical regularizer to inspire discriminative target clusters. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DCC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-arts.
