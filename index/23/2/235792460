In this study we address the problem of identifying the purchase-state of users, based on product-related questions they ask on an eCommerce website. We differentiate between questions asked before buying a product (pre-purchase) and after (post-purchase). At first, we study the ambiguity that exists in purchase-states' definition, and then investigate the linguistic characteristics of the questions in each state. We analyze the discrepancy between the language models of pre- and post-purchase questions, and offer two classification schemes for this task, both outperform human judgments. We additionally show the effectiveness of our classification models in improving real world applications for both consumers and sellers.
