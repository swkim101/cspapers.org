Software system projects face challenges to rapidly meet user requirements while adding novel values to the application domain. Value appropriation focuses on exploiting existing knowledge to develop software that meets market requirements. Value creation focuses on exploring the solution space to innovate and attract new customers. In this pilot research, we study the tension between software project controls and the goal of novelty in the software product. Two case studies provide preliminary evidence that a well-balanced portfolio of controls can result in the design and implementation of novel product features. We position the case studies in the context of digital platforms to bound our definitions of control mechanisms and novelty. Based on analysis of data collected from two case studies, we find that formal and informal control modes can positively influence novelty in software applications on digital platforms. We conclude with a discussion on implications for software development and future research directions.
