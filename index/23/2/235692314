Precise estimation of optical flow, stereo depth and camera motion are important for the real-world 3D scene understanding and visual perception. Since the three tasks are tightly coupled with the inherent 3D geometric constraints, current studies have demonstrated that the three tasks can be improved through jointly optimizing geometric loss functions of several individual networks. In this paper, we show that effective feature-level collaboration of the networks for the three respective tasks could achieve much greater performance improvement for all three tasks than only loss-level joint optimization. Specifically, we propose a single network to combine and improve the three tasks. The network extracts the features of two consecutive stereo images, and simultaneously estimates optical flow, stereo depth and camera motion. The whole network mainly contains four parts: (I) a feature-sharing encoder to extract features of input images, which can enhance features’ representation ability; (II) a pooled decoder to estimate both optical flow and stereo depth; (III) a camera pose estimation module which fuses optical flow and stereo depth information; (IV) a cost volume complement module to improve the performance of optical flow in static and occluded regions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among the joint unsupervised methods, including optical flow and stereo depth estimation on KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks, and camera motion estimation on KITTI VO dataset.
