Social media plays an important role as a source of information during crisis events. It allows for more rapid dissemination of critical information than traditional news media, as its users can provide immediate information from the locations where events are unfolding. Several studies have addressed the automatic detection of crisis-related messages to contribute to disaster management and humanitarian assistance. However, most of them have focused on a particular language (usually English) or type of event, which limits their applicability to other contexts. The lack of labeled data in different languages and types of disasters poses a major obstacle to the application of supervised learning-based approaches to more diverse scenarios. To address this problem, this research aims to characterize messages related to diverse crisis domains in a language-agnostic manner in order to construct multilingual crisis detectors. To achieve this, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of transfer learning performance in terms of crisis domain and language, comparing different data representations and classification techniques.
