When optimizing software for the cloud, monolithic applications need to be partitioned into many smaller microservices. While many tools have been proposed for this task, we warn that the evaluation of those approaches has been incomplete; e.g. minimal prior exploration of hyperparameter optimization. Using a set of open source Java EE applications, we show here that (a) such optimization can significantly improve microservice partitioning; and that (b) an open issue for future work is how to find which optimizer works best for different problems. To facilitate that future work, see https://github.com/yrahul3910/ase-tuned-mono2micro for a reproduction package for this research.
