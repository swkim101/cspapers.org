Currently, the most popular method for open-domain Question Answering (QA) adopts "Retriever and Reader" pipeline, where the retriever extracts a list of candidate documents from a large set of documents followed by a ranker to rank the most relevant documents and the reader extracts answer from the candidates. Existing studies take the greedy strategy in the sense that they only use samples for ranking at the current hop, and ignore the global information across the whole documents. In this paper, we propose a purely rank-based framework Thinking Path Re-Ranker (TPRR), which is comprised of Thinking Path Ranker (TPR) for generating document sequences called "a path" and External Path Reranker (EPR) for selecting the best path from candidate paths generated by TPR. Specifically, TPR leverages the scores of a dense model and conditional probabilities to score the full paths. Moreover, to further enhance the performance of the dense ranker in the iterative training, we propose a "thinking" negatives selection method that the top-K candidates treated as negatives in the current hop are adjusted dynamically through supervised signals. After achieving multiple supporting paths through TPR, the EPR component which integrates several fine-grained training tasks for QA is used to select the best path for answer extraction. We have tested our proposed solution on the multi-hop dataset "HotpotQA" with a full wiki set ting, and the results show that TPRR significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our method has won the first place in the HotpotQA official leaderboard since Feb 1, 2021 under the Fullwiki setting.
