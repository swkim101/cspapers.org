Thin and imperceptible soft skins that can detect internal deformations as well as external forces, can go a long way to address perception and control challenges in soft robots. However, decoupling proprioceptive and exteroceptive stimuli is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a silicone-based, capacitive E-skin for exteroception and proprioception (SCEEP). This soft and stretchable sensor can perceive stretch as along with touch at 100 different points via its 100 tactels. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that decouples global strain from local indentations due to external forces. The soft skin is 10.1cm in length and 10cm in width and can be used to accurately measure the global strain of up to 25% with an error of under 3%; while at the same time, can determine the amplitude and position of local indentations. This is a step towards a fully soft electronic skin that can act as a proprioceptive sensor to measure internal states while measuring external forces.
