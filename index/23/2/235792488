Collecting participant search logs is an integral part of interactive IR research. Today's existing approaches are either piecemeal solutions, and/or require cumbersome setups. We present YASBIL, a two-component logging solution comprising a browser extension and a WordPress plugin. The browser extension logs the browsing activity in the participants' machines. The WordPress plugin collects the logged data into the researcher's data server. The logging works on any webpage, without the need to own or have knowledge about the HTML structure of the webpage. YASBIL also offers ethical data transparency and security towards participants, by enabling them to view and obtain copies of the logged data, as well as securely upload the data to the researcher's server over an HTTPS connection. We posit that ease of installation and use will make YASBIL especially suitable for remote user-studies, and longitudinal studies in IR.
