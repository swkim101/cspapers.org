There has been significant progress in the utilization of heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KG) as auxiliary information in recommendation systems. Reasoning over KG paths sheds light on the user's decision-making process. Previous methods focus on formulating this process as a multi-hop reasoning problem. However, without some form of guidance in the reasoning process, such a huge search space results in poor accuracy and little explanation diversity. In this paper, we propose UCPR, a user-centric path reasoning network that constantly guides the search from the aspect of user demand and enables explainable recommendations. In this network, a multi-view structure leverages not only local sequence reasoning information but also a panoramic view of the user's demand portfolio while inferring subsequent user decision-making steps. Experiments on five real-world benchmarks show UCPR is significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we show that the proposed model successfully identifies users' concerns and increases reason-ing diversity to enhance explainability
