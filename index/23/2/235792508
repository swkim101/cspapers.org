Since Information Retrieval (IR) is an interactive process in general, it is important to study Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR), where we would attempt to model and optimize an entire interactive retrieval process (rather than a single query) with consideration of many different ways a user can potentially interact with a search engine. This tutorial systematically reviews the progress of research in IIR with an emphasis on the most recent progress in the development of models, algorithms, and evaluation strategies for IIR, ending with a brief discussion of the major open challenges in IIR and some of the most promising future research directions.
