A study conducted by the International Data Corporation predicted that by the year 2021, the total amount of digital information resources would have reached the 40 zettabyte mark [2]. According to a rule formulated by Merrill Lynch, 80 to 90% of these resources are unstructured [7]. Despite this, users expect digital libraries to provide them with fast and interpretable access to digital information resources that will satisfy their information need. Math information retrieval emerged as a subfield of information retrieval in 2008 [8], when it became clear that standard information retrieval techniques used for text documents are inadequate to accurately retrieve documents in digital mathematical libraries.
