Information systems are an organized combination of people, software, hardware, communication networks and data sources in the collection, replacement, and collection of information in organizations. This configuration is required in a boarding school information system that uses SOA (Service Oriented Architecture). The configuration of the boarding school information system is based on a boarding school job description that is calculated in terms of the similarity of sentences with the business process model. Calculating the similarity of words is calculated using Word Similarity for Java (WS4J) using three semantic similarities namely wu palmer, lin, and path. From this calculation, the results of the business process model will emerge. In this study, the effect of similarity sentences in the job description of the cleanliness section is compared with the security section of the Islamic boarding school displaying that sentence similarities is almost similar, although in some job descriptions they still have a far different value for similarity.
