Most of the current machine learning approaches to IR---including search and recommendation tasks---are mostly designed based on the basic idea of matching, which work from the perceptual and similarity learning perspective. This include both the learning of features from data such as representation learning, and the learning of similarity matching functions from data such as neural function learning. Though many models have been widely used in practical ranking systems such as search and recommendation, their design philosophy limits the models to the correlative signals in data. However, advancing from correlative learning to causal learning in search and recommendation is an important problem, because causal modeling can help us to think outside of the observational data for representation learning and ranking. More specially, causal learning can bring benefits to the IR community on various dimensions, including but not limited to Explainable IR models, Unbiased IR models, Fairness-aware IR models, Robust IR models and Cognitive Reasoning IR models. This workshop focuses on the research and application of causal modeling in search, recommendation and a broader scope of IR tasks. The workshop will gather both researchers and practitioners in the field for discussions, idea communications, and research promotions. It will also generate insightful debates about the recent regulations on AI Ethics, to a broader community including but not limited to IR, machine learning, AI, Data Science, and beyond.
