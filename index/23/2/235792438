Self-attention networks (SANs) have been intensively applied for sequential recommenders, but they are limited due to: (1) the quadratic complexity and vulnerability to over-parameterization in self-attention; (2) inaccurate modeling of sequential relations between items due to the implicit position encoding. In this work, we propose the low-rank decomposed self-attention networks (LightSANs) to overcome these problems. Particularly, we introduce the low-rank decomposed self-attention, which projects user's historical items into a small constant number of latent interests and leverages item-to-interest interaction to generate the context-aware representation. It scales linearly w.r.t. the user's historical sequence length in terms of time and space, and is more resilient to over-parameterization. Besides, we design the decoupled position encoding, which models the sequential relations between items more precisely. Extensive experimental studies are carried out on three real-world datasets, where LightSANs outperform the existing SANs-based recommenders in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
