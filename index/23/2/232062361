This paper proposed the vehicle-to-vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2V2I), in which I denotes IEEE 802.11p Road Side Unit (RSU), VANET data offloading from the 4G/5G cellular network to the RSU through a n-hop V2V path between the source vehicle X, which is not in RSU’s signal coverage and is communicating with its peer Z that is in the Internet side, and Y, which is inside RSU’s signal coverage. The Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm is used to have the centralized mechanism for checking whether the aforementioned n-hop V2V2I path for helping vehicles' data offloading exists or not. A control scheme was proposed to have the MEC server to derive the potential V2V2I paths that may exist in the future, i.e., in a constrained time interval. In this way, it can find the better n-hop V2V2I VANET data offloading path. The performance analysis shown that the proposed method is better than the traditional method, in which the offloading is enabled when the source vehicle is inside RSU’s signal coverage, in different vehicle density’s situations.
