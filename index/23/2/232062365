Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a concept that decouples the control plane and the user plane. So the network administrator can easily control the network behavior through its own programs. However, the administrator may unconsciously apply some malicious programs on SDN controllers so that the whole network may be under the attackerâ€™s control. In this paper, we discuss the malicious software issue on SDN networks. We use the idea of sandbox to propose a sandbox network called SanboxNet. We emulate a virtual isolated network environment to verify the SDN application functions. With continuous monitoring, we can locate the suspicious SDN applications. We also consider the sandbox-evading issue in our framework. The emulated networks and the real world networks will be indistinguishable to the SDN controller.
