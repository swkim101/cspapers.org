We study keyphrase extraction (KPE) from Web documents. Our key contribution is encoding Web documents to leverage structure, such as title or anchors, by building a graph of words representing both (a) position-based proximity and (b) structural relations. We evaluate KPE performance on real-world search engine NAVER and human-annotated KPE benchmarks, and ours outperforms state-of-the-arts in both tasks.
