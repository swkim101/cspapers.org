Biases and de-biasing in recommender systems (RS) have become a research hotspot recently. This paper reveals an unexplored type of bias, i.e., sentiment bias. Through an empirical study, we find that many RS models provide more accurate recommendations on user/item groups having more positive feedback (i.e., positive users/items) than on user/item groups having more negative feedback (i.e., negative users/items). We show that sentiment bias is different from existing biases such as popularity bias: positive users/items do not have more user feedback (i.e., either more ratings or longer reviews). The existence of sentiment bias leads to low-quality recommendations to critical users and unfair recommendations for niche items. We discuss the factors that cause sentiment bias. Then, to fix the sources of sentiment bias, we propose a general de-biasing framework with three strategies manifesting in different regularizers that can be easily plugged into RS models without changing model architectures. Experiments on various RS models and benchmark datasets have verified the effectiveness of our de-biasing framework. To our best knowledge, sentiment bias and its de-biasing have not been studied before. We hope that this work can help strengthen the study of biases and de-biasing in RS.
