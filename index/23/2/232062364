This paper investigates the real-time capacities of Linux kernel and various enhancements that remove some of the fundamental barriers to eliminate potential latency. Both raw performance and schedulability are considered for hard real-time constraints, addressing the intersection of the two problem spaces: 1) align mainstream Linux kernel development and best-effort timing assurances; 2) multiprocessor-aware real-time scheduling. Our approach extends the PREEMPT_RT, which provides full kernel compatibility and preemptibility, and the obtained result validates the real-time performance improvements with reasonably small changes against the kernel.
