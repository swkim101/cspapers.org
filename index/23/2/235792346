Criminal Court View Generation is an essential task in legal intelligence, which aims to automatically generate sentences interpreting judgment results. The court view could be seen as the summary of crime circumstances in a case, including ADjudging Circumstance (ADC) and SEntencing Circumstance (SEC). However, different circumstances vary widely, and adopting them to generate court views directly may limit the generation performance. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the ADC and SEC related sentences in case facts and enhance them into the court view generation, respectively. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Circumstances enhanced Criminal Court View Generation (C3VG) method, consisting of the extraction and generation stage. Specifically, in the extraction stage, we design a Circumstances Selector to select ADC and SEC related sentences. After that, we apply them to two generators to generate the circumstances enhanced court views, respectively. After merging the two types of court views, we could obtain the final court views. We evaluate C3VG by conducting extensive experiments on a real-world dataset and experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed model.
