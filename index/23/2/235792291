Using entity aspect links, we improve upon the current state-of-the-art in entity retrieval. Entity retrieval is the task of retrieving relevant entities for search queries, such as "Antibiotic Use In Livestock". Entity aspect linking is a new technique to refine the semantic information of entity links. For example, while passages relevant to the query above may mention the entity "USA", there are many aspects of the USA of which only few, such as "USA/Agriculture", are relevant for this query. By using entity aspect links that indicate which aspect of an entity is being referred to in the context of the query, we obtain more specific relevance indicators for entities. We show that our approach improves upon all baseline methods, including the current state-of-the-art using a standard entity retrieval test collection. With this work, we release a large collection of entity-aspect-links for a large TREC corpus.
