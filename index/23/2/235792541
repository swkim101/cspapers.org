Healthy online discourse is becoming less and less accessible beneath the growing noise of controversy, mis- and dis-information, and toxic speech. While IR is crucial in detecting harmful speech, researchers must work across disciplines to develop interventions, and partner with industry to deploy them rapidly and effectively. In this position paper, we argue that both detecting online information disorders and deploying novel, real-world content moderation tools is crucial in promoting empathy in social networks, and maintaining free expression and discourse. We detail our insights in studying different social networks such as Parler and Reddit. Finally, we discuss the joys and challenges as a lab-grown startup working with both academia and other industrial partners in finding a path toward a better, more trustworthy online ecosystem.
