The advent of artificial intelligence has introduced new and innovative developments in the public transport that are progressing towards Autonomous Vehicles, or Robot Vehicles. Consequently, this highly sophisticated technology is projected to revolutionize the automotive field.The prototype EV autonomous vehicle presented in this paper is a jointly designed by the Taiwan-based Acer Company and STUST University. The main control system is realized with a CompactRIO controller for real-time IVN (In-Vehicle Networking) signal processing and communication. An NB-IOT function based hardware SIM7000_TE [1] is employed for vehicle-to-cloud communication. Based on this scheme, associated data, such as speed, location and time, can be obtained and stored in the cloud database.
