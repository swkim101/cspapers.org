Session-based recommendation aims to predict the next item that is most likely to be clicked by an anonymous user, based on his/her clicking sequence within one visit. It becomes an essential function of many recommender systems since it protects privacy. However, as the accumulated session records keep increasing, it becomes challenging to model the user interests since they would drift when the time span is large. Efforts have been devoted to handling dynamic user interests by modeling all historical sessions at one time or conducting offline retraining regularly. These solutions are far from practical requirements in terms of efficiency and capturing timely user interests. To this end, we propose a memory-efficient framework - TASRec. It constructs a graph for each day to model the relations among items. Thus, the same item on different days could have different neighbors, corresponding to the drifting user interests. We design a tailored graph neural network to embed this dynamic graph of items and learn temporal augmented item representations. Based on this, we leverage a sequential neural architecture to predict the next item of a given sequence. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TASRec outperforms state-of-the-art session-based recommendation methods.
