Understanding complex social interactions among agents is a key challenge for trajectory prediction. Most existing methods consider the interactions between pairwise traffic agents or in a local area, while the nature of interactions is unlimited, involving an uncertain number of agents and non-local areas simultaneously. Besides, they treat heterogeneous traffic agents the same, namely those among agents of different categories, while neglecting peopleâ€™s diverse reaction patterns toward traffic agents in different categories. To address these problems, we propose a simple yet effective Unlimited Neighborhood Interaction Network (UNIN), which predicts trajectories of heterogeneous agents in multiple categories. Specifically, the proposed unlimited neighborhood interaction module generates the fused-features of all agents involved in an interaction simultaneously, which is adaptive to any number of agents and any range of interaction area. Meanwhile, a hierarchical graph attention module is proposed to obtain category-to-category interaction and agent-to-agent interaction. Finally, parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model are estimated for generating the future trajectories. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement of our method over the state-of-the-art methods.
