Hypergraphs are used to model higher-order interactions amongst agents and there exist many practically relevant instances of hypergraph datasets. To enable efficient processing of hypergraph-structured data, several hypergraph neural network platforms have been proposed for learning hypergraph properties and structure, with a special focus on node classification. However, almost all existing methods use heuristic propagation rules and offer suboptimal performance on many datasets. We propose AllSet, a new hypergraph neural network paradigm that represents a highly general framework for (hyper)graph neural networks and for the first time implements hypergraph neural network layers as compositions of two multiset functions that can be efficiently learned for each task and each dataset. Furthermore, AllSet draws on new connections between hypergraph neural networks and recent advances in deep learning of multiset functions. In particular, the proposed architecture utilizes Deep Sets and Set Transformer architectures that allow for significant modeling flexibility and offer high expressive power. To evaluate the performance of AllSet, we conduct the most extensive experiments to date involving ten known benchmarking datasets and three newly curated datasets that represent significant challenges for hypergraph node classification. The results demonstrate that AllSet has the unique ability to consistently either match or outperform all other hypergraph neural networks across the tested datasets.
