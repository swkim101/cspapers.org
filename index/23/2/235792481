Different from traditional task-oriented and open-domain dialogue systems, insurance agents aim to engage customers for helping them satisfy specific demands and emotional companionship. As a result, customer-to-agent dialogues are usually very long, and many turns of them are pure chit-chat without any useful marketing clues. This brings challenges to dialogue state tracking task in insurance marketing. To deal with these long and sparse dialogues, we propose a new dialogue state tracking architecture containing three components: dialogue encoder, Smart History Collector (SHC) and dialogue state classifier. SHC, a deliberately designed memory network, effectively selects relevant dialogue history via slot-attention, and then updates dialogue history memory. With SHC, our model is able to keep track of the vital information and filter out pure chit-chat. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed LS-DST significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on real insurance dialogue dataset.
