This paper investigates the tracking control problem of a class of high-order distributed systems subjected to limited communication bandwidth. An event-triggered control method is proposed, where the controller is triggered only when specific events happen. Moreover, the computational complexity is reduced by introducing command filters for virtual control signals. Specifically, the backstepping scheme is adopted as the main design framework, by which the n-th order nonlinear system is divided into n command-cascaded first order subsystems. And virtual control commands are sent through a second-order low-pass filter, by which the time derivatives of the virtual commands can be obtained directly. The theoretical analysis shows the stability of the proposed method. The tracking performance is illustrated by a simulation example.
