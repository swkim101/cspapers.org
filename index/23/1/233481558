Given a knowledge base and an observation as a set of facts,

ABox abduction aims at computing a hypothesis that, when added to the

knowledge base, is sufficient to entail the observation. In signature-based

ABox abduction, the hypothesis is further required to use only names from a

given set. This form of abduction has applications such as diagnosis, KB

repair, or explaning missing entailments. It is possible that hypotheses for

a given observation only exist if we admit the use of fresh individuals

and/or complex concepts built from the given signature, something most

approaches for ABox abduction so far do not allow or only allow

with restrictions. In this paper, we investigate the computational complexity

of this form of abduction---allowing either fresh individuals, complex concepts,

or both---for various description logics, and give size bounds on the hypotheses

if they exist.
