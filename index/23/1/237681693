Ultrathin films of Ni0.9Co0.1 were grown by radio frequency magnetron sputtering. By means of a periodic natural oxidation procedure they were transformed into Ni0.9Co0.1/NiCoO multilayers. Room temperature hysteresis loops recorded via the magneto-optic Kerr effect have revealed over all in-plane magnetic anisotropy due to magnetostatic anisotropy. Mild thermal annealing at 250 Â°C enhanced a tendency for perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, mainly due to an increase of the uniaxial volume anisotropy term. Spin reorientation transition, exchange bias larger than 700 Oe, and strong coercivity enhancement were observed via a superconducting quantum interference device at low temperatures after field cooling.
