How best to attach exoskeletons to human limbs is an open and understudied problem. In the case of upperbody exoskeletons, cylindrical handles are commonly used attachments due to ease of use and cost effectiveness. However, handles require active grip strength from the user and may result in undesirable flexion synergy stimulation, thus limiting the robotâ€™s effectiveness. This paper presents a new design, the Eminence Grip, for attaching an exoskeleton to the hand while avoiding the undesirable consequences of using a handle. The ergonomic design uses inverse impedance matching and does not require active effort from the user to remain interfaced with the exoskeleton. We compare the performance of the Eminence Grip to the handle design in a healthy subject target reaching experiment. The results show that the Eminence Grip achieves similar performance to a handle in terms of relative motion between the user and the exoskeleton while eliminating the requirement of grip force to transfer loads to/from the exoskeleton and avoiding stimulation of the flexion synergy. Taken together, the kinematic equivalence and improvement in ergonomics suggest that the Eminence Grip is a promising exoskeleton-hand attachment interface supporting further experiments with impaired populations.
