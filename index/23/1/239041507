Self-healing function is a promising approach for damage management of high-load robot applications such as legged robots. Although the function is getting major in soft robotics, its application to life-sized "stiff" robots is of relatively minor interest. Although the authors have devised several self-healing tensile modules for tendon-driven robots, the design guideline to satisfy the large load endurance and large stroke is still unclear. The paper focuses on the parametric design for unleaked liquid-assisted healing of low melting point alloy structure. The method was validated with a benchtop module test. Moreover, the module enabled tendon-driven monopod testbed to perform squat motion three times after the landing impact fracture and the self-healing sequence, which was never accomplished.
