Dual modular redundancy (DMR) is not only an established solution for systems with high reliability demands, it is even required in aviation certification standards such as DO-254 [5, Clause 2.3.1]. A safety critical avionic application such as the flight control system is designed with up to 6-fold redundancy and the Avionics Full-Duplex Ethernet (AFDX) communication network is also based on the DMR. Even in the automotive domain, DMR is a well known solution. ISO26262 [3, Part 6, Clause 7.4.13] also suggests heterogeneous or diverse redundancy for safety-critical applications including software which must be redundantly executed on independent hardware components to avoid failure due to hardware errors. We exploit this mandatory software redundancy to master timing errors of critical software with minimum additional overhead.
