In this work, we address the task of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation in presence of multiple target domains: The objective is to train a single model that can handle all these domains at test time. Such a multi-target adaptation is crucial for a variety of scenarios that real-world autonomous systems must handle. It is a challenging setup since one faces not only the domain gap between the labeled source set and the un-labeled target set, but also the distribution shifts existing within the latter among the different target domains. To this end, we introduce two adversarial frameworks: (i) multi-discriminator, which explicitly aligns each target domain to its counterparts, and (ii) multi-target knowledge transfer, which learns a target-agnostic model thanks to a multi-teacher/single-student distillation mechanism. The evaluation is done on four newly-proposed multi-target bench-marks for UDA in semantic segmentation. In all tested scenarios, our approaches consistently outperform baselines, setting competitive standards for the novel task.
