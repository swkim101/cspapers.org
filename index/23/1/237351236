Formulations based on mineral fillers and polymeric matrices of different nature were studied to obtain halogen-free flame retardant compounds (HFFR) for cable applications. The work was carried out by comparing fire-retardant mineral fillers of natural origin with synthetic mineral ones available on the market. As a reference, a formulation based on micronized natural magnesium hydroxide (n-MDH, obtained from brucite) and an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer with 28% by weight (11% by moles) of vinyl acetate were selected, and the mechanical and flame retardant properties compared with formulations based on secondary polymers combined with EVA, metal hydroxides, and carbonates. Notably, we found a synergistic effect in the mechanical, rheological and flame retardant properties for the composite containing a mixture of n-MDH and boehmite in a 3:1 weight ratio. Overall, the present work provided a complete and optimized recipe for the formulation of polymer composites characterized by the required flame retardant and mechanical features in electric cables applications.
