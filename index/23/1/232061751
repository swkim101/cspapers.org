Large scale software systems are usually developed by multiple teams. Communication and collaboration skills are required as essential skills of qualified developers in the modern environment, in addition to the technical hard skills of software engineering. Therefore, group projects are included in almost courses to train students' professional skills and teamwork abilities. However, in their group projects, most of the students are only required to accomplish functional requirements with limited awareness about the quality of the software. This issue seriously affects the development speed, since it is difficult for team members to read others' code during the development process. Hence, we propose a quality-driven assessment system for group projects with the capability of checking the coding style after each submission and providing immediate feedback to help student teams maintain the code quality for their group projects. Besides, to objectively assess the contribution of all students in group projects, we propose a set of repository mining metrics including two major categories of productivity and quality. A case study about the usage of the system and the proposed contribution evaluation metrics are introduced to illustrate the feasibility of our approach.
