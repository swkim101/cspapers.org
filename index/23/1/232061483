3GPP proposes the approach of autonomous component carrier selection (ACCS), it would let every base station select the carrier which isn’t used by near base stations to avoid the carrier interference caused by the irregular establishment of HeNB. However, the selection rules of ACCS are imperfect and it will result in poor performance of system throughput and carrier utility and lower the connection of UE. In this paper, we propose a new ACCS based on user scheduling under the basic CA selection framework of ACCS. This method when the base station cannot be distributed carrier resources because of the interference, base station would check the current user equipment’s interference situation, UEs will be scheduled by interference situation, then the base station select the appropriate carrier distribution for UE in the schedule. Finally, simulation results show that method proposed by this study can raise resource distribution of main carrier to attain more users’ connection and simultaneously elevate the resource distribution of sub-carrier to meet the demands of UE bandwidth.
