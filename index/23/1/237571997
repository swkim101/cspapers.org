We can make it easier for disabled users to control assistive robots by mapping the user's low-dimensional joystick inputs to high-dimensional, complex actions. Prior works learn these mappings from human demonstrations: a non-disabled human either teleoperates or kinesthetically guides the robot arm through a variety of motions, and the robot learns to reproduce the demonstrated behaviors. But this framework is often impractical — disabled users will not always have access to external demonstrations! Here we instead learn diverse teleoperation mappings without either human demonstrations or pre-defined tasks. Under our unsupervised approach the robot first optimizes for object state entropy: i.e., the robot autonomously learns to push, pull, open, close, or otherwise change the state of nearby objects. We then embed these diverse, object-oriented behaviors into a latent space for real-time control: now pressing the joystick causes the robot to perform dexterous motions like pushing or opening. We experimentally show that — with a best-case human operator — our unsupervised approach actually outperforms the teleoperation mappings learned from human demonstrations, particularly if those demonstrations are noisy or imperfect. But our user study results were less clear-cut: although our approach enabled participants to complete tasks more quickly and with fewer changes of direction, users were confused when the unsupervised robot learned unexpected behaviors.
