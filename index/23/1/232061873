Images are an important part of digital communication in this era. The optimization of image file size and algorithms for image transfer are vital to ensure quality of service levels and expected time requirements for services. This paper describes and evaluates a combination of file reduction and scheduling techniques from a system design level to ensure that image transfer timing constraints are satisfied.
