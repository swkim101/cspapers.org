Foreground occlusion removal task aims to automatically detect and remove foreground occlusions and recover background objects. Since for Light Fields (LFs), background objects occluded in some views may be seen in other views, the foreground occlusion removal task for LFs is easy to achieve. In this paper, we propose a learning-based method combining ‘seeking’ and ‘generating’ to recover occluded background. Specifically, the micro-lens dynamic filters are proposed to ‘seek’ occluded background points in shifted micro-lens images and remove occlusions using angular information. The shifted images are then combined to further ‘generate’ background regions to supplement more background details using spatial information. By fully exploring the angular and spatial information in LFs, the dense and complex occlusions can be easily removed. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts methods by a large margin.
