With the rapid development of storage devices, the computational storage device (CSD) can use NAND flash memory to store data and is equipped with powerful CPU or hardware accelerators to efficiently perform calculations and operations on internal data. In the paper, we will utilize the CSD to accelerate the CNN training that mainly contains the convolution, pooling and training work. We not only reduce the amount of data transmission between the host and the storage by bringing the convolution and the pooling work to the CSD, but also bring the training work to the powerful CSD in a hybrid computational storage architecture. According to the experimental results, the amount of data transmission and the total execution time can be reduced significantly.
