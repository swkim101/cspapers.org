We introduce an underactuated differential-based robot gripper able to perform self-adaptive grasping with passive disturbance rejection. The gripper utilises three car differential systems to achieve self-adaptiveness with a single actuator: a base differential for distributing power from the motor to the fingers, and two independent finger differentials for controlling the proximal and distal joints. Linear and torsional springs are cleverly added to these differentials to allow the return of the fingers and the gripper-object system to equilibrium, thus enabling the gripper rejecting unexpected external forces applied to the fingers after securing a grasp. This novel design provides passive disturbance rejection without implementing complicated control systems and is the main contribution of this paper. Moreover, the differentials allow the gripper to perform not only self-adaptive power grasp but also precision grasp, provide it with a large force transmission efficiency, and facilitate the prediction of grasping position. We analyse the static model of the introduced differential system and evaluate the gripper design via four sets of experiments. Numerical and empirical results clearly demonstrate the viability of the proposed grasper.
