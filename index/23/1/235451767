We present a lightweight library that automatically collects several hardware counters for MPI applications. We analyze the effect of strong and weak scaling on the counters. We first correlate the counter values obtained from each process count, and then cluster the counters to identify counters that are affected similarly due to scaling. We noted that the effect of last-level cache misses is more pronounced for some applications such as miniFE.
