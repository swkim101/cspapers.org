This paper describes the development of a 1-DOF kinesthetic force display device in the form of an arm training simulator that replicates the haptic feeling of lead-pipe rigidity in the elbow joint. Patients with lead-pipe rigidity have uniformly elevated muscle tone throughout the range of motion, which is an important clinical sign for diagnosing Parkinson’s disease during a neurological examination. The simulator could provide training opportunities for healthcare trainees to learn and practice the assessment technique for lead-pipe rigidity. The simulator was driven by a series elastic actuator in order to have more accurate joint torque control in a safe and cost-effective manner for rendering abnormal muscle resistance. A mathematical model of lead-pipe rigidity based on hyperbolic tangent was proposed to recreate the elevated muscle resistance at different Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) 0-3. Performance of the simulator was evaluated through benchtop tests and rigidity simulation tests. Preliminary results suggested the simulator had good torque control accuracy (an average RMSE < 0.27 Nm) and good fidelity in mimicking clinically-measured lead-pipe rigidity at UPDRS 0-3.
