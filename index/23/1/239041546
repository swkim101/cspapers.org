This paper extends the results in [1] considering time delays in Standard Car Following models (CFMs). In [1], connected vehicles are characterized with CFMs models and controlled using linear string analysis to stabilize single-lane car following of human-driven vehicles (HDVs). In this paper, we revisit stability and safety conditions for traffic considering time delays due to lags in the input signals. We perform plant stability and string stability analysis to derive these conditions. Then we obtain the optimal number of HDVs that can be stabilized using one autonomous vehicle. Numerical simulations are provided to implement a case study on Intelligent Driver Model to discuss the influence of time delays that arise on HDVs and the autonomous vehicle on optimal number of HDVs that can be stabilized using one autonomous vehicle.
