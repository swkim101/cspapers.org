Fire simulations are used to evaluate the spread of fires and check the safety of environments. To make the simulation realistic, the fire simulation must consider numerous physical and chemical reactions with complicate and time-consuming computations. It limits the fire simulations being used for real-time prediction when there is a fire. This paper presents a real-time fire prediction approach based on fire simulations. Our approach uses fire simulation to collect training data for building a smoke spread model of fire. The model is used to predict the spread of fire real-time which can help online evacuation planning more accurate and realistic, such as help people avoid dangerous area.
