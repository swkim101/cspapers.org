We show that explicit modeling of composition rules benefits image cropping. Image cropping is considered a promising way to automate aesthetic composition in professional photography. Existing efforts, however, only model such professional knowledge implicitly, e.g., by ranking from comparative candidates. Inspired by the observation that natural composition traits always follow a specific rule, we propose to learn such rules in a discriminative manner, and more importantly, to incorporate learned composition clues explicitly in the model. To this end, we introduce the concept of the key composition map (KCM) to encode the composition rules. The KCM can reveal the common laws hidden behind different composition rules and can inform the cropping model of what is important in composition. With the KCM, we present a novel cropping-by-composition paradigm and instantiate a network to implement composition-aware image cropping. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks justify that our approach enables effective, interpretable, and fast image cropping.
