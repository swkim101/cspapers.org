Shape and pose estimation is a critical perception problem for a self-driving car to fully understand its surrounding environment. One fundamental challenge in solving this problem is the incomplete sensor signal (e.g., LiDAR scans), especially for faraway or occluded objects. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to address this challenge, which explicitly leverages the sensor signal captured over consecutive time: the consecutive signals can provide more information about an object, including different viewpoints and its motion. By encoding the consecutive signals via a recurrent neural network, not only our algorithm improves the shape and pose estimates, but also produces a labeling tool that can benefit other tasks in autonomous driving research. Specifically, building upon our algorithm, we propose a novel pipeline to automatically annotate high-quality labels for amodal segmentation on images, which are hard and laborious to annotate manually. Our code and data will be made publicly available.
