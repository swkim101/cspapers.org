In this work, we tackle the problem of category-level online pose tracking of objects from point cloud sequences. For the first time, we propose a unified framework that can handle 9DoF pose tracking for novel rigid object instances as well as per-part pose tracking for articulated objects from known categories. Here the 9DoF pose, comprising 6D pose and 3D size, is equivalent to a 3D amodal bounding box representation with free 6D pose. Given the depth point cloud at the current frame and the estimated pose from the last frame, our novel end-to-end pipeline learns to accurately update the pose. Our pipeline is composed of three modules: 1) a pose canonicalization module that normalizes the pose of the input depth point cloud; 2) RotationNet, a module that directly regresses small interframe delta rotations; and 3) CoordinateNet, a module that predicts the normalized coordinates and segmentation, enabling analytical computation of the 3D size and translation. Leveraging the small pose regime in the pose-canonicalized point clouds, our method integrates the best of both worlds by combining dense coordinate prediction and direct rotation regression, thus yielding an end-to-end differentiable pipeline optimized for 9DoF pose accuracy (without using non-differentiable RANSAC). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on category-level rigid object pose (NOCSREAL275 [29]) and articulated object pose benchmarks (SAPIEN [34], BMVC [18]) at the fastest FPS âˆ¼ 12.
