High-radix interconnects such as Dragonfly and its variants rely on adaptive routing to balance network traffic for optimum performance. Ideally, adaptive routing attempts to forward packets between minimal and non-minimal paths with the least congestion. In practice, current adaptive routing algorithms estimate routing path congestion based on local information such as output queue occupancy. Using local information to estimate global path congestion is inevitably inaccurate because a router has no precise knowledge of link states a few hops away. This inaccuracy could lead to interconnect congestion. In this study, we present Q-adaptive routing, a multi-agent reinforcement learning routing scheme for Dragonfly systems. Q-adaptive routing enables routers to learn to route autonomously by leveraging advanced reinforcement learning technology. The proposed Q-adaptive routing is highly scalable thanks to its fully distributed nature without using any shared information between routers. Furthermore, a new two-level Q-table is designed for Q-adaptive to make it computational lightly and saves 50% of router memory usage compared with the previous Q-routing. We implement the proposed Q-adaptive routing in SST/Merlin simulator. Our evaluation results show that Q-adaptive routing achieves up to 10.5% system throughput improvement and 5.2x average packet latency reduction compared with adaptive routing algorithms. Remarkably, Q-adaptive can even outperform the optimal VALn non-minimal routing under the ADV+1 adversarial traffic pattern with up to 3% system throughput improvement and 75% average packet latency reduction.
