Industrial robots play potential and important roles on labor-intensive and high-risk jobs. For example, typical industrial robots have been used in grinding process. However, the automatic grinding process by robots is a complex process because it still relies on skillful engineers to adaptively adjust several key parameters. Moreover, it might take a lot of time and effort to yield better grinding quality. Hence, this paper proposed a new framework of cyber-physical robot system with automatic zero-tuning optimization of the process parameters to achieve the desired quality. To overcome the unexpected difference between reality and simulation, proper system calibration can help in precise positioning in real environment, and the cloud database is constructed to record the relative data during the grinding process simultaneously. The proposed zero-tuning methodology combines both neural network (NN) model and genetic algorithm (GA) to generate the best combination of corresponding parameters to meet the desired quality. Experimental results showed that the average error of the output result was 8.93%. To compare the CNC machine, our solution shows more prominent role and potential in plumbing industry.
