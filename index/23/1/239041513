Soft robots have been applied widely to various constrained scenarios due to the advantages over traditional rigid manipulators such as softness, deformability and adaptability to constrained surroundings. To make full use of this merit, this paper proposes a method that integrates collision detection, localization and force estimation for a cable-driven soft manipulator without any prior geometrical knowledge of its surroundings. First of all, a collision detection algorithm is presented based upon Cosserat-rod statics by a threshold method through using the cable tension and the shape information, which are obtained by the load cells and the Vicon system, respectively. Secondly, a collision localization and force estimation method is proposed through optimizing the discrepancy between the actual and the theoretical shapes. Finally, experiments are carried out to validate these algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the site, the magnitude as well as the direction can be estimated.
