Task planning for mobile robots typically uses an abstract planning domain

that ignores the low-level details of the specific robot platform.

Therefore, executing a plan on an actual robot often requires

additional steps to deal with the specifics of the robot platform. Such

a platform can be modeled with timed automata and a set of temporal

constraints that need to be satisfied during execution.



In this paper, we describe how to transform an abstract plan into a

platform-specific action sequence that satisfies all platform

constraints. The transformation procedure first transforms the plan into

a timed automaton, which is then combined with the platform automata

while removing all transitions that violate any constraint. We then

apply reachability analysis on the resulting automaton. From any

solution trace one can obtain the abstract plan extended by additional

platform actions such that all platform constraints are satisfied. We

describe the transformation procedure in detail and provide an

evaluation in two real-world robotics scenarios.
