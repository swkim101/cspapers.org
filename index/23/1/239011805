Quantum computers can solve problems that are intractable using the most powerful classical computer. However, qubits are fickle and error prone. It is necessary to actively correct errors in the execution of a quantum circuit. Quantum error correction (QEC) codes are developed to enable fault-tolerant quantum computing. With QEC, one logical circuit is converted into an encoded circuit. Most studies on quantum circuit compilation focus on NISQ devices which have 10-100 qubits and are not fault-tolerant. In this paper, we focus on the compilation for fault-tolerant quantum hardware. In particular, we focus on optimizing communication parallelism for the surface code based QEC. The execution of surface code circuits involves non-trivial geometric manipulation of a large lattice of entangled physical qubits. A two-qubit gate in surface code is implemented as a virtual “pipe” in space-time called a braiding path. The braiding paths should be carefully routed to avoid congestion. Communication between qubits is considered the major bottleneck as it involves scheduling and searching for simultaneous paths between qubits. We provide a framework for efficiently scheduling braiding paths. We discover that for quantum programs with a local parallelism pattern, our framework guarantees an optimal solution, while the previous greedy-heuristic-based solution cannot. Moreover, we propose an extension to the local parallelism analysis framework to address the communication bottleneck. Our framework achieves orders of magnitude improvement after addressing the communication bottleneck.
