In recent years, with the rise of the concept of virtual reality, multidimension-media that contains multiple sensory stimulations such as vision, hearing, and somatosensory have also sprung up. However, existing network streaming platforms are still limited to traditional video and audio streaming, lack the transmission of somatosensory data, and cannot support multidimension-media that requires natural interaction. This paper proposes a multidimension-media streaming system composed of three parties: control center, client platform, and multidimension-media producer. It specifies the login procedures, link procedures, interaction mechanisms, and logout procedures in detail. This architecture adopts the method of separate transmission of audiovisual information and body joint information to solve the problem of the unreturnable somatosensory information in the current streaming system. In this paper, a complete system has been set up to actually verify the flow of producers and client platforms from login, data transmission, stream creation to logout. It proposes an objective function for the system delay and tests the influence of the network cache size on the client platform. The delay can be reduced to less than one second under the best settings. This paper also measured the relationship between the body joints and the network traffic of the control center when a single pair of client-producer were connected and proposed related formulas for reference when building systems in the future.
