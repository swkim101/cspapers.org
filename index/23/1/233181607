The imagination of the surrounding environment based on the experience and semantic cognition has great potential to extend the limited observations to leverage the ability for mapping, collision avoidance and path planning. This paper provides a training-based algorithm for mobile robots to perform spatial imagination based on semantic cognition and evaluates the proposed method for the mapping task. We utilize a photo-realistic simulation environment, Habitat, for training and evaluation. The trained model is composed of Resent-18 as encoder and U-net as the backbone. We demonstrate that the algorithm can perform imagination for unseen parts of the object universally, by recalling the images and experience and compare our approach with traditional semantic mapping methods. It is found that our approach will improve the efficiency and accuracy of semantic mapping.
