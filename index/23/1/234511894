In this paper, the application of cloud computing in the field of robotics is described. Dual robots are assigned the job of picking up objects lying on the floor and to keep them in the given spaces. In the co-operative environment both the robots try to follow their route of shortest path till such situations arise when either the object or the space has been exhausted. Then the robot searches for the next nearest object or space or the remaining object or space and act accordingly.
