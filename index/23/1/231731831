Game theory has been increasingly applied in settings where the game is not known outright, but has to be estimated by sampling.
For example, meta-games that arise in multi-agent evaluation can only be accessed by running a succession of expensive experiments that may involve simultaneous deployment of several agents.
In this paper, we focus on α-rank, a popular game-theoretic solution concept designed to perform well in such scenarios.
We aim to estimate the α-rank of the game using as few samples as possible.
Our algorithm maximizes information gain between an epistemic belief over the α-ranks and the observed payoff. This approach has two main benefits. 
First, it allows us to focus our sampling on the entries that matter the most for identifying the α-rank. Second, the Bayesian formulation provides a facility to build in modeling assumptions by using a prior over game payoffs.
We show the benefits of using information gain as compared to the confidence interval criterion of ResponseGraphUCB, 
and provide theoretical results justifying our method.
