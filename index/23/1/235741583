Machine learning (ML) is increasingly seen as a viable approach for building compiler optimization heuristics, but many ML methods cannot replicate even the simplest of the data ﬂow analyses that are critical to making good optimization decisions. We posit that if ML cannot do that, then it is insufﬁciently able to reason about programs. We formulate data ﬂow analyses as supervised learning tasks and introduce a large open dataset of programs and their corresponding labels from several analyses. We use this dataset to benchmark ML methods and show that they struggle on these fundamental program reasoning tasks. We propose P RO G RA ML – Program Graphs for Machine Learning – a language-independent, portable representation of program semantics. P RO G RA ML overcomes the limitations of prior works and yields improved performance on downstream optimization tasks.
