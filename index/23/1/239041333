Obstacle avoidance is crucial for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in the sea because rescue is extremely difficult there. OceanVoy, a sailboat toward long range energy-saving voyage, has to overcome the dual challenges, i.e. from the environmental interference and its low mobility preventing from precise obstacle avoidance. We propose a control scheme based on real-time collision risk assessment and a hybrid propulsion system to enhance safety of OceanVoy. A novel sailboat safety zone (SSZ) has been designed to warn the potential collision during its sailing. Both intrinsic characteristics of OceanVoy and environmental factors have been considered in SSZ. We use lateral and axial thrusters to provide emergency propulsion. A collision avoidance algorithm is executed to coordinate motors in rudder, sail and thrusters based on SSZ. Both simulation and experiments have been conducted and the results have validated our system and collision avoidance scheme.
