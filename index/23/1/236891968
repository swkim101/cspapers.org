Indonesia is a developing country with the fourth largest population in the world. Population in one of the provinces in Indonesia, namely Yogyakarta Special Region. Based on data from the Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS), the Special Region of Yogyakarta reached 3.8 million people in 2018. Of this number, almost one third (1.2 million people) are residents of Sleman. While the region with the next largest population is Bantul with 1 million inhabitants. Increasing population causes the need to move and other needs, as well as activities in the education, office and trade sectors also increase. This increase will also affect transportation by increasing the number of vehicles, but this increase is not in line with the existing traffic light updates. As a result, the capacity of the street section has decreased and caused congestion, for example at the APILL intersection on Bantul-Nasional III Street, Yogyakarta. This shows that the existing traffic light settings are not optimal. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the duration of the traffic lights to minimize congestion. This research was conducted to analyze the traffic light system at the APILL intersection on Bantul-Nasional III Street, Yogyakarta using the Webster method. The results of calculations using this method obtained results for the Bantul Street (north), the duration of the green light 30 seconds, yellow 3 seconds and red 28 seconds. For Nasional III Street (East), the duration of the green light is 24 seconds, yellow is 3 seconds and red is 34 seconds. For Bantul Street (south), the duration of the green light is 30 seconds, yellow is 3 seconds and red is 28 seconds. For Nasional III Street (West), the duration of the green light is 24 seconds, yellow is 3 seconds and red is 34 seconds. These results look more optimal than those on the field today.
