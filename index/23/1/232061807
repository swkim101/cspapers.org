Tactile Internet (TI) is considered to create a paradigm shift from content-based communications to steer/control-based communications by enabling real-time transmission of haptic information (i.e., touch, activation, motion, vibration, surface texture) over the Internet. This is an emerging technology next to the Internet of Things (IoT). To promises new applications and services that harness real-time human-machine (H2M) interactions to revolutionize our everyday life. Understanding the traffic aspects of new applications is important in finding network control and bandwidth allocation strategies to meet their latency requirement. Fiber wireless networks (FiWi) have been proposed as an ideal candidate to support such demanding environments. In this paper, we newly propose to integrate software-defined networking (SDN) into standard FiWi architectures to facilitate an orchestrated bandwidth allocation operation in which the SDN controller dynamically provisions the number of wavelengths, link-rates, and timeslot assignments depending on the global traffic conditions. TI-DWBA is designed to estimate the average bandwidth of the Tactile Internet (TI) and Non-TI (e.g., Voice, Video, Data) traffic in each integrated optical and wireless network. Finally, detailed simulation results indicate the performance of the proposed resource allocation mechanism to provide the required Quality-of-services (QoS) for TI applications under various simulation scenarios.
