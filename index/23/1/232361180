As locomotion decisions must be taken by considering the future, most existing quadruped controllers are based on a model predictive controller (MPC) with a reduced model of the dynamics to generate the motion and a whole- body controller to execute it. Yet the simplifying assumptions of the MPC are often chosen ad-hoc or by intuition. In this article, we focus on a set of MPCs and analyze the effect of chosen model reductions on the behavior of the robot. Based on existing formulations, we present additional controllers to better understand the influence of model reductions on the controller capabilities. Finally, we propose a robust predictive controller capable of optimizing the foot placements, gait period, center- of-mass trajectory and ground reaction forces. The behavior of these controllers is statistically evaluated in simulation. This empirical study aims to assess the relative importance of the components of the optimal control problem (variables, costs, dynamics) to be able to take reasoned decisions instead of arbitrarily emphasizing or neglecting some of them. We also provide a qualitative study in simulation and on the real robot Solo-12.
