We provide $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$-pass semi-streaming algorithms for computing $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs. Our most efficient methods are deterministic and use optimal, $O(n)$, space, improving upon the space complexity of the previous state-of-the-art $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$-pass algorithm of Ahn and Guha. To obtain our results we provide semi-streaming adaptations of more general continuous optimization tools. Further, we leverage these techniques to obtain improvements for streaming variants of approximate linear programming, optimal transport, exact matching, transshipment, and shortest path problems.
