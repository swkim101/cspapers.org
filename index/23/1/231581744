This paper investigate potential use of augmented reality (AR) for physical human-robot collaboration in large-scale, labour-intensive manufacturing tasks. While it has been shown that use of AR can help increase task efficiency in teleoperative and robot programming tasks involving smaller-scale robots, its use for physical human-robot collaboration in shared workspaces and large-scale manufacturing tasks have not been well-studied. With the eventual goal of applying our AR system to collaborative aircraft body manufacturing, we compare in a user study the use of an AR interface we developed with a standard joystick for human robot collaboration in an experiment task simulating industrial carbon-fibre-reinforced-polymer manufacturing procedure. Results show that use of AR yields reduced task time and physical demand, with increased robot utilization.
