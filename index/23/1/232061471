The design of modern real-time systems not only needs to guarantee their timing correctness, but also involves other critical metrics such as control quality and energy consumption. As real-time systems become increasingly complex, there is an urgent need for efficient optimization techniques that can handle large-scale systems. However, the complexity of schedulability analysis often makes it difficult to be directly incorporated in standard optimization frameworks, and inefficient to be checked against a large number of candidate solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework for the design of real-time systems. It leverages the sustainability of schedulability analysis that is applicable for a large class of real-time systems. It builds a counterexample-guided iterative procedure to efficiently learn from an unschedulable solution and rule out many similar ones. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed framework may be ten times faster while providing solutions with the same quality.
