Straight line features have been increasingly utilized in visual SLAM and 3D reconstruction systems. The straight linesâ€™ parameterization, parallel constraint, and coplanar constraint are studied in many recent works. In this paper, we explore the novel intersection constraint of straight lines for structure reconstruction. First, a minimum parameterized representation of ray-point-ray (RPR) structures is proposed to represent the intersection of two straight lines in the 3D space. Second, an efficient solver is designed for the camera pose estimation, which leverages the perpendicularity and intersection of straight lines. Third, we build a stereo visual odometry based on RPR features and evaluate it on the simulation and real datasets. The experimental results verify that the intersection constraints from RPR can effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency of line-based SLAM and reconstruction system.
