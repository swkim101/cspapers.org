Requirements-driven search-based testing (SBT), also known as falsification, has proven to be a practical and effective method for discovering erroneous behaviors in Cyber-Physical Systems. However, SBT techniques do not provide guarantees on correctness if no falsifying behavior is found within the test budget. Hence, the applicability of SBT methods for evidence generation supporting assurance cases is limited. In this work, we make progress towards developing finite-time guarantees for SBT techniques with associated confidence metrics. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to the F16 GCAS benchmark challenge.
