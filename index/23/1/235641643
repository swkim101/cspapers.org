We propose a novel method for exploring how neurons within neural networks interact. In particular, we consider activation values of a network for given data, and propose to mine noise-robust rules of the form X → Y , where X and Y are sets of neurons in different layers. We identify the best set of rules by the Minimum Description Length principle, as those rules that together are most descriptive of the activation data.To learn good rule sets in practice, we propose the unsupervised E X - PLAI NN algorithm. Extensive evaluation shows that the patterns it discovers give clear insight into how networks perceive the world: they identify shared and class-speciﬁc traits, composition-ality, as well as locality in convolutional layers.
