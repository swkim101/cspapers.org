The dual-hop non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based diamond relay network can attain a high achievable rate from a source to a destination thanks to the use of the two relays realizing both downlink and uplink NOMA virtually. In this paper, we further enhance its achievable-rate performance through joint power allocation at the source and the two NOMA-functioned relays. Particularly, an efficient algorithm is presented to fulfill this task. Simulation results show that in the considered network, the proposed power-allocation method offers a higher achievable rate than some relevant approaches, especially when the two relays are placed rather asymmetrically, i.e., one is very near the source and another is very near the destination.
