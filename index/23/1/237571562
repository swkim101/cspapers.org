Grasp planning and most specifically the grasp space exploration is still an open issue in robotics. This article presents an efficient procedure for exploring the grasp space of a multifingered adaptive gripper for generating reliable grasps given a known object pose. This procedure relies on a limited dataset of manually specified expert grasps, and use a mixed analytic and data-driven approach based on the use of a grasp quality metric and variational autoencoders. The performances of this method are assessed by generating grasps in simulation for three different objects. On this grasp planning task, this method reaches a grasp success rate of 99.91% on 7000 trials.
