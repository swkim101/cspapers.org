A group of agents can collectively purchase a public good that yields heterogeneous benefits to its members. Combining a reduced-form implementation result with a duality argument, we characterize the seller's profit-maximizing mechanism. Trade outcomes depend solely on a weighted average of the agents' virtual values, with endogenous voting weights. Heterogeneity in voting weights reflects heterogeneity in agents' value distributions, where agents with lower value distributions are given more weight in trade decisions. Simple pricing rules are generally not (even approximately) optimal.
