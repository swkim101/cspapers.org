Real-time lower limbs motion or gait measurement is an important part in human-robotic interaction for the control of robotic walkers and rehabilitation devices. Laser range finder or infrared sensor that is mounted on the device has been widely used in applications. Although these sensors can provide accurate horizontal motion information of lower limbs during human walking, it is still difficult to measure the angular motion of lower limbs due to their functional principles. Using inertial measurement units (IMU) can measure the angular motion of lower limbs, but it requires a large amount of IMU units for measurements of all lower limb segments. In this study, a novel method is developed for real-time monitoring lower limbs (shanks and thighs) motion in human walking using just two shank-mounted IMUs. A pose prediction model based on multiple linear regression and Kalman filter is proposed. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the thigh orientation and the knee joint angle estimation in sagittal plane are 6.1 ± 1.3 and 6.8 ± 1.4 degs, respectively. The RMSE of the ankle, knee, and hip position estimation are 4.2 ± 1.3, 4.2 ± 1.1 and 3.5 ± 0.9 cm, respectively.
