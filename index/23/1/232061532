The Internet of Things (IoT) system is booming and most of IoT applications are applied by short-distance transmission protocols. It is not suitable for long-term used and wide area application. Hence, LoRa is an ideal protocol for applied to IoT system, which is with low transmission power and long transmission distance. The transmission device implementation on IoT system is a time-consuming procedure. To saving implementation time, a deployment and evaluation of LoRa network configuration is proposed in this research. The proposed method is designed with Random Forest based on machine learning. Based on specific condition, the proposed method will output a suggested parameter combination for implementation. On the basis of our experiment, when deploying LoRa devices in different locations, user only need to enter the constraints of the expected result, proposed will automatically output the most suitable parameters to achieve rapid deployment and intelligent network.
