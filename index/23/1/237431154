Transformer, as a strong and flexible architecture for modelling long-range relations, has been widely explored in vision tasks. However, when used in video inpainting that requires fine-grained representation, existed method still suffers from yielding blurry edges in detail due to the hard patch splitting. Here we aim to tackle this problem by proposing FuseFormer, a Transformer model designed for video inpainting via fine-grained feature fusion based on novel Soft Split and Soft Composition operations. The soft split divides feature map into many patches with given overlapping interval. On the contrary, the soft composition operates by stitching different patches into a whole feature map where pixels in overlapping regions are summed up. These two modules are first used in tokenization before Transformer layers and de-tokenization after Transformer layers, for effective mapping between tokens and features. Therefore, sub-patch level information interaction is enabled for more effective feature propagation between neighboring patches, resulting in synthesizing vivid content for hole regions in videos. Moreover, in FuseFormer, we elaborately insert the soft composition and soft split into the feed-forward network, enabling the 1D linear layers to have the capability of modelling 2D structure. And, the sub-patch level feature fusion ability is further enhanced. In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our proposed FuseFormer surpasses state-of-the-art methods. We also conduct detailed analysis to examine its superiority. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/ruiliu-ai/FuseFormer.
