This paper deals with the traffic management of multiple Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in an automatic factory or warehouse. We propose innovative methods, evolved from the studies previously conducted in [1], to coordinate a fleet of AGVs in an industrial environment, and we describe the methodologies developed to build a complete traffic manager software. The software is based on a multi-layer control architecture: a higher-level layer useful to model the traffic of vehicles among the different areas of the warehouse, a middle layer which acts as a bridge between the traffic model and the path planner, and a lower-level layer which represents the roadmap itself and, hence, defines the optimal path to be followed by each vehicle. Finally, the AGVs movement coordination is managed separately through a centralized control in order to avoid conflicts and deadlocks.The aim is to make theoretical methods applicable to a real environment facing the usual problems related to the industrial applications, which have been overlooked in [1]. Indeed, the roadmap is usually constrained by the plant layout, especially in medium size factories, and paths can not be arbitrarily defined. Hence, the aim is to realize a reliable and robust software able to manage real scenarios, allowing the traffic management of multiple AGVs. The proposed method aims at flexibility by considering a coordination strategy not based on assumptions and ad-hoc rules.
