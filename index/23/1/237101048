This paper summarises work where we combined semantic web technologies with deep learning systems to obtain state-of-the art explainable misinformation detection. We proposed a conceptual and computational model to describe a wide range of misinformation detection systems based around the concepts of credibility and reviews. We described how Credibility Reviews (CRs) can be used to build networks of distributed bots that collaborate for misinformation detection which we evaluated by building a prototype based on publicly available datasets and deep learning models.
