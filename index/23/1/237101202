Taxonomies provide a structured representation of semantic relations between lexical terms, acting as the backbone of many applications. The research proposed herein addresses the topic of taxonomy enrichment using an ”human-in-the-loop” semi-supervised approach. I will be investigating possible ways to extend and enrich a taxonomy using corpora of unstructured text data. The objective is to develop a methodological framework potentially applicable to any domain.
