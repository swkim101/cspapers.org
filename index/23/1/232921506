In this work we analyze a massive data-set that captures 5.23 petabytes of traffic to shed light into the composition of one-way traffic towards a large network based on a novel one-way traffic classifier. We find that one-way traffic makes a very large fraction of all traffic in terms of flows, it can be primarily attributed to malicious causes, and it has declined since 2004 because of relative decrease of scan traffic. In addition, we show how our classifier is useful for detecting network outages.
