We tackle the problem of multiple quadrotors transporting a cable-suspended point-mass load. The quadrotors are treated as a virtual leader-follower algorithm, where a multi-layer graph encapsulates the communication and physical interaction. On the one hand, the communication stands for the approach of following the reference trajectory of a virtual leader. On the other hand, the load exerts a distributed tension force on each cable which is modeled as the well-known spring-damping system to each quadrotor establishing an interconnected dynamic. We assume cables are stretchable and have neglectable mass. Both objectives are accomplished through a Model Reference Adaptive Control approach with a robust modification that treats uncertainties and perturbations given by error in parameters, noise in the signal, and the wind drag forces. We prove stability based on Lyapunov approach and the results are shown through simulation.
