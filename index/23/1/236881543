Vector graphic documents present visual elements in a resolution free, compact format and are often seen in creative applications. In this work, we attempt to learn a generative model of vector graphic documents. We define vector graphic documents by a multi-modal set of attributes associated to a canvas and a sequence of visual elements such as shapes, images, or texts, and train variational auto-encoders to learn the representation of the documents. We collect a new dataset of design templates from an online service that features complete document structure including occluded elements. In experiments, we show that our model, named CanvasVAE, constitutes a strong baseline for generative modeling of vector graphic documents.
