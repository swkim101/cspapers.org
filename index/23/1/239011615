The performance of persistent applications is severely hurt by current secure processor architectures. Persistent applications use long-latency flush instructions and memory fences to make sure that writes to persistent data reach the persistency domain in a way that is crash consistent. Recently introduced features like Intelâ€™s Asynchronous DRAM Refresh (ADR) make the on-chip Write Pending Queue (WPQ) part of the persistency domain and help reduce the penalty of persisting data since data only needs to reach the on-chip WPQ to be considered persistent. However, when persistent applications run on secure processors, for the sake of securing memory many cycles are added to the critical path of their write operations before they ever reach the persistent WPQ, preventing them from fully exploiting the performance advantages of the persistent WPQ. Our goal in this work is to make it feasible for secure persistent applications to benefit more from the on-chip persistency domain. We propose Dolos, an architecture that prioritizes persisting data without sacrificing security in order to gain a significant performance boost for persistent applications. Dolos achieves this goal by an additional minor security unit, Mi-SU, that utilizes a much faster secure process that protects only the WPQ. Thus, the secure operation latency in the critical path of persist operations is reduced and hence persistent transactions can complete earlier. Dolos retains a conventional major security unit for protecting memory that occurs off the critical path after inserting secured data into the WPQ. To evaluate our design, we implemented our architecture in the GEM5 simulator, and analyzed the performance of 6 benchmarks from the WHISPER suite. Dolos improves their performance by 1.66x on average.
