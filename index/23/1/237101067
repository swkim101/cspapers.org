My research is driven by my curiosity about the nature of intelligence. Of the several aspects that characterise the behaviour of intelligent agents, I primarily study sequential decision making, learning, and exploration. My interests also extend to broader questions on the effects of AI on life and society. In this paper, I present four distinct investigations drawn from my recent work, which range from theoretical to applied, and which involve both analysis and design. I also share my outlook as an early-career researcher.
