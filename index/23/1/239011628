Processing-in-memory (PIM) and in-storage-computing (ISC) architectures have been constructed to implement computation inside memory and near storage, respectively. While effectively mitigating the overhead of data movement from memory and storage to the processor, due to the limited bandwidth of existing systems, these architectures still suffer from the large data movement overhead between storage and memory, in particular, if the amount of required data is large. It has become a major constraint for further improving the computation efficiency in PIM and ISC architectures. In this paper, we propose ParaBit, a scheme that enables Parallel Bitwise operations in NAND flash storage where data reside. By adjusting the latching circuit control and the sequence of sensing operations, ParaBit enables in-flash bitwise operation with no or little extra hardware, which effectively reduces the overhead of data movement between storage and memory. We exploit the massive parallelism in NAND flash based SSDs to mitigate the long latency of flash operations. Our experimental results show that the proposed ParaBit design achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art PIM and ISC architectures.
