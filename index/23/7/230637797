On-chip power dissipation is recognized as one of the primary limiters, if not a show stopper, of performance for high-end safety-critical uniform multi-core processors. This paper proposes an efficient and simple thermal model for such a platform to be coupled with the large variety of schedulers designed to control the processor activity and the triggering of the cooling mechanism with as little impact on performance as possible.
