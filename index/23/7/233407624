We introduce polynomial couplings, a generalization of probabilistic couplings, to develop an algorithm for the computation of equivalence relations which can be interpreted as a lifting of probabilistic bisimulation to polynomial differential equations, a ubiquitous model of dynamical systems across science and engineering. The algorithm enjoys polynomial time complexity and complements classical partition-refinement approaches because: (a) it implements a local exploration of the system, possibly yielding equivalences that do not necessarily involve the inspection of the whole system of differential equations; (b) it can be enhanced by up-to techniques; and (c) it allows the specification of pairs which ought not be included in the output. Using a prototype, these advantages are demonstrated on case studies from systems biology for applications to model reduction and comparison. Notably, we report four orders of magnitude smaller runtimes than partition-refinement approaches when disproving equivalences between Markov chains.
