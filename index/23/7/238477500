We present a novel wearable system for assisting with voluntary pinch force control that requires no devices on the fingers. We use active bio-acoustic sensing to estimate voluntary pinch force with piezo elements attached to the back of the hand and electrical muscle stimulation to the forearm to control involuntary pinch force in a closed-loop system. We conducted a user study with eight participants to investigate whether the system could assist with pinch force control under target forces of 3 N, 6 N, or 9 N. When they tried to get pinch force closer to each target force with our system, the medians of the absolute errors were 0.8 N, 1.0 N, and 2.8 N, respectively. When they tried to do it without our system, they were 0.9 N, 1.4 N, and 2.4 N, respectively.
