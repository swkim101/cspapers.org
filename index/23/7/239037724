This study presents a novel dynamic modelling method for analyzing the modal properties of a curved extensible continuum manipulator (ECM). Considering the variable bending angle and the length, the kinematic and static models are firstly established for descripting the geometric posture deformation and deflection generated by gravity. Then, the modal dynamic model is developed along the centerline direction of the ECM in the polar coordinates, by which the modal properties, include modal frequency and mode shape of curved continuum manipulator with different posture parameters are analyzed. The modal response is further analyzed based on the generalized coordinate method. Finally, the modal properties of ECM with variable posture are experimentally tested and compared with the theoretical value using the in-house developed ECM physical prototype. In the experiments, the bending, length varying and circular tracking motion are performed for the comprehensive validation of the proposed dynamics modelling method.
