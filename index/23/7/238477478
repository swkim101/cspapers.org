We present use cases for GestuRING, our web-based tool providing access to 579 gesture-to-function mappings, companion YouTube videos, and numerical gesture recordings for input with smart rings. We illustrate how practitioners can employ GestuRING for the design of gesture sets for ring-based UIs by discussing two examples: (1) enhancing a smart ring application for users with motor impairments with new functions and corresponding gesture commands, and (2) identifying a gesture set for cross-device watch-ring input.
