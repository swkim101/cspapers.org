Jumping rope is a very efficient aerobic exercise, during which the exerciser can maintain an efficient heart rate range (heart rate value to 140 âˆ¼ 160bpm). However, at present, people are unable to recognize whether they are in this ideal aerobic state in a timely and accurate manner, and there is no convenient way of showing exercisers how to perform efficient jumping rope exercises. We developed an early prototype, Rope X, an exercise device that communicates the exerciser's heart rate status through a dynamic interactive interface and gives the exerciser a certain degree of guidance, as to the correct use of the jumping rope to improve the efficiency of the jumping rope exercise (aerobic exercise).
