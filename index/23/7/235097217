BigE-retailer advertising delivers ad impressions at web scale on a daily basis driving value to both shoppers and advertisers. This scale necessitates programmatic ways of detecting unsuitable content in ads and thus, safe guarding customer experience and trust. This paper focusses on text classification models for trained in resource constraints, built as part of automated solutions for ad policy enforcement. We show how weak supervision, curriculum learning and multi-lingual training can be applied effectively to fine-tune BERT and itâ€™s variants for text classification tasks in conjunction with different data augmentation strategies. Our extensive experiments on multiple languages show that these techniques detect policy violations in advertisements with a substantial gain in precision at high recall threshold over the baseline.
