In virtual reality (VR), continuous movement often leads to users experiencing vection, or cybersickness. To circumvent vection, users are typically given the choice to use teleportation. However, teleportation leads to less spatial awareness compared to continuous movement. One approach to combating cybersickness in continuous movement is to restrict the user’s field of view (FOV). This is typically done by occluding the user’s peripheral vision with a vignette. We developed a FOV restricting continuous locomotion system that does not occlude the user’s FOV and instead uses a 3D portal to display the continuous movement in a limited area in the user’s FOV. We found that this system reduces nausea and disorientation compared to continuous locomotion. However, our system did not significantly increase spatial awareness compared to teleportation.
