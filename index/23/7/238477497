OpenNFCSense is an open-source library for NFCSense, a system for detecting the movements of near-field communication (NFC) tags using a commodity, low-cost RC522 NFC reader. With a user-defined tag profile, the users can use its application programming interface (API) to obtain the NFC tagged objectsâ€™ motion speed, motion frequency, and motion type while recognizing these tagged objects. Since NFC tags support straightforward augmentation to existed physical objects, such as modular building blocks and mechanical toys, OpenNFCSense offers an easy and safe method for rapid prototyping tangible user interfaces for designers.
