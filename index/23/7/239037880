This paper proposes an automatic and accuracy- enhanced extrinsic calibration method for 3D LiDARs with a range offset correction, which needs only an arbitrarily-shaped single planar board. One of the most exhaustive parts of existing LiDAR calibration procedures is to manually find target objects from massive point clouds. To obviate user interventions, we propose an automated planar board detection from LiDAR range images. To extract a target completely, we suppress outliers and restore rejected inliers of the target board by introducing a target completion method. We empirically find that range measurements of various LiDARs are mainly skewed by constant offset values. To compensate for this, we suggest a range offset model for each laser channel in calibration procedures. The relative pose between LiDARs and range offsets are jointly estimated by minimizing bi-directional point- to-board distances within the iterative re-weighted least squares (IRLS) framework. To verify the suggested range offset model, we obtain and analyze extensive real-world measurements. By conducting experiments using the various sensor configurations and shapes of boards, we quantitatively and qualitatively confirm accuracy and versatility of the proposed method by comparing with the state-of-the-art LiDAR calibration methods.
