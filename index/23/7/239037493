In this paper, we propose a novel bilateral teleoperation architecture that allows to optimally render the remote interaction force at the local side while guaranteeing a robustly stable behaviour. Stability is guaranteed by ensuring a proper energy exchange between the local and the remote sides. Desired performance is obtained by optimizing the way energy is exploited for generating the behaviour at each side. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is experimentally validated on a torque-controlled manipulator and in a surgical scenario, using the da VinciÂ® Research Kit (dVRK).
