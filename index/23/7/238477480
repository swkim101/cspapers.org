Reproducing the taste of food and beverages as a media technology is an emerging problem of commercial value and entertainment utility. An already developed taste reproduction system uses electrolyte containing gels controlled by electric current to reproduce taste by ion-phoresis. In this study, an alternative taste reproduction mechanism was proposed that sprays a mixture of liquids on a rolling transparent sheet placed on a screen that displays the image of the food item under consideration for reproduction of its taste.
