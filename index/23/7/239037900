Robot motion control aims to generate control inputs for a robotic system to track a planned trajectory. Feedback provided by sensors plays an essential role in motion control by improving system performance when external disturbances and/or initial errors exist. However, feedback signals, such as images are often of a large size, which imposes a heavy computational burden on the system. In this paper, a new robot motion control scheme is proposed based on compressive feedback to improve feedback rate. The controller is designed in non-vector space using compressive feedback. As an application, visual servoing is formulated under the proposed framework by considering a feedback image as a set, instead of a traditional feature vector. Experiments are conducted to validate the proposed scheme.
