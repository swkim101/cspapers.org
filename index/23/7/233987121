Research has demonstrated that users’ heuristic decision-making processes cause external factors like defaults and framing to influence the outcome of privacy decisions. Proponents of “privacy nudging” have proposed leveraging these effects to guide users’ decisions. Our research shows that defaults and framing not only influence the outcome of privacy decisions, but also the process of evaluating the contextual factors associated with the decision, effectively making the decision-making process more heuristic. In our analysis of an existing dataset of scenario-based smart home privacy decisions, we demonstrate that defaults and framing not only have a direct effect on participants’ decisions; they also moderate the effect of their cognitive appraisals of the presented scenarios on the decision. These results suggest that nudges like defaults and framing exacerbate the well-researched problem that people often employ heuristics rather than making deliberate privacy decisions, and that privacy-setting interfaces should avoid the effects of heuristic decision-making.
