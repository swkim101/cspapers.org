In this study, we propose a method for efficiently animating various characters. The main concept is to build an animation-authoring system in a virtual reality (VR) environment and allow users to move anchors of a character model with their arms. With our system, users select two anchors, which are associated with two VR controllers. The users then directly specify the three-dimensional (3D) motions of the anchors by moving the controllers. To animate various characters with multiple anchors, users can repeat this specification process multiple times. To demonstrate the feasibility of our method, we show animations designed with our system, such as a walking fox, a walking spider, and a flapping hawk.
