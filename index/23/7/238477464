Tools that support problem-solving in mathematics tend to focus on reaching a solution directly. In practice, it is common to go down paths that do not obviously lead to the solution. This part of the process should be reflected in the tools students use to help them better learn problem-solving strategies. MathMap is an application designed to help high-school students learn how to solve algebraic problems by encouraging them to use multiple strategies, maintain the history of previous attempts, and allows them to meaningfully compare methods with other students.
