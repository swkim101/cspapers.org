The fusion of music-information processing and human physical functions will enable new musical experiences to be created. We developed an interactive music system called “Deep Augmented Performers,” which provides users with the experience of conducting a musical performance. This system converts music arranged using melody morphing into electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) to control the body movements of multiple performers. The melodies used in the system are divided into segments, and each segment has multiple variations of melodies. The user can interactively control the performers, thus the actual performance.
