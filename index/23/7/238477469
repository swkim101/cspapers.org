The traditional perforated boneless lantern craft is a three-dimensional (3D) lamp fabrication method in which paper sheets are folded without any skeleton, and often accompanied by hole-like patterns. It has been extensively applied throughout history using various means and is favored because of its low cost and environmental friendliness. However, the traditional craft requires a complicated manual production process and accumulated craft expertise, which limits its aesthetics and daily use-value. We propose a computer-aided design method to customize a 3D lamp with decorative patterns from paper pieces. The key idea is to establish an automatic workflow for producing 3D objects with visual information that is similar to the lantern tradition but without overloaded manual efforts. Our user tests and results demonstrate the potential for DIY everyday interfaces for creating personalized aesthetics, enhancing the visualization of information, and promoting multi-person handicraft activity.
