Autonomous inspection of powerlines with quadrotors is challenging. Flights require persistent perception to keep a close look at the lines. We propose a method that uses event cameras to robustly track powerlines. Event cameras are inherently robust to motion blur, have low latency, and high dynamic range. Such properties are advantageous for autonomous inspection of powerlines with drones, where fast motions and challenging illumination conditions are ordinary. Our method identifies lines in the stream of events by detecting planes in the spatio-temporal signal, and tracks them through time. The implementation runs onboard and is capable of detecting multiple distinct lines in real time with rates of up to 320 thousand events per second. The performance is evaluated in real-world flights along a powerline. The tracker is able to persistently track the powerlines, with a mean lifetime of the line 10Ã— longer than existing approaches.
