Previous motor learning systems rely on a vision-based workflow both from feed-forward and feedback process, which limits the application requirement and scenario. In this demo, we presented a novel cross-modal motor learning system named VoLearn. The novice is able to interact with desired motion through a virtual 3D interface and obtain the audio feedback based on a personal smartphone. Both interactivity and user-accessibility of the designed system contribute to a wider range of applications and reduce the limitations in the applied space as well.
