Despite the significant progress made by deep learning in natural image matting, there has been so far no representative work on deep learning for video matting due to the inherent technical challenges in reasoning temporal domain and lack of large-scale video matting datasets. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based video matting framework which employs a novel and effective spatio-temporal feature aggregation module (ST-FAM). As optical flow estimation can be very unreliable within matting regions, ST-FAM is designed to effectively align and aggregate information across different spatial scales and temporal frames within the network decoder. To eliminate frame-by-frame trimap annotations, a lightweight interactive trimap propagation network is also introduced. The other contribution consists of a large-scale video matting dataset with groundtruth alpha mattes for quantitative evaluation and real-world high-resolution videos with trimaps for qualitative evaluation. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our framework significantly outperforms conventional video matting and deep image matting methods applied to video in presence of multi-frame temporal information.
