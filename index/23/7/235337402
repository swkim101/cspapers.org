The number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) (hereinafter referred to as drone) is rising in both, private and commercial applications. This makes it necessary that a drone remains under full control of the owner at any time. Most drones are controlled wirelessly by protocols in the 2.4 GHz band. The most commonly used protocols are DSMX (Spektrum), ACCST D16 EU-LBT (FrSky), DEVO (Walkera) and S-FHSS (Futaba). While it has been known that the DSMX protocol is vulnerable to attacks, the security of the other protocols was an open question. In this paper, we give a negative answer: all these protocols are insecure as well. More precisely, we show that it is practically possible to seize control over the drone in all cases. All presented attacks were implemented and validated under real conditions.
