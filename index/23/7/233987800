We present a computational approach to haptic design embedded in everyday tangible interaction with digital fabrication. To generate haptic feedback, the use of permanent magnets as the mechanism potentially contributes to simpleness and robustness; however, it is difficult to manually design how magnets should be embedded in the objects. Our approach enables the inverse design of magnetic force feedback; that is, we computationally solve an inverse problem to obtain an optimal arrangement of permanent magnets that renders the user-specified haptic sensation. To solve the inverse problem in a practical manner, we also present techniques on magnetic simulation and optimization. We demonstrate applications to explore the design possibility of augmenting digital fabrication for everyday use.
