In this demonstration, we showcase FabHydro [6], a set of rapid and low-cost techniques to prototype interactive hydraulic devices using off-the-shelf SLA 3D printers and flexible photosensitive resin. We introduce two printing processes to seal the transmission fluid: the Submerged Printing process seals liquid resin inside the printed objects without assembly, and the Printing with Plug method which allows using variety of transmission fluid with no modification to the printer. We showcase how a range of relevant 3D printable primitives, including hydraulic generator, transmitter, and actuator can be printed and combined to create interactive examples.
