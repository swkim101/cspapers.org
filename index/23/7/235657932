Since its inception in 2015, Style Transfer has focused on texturing a content image using an art exemplar. Recently, the geometric changes that artists make have been acknowledged as an important component of style[42], [55], [62], [63]. Our contribution is to propose a neural network that, uniquely, learns a mapping from a 4D array of inter-feature distances to a non-parametric 2D warp field. The system is generic in not being limited by semantic class, a single learned model will suffice; all examples in this paper are output from one model.Our approach combines the benefits of the high speed of Liu et al. [42] with the non-parametric warping of Kim et al. [55]. Furthermore, our system extends the normal NST paradigm: although it can be used with a single exemplar, we also allow two style exemplars: one for texture and another geometry. This supports far greater flexibility in use cases than single exemplars can provide.
