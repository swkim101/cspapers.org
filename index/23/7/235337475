Honeywords are false passwords injected in a database for detecting password leakage. Generating honeywords is a challenging problem due to the various assumptions about the adversary's knowledge as well as users' password-selection behaviour. The success of a Honeywords Generation Technique (HGT) lies on the resulting honeywords; the method fails if an adversary can easily distinguish the real password. In this paper, we propose HoneyGen, a practical and highly robust HGT that produces realistic looking honeywords. We do this by leveraging representation learning techniques to learn useful and explanatory representations from a massive collection of unstructured data, i.e., each operator's password database. We perform both a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our framework using the state-of-the-art metrics. Our results suggest that HoneyGen generates high-quality honeywords that cause sophisticated attackers to achieve low distinguishing success rates.
