We prove that there exists an absolute constant 6 > 0 such any binary code <tex>$C$</tex> ⊂ {0, 1}<sup>N</sup> tolerating (1/2 - δ) <tex>$N$</tex> adversarial deletions must satisfy| C| ≤ 2<sup>polylog</sup><tex>$N$</tex> and thus have rate asymptotically approaching 0. This is the first constant fraction improvement over the trivial bound that codes tolerating <tex>$N$</tex> /2 adversarial deletions must have rate going to 0 asymptotically. Equivalently, we show that there exists absolute constants <tex>$A$</tex> and 6 > 0 such that any set <tex>$C$</tex> ⊂ {0, 1} of 2<sup>log</sup><sup>A</sup> N binary strings must contain two strings <tex>$c$</tex> and c’ whose longest common subsequence has length at least (1/2 + δ) N. As an immediate corollary, we show that q-ary codes tolerating a fraction 1 - (1 + 2δ) / <tex>$q$</tex> of adversarial deletions must also have rate approaching 0. Our techniques include string regularity arguments and a structural lemma that classifies binary strings by their oscillation patterns. Leveraging these tools, we find in any large code two strings with similar oscillation patterns, which is exploited to find a long common subsequence.
