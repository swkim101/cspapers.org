We present an open source tool which provides commonly required functionality in HCI experimental research targeted at Immersive technologies. Using the tool, researchers can monitor and control a Unity scene from a controller panel running in the web-browser. Researchers can also use the tool to track the user status (e.g. see what the user sees) and trigger the execution of remote functions (e.g. alter the Unity Scene, the objects appearing, etc.). Moreover, we show a use case to exemplify how the tool is being used to support our research regarding Immersive Multisensory Interaction in a room-sized environment.
