We present Eloquent, an exploration of new interaction techniques for text editing on mobile. Our prototype combines techniques for targeting, selection, and command menus. We demonstrate preliminary results in the form of a text editor, whose design was informed by feedback from users of existing systems. With Eloquent, selecting and acting on text can be done with a single gesture for both novice and expert users.
