Robot teleoperation is a reliable way to perform a variety of tasks with complex robotic systems. However, the remote control of active telepresence cameras on the robot for improved telepresence adds an additional degree of complexity while teleoperating and can thus affect the operatorâ€™s performance during tele-manipulation. Our previous user study investigates the general human performance and preference when using various wearable cameras. In this paper, we further investigate how humans respond to the usage of telepresence cameras in terms of motion behavior. The findings from our human motion analysis inform several desired designs for robot teleoperation interfaces and assistive autonomy.
