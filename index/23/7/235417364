Unsupervised object re-identification targets at learning discriminative representations for object retrieval without any annotations. Clustering-based methods [27], [46], [10] conduct training with the generated pseudo labels and currently dominate this research direction. However, they still suffer from the issue of pseudo label noise. To tackle the challenge, we propose to properly estimate pseudo label similarities between consecutive training generations with clustering consensus and refine pseudo labels with temporally propagated and ensembled pseudo labels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to leverage the spirit of temporal ensembling [25] to improve classification with dynamically changing classes over generations. The proposed pseudo label refinery strategy is simple yet effective and can be seamlessly integrated into existing clustering-based unsupervised re-identification methods. With our proposed approach, state-of-the-art method [10] can be further boosted with up to 8.8% mAP improvements on the challenging MSMT17 [39] dataset.
