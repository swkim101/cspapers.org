RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) is a hardware feature introduced by Intel to facilitate power management. Even though RAPL and its supporting software interfaces can benefit power management significantly, they are unfortunately designed without taking certain security issues into careful consideration. In this paper, we demonstrate that information leaked through RAPL-induced side channels can be exploited to mount realistic attacks. Specifically, we have constructed a new RAPL-based covert channel using a single AVX instruction, which can exfiltrate data across different boundaries (e.g., those established by containers in software or even CPUs in hardware); and, we have investigated the first RAPL-based website fingerprinting technique that can identify visited webpages with a high accuracy (up to 99% in the case of the regular network using a browser like Chrome or Safari, and up to 81% in the case of the anonymity network using Tor). These two studies form a preliminary examination into RAPL-imposed security implications. In addition, we discuss some possible countermeasures.
