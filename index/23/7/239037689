This paper contributes a method designed to enable autonomous distributed 3D nuclear radiation field mapping. The algorithm uses a single radiation sensor and a sequence of spatially distributed and robotically acquired radiation measurements across a discretized 3D grid to derive a radiation gradient. The derived gradient is probabilistically propagated to unknown components of the map to further guide a curiosity-driven path planner by identifying the next most radiologically informative point given available information. To demonstrate the method, we develop a resilient micro flying robot capable of autonomous GPS-denied navigation that integrates a Thallium–doped Cesium Iodide (CsI(Tl)) scintillator and Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPm) combined with custom–built pulse counting circuitry. A set of experimental studies is presented inside an indoor facility within which actual radioactive uranium ore sources have been distributed.
