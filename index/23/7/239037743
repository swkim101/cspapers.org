Jumping with controllable elevation is significant for insect-scale robots to improve terrain adaptability and to escape from risks. However, jumping robots based on soft materials with low stiffness cannot transmit displacement precisely, exhibiting poor control of jumping. Here, we propose a modified two-bars catapult mechanism combined with an asynchronous sequential releasing strategy to realize elevation controllable jumping. In this work, an 80 mg prototype robot, 56 (long) × 29 mm (wide) × 3 mm (high) mm in size, is designed with the controllable elevation range from 63° to 112°. The soft robot is mainly composed of a shape memory alloy actuator and four electrostatic pads acting as the lock/release structures. Elevation control is realized by asynchronously releasing the electrostatic pads in a small time interval (about 10 ms). A maximum jump height of 62 mm and a maximum half-distance of 41 mm are also achieved.
