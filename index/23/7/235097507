Given the diversity of the candidates and complexity of job requirements, and since interviewing is an inherently subjective process, it is an important task to ensure consistent, uniform, efficient and objective interviews that result in high quality recruitment. We propose an interview assistant system to automatically, and in an objective manner, select an optimal set of technical questions (from question banks) personalized for a candidate. This set can help a human interviewer to plan for an upcoming interview of that candidate. We formalize the problem of selecting a set of questions as an integer linear programming problem and use standard solvers to get a solution. We use knowledge graph as background knowledge in this formulation, and derive our objective functions and constraints from it. We use candidateâ€™s resume to personalize the selection of questions. We propose an intrinsic evaluation to compare a set of suggested questions with actually asked questions. We also use expert interviewers to comparatively evaluate our approach with a set of reasonable baselines.
