The spread of personal computer-aided fabrication has made it possible for individuals to create things that meet their personal needs. However, it is still not easy for an individual to prototype electronic circuits. Several methods have been proposed for quickly prototyping electronic circuits. Our solution is combining a 3D printer with transfer foil. This paper expands our original circuit printing method so as to fabricate single-sided multi-layer boards. We show that the proposed technique allows a 3D printer and two types of transfer foil to create single-sided multi-layer circuits.
