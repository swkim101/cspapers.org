In modern web ecosystem, online businesses often leverage third-party web analytics services to gain insights into the behavior of their users. Due to the recent privacy enhancements in major browsers that restrict third-party cookie usage for tracking, these businesses were urged to disguise third-party analytics infrastructure as regular subdomains of their websites [3]. The integration technique referred to as CNAME cloaking allows the businesses to continue monitoring user activity on their websites. However, it also opens up the possibility for severe security infractions as the businesses often share their session cookies with the analytics providers, thus putting online user accounts in danger. Previous work has raised privacy concerns with regards to subdomain tracking and extensively studied the drawbacks of widely used privacy-enhancing browser extensions. In this work, we demonstrate the impact of deploying CNAME cloaking along with lax cookie access control settings on web user security. To this end, we built a system that automatically detects the presence of the disguised third-party domains as well as the leakage of the first-party cookies. Using our system, we identified 2,139 web analytics domains that can be conveniently added to commonly deployed hostbased blacklists. Concerningly, we also found that 27 out of 90 highly sensitive web services (e.g., banks) that we analyzed expose session cookies to the web analytics services.
