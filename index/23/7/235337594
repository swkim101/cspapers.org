Particle simulations of plasma are important for understanding plasma dynamics in space weather and fusion devices. However, production simulations that use billions and even trillions of computational particles require high memory capacity. In this work, we explore the latest persistent memory (PM) hardware to enable large-scale plasma simulations at unprecedented scales on a single machine. We use WarpX, an advanced plasma simulation code which is mission-critical and targets future exascale systems. We analyze the performance of WarpX on PM-based heterogeneous memory systems and propose to make the best use of memory hierarchy to avoid the impact of inferior performance of PM. We introduce a combination of static and dynamic data placement, and processor-cache prefetch mechanism for performance optimization. We develop a performance model to enable efficient data migration between PM and DRAM in the background, without reducing available bandwidth and parallelism to the application threads. We also build an analytical model to decide when to prefetch for the best use of caches. Our design achieves 66.4% performance improvement over the PM-only baseline and outperforms DRAM-cached, NUMA first-touch, and a state-of-the-art software solution by 38.8%, 45.1% and 83.3%, respectively.
