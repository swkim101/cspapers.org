In this paper, we focus on the problem of learning online an optimal policy for Active Visual Search (AVS) of objects in unknown indoor environments. We propose POMP++, a planning strategy that introduces a novel formulation on top of the classic Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) framework, to allow training-free online policy learning in unknown environments. We present a new belief reinvigoration strategy that enables the use of POMCP with a dynamically growing state space to address the online generation of the floor map. We evaluate our method on two public benchmark datasets, AVD that is acquired by real robotic platforms and Habitat ObjectNav that is rendered from real 3D scene scans, achieving the best success rate with an improvement of >10% over the state-of-the-art methods.
