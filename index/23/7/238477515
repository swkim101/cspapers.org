A large, generative language model’s output can be influenced through well-designed prompts, or text-based inputs that establish textual patterns that the model replicates in its output [6]. These capabilities create new opportunities for novel interactions with large, generative language models. We present a macro system with two tools that allow users to invoke language model prompts as macros in a code editor. GenLine allows users to execute macros inline as they write code in the editor (e.g., “Make an OK button” produces the equivalent HTML). GenForm provides a form-like interface where the user provides input that is then transformed into multiple pieces of output at the same time (e.g., a description of web code is transformed into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
