Electrodermal activity data is widely used in HCI to capture rich and unbiased signals. Results from related fields, however, have suggested several methodological issues that can arise when practices do not follow established standards. In this paper, we present a systematic methodological review of CHI papers involving the use of EDA data according to best practices from the field of psychophysiology, where standards are well-established and mature. We found severe issues in our sample at all stages of the research process. To ensure the validity of future research, we highlight pitfalls and offer directions for how to improve community standards.
