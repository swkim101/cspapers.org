EMG-driven musculoskeletal model has been broadly used to detect human intention in rehabilitation robots. This approach computes muscle-tendon force and translates it to the joint kinematics. However, the muscle-tendon parameters of the musculoskeletal model are difficult to measure in vivo and varied across subjects. In this study, a direct collocation (DC) method is proposed to optimize the subject-specific parameters in a wrist musculoskeletal model. The resultant optimized parameters are used to estimate the wrist flexion/extension motion. The estimation performance is compared with the parameters optimized by the genetic algorithm. Experiment results show that the DC methods have a similar performance compared with GA, in which the mean correlation are 0.96 and 0.93 for the genetic algorithm and DC method respectively. But the direction collocation method requires less optimization time.
