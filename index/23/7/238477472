1 PROBLEM Currently, we use a multitude of computing environments in our daily lives, and these devices are increasingly becoming an essential part of our everyday lives [7, 10]. For example, someone might start the day by reviewing notifcations on a smartwatch, move to browsing the news and quickly responding to emails during breakfast on a smartphone, and then using a laptop and digital whiteboard during work hours to send emails and facilitate meetings. Sometimes, even multiple computing environments are used in parallel to fulfll a task — Waeljas et al. describe these are multi-channeled and crossmedia service experiences [12]. However, because existing software programs are seldom able to provide a seamless experience across multiple devices, users are forced to “act as the bridge connecting their devices” [4]. This bridging creates additional burdens on users, which have been found to increase cognitive load [4]. Additionally, even on the same screen, we use variable viewport sizes to run multiple software applications. These phenomena are more and more observable on handheld devices as well. In digital product design, the use of multiple devices and multiple software is even more augmented as a wide variety of stakeholders with diferent cultural backgrounds and tool preferences need to work together in order to efciently deliver scalable and secure digital solutions to billions of customers. Until now, there has yet to be a uniform visualization technique that can serve as a main metaphor for user interfaces across a wide variety of screen sizes and shapes to access information. Such a uniform solution would allow a user to interact with displayed information in a fully consistent way from
