We present an actor-critic framework to induce subtopical structures in a news article for news discourse proﬁling. The model uses multiple critics that act according to known subtopic structures while the actor aims to outperform them. The content structures constitute sentences that represent latent subtopic bound-aries. Then, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that uses the identiﬁed subtopic boundary sentences to model multi-level interaction between sentences, subtopics, and the document. Experimental results and analyses on the NewsDiscourse corpus show that the actor model learns to effectively segment a document into subtopics and improves the performance of the hierarchical model on the news discourse proﬁling task 1 . runs with random seeds. In addition, we report standard deviation for both macro and micro F1 scores. Statistical signiﬁcance tests show that both the macro and micro F1 scores for RL-IP/TT model are signiﬁcantly better compared to the hierarchical, self-critic, TextTiling and joint-IP models with p < 0.05 on paired t test (Dietterich, 1998). Similarly, the macro F1 scores for RL-TT and RL-IP models are signiﬁcantly better compared to the hierarchical, TextTiling and Joint-IP models with p < 0.05.
