The problem of safe interception of multiple intruder UAVs by a team of cooperating autonomous aerial vehicles is addressed in this paper. The presented work is motivated by the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) 2020 where this task was simplified to an interaction with a set of static and dynamic objects (balloons and a UAV), and by a real autonomous aerial interception system of Eagle.One that our team has been working on. We propose a general control, perception, and coordination system for the fast and reliable interception of targets in a 3D environment relying only on onboard sensors and processing. The proposed methods and the entire complex multi-robot system were successfully verified in demanding desert conditions, with the main focus on reliability and fast deployment. In the MBZIRC competition, the proposed approach exhibited the greatest reliability and fastest solution. It was crucial to our team in winning the entire competition and achieving the second place in the intruder UAV interception scenario.
