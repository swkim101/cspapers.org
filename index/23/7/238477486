We present IntoTheVideos, a novel system that takes a sports video and reconstructs the 3D space (e.g., basketball court, football field) along with the highlighted event (e.g., making a basket, scoring a touchdown) to enable viewers to experience the sports entertainment with more freedom. Users can move around in the reconstructed 3D space and explore the event freely from different angles and distances as well as view the players in 3D. With this system, we hope to offer users a new option to enjoy sports entertainment beyond passively watching video footage potentially leading to more active fan engagement and participation.
