—Residential proxy has emerged as a service gaining popularity recently, in which proxy providers relay their customers’ network trafﬁc through millions of proxy peers under their control. We ﬁnd that many of these proxy peers are mobile devices, whose role in the proxy network can have signiﬁcant security implications since mobile devices tend to be privacy-and resource-sensitive. However, little effort has been made so far to understand the extent of their involvement, not to mention how these devices are recruited by the proxy network and what security and privacy risks they may pose. In this paper, we report the ﬁrst measurement study on the mobile proxy ecosystem. Our study was made possible by a novel measurement infrastructure, which enabled us to identify proxy providers, to discover proxy SDKs (software development kits), to detect Android proxy apps built upon the proxy SDKs, to harvest proxy IP addresses, and to understand proxy trafﬁc. The information collected through this infrastructure has brought to us new understandings of this ecosystem and important security discoveries. More speciﬁcally, 4 proxy providers were found to offer app developers mobile proxy SDKs as a competitive app monetization channel, with $50K per month per 1M MAU (monthly active users). 1,701 Android APKs (belonging to 963 Android apps) turn out to have integrated those proxy SDKs, with most of them available on Google Play with at least 300M installations in total. Furthermore, 48.43% of these APKs are ﬂagged by at least 5 anti-virus engines as malicious, which could explain why 86.60% of the 963 Android apps have been removed from Google Play by Oct 2019. Besides, while these apps display user consent dialogs on trafﬁc relay, our user study indicates that the
