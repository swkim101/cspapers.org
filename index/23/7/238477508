Bodily play, which is a productive social interaction for bonding social relationships, has positive impacts on self-efficacy, acute cognitive benefit, and emotion. However, most bodily play encourages players to enjoy their own experiences. There are limited researches on sharing players' perspectives to enhance players' empathy for understanding others. Thus, we propose an asymmetric two-person game in an immersive environment. This bodily play, which supports perspective-taking via the integration with the first- and second-perspectives, has a collaborative interface that allows users to share their physiological and emotional perspectives. Initial testing of the system shows that players can not only understand well the feeling and problems encountered by each other through sharing perspectives and information but also increases the social closeness of players and stimulates empathy after the interplay.
