Established user-centered evaluation methods for interactive systems are time-consuming and expensive. Crowd-feedback systems provide a quick and cheap solution to collect large amounts of meaningful feedback from users. However, existing crowd-feedback systems for evaluating interactive systems lack interactivity and a seamless integration into the developed artifact. This might have negative effects on user engagement as well as feedback quality and quantity. In this work, we present ”Feeasy”, an interactive crowd-feedback system with five key design features that are motivated by a qualitative pilot study. Feeasy extends existing crowd-feedback systems for interactive designs by offering more interaction and combining the feedback panel and the interactive system in one user interface. Thereby, it provides users a more seamless way to contribute feedback.
