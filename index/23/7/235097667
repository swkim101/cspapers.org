Although there are many studies on neural language generation (NLG), few trials are put into the real world, especially in the advertising domain. Generating ads with NLG models can help copywriters in their creation. However, few studies have adequately evaluated the effect of generated ads with actual serving included because it requires a large amount of training data and a particular environment. In this paper, we demonstrate a practical use case of generating ad-text with an NLG model. Specially, we show how to improve the adsâ€™ impact, deploy models to a product, and evaluate the generated ads.
