We describe a simple pre-training approach for point clouds. It works in three steps: 1. Mask all points occluded in a camera view; 2. Learn an encoder-decoder model to reconstruct the occluded points; 3. Use the encoder weights as initialisation for downstream point cloud tasks. We find that even when we pre-train on a single dataset (ModelNet40), this method improves accuracy across different datasets and encoders, on a wide range of downstream tasks. Specifically, we show that our method outperforms previous pre-training methods in object classification, and both part-based and semantic segmentation tasks. We study the pre-trained features and find that they lead to wide downstream minima, have high transformation invariance, and have activations that are highly correlated with part labels.
