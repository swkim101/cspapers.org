Multi-agent Path Finding (MAPF) deals with finding collision-free paths for a set of agents on a graph, where each agent has its origin and destination. Colored MAPF is a generalization of MAPF, where groups of agents are moving, and the set of destination nodes is specified per group rather than per agent. OzoMorph is software providing an intuitive user interface for specifying Colored MAPF problems, solving them by translation to SAT, and finally visualizing the solution either in a computer simulation or by converting the plans to executable instructions for Ozobot Evo robots.
