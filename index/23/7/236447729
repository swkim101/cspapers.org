Image enhancement is a subjective process whose targets vary with user preferences. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based image enhancement method covering multiple tonal styles using only a single model dubbed StarEnhancer. It can transform an image from one tonal style to another, even if that style is unseen. With a simple one-time setting, users can customize the model to make the enhanced images more in line with their aesthetics. To make the method more practical, we propose a well-designed enhancer that can process a 4K-resolution image over 200 FPS but surpasses the contemporaneous single style image enhancement methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Finally, our proposed enhancement method has good inter-actability, which allows the user to fine-tune the enhanced image using intuitive options.
