In this paper, we proposed an autonomous robotic flexible endoscope system for the laparoscopic bariatric surgery (LBS). This system comprises a UR5 robot and a flexible endoscope equipped with a novel continuum joint, named reinforced double helix continuum mechanism. Compared with the simple helix structure, the compressional and torsional stiffness of the proposed joint are improved significantly. To automate the robotic flexible endoscope, image-based visual servoing technique is employed. A deep learning algorithm named TernausNet-16 is improved and incorporated into the control framework to detect surgical instruments inside the camera view. The experimental studies verified the effectiveness and feasibility of the robotic flexible endoscope system for the visual serviong control scheme assisted by deep learning methods.
