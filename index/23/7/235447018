We propose TUTA, a unified pre-training architecture for understanding generally structured tables. Noticing that understanding a table requires spatial, hierarchical, and semantic information, we enhance transformers with three novel structure-aware mechanisms. First, we devise a unified tree-based structure, called a bi-dimensional coordinate tree, to describe both the spatial and hierarchical information of generally structured tables. Upon this, we propose tree-based attention and position embedding to better capture the spatial and hierarchical information. Moreover, we devise three progressive pre-training objectives to enable representations at the token, cell, and table levels. We pre-train TUTA on a wide range of unlabeled web and spreadsheet tables and fine-tune it on two critical tasks in the field of table structure understanding: cell type classification and table type classification. Experiments show that TUTA is highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art on five widely-studied datasets.
