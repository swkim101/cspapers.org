Drones are rapidly populating human spaces, yet little is known about how these flying robots are perceived and understood by humans. Recent works suggested that their acceptance is predicated upon their sociability. This paper explores the use of facial expressions to represent emotions on social drones. We leveraged design practices from ground robotics and created a set of rendered robotic faces that convey basic emotions. We evaluated individualsâ€™ response to these emotional facial expressions on drones in two empirical studies (N = 98, N = 98). Our results demonstrate that individuals accurately recognize five drone emotional expressions, as well as make sense of intensities within emotion categories. We describe how participants were emotionally affected by the drone, showed empathy towards it, and created narratives to interpret its emotions. As a consequence, we formulate design recommendations for social drones and discuss methodological insights on the use of static versus dynamic stimuli in affective robotics studies.
