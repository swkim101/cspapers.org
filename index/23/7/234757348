The majority of existing few-shot learning methods describe image relations with binary labels. However, such binary relations are insufficient to teach the network complicated real-world relations, due to the lack of decision smoothness. Furthermore, current few-shot learning models capture only the similarity via relation labels, but they are not exposed to class concepts associated with objects, which is likely detrimental to the classification performance due to underutilization of the available class labels. For instance, children learn the concept of tiger from a few of actual examples as well as from comparisons of tiger to other animals. Thus, we hypothesize that both similarity and class concept learning must be occurring simultaneously. With these observations at hand, we study the fundamental problem of simplistic class modeling in current few-shot learning methods. We rethink the relations between class concepts, and propose a novel Absolute-relative Learning paradigm to fully take advantage of label information to refine the image an relation representations in both supervised and unsupervised scenarios. Our proposed paradigm improves the performance of several state-of-the-art models on publicly available datasets.
