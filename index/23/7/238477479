We hypothesized that the act of actively moving one’s body to see the hidden parts of a sphere, cube, or any other structure with height and sides would be entertaining. In this paper, we propose a novel portable game device with omnidirectional display called “UPLIGHT,” which was created by combining the element of entertainment with the play style of a portable game device. We also describe the design of a prototype and a playable game application that we developed to achieve this interaction.
