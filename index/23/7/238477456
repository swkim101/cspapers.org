Live music provides a more immersive and social experience that recorded music cannot replicate. In a live music setting, listeners perceive sounds differently based on their position with respect to the musicians and can enjoy the experience with others. To make recorded music a dynamic listening experience, we propose and implement an app that adds a spatial dimension to music using augmented reality to allow users to listen to a song as if it were played live. The app lets users place virtual instruments around a physical space and plays the instrument track for each instrument. Users can move around in the space and change the importance of various sound localization aspects to customize their experience. Finally, users can record and livestream to share their listening experience with others.
