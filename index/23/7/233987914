This paper presents NFCSense, a data-defined rich-ID motion sensing technique for fluent tangible interaction design by using commodity near-field communication (NFC) tags and a single NFC tag reader. An NFC reader can reliably recognize the presence of an NFC tag at a high read rate (∼ 300 reads/s) with low latency, but such high-speed reading has rarely been exploited because the reader may not effectively resolve collisions of multiple tags. Therefore, its human–computer interface applications have been typically limited to a discrete, hands-on interaction style using one tag at a time. In this work, we realized fluent, hands-off, and multi-tag tangible interactions by leveraging gravity and anti-collision physical constraints, which support effortless user input and maximize throughput. Furthermore, our system provides hot-swappable interactivity that enables smooth transitions throughout extended use. Based on the design parameters explored through a series of studies, we present a design space with proof-of-concept implementations in various applications.
