Text input is essential in a variety of uses in virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR). We present HMK: an effective text input method that mounts split keyboards on the left and right side of the head mounted display (HMD). Users who can touch-type are able to type using HMK by relying on their familiarity with the normal QWERTY keyboard. We develop custom keycaps to make it easier to find the home position. A study with three participants shows that users retain most of their normal keyboard typing skills. The participants achieved, on average, 34.7 words per minute (WPM) by the end of three days of use, retaining 81 percent of their regular entry speed.
