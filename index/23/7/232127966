Recent years have witnessed the rapid deployments of wireless mesh networks (WMNs) for industrial automation, military operations, smart energy, etc. Although WMNs work satisfactorily most of the time thanks to years of research, they are often difﬁcult to conﬁgure as conﬁguring a WMN is a complex process, which involves theoretical computation, simulation, and ﬁeld testing, among other tasks. Simulating a WMN provides distinct advantages over experimenting on a physical network when it comes to identifying a good network conﬁguration. Unfortunately, our study shows that the models for network conﬁguration prediction learned from simulations cannot always help physical networks meet performance requirements because of the simulation-to-reality gap. In this paper, we employ deep learning based domain adaptation to close the gap and leverage a teacher-student neural network to transfer the network conﬁguration knowledge learned from a simulated network to its corresponding physical network. Experimental results show that our method effectively closes the gap and increases the accuracy of predicting a good network conﬁguration that allows the network to meet performance requirements from 30.10% to 70.24% by learning robust machine learning models from a large amount of inexpensive simulation data and a few costly ﬁeld testing measurements.
