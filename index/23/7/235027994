Abctract. Math learning is growing as the times evolve. More and more media is used to enhance student learning motivation. This assessment aims to create a math learning design that can increase the motivation of learning students through Math card matchmaking (Mak Karjo) in high school students. As for the use is a descriptive method and the post facto method ex. The descriptive method used is with the development of pre-existing research results. While the method ex post facto, that is to assess the use of Media card soul mate in improving the motivation to learn high school students. Mak Karjo is the length of mathematics with a matchcard, so the media used is the media of a soul mate filled with sin, cos, and tan. Results show that the application of Mak Karjo in trigonometric learning motivates students in learning because learning is designed in such a way that it can create a pleasant learning atmosphere.
