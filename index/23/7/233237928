The quality of Wikipedia articles is manually evaluated which is time inefficient as well as susceptible to human bias. An automated assessment of these articles may help in minimizing the overall time and manual errors. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on the structural analysis of Wikigraph to automate the estimation of the quality of Wikipedia articles. We examine the network built using the complete set of English Wikipedia articles and identify the variation of network signatures of the articles with respect to their quality. Our study shows that these signatures are useful for estimating the quality grades of un-assessed articles with an accuracy surpassing the existing approaches in this direction. The results of the study may help in reducing the need for human involvement for quality assessment tasks.
