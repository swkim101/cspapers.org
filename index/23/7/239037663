Recent works on semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) utilizing object landmarks have shown superiority in terms of robustness and accuracy in tracking and localization. 3D object landmarks represented by a cubic or quadric surface are inferred from 2D object bounding boxes which are typically captured from multiple views by an object detector. Nevertheless, bounding box noises and small camera baseline may lead to an inaccurate 3D object landmark inference. Inspired by the dual quadric enveloping property, in this work, we introduce the horizontal support assumption to constrain rotation w.r.t. roll and pitch for a quadric representation. As the result, we reduce the number of quadric parameters and narrow down the solution space, and ultimately produce a relatively accurate inference. Extensive experimental evaluations under both simulated and real scenarios are conducted in this paper. Quantitative results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art.
