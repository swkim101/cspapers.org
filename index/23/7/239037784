Safety integration components for robotic applications are a mandatory feature for any autonomous mobile application, including human avoidance behaviors. This paper proposes a novel parametrizable scene risk evaluator for open-field applications that use humans motion predictions and pre-defined hazard zones to estimate a braking factor. Parameters optimization uses simulated data. The evaluation is carried out by simulated and real-time scenarios, showing the impact of human predictions in favor of risk reductions on agricultural applications.
