JetController is a novel haptic technology capable of supporting high-speed and persistent 3-DoF ungrounded force feedback. It uses high-speed pneumatic solenoid valves to modulate compressed air to achieve 20-50Hz of full impulses at 4.0-1.0N, and combines multiple air propulsion jets to generate 3-DoF force feedback. Compared to propeller-based approaches, JetController supports 10-30 times faster impulse frequency, and its handheld device is significantly lighter and more compact. JetController supports a wide range of haptic events in games and VR experiences, from firing automatic weapons in games like Halo (15Hz) to slicing fruits in Fruit Ninja (up to 45Hz). To evaluate JetController, we integrated our prototype with two popular VR games, Half-life: Alyx and Beat Saber, to support a variety of 3D interactions. Study results showed that JetController significantly improved realism, enjoyment, and overall experience compared to commercial vibrating controllers, and was preferred by most participants.
