In few-shot domain adaptation (FDA), classiﬁers for the target domain are trained with accessible labeled data in the source domain (SD) and few labeled data in the target domain (TD). However, data usually contain private information in the current era, e.g., data distributed on personal phones. Thus, the private data will be leaked if we directly access data in SD to train a target-domain classiﬁer (required by FDA methods). In this paper, to prevent privacy leakage in SD, we consider a very challenging problem setting, where the classiﬁer for the TD has to be trained using few labeled target data and a well-trained SD classiﬁer, named few-shot hypothesis adaptation (FHA). In FHA, we cannot access data in SD, as a result, the private information in SD will be protected well. To this end, we propose a target-oriented hypothesis adaptation network (TOHAN) to solve the FHA problem, where we generate highly-compatible unlabeled data (i.e., an intermediate domain) to help train a target-domain classiﬁer. TOHAN maintains two deep networks simultaneously, in which one focuses on learning an intermediate domain and the other takes care of the intermediate-to-target distributional adaptation and the target-risk minimization. Experimental results show that TOHAN outperforms competitive baselines signiﬁcantly.
