Learning from noisy data has attracted much attention, where most methods focus on label noise. In this work, we propose a new learning framework which simultaneously addresses three types of noise commonly seen in real-world data: label noise, out-of-distribution input, and input corruption. In contrast to most existing methods, we combat noise by learning robust representation. Specifically, we embed images into a low-dimensional subspace, and regularize the geometric structure of the subspace with robust contrastive learning, which includes an unsupervised consistency loss and a supervised mixup prototypical loss. We also propose a new noise cleaning method which leverages the learned representation to enforce a smoothness constraint on neighboring samples. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our method and robustness of the learned representation. Code is available at https://github.com/salesforce/RRL/.
