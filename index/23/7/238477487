Generative design tools afford designers new ways of creating complex objects from 3D models to machine knittable textures. However, implementing the optimization algorithms that make generative design possible requires the rare combination of programming and domain expertise. I present the Generative Interactive Synthesis Toolkit (GIST) to simplify the implementation of generative design tools in novel domains. GIST factors common optimization algorithms into elements of an extensible library and structures optimization tasks around objectives and tactics specified by domain experts in a simple GUI. This moves the burden of domain expertise from programmers to domain experts. I demonstrate GIST in three unique domains: machine knitting, cookie recipes, and tactile maps for blind users. These show the versatility of GISTâ€™s structure.
