Medical making intersects opposing value systems of a medical “do no harm” ethos and makers’ drive to innovate. Since March 2020, online maker communities have formed to design, manufacture, and distribute personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical devices needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. We present a participant observation study of 14 maker communities, which have developed differing driving principles for efforts with varied access to interdisciplinary expertise on online platforms that mutually shape collective action. Over time, these communities unintentionally align towards action-oriented or regulated practices because they often lack higher level insight and agency in choosing communication platforms. In response, we recommend: regulatory bodies to build coalitions with makers, online platforms to give communities more control over the presentation of information, and repositories to balance needs to distribute information while limiting the spread of misinformation.
