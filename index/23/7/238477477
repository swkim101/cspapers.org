4D printing thermoplastic technology has become a common method for fabricating shape-changing interfaces, however, the fully automated 3D printing method also limits user's creative participation in the fabrication process. We present a 4D Doodling method which allow users to create deformable daily items in a free-style way using a 3D printing pen. In the doodling experiment, we summarized the experience of manual printing and provided a practical method to support the user's creation, which can be a way to increase humanity for 4D printing technology.
