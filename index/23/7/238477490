With the notion of personal fabrication, users are handed industry-level processes to design and manufacture arbitrary physical artifacts. While personal fabrication is a powerful opportunity, it is currently employed by hobbyists and enthusiasts. Consumers, accounting for a majority of the population, still employ workflows like shopping to acquire physical artifacts. The core of my thesis focuses on partially or fully omitting steps of modeling, by relying on outsourced design effort, remixing, and low-effort interactions. Through such deliberate omission of workflow steps, the required effort can be reduced. Instead of starting ”from scratch”, users may remix existing designs, tune parametric designs or merely retrieve their desired artifacts. This moves processes in personal fabrication towards shopping-like interactions, away from complex but powerful industrial CAD (computer-aided design) systems. Instead of relegating design processes to a disconnected workstation, users may conduct search, remix, and preview procedures in-situ, at the location of use for the future artifact. This may simplify the transfer of requirements from the physical environment. Low-effort–high-expressivity fabrication workflows may not be easy to achieve, but crucial for widespread dissemination of personal fabrication. The broader vision behind my focus on ”ubiquitous personal fabrication” is one where any person can create highly personalized artifacts that suit their unique aesthetic and functional needs, without having to define and model every single detail of the artifact.
