We investigate the existence of constant-round post-quantum black-box zero-knowledge protocols for NP. As a main result, we show that there is no constant-round post-quantum black-box zero-knowledge argument for NP unless $\text{NP} \subseteq \text{BQP}$. As constant-round black-box zero-knowledge arguments for NP exist in the classical setting, our main result points out a fundamental difference between post-quantum and classical zero-knowledge protocols. Combining previous results, we conclude that unless $\text{NP} \subseteq \text{BQP}$, constant-round post-quantum zero-knowledge protocols for NP exist if and only if we use non-black-box techniques or relax certain security requirements such as relaxing standard zero-knowledge to $\epsilon$-zero-knowledge. Additionally, we also prove that three-round and public-coin constant-round post-quantum black-box $\epsilon$-zero-knowledge arguments for NP do not exist unless $\text{NP} \subseteq \text{BQP}$.
