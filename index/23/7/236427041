The objective of this work is to develop methodologies to detect, and report the noncompliant images with respect to indian space research organisation (ISRO) recruitment requirements. The recruitment software hosted at U. R. rao satellite centre (URSC) is responsible for handling recruitment activities of ISRO. Large number of online applications are received for each post advertised. In many cases, it is observed that the candidates are uploading either wrong or non-compliant images of the required documents. By non-compliant images, we mean images which do not have faces or there is not enough clarity in the faces present in the images uploaded. In this work, we attempt to address two specific problems namely: 1) To recognise image uploaded to recruitment portal contains a human face or not. This is addressed using a face detection algorithm. 2) To check whether images uploaded by two or more applications are same or not. This is achieved by using machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate similarity score between two images, and then identify the duplicate images. Screening of valid applications becomes very challenging as the verification of such images using a manual process is very time consuming and requires large human efforts. Hence, we propose novel ML techniques to determine duplicate and non-face images in the applications received by the recruitment portal.
