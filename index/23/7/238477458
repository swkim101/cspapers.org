Today, in order to start an interaction with most digital technology, we must perform some sort of action to indicate our intention, such as shaking a computer’s mouse to wake it or pressing a coffee maker’s start button for your morning cup of coffee. Our system aims to help remove these currently necessary ”trigger actions” and aims to support an array of applications to create borderless and fluid interactions between the technological world and our own. Our system as has the potential for application within the world of accessible technology as well. The system we propose is a method of identifying held objects via a smartwatch’s accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. A preview demo video is available at https://youtu.be/1YCTzvjcJ18.
