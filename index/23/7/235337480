The immutability of blockchain is crucial to the security of many blockchain applications, while it is still desired or even legally obliged to allow for redacting the contents of blockchain for some scenarios. In this work, we revisit the conflict between the immutability and redaction of blockchain, and put forward a new fine-grained redactable blockchain with a semi-trusted regulator, who follows our protocol but has a tendency to abuse his power. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first blockchain that not only supports the supervision of blockchain content, but also allows users themselves to manage their own data. To this end, we introduce a new variant of chameleon-hash function, named stateful Chameleon Hash with Revocable Subkey, which is important for building our redactable blockchain and may be of independent interest. We also propose a black-box construction from standard chameleon-hash functions, and prove its security properties under our proposed security notions. At last, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation. The evaluation results demonstrate that our redactable blockchain is practical and can be adopted with small additional overhead compared to the immutable blockchain.
