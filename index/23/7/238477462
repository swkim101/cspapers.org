Origami is the art of making 2D/3D shapes by folding paper, HCI researchers have leveraged novel structure design and material techniques to create a wide range of origami-based shape-changing interface. Meanwhile, additive manufacturing which could easily fabricate complicated artifacts and augment the haptic sensation, has drawn more attention to the field. This paper presents 3DP-Ori, a fabrication method of flexible origami construction with conventional FDM printers. To create and end-to-end pipeline, we developed a parametric design tool with dynamic folding simulation and feasibility estimation, which enable our software to output a printable semi-folded origami model for further easy manual deformation. Adopting and optimizing bridging-based printing, we leverage multiple geometric patterns with adjustable flexibility on creases, which further effect the haptic properties on 3DP-Ori objects. We believe the 3DP-Ori extends the design space of 3D printing beyond typically hard and fixed forms, and it will help designers and researchers to fabricate interactivities with various physical properties.
