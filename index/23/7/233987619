Smartphone users do not deal with notifications strictly in the order they are displayed, but sometimes read them from the middle, suggesting a mismatch between current systems’ display order and users’ needs. We therefore used mixed methods to investigate 34 smartphone users’ desired notification display order and related it with users’ self-reported order of attendance. Classifying using these two orders as dimensions, we obtained seven types of notifications, which helped us not only highlight the distinct attributes but understand the implied roles of these seven types of notifications, as well as the implied meaning of display orders. This is especially manifested in our identification of three main mismatches between the two orders. Qualitative findings reveal several meanings that participants attached to particular positions when arranging notifications. We offer design implications for notification systems, including calling for two-dimensional notification layout to support the multi-purpose roles of smartphone notifications we identified.
