Autonomous robotic suturing has the potential to improve surgery outcomes by leveraging accuracy, repeatability, and consistency compared to manual operations. However, achieving full autonomy in complex surgical environments is not practical and human supervision is required to guarantee safety. In this paper, we develop a confidence-based supervised autonomous suturing method to perform robotic suturing tasks via both Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR) and surgeon collaboratively with the highest possible degree of autonomy. Via the proposed method, STAR performs autonomous suturing when highly confident and otherwise asks the operator for possible assistance in suture positioning adjustments. We evaluate the accuracy of our proposed control method via robotic suturing tests on synthetic vaginal cuff tissues and compare them to the results of vaginal cuff closures performed by an experienced surgeon. Our test results indicate that by using the proposed confidence-based method, STAR can predict the success of pure autonomous suture placement with an accuracy of 94.74%. Moreover, via an additional 25% human intervention, STAR can achieve a 98.1% suture placement accuracy compared to an 85.4% accuracy of completely autonomous robotic suturing. Finally, our experiment results indicate that STAR using the proposed method achieves 1.6 times better consistency in suture spacing and 1.8 times better consistency in suture bite sizes than the manual results.
