This study introduces a multi-window web browser system to visualize all visited pages and their link structure in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Using VR space, it is possible to visualize many pages and their connections while maintaining their readability. To evaluate the usefulness of our system, we conducted a user study to compare our system to a conventional single-window browsing system. We then found that our system reduces the browsing operations and time for the task of comparing multiple web pages.
