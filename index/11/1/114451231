Ureteropelvic junction obstruction is a common clinical entity in urological practice. The obstruction can result from intrinsic or extrinsic factors. The clinical course is variable due to degree of obstruction. Diagnose is usually made by contrast-enhanced excretory imaging modalities and nuclear scan. Open surgical, laparoscopic and robotic assisted laparoscopic approaches are the available surgical treatment options. In this case report, we present a congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction treated with robotic assisted transperitoneal pyeloplasty with many intracalyceal stones surprisingly noticed during surgery and successfully treated in the same session.
