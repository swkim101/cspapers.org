This paper studies an automatic control device applied to goose feather ironing. It is a hybrid control system which incorporates sequential control, electric-drive control and temperature control. The device centers on PLC and takes advantage of the Y-axis and Z-axis servo drives to obtain an optimal control path. The fuzzy control technique used in temperature loop can restrain the temperature disturbance effectively. By using the human-machine exchange interface technology based on touch-screen, the device realizes user interface and system monitoring capabilities. Compared with the traditional machine, the new device can improve the production efficiency and quality significantly.
