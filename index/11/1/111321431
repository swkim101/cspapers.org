In this paper we present a novel approach regarding the exteroceptive sensor system of a new developed artificial hand. Force and proximity (distance) sensors are the main components of the exteroceptive sensor system of the new artificial hand. Modern control algorithms are conceived in relation to the signals received from these sensors.
