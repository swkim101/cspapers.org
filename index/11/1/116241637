This research describes the tracked combine harvester dynamic model developed based on the sensors measurements for the controlling of tracked combine harvester and the application of automated navigation. Real time global positioning system and inertial measurement unit were equipped on the tracked combine harvester for obtaining the position, direction of travel, angular rate etc. Circular and sinusoidal trajectories were performed by the tracked combine harvester over the concrete and soil ground from a set of steering commands to evaluate the tracked combine harvester dynamic model. The results indicate that the computed harvester state, angular yaw rate, soil parameter, track coefficients, turning radius and sideslip angle from the tracked combine harvester dynamic model and sensors measurements can be used to control an autonomous tracked combine harvester during nonlinear maneuverability.
