Aiming at the problems of the choice of system parameters has great influence on stability of system in the push-pull DC/DC converter system. The relationship between system parameters and system stability was studied based on the push-pull DC/DC converter simulation model of MATLAB. Due to the push-pull DC/DC converter system is nonlinear, the system was analyzed by poincare mapping graph. This paper mainly analyzed the influence of the ratio of converter transformer on system stability. It is shown by simulation that the system operation state transferred from stable period to chaos, when the value of transformer ratio changed from 7 to 4. The study results are valuable for the design of switching power supply system parameters, and would have a wide application foreground.
