Tendon based parallel manipulators are capable of realizing movement of high speed and acceleration. In order to perform tasks that require direct contact with the environment control schemes are needed that adapt both operational space variables and tendon forces. By use of an inverse dynamics approach a motion control scheme in operational space is presented. In redundant systems the forces that act along the tendons can be divided into internal forces, the sum of which is zero, and external forces, that produce the driving force for the endeffector. Based on that property an additional and decoupled force control scheme is presented.
