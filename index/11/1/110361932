A method for determining whether a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) active noise control (ANC) system can reduce error signals around all sensors to zero at steady state was proposed. The method was converted to determine the solution of linear equations. Three different simulations were conducted to verify the theoretical analysis. Simulation shows that max estimation error of control signals is no greater than 1.87% in amplitude and 2.22 deg. in phase.
