The Artificial Immune System (AIS) is a biologically inspired computation system based on specifically human immune system. AIS applications in last one decade have been developed to address the complex computational and engineering problems related to classification, optimisation and anomaly detection. Many investigations have been conducted to understand the principles of immune system to translate the knowledge into AIS applications. However, a clear understanding of principles and responses of immune system is still required for application of AIS to Swarm Robotics. This article after a review of AIS models and algorithms proposes an integration of AIS and Swarm Robotics by developing a very clear understanding of immune system structures and associated functions.
