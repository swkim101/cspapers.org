—In this paper, we developed a fully textile sensing fabric for tactile touch sensing as the robot skin to detect human-robot interactions. We deﬁned seven gestures which are inspired by the interactions of typical people to people and pet scenarios. Through evaluation experiment with 5 participants, the machine learning algorithm can recognize the gesture with a 98% accuracy if the algorithm has encountered the person before, and 86 . 8% accuracy if the person is excluded in the training data.
