An organic light emitting device (OLED) with multilayer structure is reported. The devices were made of ITO/ m-MTDATA (45 nm)/ NPB (10 nm) / DCJTB (0.05 nm)/DPVBi (x nm)/ Alq:QAD 0.5% 20nm /Alq (50-x nm)/LiF(1nm)/Al, by doping combine with non-doping method. The ultrathin layer was introduced for the yellow emitting layer by using 4- (dicyanomethylene)-2-tert-butyl-6 (1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)-4H-pyran (DCJTB). The ultrathin layer offered an attraction in that it allowed the easy handling process and accurate thickness control, it enabled high device efficiency with simple architecture.The device shows the current efficiency of 2.79 cd/A at 12V, its maximum luminance is 17450 cd/m2 at 14V, respectively.
