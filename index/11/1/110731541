A dynamic simulation system whose model objects were industrial robot was designed. An advanced and quickly inverse kinematic algorithm was used to solve inverse kinematic equation for 6DOF industrial robot, the time of solve was improved. The method of trajectory planning was developed. The vision simulation for industrial robot was completed by Creator and Vega software. Simulation result shows that the requirement of kinematic control has been achieved and provides an intuitive and convenient tool for research of the kinematic control algorithm for industrial robot.
