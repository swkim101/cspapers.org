The accurate clamping and locating is essential in factory automation process. Fast localization of strategic placement of structure elements for 3-2-1 fixture based on genetic algorithm and milling tool path is presented. Travelling salesmen method is used for a 2D tool path search. A final design of an optimised placement is also shown with improved overall workpiece force and deflection influence.
