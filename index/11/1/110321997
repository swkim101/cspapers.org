In order to deal with the influence of adverse weather (such as dust fog) over vision system of the outdoor machine, this paper proposes a real-time image defogging method basing on sparsity. This method estimates the radiation intensity of airlight based on the dark channel prior statistical law and adopts sparse decomposition and reconstruction to figure out the atmospheric veil, taking advantage of the sparsity of this issue. By solving the equation for imaging based on the atmospheric scattering model, we can obtain the atmospheric radiation intensity under the ideal condition and succeed in image defogging. Experimental results show that this method can effectively improve the degradation of image in adverse weather (foggy) and raise its sharpness.
