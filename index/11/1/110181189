Summary form only given, as follows. It was June 1982 that I had my first technical paper in the EDA area presented at the 19th Design Automation Conference. It was exactly 20 years after I completed my doctoral study and exactly 30 years ago from today. I would like to share with the audience how my prior educational experience prepared me to enter the EDA field and how my EDA experience prepared me for the other aspects of my professional life.
