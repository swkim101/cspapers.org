This template carries out a three-terminal accurate fault location method for distribute cable network. It is improved from type D principle fault location method. Radial distribution network is decomposed into T-type networks. A set of formulas based on three-terminal data can calculate fault distance and find fault branch. Only first transient wave heads is needed. Shorter transmission distance makes it more accurate to extract first wave heads with wavelet. The distributed measurement offers redundant transient voltage data. These data is fully used to improve location success rate and accuracy. The simulation result in ATP-EMTP shows that the location accuracy isnt influenced by wave speed, catadioptric wave, grounding resistance and initial fault phase angle.
