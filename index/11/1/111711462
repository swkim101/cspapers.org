This paper compares the economic viability and performance outcomes of two different thermoelectric device architectures to determine the advantages and appropriate use of each configuration. Hybrid thermoelectric coolers employ thin-film thermoelectric materials sandwiched between a plastic substrate and formed into a corrugated structure. Roll-to-roll manufacturing and low-cost polymer materials offer a cost advantage to the hybrid architecture at the sacrifice of performance capabilities while conventional bulk devices offer increased performance at a higher cost. Performance characteristics and cost information are developed for both hybrid and conventional bulk single-stage thermoelectric modules. The design variables include device geometry, electrical current input, and thermoelectric material type. The trade-offs between cooling performance and cost will be explored and the thermoelectric system configuration analyzed for both hybrid and conventional bulk thermoelectric coolers.Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME
