The doubly-fed wind power generation system containing crowbar protection circuit will change from reactive power source to reactive power load during the low voltage ride-through, which is likely to aggravate burdens to the fault system. Aiming at solving this problem, the paper will introduce the STATCOM compensation device, and put forward a comprehensive control strategy. Under the coordinated control strategy, the STATCOM will cooperate with the compensation capacity of the doubly-fed generator to support the reactive power. The voltage at point of common coupling will be raised and the ability of low voltage ride-through of the wind turbines will be improved. A simulative model of doubly-fed induction generator is established in MATLAB and the strategys rationality and effectiveness will be verified by the simulative results.
