Internet of things have transformed existing communications between machines to machine, machines to human in great extent and helped word to move towards more connected systems. This connected system will help all stakeholders to generate process and share the gathered data from various sources/devices located across variety of platforms. This research work in an effort made in the area of IOT with the design of low cost, self-navigation rover which will be able to detect the obstacles based on the video feeds and can take a decision to avoid this obstacle and complete its assigned path. At the same time the rover was capable of posting live video feeds of the places under observations to remote server through the available communication network. GPS sensor installed on the rover is working on the principals of National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) and provides the geospatial data of longitude, latitude data for processing [1]. The ultrasonic sensor is a low cost sensor which is used to detect and avoid the obstacles coming in the path of rover travel in a dynamic environment [2].
