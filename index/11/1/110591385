In order to develop the four in-wheel motors driven Electric Vehicle (EV), this paper designed a skidding detector depending on the motor torque, established a slip-ratio estimator. Then, the Model Following Control (MFC) and Optimal Slip-ratio Control algorithms were analysed, compared and optimized. All of the algorithms were simulated using the one-wheel vehicle model. The simultion results show that the algorithms can make full use of the road adhesion characteristics and do good work on the ASR and the vehicle dynamics.
