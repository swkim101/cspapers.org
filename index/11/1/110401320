Metamodel based design optimization (MBDO) algorithms have attracted considerable interests in recent years due to their special capability in dealing with complex optimization problems with computationally expensive objective and constraint functions and local optima. Conventional unimodal-based optimization algorithms and stochastic global optimization algorithms either miss the global optimum frequently or require unacceptable computation time. In this work, a generic testbed/platform for evaluating various MBDO algorithms has been introduced. The purpose of the platform is to facilitate quantitative comparison of different MBDO algorithms using standard test problems, test procedures, and test outputs, as well as to improve the efficiency of new algorithm testing and improvement. The platform consists of a comprehensive test function database that contains about 100 benchmark functions and engineering problems. The testbed accepts any optimization algorithm to be tested, and only requires minor modifications to meet the test-bed requirements.The testbed is useful in comparing the performance of competing algorithms through execution of same problems. It allows researchers and practitioners to test and choose the most suitable optimization tool for their specific needs. It also helps to increase confidence and reliability of the newly developed MBDO tools. Many new MBDO algorithms, including Mode Pursuing Sampling (MPS), Pareto Set Pursuing (PSP), and Space Exploration and Unimodal Region Elimination (SEUMRE), were tested in this work to demonstrate its functionality and benefits.Copyright Â© 2013 by ASME
