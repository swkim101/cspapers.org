Modern systems are difficult to design because there are a significant number of potential alternatives to consider. The specification of an alternative includes an architecture (which describes the components and connections of the system) and component sizings (the sizing parameter for each component). In current practice, designers rely mainly on their experience and intuition to select a desired architecture without much computational support and then spend most of their effort on optimizing component sizings. In this paper, an approach for representing an architecture selection as a mixed-integer linear programming optimization is presented; existing solvers are then used to identify promising candidate architectures at early stages of the design process. Mathematical programming is a common optimization technique, but it is rarely used for architecture selection because of the difficulty of manually formulating an architecture selection as a mathematical program. In this paper, the formulation is presented in a modular fashion so that model transformations can be applied to transform a problem formulation that is convenient for designers into the mathematical programming optimization. A modular superstructure representation is used to model the design space; in a superstructure a union of all potential architectures is represented as a set of discrete and continuous variables. Algebraic constraints are added to describe both acceptable variable combinations and system behavior to allow the solver to eliminate clearly poor alternatives and identify promising alternatives. The framework is demonstrated on the selection of an actuation subsystem for a hydraulic excavator, although the solution approach would be similar for most mechanical systems.Copyright Â© 2012 by ASME
