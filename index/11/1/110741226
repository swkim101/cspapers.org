Adopting a system-on-chip approach, this paper presents an integrated FPGA-based Electronic Speed Control (ESC) for driving brushless DC electric motors. This allows for sensing, computation, and higher control bandwidth than traditional off-the-shelf ESCs (typically 50Hz). In addition to a more compact and flexible package, this provides greater system awareness and facilitates a faster control loop rate, which are useful for agile robotic systems, such as UAVs. This design has been tested in conjunction with a custom, compact quadrotor system. It provides reduced payload and increased robustness compared to traditional controllers.
