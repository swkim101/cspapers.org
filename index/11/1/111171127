A new hybrid technique based on ADALINE (Adaptive linear element neuron) associated with Prony algorithm is presented for harmonics and interharmonics estimation in power system. The Prony algorithm can detect the accurate frequencies of harmonics and interharmonics, and the ADALINE can get the amplitudes and phase angles. If the noise is present, the Prony algorithm can get less accurately frequencies to reduce convergence time of the ADALINE, and the ADALINE will obtain higher accurately frequencies, amplitudes and phase angles by adjusting the weights. The validity and feasibility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by numerical simulations.
