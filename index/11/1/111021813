The wide application of service robot caused security problems between humans and robots. Through the theoretical analysis and mathematical formula based on the calculation. Designing a novel safe impedance joint mechanism consisting of an inclined link, a slider with rollers, and linear springs is proposed. Analysis the institutions of different friction between rollers and tilt links in the form of organization function at the same time. Using solidworks software to mechanism of 3D modeling, the design of two different partial CAM model, importing ADAMS software and analysis the function, Comparison between simulation data and experimental data consistency, for later used in robot mechanical arm to provide a theoretical basis.
