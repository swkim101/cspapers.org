The wave piercing buoy in this paper is different with the traditional cylindrical buoy, it is made by ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and has six middle pontoons. In order to guarantee the stability of the buoy structure, it is necessary to carry out the strength analysis. This paper use the ANSYS software to carry on the simulation analysis to the buoy, and the result of it is compare with the actual operation, therefore ensure the strength of the wave piercing buoy meet the related requirements.
