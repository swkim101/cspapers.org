Fabricating silicon-beam through the wet etching has been developed for many years, there are a lot of advantages during the wet etching, low cost, easy to obtain and so on. However the design and fabrication of silicon-beam with polygon section has been confined during the process of wet etching; In order to fabricate more kinds of silicon-beam with the advantages of the wet etching, a novel method to fabricate silicon-beam with polygon section is proposed. The fabricating process has been designed by taking advantage of the protection effect of the SiO2 layer.
