The past one decade has witnessed an astounding outburst in the number of online social media (OSM) services, and a lot of these services have enthralled millions of users across the globe. With such tremendous number of users, the amount of content being generated and shared on OSM services is also enormous. As a result, trying to visualize all this overwhelming amount of content, and gain useful insights from it has become a challenge. In this work, we present uTrack, a personalized web service to analyze and visualize the diffusion of content shared by users across multiple OSM platforms. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no work which concentrates on monitoring information diffusion for personal accounts. Currently, uTrack monitors and supports logging in from Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Once granted permissions by the user, uTrack monitors all URLs (like videos, photos, news articles) the user has shared in all OSM services supported, and generates useful visualizations and statistics from the collected data.
