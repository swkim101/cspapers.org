This research proposes a people-following mobile robot system that is equipped with Kinect RGB-D camera and a laser scanner, in which the Kinect’s skeleton tracking function helps, identify people in the depth image. First, the system selects a person who raises his two hands as the target to follow. Second, the system identifies the target to follow from the person’s location and color characteristics of clothes. When an occlusion occurs, the system uses the information from the laser scanner to guide the motion of the mobile robot and tries to re-recognize the target to follow at the same time. The people-following mobile robot accomplishes a human detection and follows only the target even if more than two people are located around the target person. The research conducts several experiments and shows the effectiveness of the proposed system to identify and follow a human in an indoor environment
