Based on theoretical analysis and computational mechanics, the spatial structure of overburden rock model of 1704 working face in a coal mine, stratum quality membership of uniaxial compressive strength, layer thickness, joint cracks were analyzed. Stope model was established, immediate roof caving step distance is calculated, fracturing length and structural composition of rock beam were calculated, which may have important implications for The failure mechanism of instability of coal rock.
