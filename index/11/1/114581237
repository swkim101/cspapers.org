Predominately, robotic construction is applied as prefabrication in structured indoor environments with standard building materials. Our work, on the other hand, focuses on utilizing irregular materials found on-site, such as rubble and rocks, for autonomous construction. We present a pipeline that detects randomly placed objects in a scene that are used by our next best stacking pose searching method employing gradient descent with a random initial orientation, exploiting a physics engine. This approach is validated in an experimental setup using a robotic manipulator by constructing balancing vertical stacks without mortars and adhesives. We show the results of eleven consecutive trials to form such towers autonomously using four arbitrarily in front of the robot placed rocks.
