In this paper, aiming at the poor performance of the existing symbol rate estimation methods when SNR is low, we proposed a method based on the timing square which can be simply calculated and applied to MASK/MPSK/MQAM modulated signal, improved the performance of signal symbol rate estimation compared with the existing method. Based on the principle of the timing square, the signal modules were squared to calculate the fourier coefficient modulus corresponding to different sampling ratios. Then the characteristic line was searched in the transform spectrum which contains symbol rate information and obtained an estimation of the symbol rate. The impact of the roll-off factor and the carrier wave was analyzed and solution was proposed in this paper. Simulation results show that the performance of symbol rate estimation of the improved method is better than the original method, the wavelet transform method and the cyclostationary method in low SNR and low roll-off factor environment.
