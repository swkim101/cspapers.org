Because of brushless dc motor with ac motor, simple in structure, convenient in operation and reliable maintenance and so on a series of advantages, and has the dc motor running with high efficiency, no excitation loss and speed performance is good wait for an advantage, but the low voltage DC brushless motor output torque is small on the market, can't adapt to the requirements for this problem, this paper proposes a solution of winding and the structure of the stator are analyzed and discussed, some through the motor parameter optimization method for improving the capability of the brushless dc motor overload.
