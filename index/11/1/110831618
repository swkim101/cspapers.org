According to the demand of the present agricultural environment on-line monitoring, a design scheme based on Nx5883 wireless remote control terminal is proposed for agricultural environment monitoring system. The monitoring system consists of background detection server and remote detection terminal; it can real-timely monitor the environment variables such as temperature, humidity and sunlight which can influence crop growth. Firstly the system framework is given, secondly the hardware is designed. Whats more, the function application and work process is given. Because of using the wireless data transmission, the system solved the existent problems in upgrade and expanding. Because the monitoring system has the advantages of low-power, low-cost, agile expanding and so on, it will possess a wildly application foreground.
