This paper describes an architecture for robotic telepresence and teleoperation based on the well known tools ROS and Skype. We discuss how Skype can be used as a framework for robotic communication and can be integrated into a ROS/Linux framework to allow a remote user to not only interact with people near the robot, but to view maps, sensory data, robot pose and to issue commands to the robot’s navigation stack. This allows the remote user to exploit the robot’s autonomy, providing a much more convenient navigation interface than simple remote joysticking.
