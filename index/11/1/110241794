The present study developed a high-efficiency charge/discharge controller for stand-alone solar LED lighting system by incorporating an nMPPO (near-maximum-power-point-operation) design, a PWM battery charge control, and a PWM battery discharge control to drive the LED. A battery charge control system using PWM technique with feedback control is developed in the present study to charge the battery in full capacity. The daily outdoor experiment shows the battery capacity can be charged 9.7% more after the overcharge point.
