The safety storage of rice or brown rice moisture content is below 14% ,hardness and brittleness is larger to low moisture content of brown rice, the crack in the manufacturing process of milling rice and broken rice rate is higher, milling processing energy consumption to increase, and the rice surface roughness is low .In this paper, using mathematical simulation method based on the theory of the humidifying, thin layer of humidifying dynamics model is established, and brown rice humidification conditioning properties are studied. Results show that the unit heat consumption is reduced with the increase of air temperature,humidifying rate increases, the bread machine temperature linearly increases; With the increase of wind speed, unit heat consumption increases, humidifying rate increased.
