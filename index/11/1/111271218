The double hexapod robot consists in two staged hexapod platforms â€“ Stewart Gough platforms - combining in a certain measure the advantages of the robots with parallel kinematics and of the serial robots: high accuracy, high stiffness, fast response and small dimensions, having an extended operating space. Different modelling and construction aspects were described in few previous articles. Some examples of trajectories generated with this positioning system are now presented to illustrate its mobility, as well as the workspaces for one and two hexapods in order to make possible a visual comparison between the two volumes.
