The implementation of PBN is an important part of China's civil aviation to enhance national strength program,the evaluation of the ground-based navigation signal Overlay is an essential part of the design of flight procedures.This article start from the principle of electromagnetic wave propagation in the atmosphere and establish a reasonable mathematical model for the propagation of electromagnetic signals,then make use of the secondary development for ArcGIS to complete the evaluation system of Ground-based navigation signal overlay while considering the requirements of DME / DEM update area for 2 DME station.
