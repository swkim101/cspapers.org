Target tracking is one of the interesting tasks of mobile robots navigation. This paper presents a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for a mobile robot chasing a moving target. The proposed control strategy computes both the linear and angular velocities of the robot in order to regulate its perceptual state according to the targets motion. Then, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to tune the scaling factors of the FLC for a better performance in term of target tracking. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.
