The idea of multidisciplinary design optimization is applied to the solution of the optimization design of oil tankers. The multidisciplinary design optimization model is established according to the multi-objective and multi-constraints characteristics of the design of oil tanker. The optimization model is solved by using the collaborative optimization algorithm, and its solution is completed. The numerical results indicate that the collaborative optimization can be successfully applied to dealing with the efficiency of the optimization design as well as the problems of an oil tanker, which lays a foundation to solve more complex engineering systems.
