Digital building methods and means to change the performance of traditional architecture, design and manufacturing to effectively integrate together. It emphasizes the process of design, attention to the interaction between the factors, is a computer designed, this paper studies the factors that influence the index construction site building sunshine, environmental noise, natural ventilation, insulation, etc. into the internal logic of the language of the computer, then architectural form can be generated by a computer, through constant revision and feedback, and ultimately establish optimal architectural form.
