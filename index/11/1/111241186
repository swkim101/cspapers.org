Insufficiency of traditional EB-type silk reeling machine was pointed out after analyzing its traverse mechanism. A novel traverse mechanism driven by non-circular gears with Fourier pitch-line was proposed in order to make up the insufficiency of the traditional EB-type machine. Kinematical mathematic model of this mechanism was established and an aided analysis and simulation software was compiled. A group of preferable parameters was obtained by means of human-computer interactive optimization method. New advantages of uniform roundtrip velocity and better silk winding shape were achieved by the novel traverse mechanism compared to the traditional EB-type mechanism.
