Because of lacking technical and economic theory support, running transformer life assessment work often goes to disorder, thus constructing transformer assessment new model of economic life has a certain practical significance. Because of the transformer serving for a long time and the running environment being complicated, factors that influence the assessment of transformer economic life have a certain characteristic of a variety of coexistence or cross-existence. Due to this characteristic, introduce blind number theory into transformer life assessment, use blind number express evaluation parameter uncertainties, and establish transformer economic life evaluation model. This model not only can get transformer economic life expectancy, but also can obtain economic life interval under different confidence level An example shows that blind number theory applied to the transformer economic life assessment is feasible and effective, which can provide more detailed and diversified information for decision makers and have a certain reference value.
