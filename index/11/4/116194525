In thi ..; pC'pcr we will investigate transjornLQ.tions that serve as tools in the desiGn of new diita structures. Specifically, we ~ltlldy epncral m('thod~, for converting static structures (in which all olr:mcnts are known before any searches are pcrformrd) to dyn;unic st rueturcs (in which the in!:,ertion of a new clement can be rnixed with searches). We will see three (la:.:.c5 of :.uch tran:,formations (each based on a different ( 0 UntinG '.' ( lIe me for representing the int eger s) and thenuse a COtnbindtori"l rnodel to show the optimality of many of the t r i1ns for m;Â·d ions. Is~,LJCS such as online dat a st ruc tures and dcl0tion of clements are also examined. To demonstrate the appli( ability of these tools, we will study structures that have been developed by trans form<=lt ions.
