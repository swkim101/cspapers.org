The main objective of this paper is to simulate the mobility of humanoid robot. Simulation method implemented by using RecurDyn, one can analyze the kinematics and dynamics of BIOLOID humanoid robot. Moreover, the analysis of mobility will be discussed. In this paper, the Zero-Moment Point and Forward Dynamics methods are also introduced to the dynamic analysis of humanoid robot. Finally, the simulation results show that the algorithms developed in this paper can efficiently enhance the stability of the humanoid robot.
