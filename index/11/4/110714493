This paper focuses on the parametric modeling and optimization of the Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process for the deposition of thin films of silicon from silane in a vertical impinging CVD reactor. The parametric modeling using Radial Basis Function (RBF) for various functions which are related to the deposition rate and uniformity of the thin films are studied. These models are compared and validated with additional sampling data. Based on the parametric models, different optimization formulations for maximizing the deposition rate and the working areas of thin film are performed.Copyright Â© 2008 by ASME
