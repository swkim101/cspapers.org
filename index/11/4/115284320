Fire fighters extinguish fires to protect lives and to avoid destruction of property and environment. Through extinguishing operation, many firefighters are killed and injured due to the absence of information about hazard building infrastructure. In this paper, we design and implement a prototype robotic system which intends to assist the firefighters in accomplishing their duties, including navigation, rescue, and obtain localization information. In addition, the robotic system will navigate the firefighters through the safest route inside the building where GPS signals are inaccessible.
