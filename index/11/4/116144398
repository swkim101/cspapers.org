The starting points of this paper are two size-optimal solutions: (i) one for implementing arbitrary Boolean functions (Horne, 1994); and (ii) another one for implementing certain sub-classes of Boolean functions (Red`kin, 1970). Because VLSI implementations do not cope well with highly interconnected nets--the area of a chip grows with the cube of the fan-in (Hammerstrom, 1988)--this paper will analyze the influence of limited fan-in on the size optimality for the two solutions mentioned. First, the authors will extend a result from Horne and Hush (1994) valid for fan-in {Delta} = 2 to arbitrary fan-in. Second, they will prove that size-optimal solutions are obtained for small constant fan-in for both constructions, while relative minimum size solutions can be obtained for fan-ins strictly lower than linear. These results are in agreement with similar ones proving that for small constant fan-ins ({Delta} = 6...9) there exist VLSI-optimal (i.e. minimizing AT{sup 2}) solutions (Beiu, 1997a), while there are similar small constants relating to the capacity of processing information (Miller 1956).
