The paper presents a novel expressive logic-based formalism intended for reasoning about numerical distances. We investigate its computational properties (in particular, show that it is EXPTIME-complete) and devise a tableau-based satisfiability-checking algorithm. To be able to express knowledge about implicit or unknown distances, we then extend the language with variables ranging over distances and prove that the resulting logic is decidable as well.
