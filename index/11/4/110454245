When the number of group members changes, public feature key of the group manager must be changed. The deletion of group members is based on the mathematical principle that the secret feature key of each legitimate member will update with the group managers changing of public feature key. Cancel the update operator, create independent secret feature key for each legitimate member, so that the secret feature key of each legitimate member will be irrelevant to the group public feature key. This method can be used to improve the signature computational efficiency and to delete group members effectively.
