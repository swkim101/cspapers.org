In this paper, according to several common temperature sensors in the industrial field a temperature transmitter based on the reconfigurable field programmable gate array (FPGA) has been designed to ensure that a single device which can meet the requirements of the various applications. The transmitter can quickly and automatically identify the sensor type (ST) and connection type (CT) of external temperature sensor (ETS). It then can automatically search the reconfiguration scheme by reconfiguration identification and reconfiguration planning. The transmitter also reconfigures its inner structure by auto-deployment. Therefore, acquisition and processing the temperature with different ST and CT can be realized. In addition, a physical prototype is developed, and the effectiveness of the temperature transmitter with autonomous reconfiguring function (TTARF) is verified in the resistance temperature detector (RTD) application. The whole reconfiguration process is fully automated without human intervention.
