A novel integrated angle measurement system is proposed, which is based on CAN bus and can solve the problem that the traditional shaft angle measurement device is sensitive to disturbances and lack of network interface. The hardware circuits are designed based on the digital signal processor (DSP) TMS320F2812 and the resolver-to-digital converter (RDC) AD2S83. In addition, an adjustable frequency circuit based on Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS) is designed to provide a precise reference signal. The software design is also introduced. The experimental results show that the angle measurement system is reliable, high accuracy, compact and convenient to be used.
