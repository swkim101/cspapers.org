Locomotion and autonomy in humanoid robots is of utmost importance in integrating them into social and community service type roles. However, the limited range and speed of these robots severely limits their ability to be deployed in situations where fast response is necessary. While the ability for a humanoid to drive a vehicle would aide in increasing their overall mobility, the ability to mount and dismount a vehicle designed for human occupants is a non-trivial problem. To address this issue, this paper presents an innovative approach to enabling a humanoid robot to mount and dismount a vehicle by proposing a simple mounting bracket involving no moving parts. In conjunction with a purpose built robotic vehicle, the mounting bracket successfully allowed a humanoid Nao robot to mount, dismount and drive the vehicle.
