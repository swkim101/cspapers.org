The probability of S-N curve is one of the basic material fatigue reliability analysis and design. Determination of S-N curve is the basis of the fatigue life of obedience lognormal based on the application of statistical methods to fit the experimental data obtained fatigue. This paper studies the construction of reinforced Fatigue S-N Curves overloading effect on the structural performance of the bridge. In this paper, the fatigue reliability theory as a useful supplement, has some theoretical significance and value of work.
