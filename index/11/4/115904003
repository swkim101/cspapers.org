We present a sufficient as well as a necessary condition for the equivalence between answer sets and models of completion for logic programs with nested expressions in the bodies of rules. This condition is the weakest among all that we are aware of even for normal logic programs. To obtain this result, we present a polynomial time reduction from this class of nested logic programs to extended programs. Consequently, answer sets for these nested programs can be computed by an answer set generator for extended programs on the one hand, and characterized in terms of models of completion on the other.
