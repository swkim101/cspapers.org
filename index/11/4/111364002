This paper has designed a wireless sensor network (WSN) system which is suitable for the subway security environment. The system uses ZigBee wireless communication technology to form a network, uses the chip CC2530 as the core processor to design the hardware circuit for the network node, and the design of the embedded software is based on Z-Stack protocol stack. Through analyzing the factors having affection on the security environment, the system collects a variety of environmental information with some sensors, and completes the design of the sensor modules. The test results show that this system has the characteristics of low-power, low-cost and high reliability.
