It is well known that, the main drawback of parallel manipulators is the existence of singularities within its workspace, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based solution is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach can certainly learn the input-output data and discover the non-linear relationships which are inherent in the training data. Additionally, the proposed approach can provide solution of the forward kinematic problem with reasonable errors at and in the vicinity of kinematic singularities. The approach is implemented for the 3-RPR, 3-PRR, and 3-RRR planar parallel manipulators.
