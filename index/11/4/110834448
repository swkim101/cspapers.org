In view of studentss lack of production practices in Biology Microorganism, a design and implementation scheme for Microorganism Fermentation professionals Production practices is developed by using the 3DSMax modeling techniques, Flash and ActionScript 3.0. Firstly, create the model of fermentation tank, valves and pipelines and then put all theses objects in cascade. Secondly, simulate the basic manipulation knowledge test, the demo mode and the exercises mode in flash. Thirdly, design choice question, sorted question, keyboard control and hit-testing by using ActionScript 3.0. The platform has characteristics, such as high-degree of simulation, human-computer interaction, and portability. So it is a useful platform.
