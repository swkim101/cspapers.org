This paper introduces the basic principle, features and overall structure of Aviation Aluminum Alloy technology CAPP system. It also discusses 3 key techniques of the system : 1. designing Parts Classification Coding System based on Group Technology. 2. key features coding. 3. technology query based on the part similarity. After coding a new Aviation Aluminum Alloy structural part, the system can work out the part similarity between the new part and the existing ones and show the typical technology of the part which has the highest similarity.
