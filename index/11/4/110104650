The paper describes a intelligent robot with two stepper motor and microcontroller PIC16F84A for obstacles avoiding (IRSMP). An experimental prototype, based on a stepper motor, microcontroller PIC16F84A and infrared sensors, has been realized using conventional digital circuits. The proposed control scheme can be usefully applied to any intelligent robot. The infrared sensors has using for obstacles avoiding. The program for microcontroller is making in assembler language.
