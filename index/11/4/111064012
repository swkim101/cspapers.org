The pneumatic actuation is widely used in robotics. The actuators based on pneumatic artificial muscles are unconventional actuation systems which use the shortening by increase of the volume property which generate an axial force. They have a very good force/volume ratio and some advantages compared with conventional pneumatic actuation. This paper presents the mechatronic design of a PRRRP Biglide planar parallel robot actuated by four artificial muscles in antagonist configuration. The control system is based on an 8-bit microcontroller based development board and the position and force control is made by means of pressure regulation using proportional pressure regulators. It was determined the workspace of PRRRP Biglide parallel robot for different strokes of actuators using discretisation method in Matlab environment.
