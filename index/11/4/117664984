Most of cyberscam-related studies focus on threats perpetrated 
against the Western society, with a particular attention 
to the USA and Europe. Regrettably, no research has 
been done on scams targeting African countries, especially 
Nigeria, where the notorious and (in)famous 419 advancedfee 
scam, targeted towards other countries, originated. However, 
as we know, cybercrime is a global problem affecting 
all parties. In this study, we investigate a form of advance 
fee fraud scam unique to Nigeria and targeted at Nigerians, 
but unknown to the Western world. For the study, we rely 
substantially on almost two years worth of data harvested 
from an online discussion forum used by criminals. We complement 
this dataset with recent data from three other active 
forums to consolidate and generalize the research. We 
apply machine learning to the data to understand the criminalsâ€™ 
modus operandi. We show that the criminals exploit 
the socio-political and economic problems prevalent in the 
country to craft various fraud schemes to defraud vulnerable 
groups such as secondary school students and unemployed 
graduates. The result of our research can help potential victims 
and policy makers to develop measures to counter the 
activities of these criminal groups.
