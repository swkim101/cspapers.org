We study the computational complexity of conjunctive query answering w.r.t. ontologies formulated in fragments of the description logic SHIQ. Our main result is the identification of two new sources of complexity: the combination of transitive roles and role hierarchies which results in 2-EXPTIME-hardness, and transitive roles alone which result in CO-NEXPTIME-hardness. These bounds complement the existing result that inverse roles make query answering in SHIQ 2-EXPTIME-hard. We also show that conjunctive query answering with transitive roles, but without inverse roles and role hierarchies, remains in EXPTIME if the ABox is tree-shaped.
