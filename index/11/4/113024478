Upper extremity impairment is a prevalent outcome for a variety of neuromuscular disorders, such as stroke. According to the American Stroke Association, each year about 795,000 Americans experience a new or recurrent stroke; i.e., every 40 seconds in the United States, someone suffers a stroke [1]. 60-75% of these patients will live beyond one year after the incidence, resulting in an estimated stroke population of 7 million in the USA alone [1-3]. Upper-extremity function is acutely impaired in a large majority of those diagnosed with stroke [4-7]. Furthermore, acute hemiparesis presages chronic hemiparesis in over 40% of individuals [5,6] suffering from stroke. Chronic deficits are prevalent in the distal upper extremities, especially with regard to arm and hand motor function. Intensive physical therapies help patients regain useful functions of upper extremities, help with activities of daily living, and make them more independent.
