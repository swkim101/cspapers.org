industrial assembly line development in the direction of automation and flexibility. Not only more and more automated machinery and more industrial manipulator into the production line. Manipulator instead of artificial heavy labor, realize mechanization, automation and flexibility production process. But in the process of production, first of all to the parts, then is all kinds of processing actions. So, will the application of automatic identification in combination with manipulator is very necessary. This paper introduces a can demonstrate the technology training equipment, from the development of the technology are integrated into the software are introduced. Hope that this technology can be widely used in industrial production.
