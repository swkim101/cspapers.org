By using the finite displacements theory, this paper establishes relations of dependency between the initial and the final positions of the car batteries and the geometric and design parameters of the robot. For this, the structural kinematic scheme of the robot was used to apply gradually this theory, from the end-effector to the base of the robot. To utilize the finite displacements theory is necessary to register the two positions of the manipulated object in the same reference system. This thing can be done by using matrix relations which transforms the coordinates of the points from one system to another. These relations, along with specific relations from the finite displacements theory, lead to a matriceal algorithm suitable for computer implementation. The numerical application presented in this paper shows the final position of the car battery on the stock pallet, if the geometric parameters, the design parameters and the initial position of the battery are given.
