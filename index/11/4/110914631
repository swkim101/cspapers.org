In order to prove the applicability of the design approach with complex System-on-Chip (SoC), equipments for real-time electrocardiographic (ECG) signal generator and corresponding algorithm have been implemented in this study. The study mainly focused on completing a SoC design which constructs a customizable system via user interface to an FPGA Chip in accordance with the need of a specific application. In the proposed design flow the architecture of the generated hardware is tailored to match the communication structure of the application. This allows the developer to meet the system's performance, size and power consumption requirements with short time to market. The feature-rich multimedia products can meet market expectations of high performance at low cost and lower energy consumption.
