Robots evolve to more autonomous systems that can operate in humanpopulated environments. Moreover, these new environments and related applications expect physical and cognitive interaction capabilities of the robot. This evolution requires the integration of many different fields of research to be carried out by a multitude of experts. In order to bring this integration challenge to a good end, a systematic and model-driven approach to software is needed, which should result in flexible, reusable, and adaptable software. This paper describes the Composition Pattern [3] as such a systematic approach to model robot applications. It is an architectural pattern to systematically structure, i.e. to contain and connect, types of behavior. It builds on and provides a constructive way to apply the 5Câ€™s approach to separation of concerns [2]. The pattern can be applied to analyse, model and implement applications. Earlier work introduced the Composition Pattern as software architectural pattern [4]. The focus of this paper and presentation will be on the modeling aspect.
