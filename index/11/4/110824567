In order to reduce the loss in production and guarantee the quality of tobacco, the mixed tobacco vibration screening technology was studied. It introduced a double-layer vibration sieve into the tobacco production of cigarette enterprise, realized two technical indicators that the screening efficiency is high and the false screening rate is low. Mixed tobacco screen effect is obvious, the dust content in cigarette fell down, the false screening rate decreased 62%, and the loss reduced 41%. It provides a very good reference for the research and application of vibration screening technology.
