Video denoising is an important task to enhance video quality in many applications. The recently proposed Polyview Fusion (PVF) is one of the best methods that significantly improves results by applying 2-D denoising algorithm to multiple views (front, top and side views) and fusing the denoised results into one. In general, denoised result in smooth content is better than that in texture content; and if there is no significant motion in the video signal, the top or side view is mainly consisted of smooth content. Based on it, a new fusion method is proposed. Three denoised results are transformed into top or side views. And then they are divided into different regions and given different weights based on local features. After fusion and transformation, it obtains the final front view result. Experimental results confirm the better performance of the proposed method for the video sequences without significant amount of rapid motion.
