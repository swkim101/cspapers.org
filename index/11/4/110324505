This study used finite element models to assess potential benefits of selected unconventional features, implemented in an experimental car, for vehicle crashworthiness in frontal impact. These safety features include: structural energy-absorbing bumper, hood lockdown with optimized hood and extendable bumper. The A-pillar intrusion and the effective acceleration of the vehicle were used as the parameters for measuring frontal impact crashworthiness performance.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
