By cooperative communication among mobile vehicles, content based information dissemination could be implemented by local information storage. This paper focuses on analyzing how long the local information could be stored in this local region for, which is also called storage capability. Although there is an approximation model for two-way traffic, it is not scalable for different scenarios .We analyze the different scenarios of two-way highway traffic. Based on the analytical model for one-way highway traffic, we improve the model for two-way highway traffic. Finally, exhaustive simulations are presented to show the good performance of the proposed models for different scenarios.
