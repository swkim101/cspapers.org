In this paper, output feedback controller is applied to solve robust fault-tolerant problem for singular bilinear system with Markovian jump. The aim of this problem is to design a output feedback controller that ensures stochastic stability of the closed-loop system and the -induced gain from the noise signal to the estimation signal remains bounded by a prescribed value, whether the actuators are normal or abnormal. The controller can be constructed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. An illustrative numerical example is given to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.
