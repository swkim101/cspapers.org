In the standard target system of specialty accreditation, assessed results of teaching process are required to reflect students level of mastering related knowledge. Examination score is the most direct and important reflection. In this paper, VBA programming was applied to generate score sheet of main curriculums in recent years which is required in self-assessment report for specialty accreditation. Firstly, original data were obtained from information management system of teaching affairs. They are teaching task files and class score sheet, which are all Excel files. Secondly, original data were handled by VBA according to requirement. Compulsory courses for civil engineering class and scores for first exams were selected. Thirdly, average scores and first passing rates were calculated. At last, a summary score sheet was produced which is helpful to analyze students learning effect and to find out reasons. Therefore, the efficiency of analyzing teaching results for specialty accreditation is greatly improved.
