The Current domestic production enterprises of disposable syringe in all packaging chain for artificial fill, and complete a thermal sealing, packaging need to be done in a sterile environment down. Due to the low machining efficiency, need a lot of artificial operation, it is difficult to ensure that the quality of the product of uniform manufacturing, is not in conformity with the sterile medical devices industry, the industry standards of fyrogen-free. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we developed a "disposable syringe filler", and applied for national invention patent (patent name: eat hutch waste water purification methods and purification system), the project has been listed as a development zone of tianjin government innovation. This paper introduces the equipment of the system composition, working principle, technological process and control method, in the medical packaging industry promotion value extremely.
