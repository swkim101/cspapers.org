In order to achieve the performance of the steer-by-wire force feedback based on magnetorheological fluid (MRF) damper, an experimental system was developed. The aligning torque model and the return model based on MRF damper were built up. The general structure and hardware components were introduced. The change course of feedback force is achieved followed the change of the current of the MRF damper. Experiments showed that the force feedback system based on MRF damper can be used for automobile steer-by-wire system in the little angle.
