China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) takes over the responsibility of food safety management, which in the past was conducted by different government sectors. Under this new management system, how to carry out the practical work has become a new issue. This paper introduces an innovative food safety management mode adopted by Guizhou province. On the basis of latest information technology, food production enterprises, government, testing organizations and consumers are integrated into a unified food safety information service cloud platform. The core technology of cloud platform is composed of food safety knowledge system, testing management system, food safety information publicity system as well as mobile application.
