Development of product innovation design theory, especially the axiomatic design, has changed the pattern depending upon accumulated experience in product design. Independence rule and information rule are the necessary rules of axiomatic design theory. In design of multi-planetary gear transmission, axiomatic design has been applied to determinate type of even-loading mechanism, being important in evenly dividing power into planetary gears to greatly reduce vibration and impact of gear transmission process. By axiomatic design, flexible pin even-loading system and sun gear floating system were compared, and the best scheme has been decided to realize great power transmission.
