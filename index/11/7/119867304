Common gene data usually have the larger number of variables p (genes) than the numbers of samples N, which makes it difficult to do the classification by standard statistical methods. In this paper, the original datas dimension was reduced from the high p-dimensional gene space to a lower k-dimensional gene space, and then would be classified by SVM (Support Vector Machine). Several methods were used for dimensional reduction, such as PCA (Principle Component Analysis), MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling). The experiments showed that classification accuracy had been improved after the original datas dimension being reduced to a specific number
