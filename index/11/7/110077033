This paper presents a medical bottle detecting system based on machine vision, and completing the tightness detection task for the installation of vial and cap. The first step is experimental platform building; secondly, using MATLAB software for operations such as histogram equalization, image enhancement, image segmentation and boundary signature; finally, finalizing the design of the system software with MATLAB GUI. The systems can significantly reduce testing cost, improve detection quality, speed up the system efficiency and realize non-contact real-time detection in industrial field.
