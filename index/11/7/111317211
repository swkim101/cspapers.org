This remote on-line automatic monitoring system is designed based on WSN and GPRS Network, aiming at solving the present problems of low performance in field monitoring of reservoir water, forecasting sudden water pollution accidents, reporting important hydraulic process such as reservoir operation. The system is simulated laboratory water quality analysis process, and achieved long-time unattended reservoir water regimen remote on-line monitoring and optimized reservoir water resource management. By adopting embedded operating system Î¼C/OSII, the system has the function of parallel processing of multi-tasks, including an electrochemical sensor control circuit of lifetime-prolong. The bus mode is introduced to management software design of receiving and analyzing unit. Buses that associated with each component of management software are well connected. All of the above make the overall structure reasonable and orderly.
