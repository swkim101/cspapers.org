In this paper, a motion control system based on 2-axis gimbal system is designed and implemented to drive a high speed and precision. The proposed system consists of the RS-422 interface, 2-axis gimbal platform, SCU (servo control unit) integrated with a high speed DSP chipset, SAU (servo amplifier unit), potentiometer sensor unit, and resolver sensor unit. The SCU using the DSP firmware is designed to get a fast response without an overshoot with step input and a RMS error of low probability with ramp input. The SAU using a voltage control is designed to resolve the zero-crossing distortion for precise motion. To verify the performance and stability of the implemented system, experiments are performed through a measurement of the time and frequency domain response in a laboratory environment by using a PXI (PCI extentions for instrumentation).
