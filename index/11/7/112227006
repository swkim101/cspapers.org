The Computerized System, REPCOMP, developed for damage repair of composite structures is an expert system for the design of damage repair REPCOMP provides detail repair instructions and drawings, taking into consideration strength and stiffness requirements as well as aerodynamics, weight and other design considerations. The REPCOMP expert system is being developed for the two major paths in damage repair of composite structures which are: • Permanent damage repair, suitable for long term use of civil and military aircraft. • A/C Battle Damage Repair (ABDR), suitable for field repair of military aircraft during battle. REPCOMP operates on portable computer (PC) using the Microsoft Windows graphical environment. It is an independent system and can be used in any field repair base.
