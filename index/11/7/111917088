This paper presents and compares two vision-based navigation methods for tracking space debris in a low Earth orbit environment. This work is part of the RemoveDEBRIS 1 project. The proposed approaches rely on a frame to frame model-based tracking in order to obtain the complete 3D pose of the camera with respect to the target. The proposed algorithms robustly combine points of interest and edge features, as well as color-based features if needed. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the robustness of the approaches on synthetic image sequences simulating a CubeSat satellite orbiting the Earth. Finally, both methods are compared in order to specify what could be the best choice for the future of the RemoveDEBRIS mission.
