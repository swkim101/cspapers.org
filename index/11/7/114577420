Ongoing robotic systems are primarily undertaken by large organisations and are closed systems. We describe an extension to the cloud robotics concept that encourages reuse of sensor data collected from robots and sensor networks, and eases the economic and technical burden on small industry and government organisations. This paper describes the innovations currently in development by CSIRO that contribute to improved sustainability, scalability and sensor discovery in robotics using a cloud based data management system. Sensor Web and Linked Open Data principles are implemented to provide standardised interfaces to data sharing and robot tasking.
