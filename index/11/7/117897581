Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning (QSR) is concerned with constraint-based formalisms for representing, and reasoning with, spatial and temporal information over infinite domains. Within the QSR community it has been a widely accepted assumption that genuine qualitative reasoning methods outperform other reasoning methods that are applicable to encodings of qualitative CSP instances. Recently this assumption has been tackled by several authors, who proposed to encode qualitative CSP instances as finite CSP or SAT instances. In this paper we report on the results of a broad empirical study in which we compared the performance of several reasoners on instances from different qualitative formalisms. Our results show that for small-sized qualitative calculi (e.g., Allen's interval algebra and RCC-8) a state-of-theart implementation of QSR methods currently gives the most efficient performance. However, on recently suggested large-size calculi, e.g., OPRA4, finite CSP encodings provide a considerable performance gain. These results confirm a conjecture by Bessiere stating that support-based constraint propagation algorithms provide better performance for large-sized qualitative calculi.
