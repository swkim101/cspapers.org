Trapezoidal curve is selected as the hydraulic pumping unit load running speed curve. Designed a new hydraulic system of hydraulic pumping unit according to the electro hydraulic proportional control technology and then expounded its working principle, in which the electro-hydraulic proportional directional throttle valve have been used. The system is feasible on the theory by analyzing its mathematical model. It would meet the requirement of hydraulic pumping unit and realize the advantages of it via controlling the input current signal of the amplifier.
