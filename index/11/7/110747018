Landscape dynamic roaming produced according to drawings on a computer to simulate the real environment of the virtual landscape, the evolution of the past, we changed the traditional paper model or three-dimensional model of the digital model through digital technology to simulate real environmental landscape in the computer. In this thesis, a three-dimensional computer architecture design methods, the performance of the method proposed three-dimensional landscape design, engineering calculated by the environmental performance of buildings with different fiber, help to improve the level of digital three-dimensional architecture.
