Manufacturing industry is the basic industrial sector of the national economy and one of the most fundamental factors that determine the level of development of a country. From the history of development, machinery manufacturing experienced by the hand-made, Taylor manufacturing, highly automated, flexible automation, integrated manufacturing, and intelligent manufacturing. With the development of technology, manufacturing generally follows two routes: one is the development of the traditional manufacturing technology, the second is the development of intelligent manufacturing technologies based on artificial intelligent, computers and automated science. In general, the research on intelligent manufacturing has gone through three stages. The first stage, starting from the application of artificial intelligence in the field of manufacturing in the 1980s, the concept of intelligent manufacturing was formally put forward. The second stage, the development of smart manufacturing technology and intelligent manufacturing system were proposed in the 1990s. The third stage, in the 21st century, the intelligent manufacturing could be achieved with the generation of artificial intelligent, information technology, etc. In order to seize the technological requirement of the high manufacturing industry in the world, the advanced industrial countries put forward the intelligent manufacturing system based on the study of flexible manufacturing system; computer integrated manufacturing system, factory automation and artificial intelligence, etc. For this purpose, it is necessary to carry out international manufacturing joint collaboration among universities, industries, and governments. A number of countries, including China, United States, Germany and Japan, have already proposed smart manufacturing or intelligent manufacturing related strategic policies.
