Sine wave signal is a kind of typical electronic technology signal waveform, and frequency, amplitude and phase are three elements of the sine wave respectively. In order to measure the elements more accurately, scientific research methods is adopt in the design. Based on high precision of peak detection circuit combined with MSP430 MCU, the circuit for measuring frequency and amplitude of sine wave signal is implemented, and the results could be shown in the display circuit at the same time. The circuit can work within the 1kHz - 20kHz and 240mV - 5V sine wave signal, and has display circuit, which can display accurate measurement results, to achieve human-computer interaction.
