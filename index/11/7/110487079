In this article is presented a short classification for walking robots that are based on leg locomotion and the main objectives that walking robots designers must achieve. The leg configuration of the walking robot is essential for obtaining a stable motion. Computer aided design process offers certain advantages for designers who attend to realize competitive products with fewer errors and in a short term. The aim of this article is to present the graphical results of the kinematic analysis of a new type of walking mechanism designed by Dutch physicist and sculptor Theo Jansen using Pro Engineer program and SAM, in order to compare the results.
