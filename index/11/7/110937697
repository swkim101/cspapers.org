The design on distributed controller of underwater profile monitoring vehicle is investigated. We foucs on the characteristics on voltage transmission, communication and motion control precision of the vehicle, and then design a distributed controller on Underwater Profile Monitoring Vehicle. Experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
