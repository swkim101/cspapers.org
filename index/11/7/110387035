The EcoCAR Challenge team at The Ohio State University has designed a range-extending electric vehicle capable of 40 miles all-electric range via a 22 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, with range extension and limited parallel operation supplied by a 1.8 L dedicated E85 engine. This vehicle is designed to drastically reduce fuel consumption, with an estimated fuel economy of 89 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (mpgge), while meeting Tier II Bin 5 emissions standards. This paper documents the team’s control system development effort, starting with the vehicle architecture selection and specifying the powertrain configuration, explaining a detailed control system development process, summarizing the selected control hardware architecture at vehicle and component level, describing supervisory control algorithm design and implementation for fuel economy optimization and performance improvement, and concluding with the use of MIL and HIL techniques for system development and validation.Copyright © 2010 by ASME
