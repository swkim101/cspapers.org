In order to detect switch contact temperature of high voltage switch cabinet in the operation of the cabinet, this paper puts forward a wireless measurement way to solve the measuring temperature problem of high voltage switch of the switch contact using magnetic field coupling idea. The temperature danger can be achieved in time to reduce switch burn injury. The device is mainly composed of temperature acquisition part and temperature display part. The two parts are connected by wireless data transmission. By test determination, the method is accurate and convenient to measure the temperature of the switch contact and then completely eliminate major accidents caused by switch temperature rise.
