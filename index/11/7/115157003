Representing English adjectives and adverbs using a logically perspicuous notation (extended semantic networks, Schubert. 1974) and their accomodation within a state-based paradigm (Cercone, 1975) are discussed. Where appropriate, explicit comparisons are made with related approaches such as those of Schank (1972-1970) Montague (1972), Bartsch and Venneraann (1972), Zadeh (1972), and Reichenbach (1947).
