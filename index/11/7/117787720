"Non-monotonic" logical systems are logics in which the introduction of new axioms can invalidate old theorems. Such logics are very important in modeling the beliefs of active processes which, acting in the presence of incomplete information, must make and subsequently revise predictions in light of new observations. We present the motivation and history of such logics, develop a model theory for one important non-monotonic logic, and prove the completeness of the first-order non-monotonic predicate calculus.
