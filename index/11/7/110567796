Aiming at the low efficiency problem of the traditional gas-oil separator, this paper put forward a centrifugal gas-oil separator. In order to identify out the interior fluid field character of centrifugal gas-oil separator, RANS equation, RNG k-Îµ model and discrete phase model was applied to simulate the interior fluid field character and separation efficiency of centrifugal gas-oil separator. The simulation results showed that the flow field in the disc clearance was mainly laminar flow, and the flow field at the import and export of the disc was turbulence. Meanwhile, the velocity and pressure of the interior fluid field were equably distributed, the velocity and pressure in the disc clearance fluctuate in a tight range along vertical direction, and decrease along horizontal direction, and the particles in the disc clearance were distributed uniformly. The separation efficiency was 96.6% and the results met the design requirements.
