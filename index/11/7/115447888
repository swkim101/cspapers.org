Experimental research in low-power wireless networking lacks a reference benchmark. While other communities such as databases or machine learning have standardized bench-marks, our community still uses ad-hoc setups for its exper-iments and struggles to provide a fair comparison between communication protocols. Reasons for this include the di-versity of network scenarios and the stochastic nature of wireless experiments. Leveraging on the excellent testbeds and tools that have been built to support experimental val-idation, we make the case for a reference benchmark to pro-mote a fair comparison and reproducibility of results. This abstract describes early design elements and a benchmark-ing methodology with the goal to gather feedback from the community rather than propose a definite solution.
