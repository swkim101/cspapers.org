This paper studies a residual current monitoring system; PLC and PC select a combination of hardware, and to identify the specific method for AC and DC small signal data acquisition. On the software side, gives the effect of a schematic diagram of a data processing program, summed up the real-time data acquisition methods section. In the PLC control test procedures, test procedures were analyzed for comparison with the given process flow diagram of the main test and the numerical results, the present system reduces the complexity of the control to improve the automation of the detection process.
