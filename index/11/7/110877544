Current fire alarm system can only send fire alarms but failed to report accurately ignition point. So a fire seat intelligent identification system was designed based on wireless sensor networks. The system collects data from wireless sensors using ZigBee wireless communication technology, and carries on cluster analysis on the data set using the improved fuzzy kernel clustering algorithm, and gets accurate clustering results. Finally the ignition source location information is reported to the fire alarm control center. The experimental results show that, compared with other methods, this system realizes real-time monitoring and automatic identification of fire seats, which has virtues of high sensitivity and accuracy and high-speed data transfer.
