This paper shows the robustness path planning for mobile robots in indoors environments. The planning includes an accurate uncertainty in position analysis and the probability of success calculation as a path quality measurement. A topological and metric environment model, for the environment representation, is proposed. This model includes localization and risk transit zones. During the planning process, all the paths to complete a mission, are generated. Obtaining parameters such as: goal uncertainty, path feasibility, path distance and path uncertainty. These parameters allow the most adequate paths selection to fulfil a mission.
