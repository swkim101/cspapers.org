Standard mechanical methods for ground locomotion almost universally rely on wheels to translate rotational motion developed by a power train into linear motion. While the power trains used to provide this rotational motion vary significantly, it will still inevitably end up being transferred through a system of shafts and gears to end at a wheel. In recent years the use of legged locomotion has gained traction as a viable alternative to the wheel [1-5]. In certain types of rough terrain, traditional wheeled systems have trouble functioning. This project focuses specifically on designing and building a high efficiency lower extremity exoskeleton capable of enhancing the walking and load carrying abilities of a human operator. Traditional exoskeleton systems can achieve these load carrying goals, but generally, do not have the range to operate for more than a few hours away from an external power source [6-10]. This exoskeleton design will attempt to provide the similar load carrying capabilities of previous systems without requiring the operator to recharge the system during a typical shift (ex. A soldier carrying a load over the course of a full day).
