In todayâ€™s world, Internet is playing a major role in fetching information from various sources. Smart devices generate valuable information and are widely available because of development in advanced protocols and cheap electronics. Manufacturers are developing smart devices keeping in mind that, in near future, these devices will have connectivity to external world for communication. It appears that in coming years, we all will be surrounded by these smart devices. To achieve the vision of connecting the smart devices for better communication, Internet of Things (IoT) has gained lot of attention. The authors are introducing various segments of IoT based on application and communication technology. The authors have described architecture and basic building blocks of IoT enabled devices followed by two applications. It is demonstrated that how IoT plays an important role in the field of healthcare application e.g. patient monitoring and connected car. In healthcare application, it is shown that how wearable devices play a key role in monitoring various medical parameters. Authors introduce the concept of connected car and the role of IoT in connected car. This will help the academic researchers in understanding and implementing the IoT not only in described domains but can also be applied in other domains as well.
