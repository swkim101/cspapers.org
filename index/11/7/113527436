This preliminary study investigates the performance and cognitive loading of the two commercial wheelchairmounted assistive robotic manipulators (ARMs) with their original user interfaces (UIs). This study of 20 able-bodied individuals evaluated the performance of two user interfaces, keypad and joystick, using six tasks on an activities of daily living (ADL) task board with environment-independent measures, self-reported cognitive loading and questionnaires. Participants performed tasks with two commercial arms with their original UIs in a randomized order of arm and the six tasks on the adl task board. Performance was evaluated using completion time, throughput, and trajectory parameters. Self-reported measures of workload and questionnaires were also administered. Statistical performance differences were found in the translational tasks (p<0.05) in task completion time, throughput, and difficulty. The keypad showed faster performance on the knob turning task. Similar responses were reported in the perceived workload with both UI. Participants rated the UIâ€™s low on frustration and physical workload, but higher on mental effort. The findings of this study provide a preliminary comparison between two commercial ARMs with their original UIs. Barriers and recommendations for training and evaluation for first time users were discovered. The results provide information to help develop ARM UI and recommendations for clinicians and health service providers to develop better training and evaluation for arm users.
