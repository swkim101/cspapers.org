Stone laying is one of the most important design work for stone manufacturer, and it is also the basis of board processing. The geometry area which is decorated is varied. It exists not only "flat" and "closed", but has their own different characteristics. In this paper, stone laying will be divided into three parts: line laying, board type laying and special-shaped slab laying. By analyzing its characteristics and using computer-aided design, according to the method of parametric design and the parameters which are input, we can output corresponding laying rendering. It can improve the machining efficiency and utilization rate of stone, and achieve the intellectualization of stone design and processing.
