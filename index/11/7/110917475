Sampled-data backstepping control of a quadrotor UAV is presented in this paper. The discrete time controllers have been designed on the basis of a continuous time system model and an approximate discrete time equivalent system model (Euler Approximate model) obtained using the Euler method. The performance of the controllers obtained using the two sampled-data approaches has been compared in the presence of wing gusts and modeling uncertainties. Simulations have revealed that the backstepping controller designed on the basis of an approximate discrete time model has better performance in the presence of wind gusts and modeling uncertainties. In addition, the closed loop system has a larger region of attraction. Full Text: PDF DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.11591/ijra.v4i2.973
