With the development of oil field production demand today, pumping unit is developing towards the direction of energy saving, intelligent. According to the present status of the oilfield, this paper designed a kind of intelligent energy saving pumping unit system, the system acceleration and deceleration process is very short, most of their working time in uniform motion in a stroke, and the beam pumping unit has been alternating deceleration process all the time compared with good energy saving effect. Energy store system is designed, the system not only reduces energy consumption, and make the motors can be started with initial velocity, shorten the motor start-up time, the motor starting current is stable running current of 4 to 7 times, so that reduces the starting current impact. To test this idea, modeling of motor, and the simulation analysis, the results confirmed the idea very well. Finally, in the principle of the pumping unit system prototype experiments, the experimental results show that the pumping unit system has significant energy-saving effect and the intelligent characteristics.
