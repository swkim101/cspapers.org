Hovering robots intended for ying indoors are naturally constrained by the width of doorways and hallways made for humans. Their limited rotor diameter prevents them from carrying heavier payloads or batteries due to the power requirements of small rotor disc areas. To sidestep this problem, we propose adding several rotors stacked vertically to increase effective rotor area. Properly designed, the vertical configuration may reduce the overall power requirement, compared to a single rotor, and also allows for decoupled ight mechanics. We have constructed a proof of concept aircraft with two rotor modules and six manoeuvering vanes to explore the design and control problems of this configuration. We state the aerodynamic case for stacked rotor power economy, propose a decoupled orientation-translation PD control scheme and demonstrate the helicopter in stable hovering ight.
