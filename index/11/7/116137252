The term Omni-robotics is very seldom used as part of our terminology speech. We have a tendency to classify our robots by manufacturer and number of axes or more appropriately degrees of freedom, or DoF. Some of us still define a robot by the early concept. A robot is a machine that handles the three Dâ€™s; Dull, Dirty and Dangerous. The word omni is defined as; all. This could lead to the calling of all 6-axis arms, omni-arms. What this means is all the arms have the same type of motion and have the same basic function; to move the end-effector from point A to B. All 6-axis robots from Kuka, ABB or Yaskawa Motoman have the same basic function. What makes them unique is the end-effector or payload. I am sure colleagues from these companies will want to talk to me about the generalization. We do not consider having a whole factory with the same robot model; we then differentiate its job by the end-effector and the software to control it. This paper will look more at the basic hardware than the complex software used to create a full functioning robot.
