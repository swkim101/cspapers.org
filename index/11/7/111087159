There exists many shortcomings in automotive collision avoidance system, signal interference is very serious, which led to false frequently, this is an important reason why the perfect vehicle collision avoidance system is not consummate and widely popular. We study and propose a new solution of highway automotive collision avoidance, by the control of time the precise synchronization, interaction between the vehicle lane, speed, time, and other information, which solve the problem of signal interference greatly. Thus, his new solution provides a split-new thinking and research direction for highway automotive collision avoidance.
