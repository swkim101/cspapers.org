Aim at special requirements and limitations of new type carrying technique for special technology well logging, one new type worming pipe robot was put forward based on combination mechanism, it can be used in the new type carrying technique. The walking principle of the robot was given and walking kinematical model and driving torque model were set up in this paper. Further more the virtual prototype was made and kinematical simulation analysis had been accomplished. The numerical results validated the design theory and analysis conclusions of the robot were correct. The robot can have bigger tensile draw.
