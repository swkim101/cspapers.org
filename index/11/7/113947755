This paper introduces the N-ey[any] Wheel system, a set of modular wheels that enable bespoke platform development for rapid field deployments. The N-ey Wheel is inuenced by existing modular and inspection robots but provides a simple-to-operate solution to exploring various environments. Each wheel provides two degrees of freedom allowing any continuous orientation to be achieved within a plane. Onboard computing and a wificonnection enables the N-ey Wheels to operate individually or collaboratively. Heterogeneous robot platforms can be created as required through the use of adaptors. With robots of differing shapes, sizes and configurations able to be created at run time as demonstrated within the laboratory and in the field. The dynamic nature of the system model dictates the control characteristics providing differential, Ackerman and nonholonomic omnidirectional control options to the user.
