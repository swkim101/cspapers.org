In order to help driver to know the fuel efficiency of his car, the application software for information management of car oil consumption was developed based on the Android phones. The oil information filling up the car and the gas station information are inputted by the driver using the software each time. Then the fuel consumption information could be counted automatically. The statistic results could be shown as table, chart or curve respectively. The calculation method of car oil consumption is proposed based on the amount of oil left. It is more accurate and effective than traditional method which is based on oil lamp.
