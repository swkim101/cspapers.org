In order to increase rolling efficiency and production quality, adopted the finite element method, the rolling force analysis model of 3500mm rolling mill is established in this paper based on the thermal mechanical analysis theory, According to the rolling technology parameters in actual production, the rolling process of plate rolling is systematic studied, which thinks about the thermal stress caused by uneven temperature distribution. The law of technology parameters influencing rolling force is gained, which uses in the optimization of rolling process, improves production efficiency. it has important significance to reduce the energy consumption.
