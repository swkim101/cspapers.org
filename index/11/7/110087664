The Strategy of Indoor 3D Fine Modeling is discussed in the paper. The element task of data acquisition, image processing and texture mapping are finished though some different tools. Then, three-dimensional visual modeling of a laboratory in Nanchang Hangkong University is realized with the application of the key technologies about modeling. Significantly, the indoor application of virtual reality will be promoted. The influence of model fineness on system operation speed and visual fidelity during the modeling process is tested, and the modeling strategy is proposed.
