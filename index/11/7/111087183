The traditional way of the matching between suspension parameters and vehicle performance is that we assess the matching of suspension design parameters through the driver's subjective experience, this will lead that the vehicle development cycle is long and high cost, meanwhile the matching during the parameters of suspension is blindness. With the development of computer technology, combining the modern design theory and virtual prototyping technology, based on multi-body system dynamics method, the virtual prototyping model of mini passenger car was built. By using understeering degree, roll rate and total RMS acceleration values as evaluation indexes, the orthogonal experiment was designed and the range analysis was carried out, and the effects of the suspension structure parameters on handling stability and riding such as suspension rate of front suspension and rear suspension, torsion stiffness of antiroll bar, damping ratio of front suspension and rear suspension and so on were studied. Then the remarkable factors are found, the final results supply guidance and support for the optimization of the suspension parameters.
