This paper deals with aspects related to modeling, simulation and development of the drive and control systems for a modular robotic system for inspection and exploration. In the first part of the paper the proposed robotic system model is presented. In the second part of the paper the robotic system simulation in MATLAB / Simulink is presented, obtaining the necessary data to dimension the actuators. The command and control developed systems are presented in the end of the paper.
