It is our great pleasure to present the Symposia and Workshops on Ubiquitous, Autonomic and Trusted Computing associated with the UIC’09 and ATC’09 conferences. These Symposia and Workshops provide vibrant opportunities for researchers and industry practitioners to share their research experience, original research results and practical development experiences in the new challenging research areas of ubiquitous computing, autonomic computing and trusted computing. It is the first time that that the UIC/ATC conference series added Symposia and Workshop to its program in order to provide a wide range of topics that extend beyond the main conferences. The goal was to provide a better coverage of emerging research areas and also forums for focused and stimulating discussions. We received thirteen applications for workshops and this shows that the community affiliated with the UIC/ATC conference is a very active and vibrant research community. In the proceedings we present nine Symposia and Workshops that were established as part of the UIC’09/ATC’09 conferences. Six of these symposia and workshops focus on the area of ubiquitous intelligence while the remaining three address a variety of research issues in autonomic and trusted computing.
