Object tracking is one of the most important components in numerous applications of computer vision. Much progress has been made in recent years. The Tracking-Learning-Detection (TLD) algorithm achieves excellent performance on a set of challenging video sequences. However, classical TLD algorithm fails to track non-rigid pedestrian as complicated appearance, varying viewpoints, shape changes and occlusions. In this paper, we follow the TLD and propose a robust KMD framework which consists of the Kalman filter tracker, random ferns pedestrian detector and the pedestrian model. During the tracking process the tracker and detector are complementary: the Kalman filter tracker predicts the motion, the pedestrian detector searches the best-match appearance and the pedestrian model combines performance of both to determine final result and generate new samples for learning. Experimental results show our framework comparatively improves performance for pedestrian tracking in surveillance videos.
