While large organizations develop applications with new technologies, it is often necessary to leverage the investments made in legacy applications and reuse business functionality provided by them. Hence, such organizations need scalable distributed applications that are integrated based on an enterprise-wide strategy. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an answer to address these requirements. With the advent of web services, SOA based enterprise applications have become vendor independent to a large extent. The paper provides insights gathered through providing SOA based solutions in consulting engagements. It discusses the Strawman Architecture for Enterprise-Wide Service Oriented Architecture. Reference Architectures for SOA based Enterprise Applications on J2EE and .NET platforms, using Design Patterns, are detailed. It presents the SOA methodology recommended to customers. The solutions discussed in the paper are reusable across domains and the implementing organizations would benefit in terms of considerable time and cost savings.
