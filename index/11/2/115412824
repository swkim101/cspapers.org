As fabrication technology moves to 100 nm and below, profound nanometer effects become critical in developing silicon chips with hundreds of millions of transistors. Both EDA suppliers and system houses have been re- tooling, and new methodologies have been emerging. Will these efforts meet the challenges of nanometer silicon such as performance closure, power, reliability, manufacturability, and cost? Which aspects of nanometer design are, or are not, under control? This session will consist of a debate between two teams of distinguished representatives from EDA suppliers and system design houses. Which side has the right answers and roadmap? You and a panel of judges will decide!
