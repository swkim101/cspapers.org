Wireless sensor is a miniature battery powered device with limited energy; It contains a large number of the wireless router sensors in wireless sensor networks. Once these batteries placed in these sensors and deployed to the environment, we would be very difficult to artificially replace the battery, run out means of wireless sensor networks "death", so the battery energy is very precious. The energy levels of the network, in other words, to extend the life of the wireless sensor networks, has become an important research focus and design challenges. Today, LEACH is the most representative and most influential representation algorithm in the Topology control method field. To improve LEACH algorithm, Our novel IR-LEACH uses a new cluster head percentage of 3.79%; redefine the concept of round; cluster head transmission of data using a multi-hop transmission; TTL data segment is added to the cluster-head data. Simulation results display that IR-LEACH implement the above discussed improvements effectively and efficiently and improves the network lifespan over LEACH.
