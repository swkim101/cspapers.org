Based on PN junction population, flow model is set up to consider the amount of land to simulate the population migration, and take into account the level of economic development, the factors combine and incorporated into the analytical framework of a model derived the probability of a combination of multiple factors under conditions of population migration. The results of this simulation model can effectively explain the process of urbanization of the population flow problems, is an innovative model generality, there is some reference in the theoretical study.
