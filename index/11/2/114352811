This paper describes a vision-based technique for predicting whether non cooperative moving objects are possible collision threats. The technique predicts the time to minimum separation (TMS), as well as the absolute minimum separation (AMS), to identify object(s) that pose a threat based on a predefined safe separation zone. Theory demonstrates how the TMS can be estimated by measuring changes in the target’s angular visual position as captured by the on-board vision sensor. Furthermore, we show how the AMS can be estimated from the calculated TMS and the size of the object’s image. The performance of the technique is demonstrated through simulations, as well as in outdoor field tests using a rotorcraft.
