To gain a deeper understanding of human manual 
dexterity, we investigate an everyday manual interaction, 
recording hand kinematics, the involved forces and eyemovements. 
Using a multi-sensing approach we hope to develop 
a more complete understanding of what we have termed manual 
intelligence, with a view to enabling robots carry out complex 
tasks that we take for granted. A preliminary experiment was 
carried out which illuminated important aspects of manual 
intelligence such as where to look to find suitable grasping 
points, as well investigating differences in hand kinematics 
and the applied forces while carrying out a simple manual 
interaction.
