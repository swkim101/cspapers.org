This course introduces the operational and denotational semantics of PCF and examines the relationship between the two. Topics: Syntax and operational semantics of PCF, Activity Lemma, unde nability of parallel or; Context Lemma ( rst principles proof) and proof by logical relations Denotational semantics of PCF induced by an interpretation; (standard) Scott model, adequacy, weak adequacy and its proof (by a computability predicate) Domain Theory up to SFP and Scott domains; non full abstraction of the standard model, de nability of compact elements and full abstraction for PCFP (PCF + parallel or), properties of order-extensional (continuous) models of PCF, Milner's model and Mulmuley's construction (excluding proofs) Additional topics (time permitting): results on pure simply-typed lambda calculus, Friedman's Completeness Theorem, minimal model, logical relations and de nability, undecidability of lambda de nability (excluding proof), dI-domains and stable functions Homepage: http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/people/luke.ong.html CONTENTS 2
