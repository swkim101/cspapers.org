The work focuses on synchronization of time-delay chaos systems. A theoretical analysis for time-delayed system is provided. By using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach, a synchronization condition is obtained. Finally, conditions are used for synchronization of time-delay chaos systems, and simulations verify the validity of obtained result.
