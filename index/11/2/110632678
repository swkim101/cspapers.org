Path planning is a key factor in intelligent transportation vehicle navigation system, compared to a variety of advantages and disadvantages of the path planning optimization algorithm. According obstacle distribution characteristics similar characteristics to the grid circuit resistor, proposed a Circuit Map path planning algorithm. The city's roads each segment was mapped to the circuit network, and the resistance of the resistor were mapped to with the Weighted sum of road length and width, and traffic density. This can be achieved by solving the circuit that intelligent transportation systems path planning and navigation services.
