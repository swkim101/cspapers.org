Exoskeletons1 are defined as devices worn outside of human limbs, to enhance power, force, durability, or load carrying capacity of a person or to regain lost or weak limb functionality. A complete exoskeleton has structural elements, joints, actuators creating support for the human motion and movement intention recognition devices. Market is expected to increase substantially; for medical exoskeletons2 gives a growth expectation of $16.5 million in 2014 to $36.5 million in 2015 and $2.1 billion by 2021. High wearing comfort is the key requirement for all types of use, currently hardly being met by any exoskeleton. Efficiency of the actuation systems is crucial for that comfort to make size and weight of energy sources and prime movers low and operating time high. Therefore, light weight and compact actuators and power supply system are essential. In3 acceptable weights are seen in the ranges of portable consumer electronic devices for the hand, or of a backpack for the spine or hip. A major behavioral property is to emulate the natural human motion. Human walking, for instance, has a strong passive portion. Power is transferred from the ankle joint to other body segments.4 The free swing of the shank should be facilitated by releasing the knee joint actuator, thus, back-drivability and low inertia of the actuation system are important.
