Tailor welded blanks stamping forming technology of automotive panels has been widely used in the lightweight of automobile. The simulation research on forming and spring-back of tailor welded blank U-shaped parts was done to analyze the influence of various parameters on the spring-back and find a way to improve forming properties of tailor welded blank U-shaped parts. The optimal analysis method of combining numerical simulation with experiment was adopted to explore the influence of compensation factor on the forming precision. Finally, a reasonable initial iteration compensation factor was found to compensate the mould surface directly. Aiming at forming characteristics of tailor-welded blanks, a segmented compensation method was proposed and used on the U-shaped parts which can improve the precision of components effectively.
