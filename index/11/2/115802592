We show that the class S_2^p is a subclass of ZPPNP. The proof uses universal hashing, approximate counting and witness sampling. As a consequence, a collapse first noticed by Samik Sengupta that the assumption NP has small circuits collapses PH to S_2^p becomes the strongest version to date of the Karp-Lipton Theorem. We also discuss the problem of finding irrefutable proofs for S_2^p in ZPPNP.
