In the paper a very simple parallel robot intended for some celestial orientation applications (satellite dishes, sun trackers, cameras, telescopes etc.) is proposed. After describing the mechanism and its kinematics, the workspace and the presence of the singularities are studied. The dimensional optimization to maximize the workspace is described, taking into account the constraints due to telescopic leg lengths and transmission angles.
