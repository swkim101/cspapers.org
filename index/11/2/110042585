For the problem that the stability of surface Electromyographic EMG(sEMG) based human-machine interface(HMI) declines as the muscle fatigue takes place, an improved incremental training algorithm for online support vector machine(SVM) is proposed. This paper study the changes of sEMG when muscle fatigue occurs by the method of continuous wavelet transform, and then apply the improved online SVM for sEMG classification. The novel method adjusts the parameters of SVM model to adapt itself based on the changes of sEMG signals and the training data is conditionally selected and forgot. Experiment results show that the presented algorithm performs high modeling precision and training speed is increased. Furthermore, this method effectively overcomes the influence of muscle fatigue during long-term operating sEMG based HMI.
