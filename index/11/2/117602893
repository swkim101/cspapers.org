Virtual testbeds are used for the comprehensive development and testing of complex systems even before building the first hardware prototype. In this paper, we present a virtual testbed for optical sensors in robotic space systems. It comprises configurable simulation models for cameras and laser scanners, interfaces to real sensors, error models, environment models and analysis tools. The simulation models are calibrated and validated using reference experiments executed in parallel in real and virtual test setups. From these test setups we extrapolate to the application scenario of an orbital rendezvous with the full cycle of optical sensors, pose estimation and dynamic spacecraft control. An analysis toolbox allows the engineer to explore the parameters of the system and answer critical design questions.
