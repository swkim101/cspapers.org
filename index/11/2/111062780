In this research, Project-Oriented and Problem-Based Learning Strategy (POPBL) was applied in wheel robotics study for undergraduate students studying in the Electronics Department. During the application, competition was used to evaluate the study result of students with the assistance of teaching assistants. This research was aimed to explore the effectiveness of POPBL in wheel robotics study. The study results proved that POPBL can significantly improve the learning efficacy of learners, as well as their operational capacity.
