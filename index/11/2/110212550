In this paper, preliminary effort of pre-flight test lateral control method study is presented. Parameters and coefficients of candidate UAV (Unmanned Aviation Vehicle) are calculated for modeling and linearization. For controller design, dynamic inversion is used to cancel the dynamic coupling between attitudes. Stability of inversion loop controller which applied on non-ideal inversion is studied. Finally, simulation is present to compare the PI and nonlinear PI controller based on dynamic inversion.
