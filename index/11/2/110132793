In this paper, we designed an automatic system and automatic test software, and they can carry out Kunming rats bioelectromagnetic measurement in standard status and anesthesia automatically in anechoic chamber where the electromagnetic field outside is shielded, the reflection wave is absorbed, and the measurement accuracy will be improved. We get a great number of measurement data with frequency-sweep measurement method. The mean and standard deviation of amplitudes vs. frequencies is calculated and analyzed. The results show the measurement method is feasible. We have plotted the means of measured data as multiple sets of Y values in a series of bars with standard deviations bars included and distributed in the frequency axis of X. It is found that the fluctuation of the mean and standard deviation in some frequencies is not evident which may explain frequency window effects, while in other frequencies, such a fluctuation can be obviously observed, which may suggest that bioelectromagnetic signal is influenced by biological activities (standard and anaesthesia status) in these frequency points.
