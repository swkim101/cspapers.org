The TPMS can not only save fuel and protect the tire, but also make the driver more safety. Tire safety is attracting the driver's attention, the United States had developed laws to enforce the TPMS installation in the car and the deadline is in 2008. In this paper, the basic structure and the implement method of TPMS are introduced. The active sensors are already used in most of the TPMS applications. The SAW theory and some wireless passive SAW pressure and temperature sensors which suit for the TPMS application are illustrated, because the passive sensor is becoming the focus in the TPMS research field. Passive SAW sensor is the good choice for TPMS, according to its wireless, passive, zero age rate, small size etc. The wireless passive SAW TPMS is one of the most important research direction. In this paper, some kinds of passive SAW sensor are introduced, which are used in TPMS.
