The cyber-physical systems (CPS) are large-scale intelligent complex systems by the deep integration of technology and the physical systems. The cyber-physical power systems (CPPS) are the key technology to implement the objective of smart grids, by seamlessly integrating the computing, communication and sensing technologies with the power system. The existing research of CPPS is limited to the survey. This paper firstly presents the concept of smart power object applied to CPPS, which often is a power device object adopts RFID technology to identify itself, feeds back its real-time states, and has certain coordination ability. Then, on this basis, the key technical problems of global optimization and local control based on CPPS is further studied, such as control model, construction strategy, coordination control mechanisms, and communication mechanisms. Finally, it is applied to regional voltage optimization control to implement smart optimization control in low voltage power system.
