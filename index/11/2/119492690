The facial expression recognition technology has been widespread concerned and researched, and many methods have been presented. This paper focuses on studying and analyzing the feature extraction, feature dimension reduction and two-against-two multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, and an algorithm is proposed for recognition of six basic facial expressions. According to expression feature information in the different face region, the algorithm adopts local nonuniform feature point extraction to reduce the feature dimension. After transforming the feature points with Gabor filters, the Gabor expression features are obtained. And the feature dimension is further reduced by discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT). At last, the tow-against-two classification method and an optimum decision scheme are used to realize quick and accurate expression classification. Experimental results show the algorithm can achieve higher recognition rate, recognition speed and stronger robust.
