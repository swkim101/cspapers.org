The numbers of alternative models, methods and applications of operations research are very large. This paper presents fundamental and general decision and information structures, theories and two examples that can be expanded and modified in several directions. The discussed methods and examples are motivated from the points of view of empirical relevance and computability. SDP with LP or QP subroutines and oil sector application. Stochastic dynamic programming, SDP, is often the optimal method. SDP can be extended to handle very large dimensionality in the decision space, as long as the dimensionality of the state space is not too large, since SDP can be combined with linear or quadratic programming subroutines for every state and stage. A typical application of relevance to this method is described by the following problem: We want to optimize the many interdependent activities in an industrial sector, such as the oil sector, in a country. The international oil price, for instance the Brent crude price, is impossible to predict with high precision. It may be regarded as highly stochastic and of central importance to the optimal decisions in the sector. The amount of oil in the oil reserves, in the country, is another variable of fundamental importance. This can be controlled by decisions within the oil producing country.
