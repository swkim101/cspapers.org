This article falls within the field of abstract argumentation frameworks. In particular, we focus on the study of frameworks using a proof procedure based on dialectical trees. These trees rely on a marking procedure to determine the warrant status of their root argument. Thus, our objective is to formulate rationality postulates to characterize the marking criterion over dialectical trees. The behavior of the marking procedure is closely tied to the alteration of trees, which is the keystone of any model of change based on dialectical argumentation. Hence, the results achieved in this work will benefit research on dynamics in argumentation.
