Wireless communication technologies are rapidlyspreading too many new areas, including the automation and theimportance of the use of wireless technologies in the dataacquisition, building control, monitoring systems and automationof manufacturing processes will grow. Intelligent modern robotsand cooperative multi- agent robotic systems can be veryefficient tools to speed up search and research operations inremote areas. Robots are also useful to do jobs in areas and insituations that are hazardous for human. The main aim is to build a robot which work multidimentionally and can be controlled by various devices such as mobile phone, T.V. remote and through movement of human hand in addition it can also used as an automation device as well.
