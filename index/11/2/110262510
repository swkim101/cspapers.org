The concept of path planning and collision avoidance are two of the most common theories applied for designing and developing in advanced autonomous robotics applications. NI LabView makes it possible to implement real-time processor for obstacle avoidance. The obstacle avoidance strategy ensures that the robot whenever senses the obstacle stops without being collided and moves freely when path is free, but sometimes there exists a probability that once the path is found free and the robot starts moving, then within a fraction of milliseconds, the robot again sense the obstacle and it stops. This continuous swing of stop and run within a very small period of time may cause heavy burden on the system leading to malfunctioning of the components of the system. This paper deals with overcoming this drawback in a way that even after the robot calculates the path is free then also it will wait for a specific amount of time before running it. So as to confirm that if again the sensor detects the obstacle within that specified period then robot donâ€™t need to transit its state suddenly thus avoiding continuous transition of run and stop. Thus it reduces the heavy burden on the system.
