The author proposed concepts of Operator Fuzzy Logic and λ-Resolution in 1984. He and his cooperaters have obtained some theoretical results. This paper introduces λ-paramodulation to handle a set of clauses with the predicate of equality, and thus the equality substitution can be used in fuzzy reasoning. Then the λ-paramodulation method is proved to be complete with λ-lock-semantic method. Finally, Yang Fengjie and I have improved the λ- paramodulation, and proved that the linear λ- paramodulation is complete too.
