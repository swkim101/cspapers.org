Self reconfiguring robots are complex robotic systems composed of a finite number of modules, where each module of the system is considered to be a simple agent. Based on this con¬text, the reconfi¬guration represents the process of re-arranging each agent of the robotic system in order to have a working system. One versatile method to determine the most adequate movement and reconfiguration algorithms can be done us¬ing modeling methods and tools. Using this approach, the control algorithms necessary to drive such a system can be modeled, tested and implemented in an embedded system much easier than in a classical approach. This paper presents the case of a self reconfiguring robot for which, a reconfiguration algorithm and a movement algorithm were determined, analyzed, tested and validated.
