Fourier-based learning algorithms rely on being able to efficiently find the large coefficients of a function's spectral representation. In this paper, we introduce and analyze techniques for finding large coefficients. We show how a previously introduced search technique can be generalized from the Boolean case to the real-valued case, and we apply it in branch-and-bound and beam search algorithms that have significant advantages over the best-first algorithm in which the technique was originally introduced.
