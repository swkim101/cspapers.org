are satisfied. As is known, the functions i r and i ω should satisfy the conditions of transversality which are r(0) ≠ 0, r(T)≠0 (since left and right endpoints of the trajectory ( ) t Λ are fixed) and H=0 because the maneuver end time T is not fixed and the Hamiltonian Н is independent of time in explicit form. After substitution Eq.(4) in expression for H and the requirement H = 0, obtain the equation ( ) 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 2 4 0 r J r J r J a a + + − =
