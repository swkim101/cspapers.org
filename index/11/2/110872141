Aiming at the application requirements of miniaturization and energy saving in the field of high voltage power supply, a high voltage switching power supply with soft switching technology was designed. The soft switch technology which makes the loss of switch power supply decrease obviously,and the dual voltage rectifier technology can effectively reduce the volume of switching power supply. Circuit parameters of switching power supply are optimized in order to further improve the efficiency of power supply. From the experiment results, the high voltage switching power supply meets the design requirements, and suitable for the strict requirements of environment on the volume and efficiency.
