The present paper briefly describes the dynamics behavior of mechanical structures when they are subjected to a non-ideal energy power supply source. Different approaches which can be used to reduce the amplitude of vibration in the structure are described. Main results obtained during dynamicâ€™s explanation shows that by adjusting the non-ideal sources one can influence positively the response of the physical system.
