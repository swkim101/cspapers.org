Semantic Web Service technology is the solution to system integration and business collaboration for smart government which is cross-border and heterogeneous on a large scale. However the tremendous Web services search space caused by the wide range, large scale and complex e-government business systems is one of the great challenges for smart government. The paper focuses on researches about service discovery in e-government business integration for smart government. In accordance with the application environment and the current technical status of e-government, the author proposes a multi-strategy Web service discovery method on the basis of the proposed semantic model. The discovery process comprises three stages: keyword query with semantic enhancement, IO semantic matching and PE semantic matching. Finally similarity calculating method is proposed to evaluate the matching degree of each candidate service for service selection as well as the conclusions.
