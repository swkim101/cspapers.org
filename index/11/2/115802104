Now, in most cases in the absence of hand artificial limbs, which bear only the cosmetic purposes that, actually, is a manual model without functionality. Electromechanical artificial limbs which allow replacing partially functionality of a full-fledged hand are widespread poorly at present and have limited functionality, and also are available to still limited circle of users. Especially this situation is characteristic of Russia that is explained by influence of several factors: the certain structure of schemes of social insurance causing an order of financing of prosthetics for the state account low consumer ability of the people who have lost a brush and, of course, absence in the market of decisions in various price segments with the significant level of functionality. The technology of recognition of gestures of electromyography activity based on neural network or an analog of network is the cornerstone. The bracelet is put on a hand (in case of disabled people, a stump), further noninvasive electrodes remove potential difference of neuromuscular activity; by means of an electric circuit there is data handling and their transmission to the processor where by means of a neural network there is a recognition of a gripper or movement of a knee, further data are transferred for control of a bionic hand or leg. This article represents the last results of research on creation the system of the control artificial bionic hands or leg by company LLC Bionic Natali.
