Failure prediction is of great significance for power electronics systems. Taking the metro vehicle charger circuit as an example, soft failures are discussed. The paper established the system simulation model through MATLAB/SIMULINK, and carried on spectrum analysis with POWERGUI module, and analyzed system output when the parameter changed. With regard to charger circuit, the inductor should be replaced when the inductance drops to 1/2 of the normal. It is important for the on-site maintenance personnel to troubleshoot failures, improving the working reliability of metro vehicles.
