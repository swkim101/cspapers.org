In order to prevent large scope blackouts, the paper has established a model of power system cascading failures from the perspective of risk .Taking both the load of branch and the power flow changes into account, the model defines the probability of branch outage which can reflect the real-time operating condition. The consequences severity of cascading failure is measured by bus low voltage, power line overload level and the amount of isolated loads. In the process of searching fault link, the paper uses the structure transmission importance of branch to determine the next breaking branch, which can speed the search of the cascading failure mode. The simulation of the IEEE 39-node system shows the effectiveness of the method.
