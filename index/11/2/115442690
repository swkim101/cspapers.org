stability and running stability. With the development of industry, the application of industrial 3D printers will surely play an important role. 7 In the industry, the disturbance factor is complex, which will inevitably have higher requirements for the stability of the industrial 3D printer. 8 Improvement of control stability is to optimize 3D printerâ€™s controller algorithm, including the application of classical algorithm and artificial intelligence algorithm in 3D printer. The improvement of running stability refers to the optimization of control technical indexes, including overshoot in control parameters, lag time constant, steady-state error, etc.
