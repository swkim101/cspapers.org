In order to solve data lack of underground water research and monitoring situation, a wide range underground water lever dynamic information monitoring network system was designed. Remote monitoring terminal based on the techniques of embedded and wireless transmission monitored the change of underground water level; Monitoring analysis center based on the JAVA technology of B/S architecture was designed to inquiry the real-time data,set parameter and analyze data, etc. An approximate water level point was obtained by adopting the modified small period prediction model and the weight distribution method. This enhances reliability of monitored data. By utilizing the technology of GPRS wireless data transmission and Ethernet technology, a remote and real-time data transmission channel was build. Large area application in Shanxi Province shows that the system has the stable performance and the reasonable structure. System can provide long-term reliable data for underground water research.
