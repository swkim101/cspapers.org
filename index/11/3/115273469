Biosignals originates from living beings carries significant information. Current noise filters can easily remove noise that usually accompanies with biosignals during acquisition. Nonetheless, small signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) which have the amplitude of in microvolts (Î¼V) requires complex filters. In many EEG research practices, averaging is still the chosen method to eliminate noise in EEG. In this paper, moving averages and single-trial averages are demonstrated to be used as a notch filter and eliminate noise of spontaneous activity of EEG, respectively. These methods will later be used in real-time EEG acquisition to detect real-time habituation.
