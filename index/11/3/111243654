The Wireless Sensor Network applications has widely been used over the last few years. WSN is a novel self-organization wireless network which is made up of randomly distributed sensor Nodes. Due to some resource constraints, the design of security in WSN encounters a great many of new challenges. It is vulnerable to attack, which is harmful for availability of WSN. In this paper we propose a trust-aware and location-based secure routing protocol which protects WSN against routing attacks, and also supports large-scale WSN deployments. The proposed protocol is extended from GPSR protocol, which imports security mechanism that depends on a distributed trust management system. The solution has been shown to efficiently detect and avoid malicious nodes.
