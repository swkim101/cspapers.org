In view of debris flow monitoring for complicated mountainous terrain, network topology is impacted by environmental change, this paper designing a structure-free network topology to enhance network robustness. While applying the weighted resampling algorithm, to avoid monitoring data loss, make sure fairness transmission sensor nodes. To solve the problem of energy consumption and the time delay in wireless sensor networks, a real-time data aggregation algorithm proposed to reduce the redundant information transmission, to improve the energy efficiency. The simulation results show that adopted the network model of data aggregation is effective in reducing the energy consumption and improves the quality of network communication, while meeting the requirements of real-time monitoring.
