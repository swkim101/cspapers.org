In order to improve the efficiency of the coated seed dryers, improve the drying quality and reduce energy consumption, the adaptive control technology of coated seed dryer was studied. Detection system for temperature measuring, material level measuring, and wind speed and direction measuring were fixed on the drying equipment. According to the detected data, the adaptive control system controlled the dryer blade to adjust the temperature and intensity of air intake. This technology accurately controlled the drying air temperature, moisture and moisture content in the seeds. The test results show that the drying efficiency is 1.38 times of the original dryer, while the power consumption reduces to 40.05%, and intake air temperature reduced 19.84Â°C, which can improve the seed activity.
