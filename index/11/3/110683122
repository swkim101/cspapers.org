Aiming at the problem of low accuracy of indoor positioning by singular wireless access point, this paper proposes a method which is based on the result of weighted calculation using the positioning of two wireless access points. In the experiment, the method use two wireless access point to acquire the signal samples respectively in an office, using the signal propagation model and manifold regularization model to study the surroundings. At the positioning phase, the final position can be obtained by weighted calculating the results of the two wireless access point and the nature of triangular midline. The experimental results show that using the proposed method, the average error value is 20% lower than the corresponding version, using singular wireless access point.
