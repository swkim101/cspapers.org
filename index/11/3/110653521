This paper considers the problem of trajectory deviating for a class of roboticized roadheader. The motion model of roadheader is first established based on the analysis of excavation construction procedure, then the fuzzy control strategy based on dual-modality structure is proposed to realize directional adjustment and forward-walking control. The relationship between steering angle and driving wheel speed and the establishment of fuzzy control model are mainly focused. The experiment results indicate that the control strategy can satisfy the requirements of excavation construction procedure, and the remote control of roadheader can also be conducted. It is shown that the proposed approach can take an important role in few or unattended roadheader working face construction.
