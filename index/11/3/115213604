We present a computational framework for chord invention based on a cognitive-theoretic perspective on conceptual blending . The framework builds on algebraic speciﬁcations, and solves two musicological problems. It automatically ﬁnds transitions between chord progressions of different keys or idioms, and it substitutes chords in a chord progression by other chords of a similar function, as a means to create novel variations. The approach is demonstrated with several examples where jazz ca-dences are invented by blending chords in cadences from earlier idioms, and where novel chord progressions are generated by inventing transition chords.
