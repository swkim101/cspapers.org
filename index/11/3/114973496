The present paper aims to determine the mean gap between the level of perception and expectation of employers toward Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) engineering graduates based on a set of attributes. The present study was conducted by interviewing 301 employers from different industries or sectors in Malaysia for the UKM engineering graduate study. The attributes were measured using five-likert scales, and the data were analyzed using the mean gap. The findings clearly show that the perception of the employers toward UKM engineering graduates is quite satisfactory, whereas their expectation is unimportant. Employers urgently need employees with sufficient skills that can work immediately. Hence, their perception and expectation are important for them to recruit engineering graduates.
