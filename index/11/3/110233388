Due to the emergence of more and more composite armors, research related with equivalent target has practical application background. Composite armor with different physical properties between the layers weakens jet penetration effectively. If the equivalence relations between composite target and homogeneous one can be established, homogeneous target with a certain thickness takes the place of composite plates, the test cost will be slashed. After the principle of equivalent target and research methods to be introduced in brief, the jet penetration composite target for energy consumption and the jet penetration composite target depth research have been explored, the establishment about the equivalent target method of the armor-piercing projectile penetration composite armor is proposed.
