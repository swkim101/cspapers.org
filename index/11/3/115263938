Rayleigh-Taylor fluid instabilities are studied in the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit by applying boundary integral mathematical formulations to solve Laplace's equation with Dirichlet conditions on complicated boundaries. Instabilities in both the flute and sausage modes are studied for an accelerating thin cylindrical plasma, and calculations demonstrate the basic nonlinear dynamics of the z-pinch geometry. The dynamics and mathematics of plane thin shells and thin shells in cylindrical geometries with axisymmetric flow are discussed.
