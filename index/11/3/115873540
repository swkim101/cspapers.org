The present article presents an iterative ﬁlter approach for the computation of optical-ﬂow. The ﬁlter is based on an update and propagation loop. The propagation stage takes the currently computed ﬂow to predict the value at the next time iteration. The update stage takes this prediction, together with the stream of images, and corrects the optical-ﬂow ﬁeld. This leads to an incremental approach to build optical-ﬂow. Regions of the image where no ﬂow computation is possible are ﬁlled in by a diﬀusion term in the propagation step. Ground truth validation of the algorithm is provided by simulating a high-speed camera in a 3D scene. The local computations and convolution based implementation is well suited for real-time systems with high-speed and high-acuity cameras.
