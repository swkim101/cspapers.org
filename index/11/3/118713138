Deep convolutional neural networks perform better on images containing spatially invariant noise (synthetic noise); however, its performance is limited on real-noisy photographs and requires multiple stage network modeling. To advance the practicability of the denoising algorithms, this paper proposes a novel single-stage blind real image denoising network (RIDNet) by employing a modular architecture. We use residual on the residual structure to ease the flow of low-frequency information and apply feature attention to exploit the channel dependencies. Furthermore, the evaluation in terms of quantitative metrics and visual quality on three synthetic and four real noisy datasets against 19 state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the superiority of our RIDNet.
