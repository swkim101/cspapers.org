This paper introduces the Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI) algorithm for POMDP planning. PBVI approximates an exact value iteration solution by selecting a small set of representative belief points and then tracking the value and its derivative for those points only. By using stochastic trajectories to choose belief points, and by maintaining only one value hyper-plane per point, PBVI successfully solves large problems: we present results on a robotic laser tag problem as well as three test domains from the literature.
