In this paper, we deal with robust detection of defects that can occur on fastener heads peripheral side. In machine vision, the first necessary step is design good illumination system that can give image with good contrast between good and bad samples. In our case, it is difficult to devise such a god illumination system. First, we find the outer boundary of fastener head using binarization, connected component analysis and checking local distribution of intensity. Then four control points on outer boundary is chosen to ease finding the inner boundary of fastener head using polygon approximation and line fitting. Finally, decision can be done using two detected boundary points of fastener head.
