A sequential dynamical system (SDS) (see [BH+01] and the references therein) consists of an undirected graph G(V,E) where each node {nu} {epsilon} V is associated with a Boolean state (s{sub {nu}}) and a symmetric Boolean function f{sub {nu}} (called the local transition function at {nu}). The inputs to f{sub {nu}} are s{sub {nu}} and the states of all the nodes adjacent to {nu}. In each step of the SDS, the nodes update their state values using their local transition functions in the order specified by a given permutation {pi} of the nodes. A configuration of the SDS is an n-tuple (b{sub 1}, b{sub 2}...,b{sub n}) where n = |V| and b{sub i} {epsilon} {l_brace}0,1{r_brace} is the state value of node {nu}{sub i}. The system starts in a specified initial configuration and each step of the SDS produces a (possibly new) configuration.
