INTRODUCTION l am going to describe my pe,-.~onal views about managing large software developments. I have had various assignments during the past nit,.: years, mostly concerned with the development of software packages for spacecraft mission planning, commanding and post-flight analysis. In these assignments I have experienced different degrees of successwith respect to arriving at an operational state, on-time, and wi th in costs. I have become prejudiced by my experiences and I am going to relate some of these prejudices in this presentation.
