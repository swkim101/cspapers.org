Itâ€™s no accident that PCB design was one of the first electronics design tasks to which computer technology was applied in an effort to automate the process. The Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry really had its roots in the need to handle the explosion in circuit complexity brought about by the advent of digital electronics and, in particular, the rise of the microprocessor in electronics design. Traditional manual design techniques became too cumbersome to manage when faced with the onslaught of higher pin counts, multi-line signal buses and growing numbers of board layers.
