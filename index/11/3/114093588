This paper presents a case study in engineering for global development. It introduces the Village Drill, which is an engineered product that has—5years after its introduction to the market— enabled hundreds of thousands of people across 15 countries and three continents to have access to clean water. The Village Drill creates a 15cm (6 in) borehole as deep as 76m (250 ft) to reach groundwater suitable for drinking. The case study presents facts for the actual development and sustaining and are unaltered for the purpose of publication. This approach provides the reader with a realistic view of the development time, testing conditions, fundraising, and the work needed to sustain the drill through 5 years of sales and distribution. The purpose of the case study is to provide sufﬁcient and frank data about a real project so as to promote discussion, critique, and other evaluations that will lead to new developments that inspire and inform successful engineering for global development. As part of the case, the paper describes six fundamental items: the product, the customer, the impact, the manufacturing, the delivery, and the revenue model of the drill. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4036304]
