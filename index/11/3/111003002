there is a novel data transfer integration system by using single image proposed in this paper. There are many sensors use to monitoring the landslide occurred or not, but the monitoring results have different transmit protocol such as: Wi-Fi, transmit line, 2.4 GHz and ZigBee. This system is a data transfer integration system for all sensors, and it can achieve a real time monitoring system. The system integrate many sensor signals to microprocessor, and convert analog signal to digital signal by using A/D converter, i2c and UART, and the measuring results of sensors and display on a 8*8 matrix LED board. The system use the existing landslide-monitoring camera, and the matrix LED board install in the monitoring area. The result of sensors can be transmit to monitoring center by using single image, the data will not affect by environment, weather and mountain terrains.
