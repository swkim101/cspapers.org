Robotics is known as a new revolution to the entity of beings that varies according to its uses. In modern day environments, robotics and automation are involved in almost every industrial activity and conveniently improve the efficiency, productivity and reliability of a system. Autonomous Guided Robot (AGR) systems are classified as rover based robotics that require vision type and touch sensors. The AGR should be able to maneuver and counteract with the environment using sensors to detect the obstacles around, remember its current position and calculate a new path to take. Robotics Automation with industrial robots in combination with Internet of things, the birth of intelligent flexible automation systems, with the technical advantages of intelligent flexible automation systems, the company recently signed several million more than the contract, industry all over the hot die forging automation, automation of internal combustion engines, engine Assembly, automotive automatic battery swap station and so on. Thus, in this paper an over view of the significance of path planning and internet of robotic things is presented.
