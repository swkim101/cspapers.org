The applicability of lexicographic comparison in nonmonotonic reasoning with specificity is investigated. A priority mechanism based on lexicographic comparison is defined for Rciter's default logic. The following principle - earlier used by Geffner and Pearl in conditional entailment - is used as the basis for specificity-based priorities for normal default theories for each rule there is a context where it may not be defeated by any other rule. A method for computing priorities according to the principle is given Connection to earlier work is discussed.
