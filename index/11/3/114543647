Abstract: The two-wheeled mobile non-inverted-pendulum (NIP) robot which is the topic of this paper is a new prototype of a two-wheeled mobile pendulum robot with two internal devices. The pendulum contains the control devices; it is not inverted and free to oscillate. The robot actuation mode is insured by the potential energy of the internal devices. It has two actuators and the free oscillation of the pendulum is mechanically controlled. The robot mechanical structure, the kinematics, the dynamics are given.
