First being too start of fresh and develop new ideas into working prototypes and test their application and use in realworld situ-actions. Such an approach is useful for developing NDT techniques for 3D printed objects, however the demerit of such an approach is that it can be time consuming and require much trial and error, in addition the lacking of reliable data bank of knowledge also adds to the speculations related to the reliability of judgments based on these techniques. The second approach is to use existing NDT technology and to modify it for using in newly development ways. The benefit of this approach is that using the existing NDT technology adds to the inherent reliability of tools and the newly development modification or method of use brings confidence in real-world application [1-2].
