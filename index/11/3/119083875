The error repair process in software systems is, historically, a resource-consuming task that relies heavily in developer manual effort. Automatic program repair approaches enable the repair of software with minimum human interaction, therefore, mitigating the burden from developers. However, a problem automatically generated patches commonly suffer is generating low-quality patches (which overfit to one program specification, thus not generalizing to an independent oracle evaluation). This work proposes a set of mechanisms to increase the quality of plausible patches including an analysis of test suite behavior and their key characteristics for automatic program repair, analyzing developer behavior to inform the mutation operator selection distribution, and a study of patch diversity as a means to create consolidated higher quality fixes.
