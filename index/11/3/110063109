The purpose of health prognostic is to predict the future health status of system and determine the time from the current health state to functional failure completely. Application data time series analysis method often can get the expected prediction effect. Taking into account the failure characteristics of the actuators in flight control system, the autoregressive moving average model is introduced to health prognostic. The prognostic model is established. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the algorithm.
