A new class of six-bar mechanisms with symmetrical coupler-point curves is presented. This class of mechanisms is made up of a four-bar linkage with an additional dyad to form an embedded skew pantograph. Because the coupler curve generated at an output point is amplified from that of a four-bar, a compact mechanism with a relatively large coupler curve can be obtained. In addition, due to their structure arrangement, the analysis and synthesis of such mechanisms can be easily achieved. Finally, an example mechanism from this class is illustrated and compared with a four-bar linkage with the same coupler curve.
