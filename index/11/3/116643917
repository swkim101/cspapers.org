This introductory paper aims to construct a framework using the System Dynamics theory to conduct a cost-benefit analysisof the development of any smart grid project. Since the current evaluation methods are static in nature and ignore the consideration of uncertainty in the process, a different method should be adopted. The theory of System Dynamics and its relevance has been explained and the smart grid scenario is given. The cost-benefit analysis model with System Dynamics could dynamically evaluate all the benefits by allowing any factors to be changed during the grid development process, this model aims to evaluate smart grid more comprehensively.
