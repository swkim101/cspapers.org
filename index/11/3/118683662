Let [Formula: see text] be an instance of the stable marriage problem in which every vertex ranks its neighbors in a strict order of preference. A matching [Formula: see text] in [Formula: see text] is popular if [Formula: see text] does not lose a head-to-head election against any matching. Popular matchings generalize stable matchings. Unfortunately, when there are edge costs, to find or even approximate up to any factor a popular matching of minimum cost is NP-hard. Let [Formula: see text] be the cost of a min-cost popular matching. Our goal is to efficiently compute a matching of cost at most [Formula: see text] by paying the price of mildly relaxing popularity. Our main positive results are two bicriteria algorithms that find in polynomial time a “quasi-popular” matching of cost at most [Formula: see text]. Moreover, one of the algorithms finds a quasi-popular matching of cost at most that of a min-cost popular fractional matching, which could be much smaller than [Formula: see text]. Key to the other algorithm is a polynomial-size extended formulation for an integral polytope sandwiched between the popular and quasi-popular matching polytopes. We complement these results by showing that it is NP-hard to find a quasi-popular matching of minimum cost and that both the popular and quasi-popular matching polytopes have near-exponential extension complexity.
