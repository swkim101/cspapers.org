Parallel robots find many applications in human-systems interaction, medical robots, rehabilitation, exoskeletons, to name a few. These applications are characterized by many imperatives, with robust precision and dynamic workspace computation as the two ultimate ones. This paper presents kinematic analysis, workspace, design and control to 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) parallel robots. Parallel robots have received considerable attention from both researchers and manufacturers over the past years because of their potential for high stiffness, low inertia and high speed capability. Therefore, the 3 DOF translation parallel robots provide high potential and good prospects for their practical implementation in human-systems interaction.
