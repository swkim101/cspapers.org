This paper presented the loss of the power grid and elaborated the distribution features of the power grid in Anhui, pointed out that measures should be taken to improve the structure of Anhui power grid for energy-saving according to its own specific characteristics. Suggestions includes the construction of UHV power grid, the breaking out of looped network, the construction of multi-circuit transmission lines on the same tower, scientific adjusting the grid operation voltage, improving the power factors, and adjusting the load. Based on the rules and characteristics of grid power loss, measures should be adopted on special ways to get the largest energy-efficient operations and achieve the aim of less investment to increase economic efficiency.
