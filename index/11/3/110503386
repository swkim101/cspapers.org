Many optimization problems, such as manufacturing process planning optimization, are difficult problems due to the large number of potential configurations (process sequences) and associated (process) parameters. In addition, the search space is highly discontinuous and multi-modal. This paper introduces an agent based optimization algorithm that combines stochastic optimization techniques with knowledge based search. The motivation is that such a merging takes advantage of the benefits of stochastic optimization and accelerates the search process using domain knowledge. The result of applying this algorithm to computerized manufacturing process models is presented.
