The past decade witnessed a growing concern about the increasing energy consumption of central air-conditioning. Traditional PID control is practicable in partly cutting energy costs but not in achieving their energy-saving potential fully for those central air-conditioning, especially in great nonlinearity condition. To achieve this, the fussy-PID control and management-matrix strategy are introduced in this paper, with their advantages such as: better dynamic responsibility, better adaptability, better robust control, mathematic model invariant and heating/cooling on-demand allocation. Based on this theoretical assumption, an experiment is designed and implemented in a university library. Consequently, the experiment proves that the combined control system, with fussy-PID control and management-matrix strategy, is stable, fast, and feasible in energy-saving of central air-conditioning by targeting at its water system control.
