This paper is based on ANSYS finite element analysis software for the platform. It gets the hoister spindle device overall assembly analysis by the finite element theory and method, and gets the overall stress and strain of convective cloud. It is the foundation for further overall structure optimization design and assembly analysis research. It gets topological optimization analysis for the board of the picture of drum, and gives humanoid pore model board important reference value. It provides effective theoretical basis for mine hoist spindle devices the whole optimization design.
