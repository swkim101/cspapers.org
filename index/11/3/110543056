Owing to harmful gas emissions and high accident rate of diesel engine in the coal mine trackless auxiliary transport, the spring of trackless rubber tyre electric vehicle powered by the battery pack comes. This paper considers the drive system to improve the performance of the electric vehicle. In order to adapt to the complex environment of coal mine, the analysis of basic structure for trackless rubber tyre electric vehicle was based on the three-phase AC induction motor. After elaborating the vector control theory of induction motor, the field-oriented vector control system model of trackless rubber tyre electric vehicle drive system with induction motor rotor was built in Matlab/Simulink. The simulation shows that the proposed control algorithm permits the drive system to achieve good steady and dynamic performance.
