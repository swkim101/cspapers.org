This paper describes the frequency electrostatic dust-phase power design, triggered by SCR phase control method to achieve closed-loop control of three-phase AC voltage regulator of the main circuit, designed three fold spark for spark control tracking control algorithm. Electrostatic precipitator and main circuit power supply is simulated, and the main circuit parameters were calculated, the results show that the system can be better used in industrial environments dust.
