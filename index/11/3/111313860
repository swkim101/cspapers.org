Large-scale software development requires the contributions of people with diverse skills. For example, on software development projects one might often find software engineers, technical writers, human factors engineers, graphic designers, and marketing representatives. A key challenge facing software engineering educators is to prepare their students to work closely with development team members from different disciplines. This paper traces some key problems students in a project-based software engineering course faced in collaborating with students from another discipline.
