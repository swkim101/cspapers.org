This paper considers the application of simulators or demonstrators in the development of mechatronic products. It is shown at what step of the mechatronic design process a simulator or demonstrator can be used to significantly improve a products quality and thus identify possible errors and provide potential workarounds. Cost reduction is achieved by the use of simulators or demonstrators in the early design stage and less real product tests have to be carried out which also could be hazardous for the test person.
