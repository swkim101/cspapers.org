To eliminate the effects for section automatic cutting because of roadheader pose error, Control system of pose error compensation for roadheader was proposed. First, make the control strategy according to the coal mine actual working condition and the working ability of machine each actuator; Hardware system structure is proposed based on the control system and the corresponding sensors are installed; Last, according to the working way of roadheader, put forward the specific control methods of pitch attitude compensation control and cutting boundary compensation control. The above system has been tested on EBZ200 type roadheader and the testing results show that the system function is correct and reliable and the control precision is high. This system could eliminate the effects for section automatic cutting because of roadheader pose error efficiently and lays a foundation for remote control of roadheaders.
