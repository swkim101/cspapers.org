In the high-voltage direct current transmission system, the difference value between the landing phase voltage and DC transmission system commutation failure of the critical voltage drop value, as system occurred in the critical value of commutation failure. When commutation voltage lower than the critical value would reduce arc Angle, caused by commutation failureã€‚Therefore, by using the method of reactive power compensation to keep converter bus voltage stability, can avoid commutation failure.
