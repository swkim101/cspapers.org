In view of the authentication model based on token and password of traditional web cloud storage easily is forgotten or theft that raise questions about identity theft. This paper proposes a identity authentication scheme of web cloud storage based on fingerprint identification. Using the identity authentication model of fingerprint identification to verify web cloud storage users that satisfy people to the web of cloud storage security, reliability and convenience of the proposed requirements, effectively solve the problem of the resource of unauthorized access. The paper put forward three layers of c/s architecture that effectively improve the flexibility, scalability and efficiency of authentication system. And mixed encryption algorithm is put forward as two-way authentication identity authentication protocol improve system security and realize high transmission of huge amounts of data. Finally through the test and analysis of practical application proves that the security authentication based on fingerprint identification applying in the web cloud storage certification system is feasible.
