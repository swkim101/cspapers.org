Industrial recommender systems have embraced deep learning algorithms for building intelligent systems to make accurate recommendations. At its core, deep learning offers powerful ability for learning representations from data, especially for user and item representations. Existing deep learning-based models usually represent a user by one representation vector, which is usually insufficient to capture diverse interests for large-scale users in practice. In this paper, we approach the learning of user representations from a different view, by representing a user with multiple representation vectors encoding the different aspects of the user's interests. To this end, we propose the Multi-Interest Network with Dynamic routing (MIND) for learning user representations in recommender systems. Specifically, we design a multi-interest extractor layer based on the recently proposed dynamic routing mechanism, which is applicable for modeling and extracting diverse interests from user's behaviors. Furthermore, a technique named label-aware attention is proposed to help the learning process of user representations. Through extensive experiments on several public benchmarks and one large-scale industrial dataset from Tmall, we demonstrate that MIND can achieve superior performance than state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy. Currently, MIND has been deployed for handling major online traffic at the homepage on Mobile Tmall App.
