This paper analyzes the effect of stable behaviors when amplitude, phase of sine voltage compensation signal are added in the system, reveals that the dynamical behaviors mechanism that sine voltage compensation signal changes feedback voltage-mode controlled buck converter lies in changing the duty cycle without impacting the system stable error via analyzing the change of period multiplier in Monodromy matrix and conditions of period bifurcation, and finally achieves stabilization control for bifurcation and chaotic behaviors. The simulation and experimental results prove the correctness of the theoretical analysis.
