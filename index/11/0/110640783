Aim. The full paper begins with a variety of Electro-Hydraulic Pump (EHP) and a review on work of existing hydraulic pump, resulting in, in our opinion, the conclusion that it is absolutely essential to in-depth study on the EHP, a highly integration of electric motor and hydraulic pump. We now present a model how to get temperature field of our design plunger EHP that we believe that it can much better develop the EHP. In the full paper, we explain our method in some detail; in this abstract, we just add some pertinent remarks to naming the topics, such as motor thermal model, the fluid model and the heat conduction model. We discuss the temperature distribution under the different leakage decided by oil film thickness. Finally we do simulations in ANSYS. The simulation results in the full paper show our method for the temperature field is efficient to design the EHP.
