The manipulators, used to handling products or devices in industrial departments, needs to be self-balanced in order to compensate the different weight of the load in its position in the workspace. The known technical solution for self-balancing with counterweight, springs and actuators can be substituted through a band mechanism. The paper proposed a new self-balancing solution for the conco-balancer manipulator with band mechanism and presents its synthesis approach. The non-circular profile of the band mechanism permits the variation of the compensated moment in order to be easy manipulated the load by the operator.
