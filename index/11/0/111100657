A new hybrid intelligent technique is proposed to evaluate photovoltaic cell model parameters in this paper. The intelligent technique is based on a hybrid of genetic algorithm (GA) and LevenbergMarquardt algorithm (LMA). In the proposed hybrid intelligent technique, the GA firstly searches the entire problem space to get a set of roughly estimated solutions, i.e. near-optimal solutions. Then the LMA performs a local optima search in order to carry out further optimizations. An example has been used to demonstrate the evaluation procedure in order to test the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed technique has better performance than the GA approach in terms of the objective function value, the computation time and the reconstructed I-V curve shape.
