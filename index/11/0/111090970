In order to resolve the problem of complex wire routing, reliability and lightning-proof difficulty in automatic monitoring system of water conservancy engineering, the paper proposes a volume-compact, easily connected wireless strain collector. The collector modulates the differential strain signal by half-bridge and precise instrumentation amplifier, and employs an up-to-date RF system on chip to realize digitalization for analog voltage signal and wireless transmission. The wireless sensor nodes based on TI's Z-stack protocol possess high performances of network self-organization and network self-healing, and support low power consumption in wireless transmission by sleep mode.
