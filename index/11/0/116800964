Now in fluid engineering the fluid drives with one degree of freedom are used. Such drive provides univocal constraint between input and output links motion. However it is necessary to use the variable transfer ratio between input and output links for overcoming of variable resistance force and inertia forces. Use of electronic control systems for force and volume regulating leads to extreme complication of drives, decrease of their reliability, raise of manufacturing cost and service. Recently the principle of creation of the fluid-flow self-controlled mechanism by use of fluid system with two degree of freedom has been developed. In the paper the compact Self-adjusting mechanism which provides force self-regulation without a control system is developed on this principle.
