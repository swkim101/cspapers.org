The start and speed control problems of motor were analyzed in port machinery, the advantages of frequency conversion and fluid viscous start were synthesized, the speeder based on frequency conversion and fluid viscous soft start was designed. The start of motor can be protected by fluid viscous soft start, especially in the stationary start under the load. The motor can be realized infinite speed control by frequency conversion device, the use safety of motor is protected and the work efficiency is enhanced, then the aim of energy saving is realized.
