The foundation of the entertainment industry came through the birth of vaudeville on 14th Street in New York City beginning in the 1880s. Created largely by immigrants and their children, vaudeville dominated show business in the United States during a five decade period from the 1880s to the 1930s. Through the integration of immigrant performers, entrepreneurs and cultural forms, vaudeville created a synthesis that was 
much needed during a time of mass immigration and cultural chaos. With the rapid evolution of electronic media during the 20 century – music publishing, sound recording, radio, motion pictures and television – vaudeville extended its multicultural influence by becoming the dominant model for a growing entertainment industry.
