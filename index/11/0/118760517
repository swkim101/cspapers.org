We study both the complexity and approximability of various graph and combinatorial problems specified using two dimensional narrow periodic specifications (see CM93,HW92,KMW67,KO91,Or84b,Wa93). The following two general kinds of results are presented. We prove that a number of natural graph and combinatorial problems are NEXPTIME- or EXPSPACE-complete when instances are so specified. In contrast, we prove that the optimization versions of several of these NEXPTIME-, EXPSPACE-complete problems have polynomial time approximation algorithms with constant performance guarantees. Moreover, some of these problems even have polynomial time approximation schemes. We also sketch how our NEXPTIME-hardness results can be used to prove analogous NEXPTIME-hardness results for problems specified using other kinds of succinct specification languages. Our results provide the first natural problems for which there is a proven exponential ( and possibly doubly exponential) gap between the complexities of finding exact and approximate solutions.
