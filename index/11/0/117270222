Nowadays many dynamic systems, both deterministic as well as stochastic by nature, have become more and more complex: nonlinearity, the influence of the time delays and time forecasting terms, etc. Applicability of such systems is widespread: system analysis of the safety problems and optimization of the diverse technical, technological, socio-economic and other processes. The concept of the complex dynamic system (CDS) and the problem of a creation and an investigation of the mathematical models of the CDS are in focus of a number of the modern scientific and engineering fields, and of the many other areas including the robotics and automation.
