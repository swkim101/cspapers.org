The detachment as well as reattachment of satellite components during a reconfiguration or repair process represents a challenging task, since the establishment of a stable contact between the connection interfaces of the satellite’s components and the robot manipulators of a servicer satellite is required. To asses such scenarios, we propose the application of a simulation driven approach. Our approach builds upon a Virtual Testbed for space environments and presents a novel collision detection algorithm tailored to connection interfaces composed of centering pins and holes. The algorithm performs contact manifold and penetration depth computation in real-time. To validate our approach, docking scenarios between a centering pin and an interface’s hole were performed within a dedicated setup in a series of reference experiments with real hardware and robots.
