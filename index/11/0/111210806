This paper introduces a robust high-gain observer based state of charge (SOC) estimator for lithium-ion batteries of automated guided vehicles (AGV) . The proposed observer scheme enhances the transient response speed and diminishes the effect of uncertainties. Furthermore, it overcomes the perturbation problem, which is caused by high gains since the proposed observer scheme adopts sliding mode control technique. In order to verify the effectiveness of the propose method, the linear RC battery model in ADVISOR is used.
