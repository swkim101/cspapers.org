Human Machine Interactions Systems (HMI) are decisive for acceptance and safety of new cockpits in the automotive as well as in the aerospace industries. A new design and simulation platform called INSIDES will be presented where virtual cockpit prototypes are being built based on 3D CAD geometry e.g. from CATIA and integrated with logical interaction data derived from UML specifications. This new development platform enables the continuous validation and check of new interaction concepts by involving usability engineers in the very early stage of the development cycle. Since the simulation work is being done in the context of the entire aircraft cockpit / car interior with all instruments, control commands as well as displays devices a better validation of HMI systems can be achieved.Copyright Â© 2006 by ASME
