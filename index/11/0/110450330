To deal with the lack of effective experimental data under the current condition for gearbox fault pattern recognition, the Wind Turbine Drivetrain Diagnostics Simulator (WTDS) was used for experimental investigation and gained large number of gear fault samples. The wavelet transform is employed to decompose the vibration signal to obtain the energy ratio in each frequency band. Taking energy ratios as feature vectors, the pattern recognition results are obtained by the support vector classification (SVC). The experimental results show that the hybrid approach is robust to noise and has high classification accuracy.
