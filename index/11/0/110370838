Traditionally compliant mechanism is difficult to achieve decoupling features, because of lack of definite theory and its deformability character. Whereas its counterpart - many rigid mechanisms with decoupling property have been designed and the method of mechanism design with decoupling feature is constructed. In this paper, an effective method to build equivalent transformation between rigid decoupling mechanism and compliant mechanism with decoupling property is proposed, and also applied to design new a decoupling rigid mechanism with 3-DOF. Finally, the decoupling features of the micro motion platform was verified through FEM analysis software ANSYS because of difficulty of compliant mechanism analysis.
