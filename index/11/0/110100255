The high-performance parallel computing (HPPC) has a better overall performance and higher productivity, for a generical large-scale army equipment system of systems (AESoS) simulation, and the runtime efficiency can be multiplied several tenfold to several hundredfold. The requirement analysis of simulation framework of AESoS based on HPPC was proposed. After the simulation framework of AESoS based on HPPC and its key techniques were discussed, the simulation framework of AESoS Based HPPC was designed. it is of great significance to offer certain references for the engineering application in the simulation fields of AESoS based on HPPC.
