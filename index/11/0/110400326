This paper summarizes works based on the reliability and the availability of embedded software architectures. Nowadays, the advent of the embedded systems has pulled the development of different domains (aeronautics, automobile, industry, medicines, telecommunications, household electrical appliances, so one so far). Indeed, the embedded system includes hardware and software that must collaborate to carry out well defined complex tasks. An embedded system is an integration of heterogeneous components (components of the computing and the electronics). Indeed, the implementation of the embedded systems presents some constraints which can be, for example the system cost, energy consummation, speed of execution, reliability, availability, security ...However, among these constraints enumerated briefly, the reliability and the availability of the software architecture of these systems are the object of complete study in this article.
