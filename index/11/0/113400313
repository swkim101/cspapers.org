When humans and robots perform complex tasks together, the robot must have a strategy to choose its actions based on observed human behavior. One well-studied approach for finding such strategies is reactive synthesis. Existing approaches for finite-horizon tasks have used an explicit state approach, which incurs high runtime. In this work, we present a compositional approach to perform synthesis for finite-horizon tasks based on binary decision diagrams. We show that for pick-and-place tasks, the compositional approach achieves orders-of-magnitude speed-ups compared to previous approaches. We demonstrate the synthesized strategy on a UR5 robot.
