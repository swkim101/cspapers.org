The application of 3G techniques in the field of embedded system has become one of the hotspots in recent years. This paper designs a CDMA2000 1x smart home system based on Cortex-M3 MCU(micro control unit). The performance of Cortex-M3 based embedded system is analyzed compared with ARM7 platform in terms of code density. From the analysis, it is proved in the paper that ARM Cortex MCU meets the requirement of emerging embedded smart home system.
