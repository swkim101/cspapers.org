Electric bicycles as a new means of transportation is gradually rise. this paper introduces hydraulic drive into electric bicycle, avoiding the problems of frequent adjustment and repair, and reducing the noise. Electric hydraulic driving bicycle may be a new road to develop the electric bicycle industry. This paper combines the working principle of electro-hydraulic driving bicycle, determining the performance parameters of electro-hydraulic driving bicycle, and the parameter calculation and selection of components in the hydraulic system.
