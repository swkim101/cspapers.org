The paper deeply studies early-warning system of carrying capacity in scenic spots, providing quantitative model support for early-warning system of carrying capacity. Indexes of early-warning system of carrying capacity in scenic spots is established, use GM(1,1) model to construct warning degree predict model. At last, Jifa agricultural ecological sightseeing garden as an example proves that the early-warning model designed is feasible and effective.
