Warping and distortion in plastic parts has been a serious problem in mold-injection.Traditional solution is to first produce a mold and then test the moldrepeatedly. By employing Moldflow, it can be easily to offer a precise analysisand prediction of warping in products. Meanwhile, the results can be used toadjust the designed structure and process conditions of the mold. Finally, themold and its products are optimized.
