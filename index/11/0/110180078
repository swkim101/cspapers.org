As the problem that loitering unit is vulnerable to stall because of air turbulence in the initial period of posture adjustment process, this paper is based on the classic flight control and the active-disturbance-rejection control principle, and uses the method of ADRC which based on RBF neural network. It designs the ADRC for the attitude adjustment of loitering unit in the initial period, and compares it with the classic flight control algorithm and the active-disturbance-rejection algorithm. Through the contrast of the control simulation for the three control algorithms we can obtain that, RBF ADRC is superior to ADRC control method and the classic flight control method.
