Aluminum is supposed to be admirable phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage due to its excellent heat storage density and thermal conductivity. However, its application is limited because of the flowability and corrosivity when it melt. The Al/AlN-Al2O3 composite PCMs with stable thermal energy storage performance were prepared by direct nitridation method. The research showed that nitridation temperature and nitridation time are key parameters of heat storage performance of the composite materials. The morphology and thermal energy storage performance and components of the Al/AlN-Al2O3 composite PCMs were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the tiny particles of aluminum powders were closely coated by AlN-Al2O3 encapsulating materials. This structure can prevent the flowability of the liquid aluminum and also can avoid environmental impact when the it melt, meanwhile , the composite PCMs have the performance such as stability, high thermal storage density.
