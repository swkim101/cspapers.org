The paper describes numerical analyses performed during the redesign of a heat pump and air-conditioning system of a sport hall, with heat pumps utilizing the sea water as a heat source. Dynamic models of building energy consumption and a heat pump system were used in order to evaluate energy consumption and costs, as well as to make decision about additive insulation of the building. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods were used to analyze and improve the air-distribution inside the hall.
