This paper describes the introduction and experience of working with the Brunei Diploma in Professional Development within the Department of Computer Science at Brunei University. The Diploma provides a coherent framework within which software engineering students can maximise the benefit to be gained from their work placement experience by developing their professional as well as their technical abilities. The framework has to cater for a large number of students working in a variety of jobs with many differing employers. A detailed competence led approach to assessment has been considered inappropriate. The procedures developed place responsibility on the student for much of the activity They emphasise the improvement of weak points rather than the achievement of high skill levels in existing areas of expertise. 1.
