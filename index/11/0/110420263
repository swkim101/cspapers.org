Several control methods are discussed in this paper and the function of feedback of control is analyzed. The most important function of feedback is supervision, thus, make full use of the feedback information is a good way to study control problems. By using the characteristics of open-loop and closed-loop control and the effects of feedback, the authors design a controller structure and provide a feasible multi-mode intelligent control algorithm, moreover, the excellent performance of the algorithm is verified by simulation.
