The slow-start threshold in the current TCP Reno algorithm is a fixed value, and it does not change with the current network congestion status, which is prone to end the slow-start course too early or too late. Round-trip time (RTT) can reflect the current network status better. The paper presents a dynamic adjustment algorithm of slow-start threshold based on RTT, by which the value of slow-start threshold is dynamically adjusted according to the current RTT. Simulation results show that it effectively reduces congestion collapse in congestion state, and throughput is further improved under ideal network status.
