Based on the actual physical appearance of the tuna and the wave equation derived from observing its swimming locomotion, this paper proposes a new idea on the simulation and modeling of the robot fish and a novel way of thinking on kinetic analysis. The motion law for each joint of the robot fish was first obtained through the discrete fitting method and the motion law was subsequently used as the basis for the robot fish electromagnetic drive control signal. The fluent flow field analysis software was utilized. The meshing of the fluid around the fish body was performed by using the dynamic grid technique. The surface pressure values of the fish body during the steady state forward movement were analyzed, and the values of the driving force of each part of the fish were obtained. It was then determined that the electromagnetic drive caudal fin robot fish was the optimal design. Based on the idea of digital-analog conversion, the drive control signal waveform was digitally discretized, then the C51 single-chip microcomputer and DAC digital-to-analog converter was used for conversion. The OPA544 op amp chip was then used to simulate the amplified output in accordance with the control signal waveform. Electromagnetic coil drive signal with variable frequency and voltage can thus be achieved.
