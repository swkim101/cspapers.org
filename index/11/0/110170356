In this article, a multi-dimensional adjustment target used in optical field is given, which is used to implement network control. The various constituent elements of electrically controlled design and implementation are described in details. Step motor is controlled by MCU and RS232 serial port. The light of integrating sphere is controlled by relay and RS485 serial port. Silicon detector is controlled by AD and RS232 serial port. The three parts are networked through the serial server finally. The control system with this method not only implements simply, but also can achieve remote operation. The approach is convenient in use.
