Mapua Institute of Technology has been constantly engaged in providing free, renewable energy to rural and under privileged communities. Guided by the mission and vision of the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering Department and of the Office of Social Orientation and Community Involvement, the school had implemented several renewable energy activities. This paper showcases 8 different projects — 6 hydropower plant projects, 1 human kinetic harvesting demonstration facility, and 1 wind turbine project. In this paper, implemented projects are presented briefly with emphasis on the different locations, local cultural settings and different experiences encountered. It will also share how students have changed from being participants to autonomous implementers of renewable energy projects for communities.© 2014 ASME
