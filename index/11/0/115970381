The first description of use of surgical robot was for taking neurosurgical biopsies with precision using PUMA 560 model in 1985 [1]. Subsequently another robotic system was designed so as to assist in performing transurethral resection called as PROBOT. A few years later, Integrated Surgical Systems developed a robotic system called ROBODOC in 1992 [2]. This robot was mainly used in orthopaedics where it was found to be useful in accurate implantation of prosthesis in knee and hip arthroplasty procedures. As these surgical robots were found to be very useful in assisting various procedures, need was felt to develop robot which could assist in holding laparoscopic camera. And soon a surgical robot came in to the market after FDA approval in 1994 by the name of AESOP [Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning] [3]. This was first of its kind robotic system which allowed the operating surgeon to control the position of the endoscope using either voice commands or a foot pedal. With further advancement in technology, first master slave robot called ZEUS robotic system was developed in 1998 which not only allowed the surgeon to control the endoscope but also provided platform to perform surgery from remote distance using manipulating robotic arms. Subsequently this robotic system was further refined and modified to develop da Vinci Surgical System which is the most widely used surgical robot in todayâ€™s surgical practice.
