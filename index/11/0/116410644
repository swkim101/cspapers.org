The article analyzes the microwave methods for measuring the material parameters, showing their advantages and disadvantages, discussed the criteria for selecting the measurement method. The authors proposed a modification of the method of the composite dielectric resonator. The proposed method has a high sensitivity in the measurement of dielectric constant and loss.
