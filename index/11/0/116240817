Patients occasionally required to be on an inclined bed for certain therapy. One easily understandable therapy is to help the blood circulation in the legs and feet. When a patient stays long in a horizontal bed, often will have a muscle clamp in the legs. If the bed can be adjusted to an inclined position the clamp can be stopped. The shear force between his hip and the bed affects strongly how long the patient can stay at that position and is expected to be a function of inclined angle. Shear force is a familiar terminology for mechanical engineers, but it may be not clear to layman outside engineering so a detail explanation is attached in Appendix. Certainly it is good to know exactly the force and the inclined angle how they are correlated. Our project is simply to find that relationship.
