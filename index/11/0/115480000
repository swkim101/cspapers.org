Requirements that express the needs of all stakeholders and cover the key aspects of a software system (such as those addressing sustainability) are critical to the system’s successful development and adoption. For practitioners who want to develop sustainable software-intensive systems, it is also argued that software requirements are the key leverage point. But what do software developers know about broader sustainability and sustainability requirements in particular? As part of the University of Huddersfield’s ’Student as a Researcher’ initiative, this paper provides a FishEye Lens View on how novice software developers who design and develop software systems at software companies relate to the notions of sustainability and sustainability requirements. The study has found that although sustainability is valued highly by the novice software developers, the concept of sustainability and sustainability requirements are not fully understood. This lack of knowledge in the software industry and organizations must be addressed to enable delivery of truly sustainability enabling software systems.
