this paper introduces a kind of virtual experiment bench for electronic controlled engine. The experiment bench based on a super electronic controlled engine gets rid of mechanical system, but reserves electrical components. The experiment bench has the characteristics, such as simple structure, safety, environmental protection and economical efficiency. Part of the sensor signals can be simulated through a variable resistance, and the working processes of some actuators are shown by light bulbs, so that the whole bench is easy to operate, and the working process is visual and direct. The bench panel is equipped with inspection terminals for easy measuring and teaching; several systems are combined onto one experimental platform, which can improve the comprehensive analysis ability of students. The bench can also be developed, designed and produced in the form of project by students under the guidance of teachers, thus to promote the scientific and technological innovation ability of students.
