In the computer vision, feature extraction is an important research orientation. Corner and edge detection is a basic technique for obtaining local feature in this image. In the paper, we propose a method that corner and edge of image is detected simultaneously by an annealed chaotic competitive network. The method is compared with several traditional methods of corner and edge detection algorithm, the experiment result shows a good performance. The clustering method can achieve the corner and edge detection simultaneously.
