A path planning method based on fruit fly optimization algorithm was proposed. An optimization algorithm by the foraging process of fruit fly was presented, and the mathematical model of fitness function was established. The algorithm steps employing the LabVIEW platform were achieved. The experiments of path planning were carried out. The experimental results show that the optimization algorithm can achieve the path planning and avoidance of mobile robot, and thus to verify the feasibility.
