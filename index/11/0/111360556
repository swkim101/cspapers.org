Study on the working principle of the surface acoustic wave (SAW) methane sensor. Establish the physical and chemical model of sensitive mechanism based on the mass-effect and the adsorption characteristics of gas on the sensitive membrane. The linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) has been developed to describe and quantify these various interactions. Simulate the mass-sensitive gas sensor based on COMSOL multiphysics software. The simulation significantly reduces the amount of prototype experiments, sensor development cycle and development costs.
