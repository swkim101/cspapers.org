A high-speed data collection and transfer system is designed in this paper. The hardware system is based on EZ-USB FX2 and high speed A/D sampling model based on MAX1198. The frame of hardware is discussed in details. Finally, the solution of software and the firmware flow are provided. The designed system has many advantages such as high-speed, plug and play, easiness to use and expand. It can be used for reference in universal research of real-time and high-speed data transfer system.
