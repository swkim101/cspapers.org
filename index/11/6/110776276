In order to enhance machining precision of complex surfaces with a flat-end cutter, the generating method of cutter contacting (CC) paths is presented in this article. With the method of coordinate transformation, effective machining radius of a flat-end cutter had been deduced and the step-over formed by two adjacent CC paths were implemented. The parameter increment along the CC path interval direction was calculated by using geometric analysis of the local area of CC point. The corresponding NURBS path of tool center points including knot vector and controlling points was obtained from the cutter contacting points.
