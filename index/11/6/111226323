The parameters of the traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller are hard to automatically adjust when the controlled object changes, which controls ineffective for time-varying, nonlinear system. Combine the fuzzy control and PID control, and use self-adaptive fuzzy control to achieve self-tuning PID parameters online. Using matlab simulation system, the results show that the self-adaptive fuzzy PID control effects have been improved than the conventional PID control.
