This paper describes the synthesis of a robust and non-fragile H∞ observer-based filter design for a class of parameter uncertain system with polytopic uncertainties, disturbances, and gain variations. We present the sufficient condition for filter existence and the method for designing a robust and non-fragile H∞ filter by using LMIs (Linear Matrix Inequalities) technique. Because the obtained sufficient condition can be represented as PLMIs (Parameterized Linear Matrix Inequalities), which can generate infinite LMIs, we use the relaxation technique to find finite solutions for a robust and non-fragile H∞ filter. We show that the proposed filter can minimize the estimation error in terms of parameter uncertainties, filter-fragility, and disturbances.
