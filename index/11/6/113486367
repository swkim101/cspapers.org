Introduction This position paper describes how we develop intermediate design knowledge through design research. The aim of our design research is to provide designers with knowledge that inspires the creation of novel design solutions for play, and to show design relevance of theory, illustrated by diverse prototypes. The purpose of the paper is to contribute to the discussion on how to conduct conceptdriven design research and how to construct and assess intermediate-level knowledge for interaction design. With concept-driven design research, we mean design research informed by theoretical concepts (Stolterman and Wiberg, 2010).
