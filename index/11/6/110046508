Tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) is used to monitor fast or slow tire pressure loss or too high tire temperature, and ensure the safety of the drivers and the passengers. A new kind of TPMS as the core of MSP430F149 microcontrollers is put forward, which based on Wireless Sensor Network. It adopts Infineon SP370 new sensor as the transmitter and TDA5220 as the receiver. The whole system scheme, hardware and software design are expounded in this paper. A low cost, low power consumption and high precision TPMS is studied, and the tire pressure and temperature can be immediately and real-time measured.
