In ∀∃-rules, the conclusion may contain existentially quantified variables, which makes reasoning tasks (as deduction) non-decidable. These rules have the same logical form as TGD (tuple-generating dependencies) in databases and as conceptual graph rules. We extend known decidable cases by combining backward and forward chaining schemes, in association with a graph that captures exactly the notion of dependency between rules. Finally, we draw a map of known decidable cases, including an extension obtained by combining our approach with very recent results on TGD.
