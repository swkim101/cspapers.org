This paper presents the development of an Assistive Technology representative product: an automatic page turner system, designed for persons with issues like multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonâ€™s disease and other various disabilities that involve the motor functions of the upper limbs. Firstly, the authors emphasize specific features of Assistive Technology and analyse the most important functional aspects concerning different types of page turner devices. The proposed page turner system is based on a four-bar mechanism. Design aspects from the constructive and functional points of view are exposed and the developed prototype is described.
