In order to solve the problem of early fire detection in the large space, a dynamic accumulated model is presented. The motion object is firstly obtained by using adaptive background subtraction. Three combined rules for flame detection are utilized. Dynamic accumulated model is implemented to compute the edge flicker of the motion object. Two features including circularity and area change are utilized to distinguished flame from other moving object. Experimental results indicate that the presented method has quick respond and can be used in outdoor environment.
