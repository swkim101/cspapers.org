Removable partition systems of the type embodying top and bottom tracks enclosing a plurality of channel shaped vertical studs and vertical wall panels secured to the studs by means of hooks extending from the inner surface of the panel to engage notches defined in the studs. The improvement consists in a hook strip secured to the inner face of the wall panel and including a hardened planar surface and a downwardly extending hook. The hook includes inclined top and bottom edges, a horizontal bight and an inwardly protruding camming surface. The horizontal bight rests upon the bottom of the notch, while the camming surface tension fits the inner surface of the stud so as to securely mount the wall panel with respect to the stud.
