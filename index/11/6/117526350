Recent investigations in gyroscope effects have demonstrated that their origin has more complex nature that represented in known publications. On a gyroscope are acting simultaneously and interdependently eight inertial torques around two axes. These torques are generated by the centrifugal, common inertial and Coriolis forces as well as the change in the angular momentum of the masses of gyroscopeâ€™s spinning rotor. The action of these forces manifests the internal inertial resistance and precession torques of gyroscopic devices. New mathematical models for the inertial torques demonstrate fundamentally different approaches for solving of gyroscope problems in engineering. This is very important because the stubborn tendency in engineering the increasing a velocity of rotating parts with different designs like turbines, rotors, discs and other rotating components leads to the proportional increase of acting forces that are expressed on their motions in space. This work considers a typical example of computing the action of internal inertial torques acting on the running disc.
