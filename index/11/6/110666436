For the problem of low efficiency of the ordinary hydraulic systems of the friction welding machine, operating characteristics and efficiency model of the force application hydraulic system of friction welding machine are studied. The energy consumption characteristics of traditional welding machine are simulated, the efficiency characteristics of the force application hydraulic system of friction welding machine is studied, and the energy consumption and efficiency model are deduced. According to theoretical analysis, the system efficiency can be improved by changing pump output flow and relief output flow. The simulation results show that the working efficiency of the new system can be enhanced to 24%. The new friction welding hydraulic system was used in actual production and the system efficiency can be improved to 22%.
