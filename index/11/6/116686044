This work demonstrates the training of a multilayered neural network (MNN) using the Kalman filter variations. Kalman filters estimate the weights of a neural network, considering the weights as a dynamic and upgradable system. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a tool that has been used by many authors for the training of Neural Networks (NN) over the years. However, this filter has some inherent drawbacks such as instability caused by initial conditions due to linearization and costly calculation of the Jacobian matrices. Therefore, the Unscented Kalman Filter variant has been demonstrated by several authors to be superior in terms of convergence, speed and accuracy when compared to the EKF. Training using this algorithm tends to become more precise compared to EKF, due to its linear transformation technique known as the Unscented Transform (UT). The results presented in this study validate the efficiency and accuracy of the Kalman filter variants reported by other authors, with superior performance in non-linear systems when compared with traditional methods. Such approaches are still little explored in the literature.
