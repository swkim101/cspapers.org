Contrary to the difficult for complex equipment in the parallel signal acquisition, thereby affecting the equipment condition monitoring results, Design a parallel signal data acquisition device and its collection method based on embedded system. It can achieve real-time multi-point data collection and analyze parallel signal data acquisition system structure and function, then giving the hardware design of embedded systems based on the chip, including the processes of mass storage system and a plurality of communication method. Realize of the equipment condition monitoring and fault diagnosis based on this.
