It describes the basic principle of velocity parameters measuring of car in operation, establishes the related mathematical model. It disigns an intelligent, integrated digital solutions to combination instrumentation of the car based on MC9S12DP256B. This system has advantages of high performance, high precision, low cost, low power consumption, good stability, sensitive respond and expandability. The system measures and shows online velocity parameters of the car. It has fuction such as safety alarm. The system reserves bus interface such as SCI and CAN, correspondences easily with other electronic engine control systems of the car.
