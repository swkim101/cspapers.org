OpenPHRI is a C++/Python software with several builtin safety measures, designed to ease robot programming for physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) and collaboration (pHRC). Aside from providing common functionalities, the library can be easily customized and enhanced, thanks to the projectâ€™s open source nature. The library is distributed online1 free of charge under the GNU LGPLv3 license2. OpenPHRI is written in C++ to maximize efficiency in terms of computation and memory footprint and to easily embed it in existing projects. Python bindings are also provided, since this language is largely used in the robotics community. An interface with the robotics simulator V-REP3 is also provided.
