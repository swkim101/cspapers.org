For the reasearch of magnetic memory testing parameters on the effect of magnetic memory testing signals, the method of uniform design experiment is used to arrange test, by the decision criteria of the minimum component change of magnetic field, the mathematical model is established based on the test result, quantify the influence of the magnetic memory testing parameters, and optimal regression equations are verified through the test results, and achieve the optimization of test parameters, the results for the determination of magnetic memory testing parameters and the range of choice to provide theoretical reference, and improve the reproducibility of test results.
