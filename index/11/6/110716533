Modular product platforms have been shown to provide substantial cost and time savings while still allow ing companies to offer a variety of products. As a result, a mul titude of product platform methods have been developed over the last decade within the design research community. However, comparison and integration of suitable methods is d ifficult since the methods have, for the most part, been developed in isolation from one another. In reviewing the literature in m odularity and product platforms, we create a generic set of twelv e platform design activities. We then examine a set of produc t platform development processes used at several different companies, and from this form a generic sequence of the activities . We then associate the various developed methods to the sequ ence, thereby enabling the chaining together of the vario us modular and platform design methods developed by the community.
