As the development of space structures is increasing fast, analysis on the characteristics of those deployable structures deserve to be paid enough attention to ensure a reliable deployment on orbit. For a deployable truss structure, more than one position can be chosen as the driving positions, especially when the structure has not only 1 degree of freedom (DOF), an available choice of the driving positions shows significant importance on the performance of the space deployable structure. This paper mainly deals with a planar deployable support truss structure for space antenna by means of the closed loop equations and the Kane equation to discuss the deployment characteristics by comparison of the driving torque needed over time. A full comparison of all the possible examples of deployment analysis results under different driving modes is presented. The results show the importance of the choice of driving movements and the design of parameters and also provide a useful reference to other related truss structures.
