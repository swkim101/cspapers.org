Space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) is a method to control the AC asynchronous motor. SVPWM technology applied in AC speed regulation system can not only improve the shortcoming of low voltage utilization in the pulse-width modulation (PWM) technology, but have little torque ripple and low noise advantages. In this paper, a SVPWM vector control AC asynchronous motor speed regulation system employing a core TMS320LF2407A-type DSP chip was presented, and simulated the speed regulation system by MATLAB SIMULINK. The obtained simulation results indicate that the proposed speed regulation system has excellent dynamic and static performance, thus SVPWM control technology of asynchronous motor based on DSP has been implemented.
