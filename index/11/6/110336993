The study object is Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) with front-wheel drive (FWD) pattern and wire-controlled braking system. The relations between pavement adhesion coefficient and recovery efficiency of regenerative braking were discussed. Consequences were concluded through theoretical derivations basing on the two-wheel model. Simulations were built and simulated within a certain HEV on the platform in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The results indicate that the recovery efficiency would experience an upward trend if the pavement adhesion coefficient declines.
