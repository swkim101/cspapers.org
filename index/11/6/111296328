Rural roads construction projects are expensive, this has led to difficulties in developing accurate construction plans and modeling the construction operation using a novel simulation system. In this field, the aim of this research is to create a knowledge driven rural road construction simulation system to assist satellite image in generating s and reliable road construction plans. Road construction operations of the resources have been identified, developed, classified and modeled through a comprehensive analysis of a Simulink road construction projects. For every road construction operation a GIS-based template for little models was defined and developed. The models abridge distance of the path on the roads construction between villages and automating the optimizing of works. Also, the models provide a roadmap for evaluating several shortest paths on road construction via Quad-tree decomposition of the satellite image. A simulation case study was modeled to identify applicability, usefulness and accuracy of the developed simulation system and results are presented in this paper. The study fulfilled that the system generated for fast marching.
