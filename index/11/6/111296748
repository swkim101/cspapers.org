A generator bearing temperature measuring system is designed, based on the LabVIEW8.6 and virtual instrument technology, in this paper. The hardware and software implementations of the system are introduced. The system is tested and analyzed both in algorithm of linearity and filtering effect. The experimental results show that the proposed system has good characters of good stability and high accuracy, which are valuable in engineering application.
