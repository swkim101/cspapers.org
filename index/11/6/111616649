The application of integrated robotics is becoming increasingly commonplace in day to day applications. The idea presented in this paper seeks to provide a convenient and a hassle-free means of cleaning public toilets whilst maintaining hygienic and sanitary standards. By using a counter to record the number of times of usage, a line follower mechanism to guide the robot and an RFID module to initiate the flushing, the cleaning operation is fully automated and requires low operational power. Furthermore, a robotic arm is part of the module, so as to thoroughly clean the toilet bowl. Such a provision will curtail the role of manpower in maintenance of public toilets to a great degree, and thus, serves as a win-win situation; a revolting objective is accomplished with considerable ease.
