In object detection, keypoint-based approaches often experience the drawback of a large number of incorrect object bounding boxes, arguably due to the lack of an additional assessment inside cropped regions. This paper presents an efficient solution that explores the visual patterns within individual cropped regions with minimal costs. We build our framework upon a representative one-stage keypoint-based detector named CornerNet. Our approach, named CenterNet, detects each object as a triplet, rather than a pair, of keypoints, which improves both precision and recall. Accordingly, we design two customized modules, cascade corner pooling, and center pooling, that enrich information collected by both the top-left and bottom-right corners and provide more recognizable information from the central regions. On the MS-COCO dataset, CenterNet achieves an AP of 47.0 %, outperforming all existing one-stage detectors by at least 4.9%. Furthermore, with a faster inference speed than the top-ranked two-stage detectors, CenterNet demonstrates a comparable performance to these detectors.
