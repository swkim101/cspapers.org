In this paper we present a general structure of a cognitive control system that allows a mobile robot to behave semi-autonomously while receiving tasks through vocal commands. Furthermore, the paper contains an analysis of human robot interfaces, voice interface systems and cognitive systems. The main purpose is to identify the optimum structure of a mobile robot control platform and determine the outlines within which this solution will be developed. The mobile robot using such a solution will operate in the services and leisure domain, and therefore the specifications for the cognitive system will be tailored to the needs of such applications.
