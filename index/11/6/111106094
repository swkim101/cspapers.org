With the number of the city vehicle increasing, traffic congestion has become a big problem. Thus the demand for vehicle accurate monitoring and scheduling is increasingly urgent. A wireless communication module based on GPS/GPRS has been designed in this paper, which is used to transmit the vehicle position information and other related data to the server wirelessly by GPRS. The STM8S207 microcontroller produced by the STMicroelectronics is used as the controller which is adopted as the communication module. The NEO-6M module and the wireless module MG323 with embedded TCP/UDP protocol are combined to acquire and monitor the vehicle data. The communication module designed in this paper can ensure the accuracy of GPS data and the real-time of GPRS transmission.
