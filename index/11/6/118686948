High-quality image inpainting requires filling missing regions in a damaged image with plausible content. Existing works either fill the regions by copying high-resolution patches or generating semantically-coherent patches from region context, while neglecting the fact that both visual and semantic plausibility are highly-demanded. In this paper, we propose a Pyramid-context Encoder Network (denoted as PEN-Net) for image inpainting by deep generative models. The proposed PEN-Net is built upon a U-Net structure with three tailored components, ie., a pyramid-context encoder, a multi-scale decoder, and an adversarial training loss. First, we adopt a U-Net as backbone which can encode the context of an image from high-resolution pixels into high-level semantic features, and decode the features reversely. Second, we propose a pyramid-context encoder, which progressively learns region affinity by attention from a high-level semantic feature map, and transfers the learned attention to its adjacent high-resolution feature map. As the missing content can be filled by attention transfer from deep to shallow in a pyramid fashion, both visual and semantic coherence for image inpainting can be ensured. Third, we further propose a multi-scale decoder with deeply-supervised pyramid losses and an adversarial loss. Such a design not only results in fast convergence in training, but more realistic results in testing. Extensive experiments on a broad range of datasets shows the superior performance of the proposed network.
