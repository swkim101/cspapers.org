To improve the ability of aircraft sortie generation, we propose a genetic method to model the aircraft spotting allocation optimal problem, and transform it to a constrained optimal problem. Sortie path and time from parking spot to catapult are calculated by pseudospectral method, and then the genetic algorithm is given in detail. Finally, an aircraft sortie scenario is given to prove our method. Simulation results testify our method satisfies the requirement of scheduling optimal and can help commanders on flight deck to control aircraft spot allocation.
