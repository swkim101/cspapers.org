Paper defects mean that there are some defects in the paper such as hole, emboss, and fold during the paper production, which mainly results from the limitation of technological level. In the past time, artificial visual inspection and off-line checking were often used to detect the paper defects. However, its shortcoming was highlighted along with the improvement of industrial technology level and increasing demand for paper. In order to realize the online detection and markers for paper defects, the project designs the on-line detection system based on line-scan digital camera. Firstly, the principle and detection scheme of the system for the paper defects was presented. Then the overall structure of the system was designed. After that, the hardware circuit of the system was designed using TMS320F2812 as main control chip. It mainly consists of the function of each module and the working process of the system. Finally, the software of the image acquisition system was presented. With the experimental verification, the system has advantages of low cost, high efficiency and strong resistance to interference. The functions and indexes achieved the design requirements.
