Variable cylinders internal combustion engine works with variable number of cylinders. For gasoline engines, the fuel consumption rate rises rapidly with the decline of shaft power when operating at low load. If we reduce the number of cylinders but keep a constant power, each cylinder has more load and then works with low fuel consumption. At the same time, the spare cylinder can be used as an air compressor to recycle the energy lost in deceleration, braking or idle state. Pressed air is the carrier of recycled energy. Experiments show the fuel saving function similar to small-engine cars and energy recovery similar to expensive hybrid cars.
