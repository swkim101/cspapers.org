Applications at the microscale usually require the scale reduction of dedicated mechatronic systems and corresponding functional integration, notably of mechanical structure – actuation – sensing (adaptronic concept). For its most part this talk presents a method and dynamic criteria for the design of optimal piezoelectric structures. An example of a monolithic optimally designed piezoelectric microgripper is given. Its closed-loop control is presented.
