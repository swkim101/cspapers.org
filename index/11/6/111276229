This paper introduces a platform that combines shape grammars with conventional simulation and analysis methods. The premise of this combination is to create an approach to synthesizing optimal shapes considering criteria requiring heat transfer and stress analysis for their evaluation. The necessary mechanisms and issues for integrating shape grammars with standard simulation systems are described. The benefits, challenges and future outlook of this approach with regards to traditional design synthesis systems are explored. Further, possible future research projects to extend the work are presented.Copyright Â© 2012 by ASME
