In this paper are presented some of the main issues in designing and developing of mobile robots in virtual environments that can be used for completing various tasks. Due to high complexity of robotic systems, real experiments are demanding unsatisfying timeframes and high financial resources. Other problems scientists encounter in real tests are the difficulty of concurrent use, space restrictions or hardware malfunctions. Several related studies are treating these issues by proposing the usage of virtual reality (VR) as a solution for reducing costs and decreasing development time. We are focusing our study on designing and developing of a virtual mobile robot and integrating it within various virtual environments. Furthermore, we describe the technologies that can be used to accomplish our goals, listing their good and weak points, we integrate our work in an immersive VR environment like Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and we present the study results.
