Particle swarm optimization algorithms have lots of advantages such as fast convergence speed, good quality of solution and robustness in multidimensional space function optimization and dynamic target optimization. It is suitable for structural optimization design. In this paper, manual transmission gear train of a tractor is taken as research object, the minimum quality and minimum center distance of the gear train is taken as optimization goal, the gear ratio, modulus, helix angle, tooth width and equilibrium conditions of the axial force are taken as the constraints, a multi-objective optimization model of the gear train is established. The optimal structure design programs and Pareto optimal solution are obtained by using particle swarm optimization algorithm.
