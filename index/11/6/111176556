Because of the transformer serving for a long time and the running environment being complicated , factors that influence the assessment of transformer remaining life have a variety of uncertainties coexistence or cross-existence. Due to this characteristic, introduce blind number theory into transformer life assessment, use blind number express evaluation parameter uncertainties, and establish transformer economic life evaluation model based on comprehensive health index .The model not only can give health status of the transformer and state level ,but also give remaining life expectancy ,remaining lifetime interval and corresponding credits, possibility of not more than a certain year.
