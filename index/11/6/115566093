In this paper, we present the latest version of our multi-modal, cellular artificial skin (HEX-o-SKIN) and a complete overview of the implemented self-organization features on a full-sized humanoid robot (HRP-2). We conclude with a vision on how to transfer HEX-o-SKIN to the next generation, cognitively and mechatronically, flexible electronic skin.
