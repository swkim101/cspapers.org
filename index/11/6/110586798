Power plant relay protection setting value of the hidden harm causes of relay protection device is not correct, safe and stable operation of the power plant. In this paper, from the angle of the safe operation of power plant, the hidden danger to plant with the protection setting is studied and then the risk evaluation method of power plant relay protection setting values of hidden trouble is proposed. From the power plant relay protection setting value considering two aspects of probability and consequences of potential outbreak of different values, value potential risk is considered, and of a certain power plant in Hubei was made the risk assessment and analysis, in order to verify the theoretical rationality and accuracy.
