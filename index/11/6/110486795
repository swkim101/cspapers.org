The reuse of industrial waste and urban sewage is a vital method for solving the shortage of water resource in China. Settling tank as a processing link in water treatment system widely used exercises a great influence on sewage treatment efficiency, and sludge emissions have a great influence on the operation of water treatment plant. Manual mud and mechanical dredge are widely used in most of the water treatment plants from the current domestic. The design used ultrasonic as a method for determination of sludge concentration, developped corresponding application control software, and finally completed a reasonable and feasible for settling tank intermittent discharge of sludge monitoring and emission control system.The result of our simulation system shows that the program operation is stable and maneuverability, and this set of monitoring on-line and control system has good application and development foreground.
