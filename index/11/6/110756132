The paper deals with the kinematics structures of the peripheral devices used in robotic welding systems. There are two categories of such devices: either manipulators for extending the working range of the existing robots or positioners for supporting the parts to be processed. In certain cases, the last ones are also turning the welding parts, contributing to the technological movement. Starting from the kinematics structures a series of these devices, some theoretical models as well as practically built machines on their basis are shown.
