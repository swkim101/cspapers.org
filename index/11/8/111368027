This paper splices power grids detailed model of all dispatching areas to form the whole power grids detailed model through power grid model splicing technology based on common information model (CIM). This paper introduces the solution to managing the equivalent model, partitioning the splicing boundary, disposing the device on the border etc. Specific to setting calculation based on the whole power grid, some splicing solutions are also proposed concerning calculation rate and problems demanding large internal storage.
