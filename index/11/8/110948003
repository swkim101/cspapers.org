This paper presents the architecture, simulation, implementation and control problem for a class of continuum manipulators â€“ the truncated cone tentacle arm. Desired shape for a tentacle robot is obtained by bending each of the three serial connected sections of a continuous backbone. Such tentacle arm has a fixed length but it can achieve any position and orientation in 3D space. A tentacle arm prototype was designed and the practical realization is now running. For this prototype we present a finite element model, for simulation purposes, we propose a kinematic model to be used in the control structure, and we conducted a series of tests regarding the structure behavior, using both sensor and artificial vision analysis. In this paper we present the results of our work.
