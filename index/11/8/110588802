In order to improve the effect of refueling training in nuclear power plant, the simulation system of refueling machine was designed and developed, combining the virtual reality technology with a real control console. The 3D virtual refueling environment of nuclear power plant was established by 3D modeling. Signals from touch screen and console are gathered by PLC and transmitted to PC graphics workstation, control the motion of virtual refueling machine, which realize the refueling operation simulation. The operation in failure modes was also realized in the system through the programming of failure database. The results show that the system runs normally and can simulate refueling operation in normal and abnormal modes, the training of refueling personnel is implemented effectively.
