This article presents a vision based object tracking robot controlled by a computer software. We developed a robotic object tracking such that it can track objects based on color. Introducing color along with the shape of the object reduces false detection. The unique features of this system are its ability to perform simultaneous real-time image acquisition and range sensing. Furthermore, its flexible design, confers the ability to handle a wide range of tasks. In this case the object of interest is a red circular shape. The system is designed to track the object in its Y-Z plane using robotic manipulator. The program for color based object tracking is written in MATLAB. The camera is used to track the object and decide the motion of the system. The object of interest is detected successfully using two stages, color detection followed by shape detection. The detected object is then tracked by the robotic end effector very closely.
