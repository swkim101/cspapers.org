This paper introduced the laboratory model of Real-time monitor system based on the 3D Visualization for calefaction furnace, depicted the process of the model.In this paper we created a virtual environment and transport the real-time data which we collected from the locale to the virtual scene,to realize the real time monitor on the real environment.Through simulating in the lab,the effect of this system was realistic at the same time it arrived at the goal of better monitoring with better real-time.
