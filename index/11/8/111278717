In view of the complexity, higher power consumption and other shortcomings of current wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSN)QoS routing protocol algorithm, this paper proposes the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to improve the WMSN routing protocol. First of all, a routing model for multimedia sensor networks QoS was presented and then a routing algorithm (WMSN-ANT) was brought forward, which uses the network restrict condition to update the pheromone concentration. The forward ants (Fant) collects the link bandwidth, delay, packet loss rate and other parameters, along with the elite strategy for the ant system to update the local node of the network state model and the pheromone of each visited node in order to find the best routing under the conditions of multiconstrained QoS. The simulation results show that the algorithm is characterized by the distributed network routing optimization and has better convergence than the traditional QoS routing protocol and can significantly improve the network lifetime.
