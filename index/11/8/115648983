The research into stresses of thin-rimmed gear with middle web has been performed by means of finite element method and by using the pinion-wheel model. The effect of gear body taken into account by the tooth facewidth and the rim and web thickness, upon the stress at the rim, has been analysed. The insight into the stress distribution of thin-rimmed gear with complex body at possible critical locations has been enabled, based upon the obtained rim stress area developed radially along the rim and axially along the tooth facewidth, and the stress analysis.
