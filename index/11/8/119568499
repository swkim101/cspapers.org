Based on the distinguishable ball-into-box issue, this paper started from a seemingly simple ball and extended to the question of birthday frequency distribution, i.e. people birthday in different dates probability distribution and the distribution law. In addition, the value was obtained by Monte Carlo simulations with different frequency distribution birthday days, finally when frequency simulation is large, achieving the theoretical value of the frequency values to estimate the probability,and the corresponding distribution can be obtained.
