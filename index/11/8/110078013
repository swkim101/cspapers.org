Fluorescence immunoassay technology is widely recognized as the most sensitive detection technology, now widely used in clinical testing. The research of quantitative analyzer for fluorescence immune chromatography strips is of great significance. In this thesis, a quantitative analyzer for fluorescence immune chromatography strips has realized, based on photoelectric detection principle and immunochromatographic. The system uses LPC1788 and MSP430 as processors. Using some algorithms such as low-pass filtering, least square method and area method to analyze the detected waveform and eliminate noise with high accuracy. In our experiment, the minimum detection concentration is at several mIU/ml levels, the relative standard deviation is less than 2% and it has good linear response characteristics in a concentration range from 0.5125 to 952mIU/ml while the correlation coefficient R2 is 0.981. The instrument has a good prospect.
