In order to acquire and analyze the real-time vibration signals of shearer in the process of coal mining. This experiment used the portable vibration measurement data recorder, which developed by ourselves. We design a comprehensive set of solutions for data acquisition according to underground mining machines working in real time. Through the data collection package, obtained a shearer vibration signal sample on real-time working. Meanwhile, analyze the vibration signal using signal analysis method. Through the experiment we acquire vibration signals of shearer's ranging-arms on real-time working, and the analysis results indicate that data collection solution is reasonably practicable.
