This paper describes about the application of a fuzzy logic controller based back to back converter for operation of Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) used in Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS). The wind energy systems have gained popularity in the recent years due to many technological advances. But this system has problems of harmonics and requirement of reactive power compensation. In this paper a modified Grid Side Converter (GSC) control algorithm has been proposed for mitigation of harmonics associated with non-linear loads and for reactive power compensation. Fuzzy logic control is used to control Rotor Side Converter (RSC). The proposed model is simulated in MATLAB.
