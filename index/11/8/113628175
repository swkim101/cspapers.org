Modern city mainly rely on internal electricity cable tunnel, this can reduce the influence of high voltage over-head lines of urban city appearance and function. In order to reduce the dangers of cable tunnel artificial inspection and high labor intensity, we design a small caterpillar chassis in combination with two degrees of freedom robot with two degrees of freedom camera pan and tilt, used in the cable tunnel inspection work. Caterpillar chassis adopts simple return roller, damping structure. Mechanical arm with three parallel shafts, finish the up and down and rotated action. Two degrees of freedom camera pan and tilt are used to monitor cable tunnel with 360 Â°no dead angle. It looks simple, practical and efficient.
