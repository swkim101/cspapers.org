l Specification Based Development: The history of Computer Science has been chronicled by advances in programming languages, and these advances will surely continue. However, weâ€™ve also always been limited by our compiler technology. Our programming languages only contain what we know how to (efficiently) compile. But now (uncompilable) specification languages have begun to appear. For these languages to become practical, they must not just be documentation for an implementation, but the means of developing it. Since these languages are uncompilable, human guidance (i.e. Design) must be used to reach the stage where compilers can take over, and reused when the specification is subsequently evolved. The challenge is providing technology to support this translation and later retranslation so that we can ride the wave of improving specification languages instead of the compiler limited programming language wave.
