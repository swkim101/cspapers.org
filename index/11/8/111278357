In this paper, a portable integrated ship monitoring command system is designed to meet the needs of automatic maritime security working, remote monitoring and commanding ship, while adapting the harsh working environment. The propose ship monitoring command system has merits of ease of installation, highly-integrated features, easy-to-use, and so on. Application of Beidou Navigation Satellite System's high precision positioning and SMS(Short Messaging Service) communication technology in integrated ship monitoring command system can well solve the problem of ship navigation and positioning, remote monitoring and commanding. In our system, ECDIS( Electronic Chart Display and Information System) is chosen as the display platform, HF(High frequency), VHF(Very high frequency) and Beidou is chosen as the communicational measure, Beidou and GPS is chosen as the positioning measure. With the help of the above measures, the static and dynamic data of ship, real-time voice and text are transported to realize the function of ship positioning, ship navigation, remote monitoring and commanding.
