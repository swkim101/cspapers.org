The fuzzy-PI dual-mode control was designed and applied to control speed loop in feed system of ADGM25 to improve its response characteristic and stability. In order to observe its control ability, the fuzzy - PI dual-mode control and PI control were adopted respectively. The simulation of the feed system was finished by using MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that the control performance of fuzzy - PI dual-mode control is better than the performance of conventional PI control, the maximum over-shoot and setup time decreased by 13%,0.05s respectively.
