The projectâ€™s first activity was to study and determine the conditions under which robotics and 3D printing training flourishes within Europe. The partners therefore undertook different activities: Besides a web research on existing training opportunities in the field, the partners conducted an online survey targeted to SMEs, individuals and training providers. The survey was completed by 150 persons representing all target groups.
