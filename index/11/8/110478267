Design of engineering resilient systems is an emerging research field. The contribution of this paper is to i) define engineering resilience on the basis of various resilience concepts in different fields; ii) propose the engineering recoverability as a new component in the framework of designing engineering resilient systems; and iii) introduce a general mathematical formulation to quantify the engineering resilience. One case study of a CNC machining system is used to demonstrate the value of designing engineering resilient systems.Copyright Â© 2014 by ASME
