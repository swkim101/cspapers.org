Pattern analysis using syntactic methods is discussed briefly to introduce the ideas of the linguistic nature of the attributes and of possible invariance properties versus usual geometrical tran sformations. 
 
A linguistic operator invariant for projections from plane to plane is proposed and applied to the analysis of point patterns X. From knowled ge of the operator "result" or "attribute", it is possible to obtain the convex envelope, reconstitute X, compare X to another pattern X' and more generally, to obtain the possible common subpat - terns. This last process showy that a threshold exists, under which a pattern comparison is not reliable. 
 
Linguistic operators invari ant tor plane similarties are also considered.
