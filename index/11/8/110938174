Object association and tracking have attracted great attention in the computer vision. In this paper, we present an object association and tracking method for monitoring multiple vehicles on the road based on objects' visual features and the similarity comparison between them. First, we identify vehicles using the difference operation between the current frame in CCTV image sequences and the referential images that are stored in a database, and then extract various features from the vehicles identified. Finally, we associate the objects in the current frame with those in the next frames using similarity comparison, and track multiple objects over a sequence of CCTV image frames. Empirical study using CCTV images shows that our method has achieved the considerable effectiveness in tracking vehicles on the road.
