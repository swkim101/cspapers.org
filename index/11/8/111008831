Path planning for mobile robot with blind zone is a difficult and practical problem. To decrease the influence of blind zone. The path planning approach in this paper has introduced entry point to represent the free road which may guide the robot to find the gaps between obstacles. By estimating the entry point in blind zone and estimating the probability it exist there using uncented kalman filter, the historical sensor information is used. All entry points are then evaluated using a evaluate function. So that both the current sensor information and the historical sensor information are used. Compared with the traditional local path planning approaches, this approach avoid the trap problem and the hover problem came with the blind zone. Simulation has proved the effect.
