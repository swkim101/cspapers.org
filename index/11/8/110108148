The methods for autonomous navigation of a robot in a real world environment is an area of interest for current researchers. Although there have been a variety of models developed, there are problems with regards to the integration of sensors for navigation in an outdoor environment like moving obstacles, sensor and component accuracy. This paper details an attempt to develop an autonomous robot prototype using only ultrasonic sensors for sensing the environment and GPS/ GSM and a digital compass for position and localization. An algorithm for the navigation based on reactive behaviour is presented. Once the robot has navigated to its final location based on remote access by the owner, it surveys the geographical region and uploads the real time images to the owner using an API that is developed for the Raspberry PIâ€™s kernel.
