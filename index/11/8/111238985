Taking the power distribution network situation in China into consideration, this paper proposes a communication circuit applied in street lamp control system. It first summarizes the overall design scheme of the control system. And then it demonstrates the high reliability of outbound Two Way Automatic Communication System (TWACS) within one transformer area and the low-cost characteristics of corresponding circuit. Finally, it proposes the design scheme of the communication circuit which can process Power Line Carrier communication (PLC) signals and outbound TWACS signals simultaneously, and it is based on single MCU. This design scheme is conducive to improving the communication efficiency and success rate of the street lamp control system to a great extent.
