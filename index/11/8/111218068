The main objective of this work is the construction 
of a robot type exoskeleton that emulates human 
walking, this way you can establish a research 
base, allowing future developments involving the 
rehabilitation of lower limb. 
The key feature of the project is the mechanical 
design, construction, including power stage 
actuators, sensors selection and installation of an 
exoskeleton consisting of two legs, 6 joints, 6- 
membered ring and a support structure. Everything will be done for educational, 
biomechanical arguments, and mechatronics 
engineering design, which will strengthen the 
ultimate goal.
