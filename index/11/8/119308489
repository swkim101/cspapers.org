We propose a new approach, named PolyMapper, to circumvent the conventional pixel-wise segmentation of (aerial) images and predict objects in a vector representation directly. PolyMapper directly extracts the topological map of a city from overhead images as collections of building footprints and road networks. In order to unify the shape representation for different types of objects, we also propose a novel sequentialization method that reformulates a graph structure as closed polygons. Experiments are conducted on both existing and self-collected large-scale datasets of several cities. Our empirical results demonstrate that our end-to-end learnable model is capable of drawing polygons of building footprints and road networks that very closely approximate the structure of existing online map services, in a fully automated manner. Quantitative and qualitative comparison to the state-of-the-arts also show that our approach achieves good levels of performance. To the best of our knowledge, the automatic extraction of large-scale topological maps is a novel contribution in the remote sensing community that we believe will help develop models with more informed geometrical constraints.
