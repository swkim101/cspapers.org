The wheeled robot with non-integrity constraints is a typical nonlinear system, in order to achieve the ideal path tracing, presented a theory based on fuzzy neural network control. Centralized compensation system based on neural network uncertainty can be arbitrary-precision approximation of continuous nonlinear functions as well as the complex uncertainties with adaptive and learning ability. By MATLAB simulation showed that the control method to ensure fast convergence and error robustness of parameter uncertainties and external disturbance.
