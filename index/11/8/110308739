Microwave cavity with complicated structure and rubidium gas is studied by mode matching method. By calculating resonant frequencies of HE111 mode under different parameters, main factors that influence resonant frequency is studied. In addition, the resonant frequency of HE111 mode is compared with commercial software (CST) results. The computed results show good agreement with CST simulations. It can be seen that this method is of high credibility and efficiency. This paper is of great significance for cavity design and theoretical perfection.
