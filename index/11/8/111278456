According to the characteristics of the optimization theory and arrival flights.Established static and dynamic model which take the aircraft delay cost as target. The limit of maximum allowable delay time variable are introduced to reduce the delay cost, take into account fairness of flights landing at the same time. The solution of the model is filtered beam search algorithm (FBS).
