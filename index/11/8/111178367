With the emerging of RFID technology and increasing pressure on maintenance, higher request is posed on the maintenance action. This paper introduces a combined intelligent system to complete the maintenance task. SVM and SVR model has been trained to classify machine fault types and predict the degradation. The proposed system can carry out maintenance action with the staff position information form RFID tags and the machine condition information. Genetic algorithm will be used to search the best maintenance sequence, then, the combined information will help make most efficient maintenance decision.
