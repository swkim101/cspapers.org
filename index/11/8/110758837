Telecommunications applications offer one of the most challenging domains for applications-interfaces. This paper presents an application-interface which adopts a flexible approach to the presentation of information and handles multiple access for different types of users. The work is funded by British Telecom as part of a project focusing on distributed resource allocation within a dynamic environment. In the next decade, the development of telecommunications services will generate a new technological revolution from which massive financial and employment benefits are expected. Private networks will play a vital role in the management of companies and the public will have access to a multitude of new services. Application-interfaces will have a vital part to play in achieving this revolution; by providing users (e.g: managers, field staff, customers) with access to a wide range of management facilities. >
