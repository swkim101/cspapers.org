Due to the complexity of the underwater acoustic channel, a reliable mobile underwater acoustic communication system must have high resistance to Doppler and multi-path extension. In this paper, an AUV underwater acoustic control and communication system based on frequency-hopping frequency-shift keying (FH-FSK) is proposed. The system uses pulse pair method to estimate Doppler frequency shift, and analyzes the performance of the algorithm via simulation. The system has been developed based on chip OMAP-L138, with lake test conducted. Result of the tests shows that the system can estimate and compensate the Doppler frequency shift generated by the platform's movement precisely, and has strong resistance to interference to transmit AUV control messages effectively.
