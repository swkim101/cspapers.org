It is difficult to detect the edges of objects in side scan sonar images due to the complex background, bad contrast and deteriorate edges. Therefore, it is important to remove noise from side scan sonar images. The traditional de-noising methods for optical images may not work well on the sonar image. In this paper, an adaptive de-noising approach is used. The side scan sonar image is first filtered using mean filter to remove the rough noise, then a weighted function is generated using spatial distance filter and intensity distance filter. The parameters are adaptive according to the sonar image. The experimental results indicate that it is an effective de-noising method for underwater sonar image.
