In this paper one proposed to exemplify a modern solution of an automatic control of industrial production lines. The necessity to align at the requirements of industrial competition has led to a degree of automation of increasingly advanced that the human intervention into the processes is minimal. A high productivity means lower flow interruptions as manufacturing, so the systems which control these lines must operate without errors. This can be done only by testing control programs and monitoring automation systems and, also, through simulate the manufacturing process.
