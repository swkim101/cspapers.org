This paper describes a Geometry Based algorithm (GBA) developed for aggregation behavior of a swarm of simple robots. Aggregation is one of the primary behaviors for swarm robots. Decentralization and stability for single-swarm aggregations are the two major properties of the GBA algorithm presented in this paper. Our analysis, together with extensive simulation studies considering various swarm size and configurations, indicate that the GBA algorithm is scalable and effective for swarm aggregations.
