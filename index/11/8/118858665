In embodiment and detailed design one is often concerned with sizing and geometric arrangement. Constraint problems of satisfying certain relationships in feasible designs are often solved by domain specific procedures in design and manufacturing applications. This paper shows that a variety of such problems are reducible to a small set of generic problems solvable by domain-independent procedures. A taxonomy of constraint problem types is developed. The taxonomy is based on the types of entities, constraints, and tasks (reasoning or inquiry) that are to be performed. The "exemplar" is introduced as a new concept for describing complex situational patterns and extracting information of interest. Such a canonical representation of parametric problems is needed for designing cleaner interfaces between applications and generic solvers, as a basis for standardized data exchange between future CAD systems, and for providing the foundations for domain independent shells for parametric design.
