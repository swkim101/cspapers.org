The purpose of the research is to: 1. Design a course with an emphasis on the transnational digit platform (d-learning) as a way to produce research and study internationally cooperatively and to promote the international exchange and study of science and technology education to a great extent. 
 
2. Provide a clearing house for an international collection of science and technology teaching materials, teaching methods, teaching policies, and a means for distributing the information to small and medium school districts in Taiwan. 
 
3. Provide an impetus to cooperatively study teaching and exchange the findings with the world. Aviation technology education is the focus of the transnational d-learning course. 
 
In recent years, there is a need to expand the performance of studying in order to build national power and improve the well-being for our country's people. At the 7th national scientific meeting, leaders drafted 6 tactics to guide the first stage of the national scientific development plan of Cheng (the 94-97th year of R.O.C.) for promoting the development of science and technology until 2008. The plan is to use the pool of operating dollars to fund improvement activities. As a result, the theme of Scientific and Technological Education International became the main theme for research in 2008-2012.
