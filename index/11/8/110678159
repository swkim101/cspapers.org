Current tourism-led tertiary industry achieved remarkable development and achievements. In order to make better use of the natural geological resources, local governments adopt local characteristics as a guide to invest in tourist attraction construction to promote local economic development. However, due to the lack of scientific and technical conditions, tourist attraction construction is only confined to the planning and design of major landscape regions, rather than taking into account the query needs of tourists during the tour. Under this background, this thesis first of all makes an introduction to geographic navigation system function, and then proposes the function design of tourist attraction geographic navigation system and application of GPS technology to tourist attraction navigation, so as to assist the further study.
