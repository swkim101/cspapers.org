As China's space-tracking ships' missions change, there is ever higher demand on ships' orbit determination accuracy. This is reflected in Shenzhou missions, during which ships' orbit determination accuracy influences the whole tracking and control system. This paper bases its research on the analysis of error sources' influence on the determination of near-earth and near-round orbit, and proposes urgent problems and research prospects of maritime orbit determination accuracy enhancement. It establishes a model for adjusting ship attitude and speed, designs a self-adjusting information retrieval calibration method, realizes accurate simulation of ship complex error and researches on optimal selection of first-orbit root number based on sequence statistics. It also conducts research on improving preliminary treatment model and enhancing orbit report accuracy.
