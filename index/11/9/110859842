In this paper, we introduced an intelligent Customer Service Representative (CSR) Operating System. The system contains three modules: Knowledge Management (KM) module, Natural Language Process (NLP) module and CSR Operating (CSRO) module. The KM module manages knowledge. When get query through phone, Internet, Fetion, QQ, etc. from customer, the NLP module understands the query and gives recommended reply. If confirms that the reply is right, NLP module replies the query automatically. The CSRO module confirms that the reply is right or retrieves the right reply quickly from the knowledge base, and gives the reply. The system can increase self-service scale and improve CSR's efficiency. The system has been successfully used in a domestic telecom company since May 2010, and achieved a satisfactory result.
