In this paper comparative analysis of three phase Induction motor is correlated on the ground of rise time, settling time and transient response. The direct torque control (DTC) technique used in this paper with Proportional (P) Controller, Proportional Integral (PI) on the basis of rotor speed and torque control of three phase induction motor. From the comparative analysis, it has been found that the PI controller with DTC is best when compared with P controller. The comparative analysis shows that the settling time is improved by 12%, rise time is increased by 8% and torque ripples are reduced 3 to 5% with well extent. The simulated model is made in MATLAB/SIMULINK software to compare the fulfilment of the three phase induction motor model.
