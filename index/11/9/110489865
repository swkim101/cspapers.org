A novel method has been proposed for integrated Beidou and GPS (Global Positioning System) navigation system in vessel monitoring system. Application of integrated Beidou and GPS navigation system's high precision positioning and SMS (Short Messaging Service) communication technology in vessel can well solve the problem of vessel navigation, positioning, remote monitoring and commanding. Based on 27 stations of Crustal Moment Observation Network of China, satellite visibility and availability of integrated Beidou and GPS are calculated and analyzed in detail. A data compression algorithm is proposed for Beidou SMS communication technology to get the continuous location and other state of the target vessel. Experimental results reveal that the integrated Beidou and GPS system is superior to any single system in all respects of positioning performance.
