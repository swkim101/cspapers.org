Regarding the grabbing of the objects by the robots, countless researches have been made. In particular it has been researched for obtaining the models for the human hand and the way it acts when the human agent wants to grab an object. In this paper a few elements obtained after a research concerning the natural grab of object by human, has been made. In our research, we have made measurements for the motion coordinates of human agent arm, when he desires to grab a cylindrical object. The aim was to identify the grabbing motions and to transpose them in acting models (acting rules) used for programming an industrial robot, placed into a flexible fabrication cell.
