This paper presents a new catching-mechanism which is the key device of the casing continuous circulation system designed by us. The difference between different structures would have important effect on its stability and strength. In this paper, through limiting the spacing of installation and the strength of the catching-mechanism, we analyzed the effect of inclination of the horizontal hydraulic cylinder based on the finite element method. And the optimum design of the catching-mechanism which shall satisfy all of the constraints were achieved with the help of MATLAB, ANSYS and ADAMS.
