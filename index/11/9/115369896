We investigate the problem of tracking and planning for a UAV in a task to locate multiple radio-tagged wildlife in a three-dimensional (3D) setting in the context of our Tracker-Bots research project. In particular, we investigate the implementation of a 3D tracking and planning problem formulation with a focus on wildlife habitats in hilly terrains. We use the simplicity of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements of VHF (Very High Frequency) radio tags, commonly used to tag and track animals for both wildlife conservation and management, in our approach. We demonstrate and evaluate our planning for tracking multiple mobile radio tags under real-world digital terrain models and radio signal measurement models in a simulated software-in-the-loop environment of a Quad-Copter.
