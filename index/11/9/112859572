I. BACKGROUND The Metropolitan Police have a nationally deployable team of specialised divers capable of carrying out a variety of underwater missions. These range from search and recovery of missing persons to the collection of evidence. Typically, the divers are required to operate in confined shallow-water environments with low visibility (canals, lakes, water reservoirs, etc.) and they must deploy and complete their tasks within very short time frames. Due to their unique training for these difficult conditions and their limited numbers (84 in England and Wales and 34 in Scotland), they are a valuable resource that is in extremely heavy demand.
