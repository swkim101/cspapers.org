In machine tool development, control software engineering has reached a cost proportion of over fifty percent of the total development costs. Highly customized user requirements and the compulsion to shorten development cycles accompany the need to master risen quality requirements of the mechatronic product machine tool. This enforces a strategy change from prevailing sequential engineering to concurrent engineering. The paper proposes a Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation environment as an interdisciplinary discussion platform to virtually implement, evaluate and optimize a machine tool throughout all stages of development.Copyright Â© 2003 by ASME
