A marine DC uninterruptible power supply is designed. The UPS adopts PIC16C73 single-chip microcomputer to realize the battery management. Both AC power and battery power, the output voltage stability in 23 to 24 v.Via advanced battery management, two sections of charging, equalized charging and floating charging can automatic convert and the DCUPS has many functions of protection, such as over-voltage protection ,under voltage protection and short circuit protection.The actual use on the ship and other occasions showed that the DCUPS is convenient and practical,and is more simple, reliable and longer emergency power supply than the traditional AC-DC uninterruptible power supply management scheme.
