Recent completeness results on the ZX-calculus used a third-party language, namely the ZW-Calculus. As a consequence, these proofs are elegant, but sadly non-constructive. We address this issue in the following. To do so, we first describe a generic normal form for ZX-diagrams in any fragment that contains $\mathbf{Clifford}+\mathbf{T}$ quantum mechanics. We give sufficient conditions for an axiomatisation to be complete, and an algorithm to reach the normal form. Finally, we apply these results to the $\mathbf{Clifford}+\mathbf{T}$ fragment and the general ZX-calculus - for which we already know the completeness-, but also for any fragment of rational angles: we show that the axiomatisation for $\mathbf{Clifford}+\mathbf{T}$ is also complete for any fragment of dyadic angles, and that a simple new rule (called cancellation) is necessary and sufficient otherwise.
