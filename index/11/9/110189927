The thin wall steel U-pipe is the main component of a heat exchanger. It is extremely applied in various machines such as heat exchanger, air conditioner and refrigerator.

In order to resolve this practical problem, we design the automatic control pipe bender which can process various radius of the thin wall steel pipe.
