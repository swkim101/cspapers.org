Structured light extraction is an important problem in 3-D measurement of structured light. Due to traditional structured light extraction methods are mostly applied in small visual field and simple environment. Therefore, a novel method is proposed based on the feature of structured light aiming at the large field and complex surroundings. Firstly, a region of interest (ROI) is obtained through a third sensor in order to reduce calculations and process conveniently. And then, structured light is extracted according to its feature of brightness distribution module and geometrical morphology trait. Experiment shows that this new method not only extracts structured light in such large field with strong background noise well but also reduces the computation to meet real-time requirement.
