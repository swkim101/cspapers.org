This paper first discusses the basic principles of binocular stereo vision inspection, followed by discussion of the three-dimensional mathematical model of binocular vision sensor measurements, non-contact measurement accuracy binocular stereo vision again spring geometric parameters were analyzed, and then double-structure stereo vision sensor configurations were analyzed for binocular stereo vision to do a simple discussion of the basis for discussion.
