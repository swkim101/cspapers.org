The orthogonality of transmitting signals affects the performance of Muitple Input Mulitiple Output (MIMO) radar system. The chaotic signals was adopted at the transmitter to achieve the approximate orthogonal. A signal separation aprroach for MIMO Radar based on the particle filter in Non-Gaussian clutter environment was proposed. Before the match filter (MF), the particle filter is quite suitable for chaotic signals separation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can realize a good separation performance. At the receiver, the coherent processing results show that this method has the better target resolution ability than the tranditional match filter alone.
