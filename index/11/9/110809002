High-impedance ground plane (HIGP) is applied in the design of rectangular waveguide end-slot phased array. The benefits of using such a HIGP are related to the suppression of surface waves because of its obvious frequency bandgap and, therefore, the scan blindness could be eliminated. Both of the bandgap curve of the HIGP structure and the scan properties of the phased arrays have been calculated. The elimination of scan blindness is obtained.
