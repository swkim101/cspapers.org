The dielectric characteristic parameter, such as capacitance value, the dielectric loss tangent and leakage current values will change when insulation degradation occurs in capacitive equipment, thus the insulation on-line monitoring devices were used for the insulation state monitoring. At present, the monitoring mode, functional requirements, stability requirement, reliability requirement, and the access security impact has not been fully unified among different manufacturers. For the purpose of standardization of the design, production, testing and operation management of the device, studies were carried out in field of technical parameters and test methodology. Considering the structure and working principle of this kind device, key technical parameters of functional and technical requirements were put forward, and the measurement error performance testing method, as well as the detection circuit was also given under the laboratory conditions.
