Submit Manuscript | http://medcraveonline.com Following the advances of the state of the art in robotics and the increasing demand for research on the design and development of innovative solutions, it is evident that no single journal can cover such a vast scope. Thus the demand for new journals is mandated by the continued progress in this field. The International Robotics and Automation Journal (IRATJ) aspire to furnish the researchers in both academia and industry with the latest advances in the field of robotics and emphasize their practical significance and scientific value. The Journal is intended to provide a wider platform for timely dissemination of knowledge pertinent to the recent research developments in this rapidly growing field. Promoting and facilitating more exchanges and collaborations among worldwide researchers stand as one of the main objectives of this Journal; thus contributing to the future advancements in robotics research. The Journal publishes peer-reviewed, original research articles that may include manipulation, automation, sensing, actuation, kinematics and dynamics, micro robotics and other related features. In addition, the Journal provides a venue for scholarly work on integration of experimental and analytical research. We warmly invite you to join its future by submitting manuscripts or reviewing for the journal. As we endeavor to be a high caliber scholarly journal, we are adhering to originality and quality. IRATJ adopts a blind peer-review system with rigorous evaluation criteria closely monitored and managed by an editorial board whose members represent an array of diverse research activities and scholarly achievements.
