Space robotics systems consist of a huge variety of different components working together and coming from different domains. Thus, it is crucial to test all the components and their interplay to guarantee a reliable functionality in space prior to the real mission. There exist powerful simulation tools to model a certain aspect of a system, like structural deformation, which can be analysed with Finite Element Analysis (FEA). This method is used as a stand-alone tool to e.g. optimize lightweight construction. Nevertheless, errors in functionality often occur due to the interaction of several components with each other or with the environment. This requires an Overall System Simulation for the early validation of the system in a Virtual Testbed. To consider both the details and the overall picture of a real-life scenario in the same framework, an interaction between FEA and a Virtual Testbed was implemented in this work.
