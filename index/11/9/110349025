Temperature is one of the most important factors affecting the accuracy of micromechanical silicon resonant accelerometer (SRA). In order to reduce the temperature sensitivity and improve the sensor performance, a new method of temperature self-compensation for SRA is presented in this paper. Utilizing the differential structure of SRA, the temperature compensation for bias and scale factor can be realized simultaneously in this method. Moreover, because no temperature sensor is needed in this method, the error in temperature measurement due to the temperature gradient between the mechanical sensitive structure and temperature sensor is avoided, and the precision of temperature compensation for SRA can be further improved. The test results obtained on SRA prototype which is developed by MEMS Inertial Technology Research Center show that, by employing the method of temperature self-compensation, the temperature coefficients of bias and scale factor are reduced from 3.1 mg/째C and 778 ppm/째C to 0.05 mg/째C and -9.4 ppm/째C, respectively.
