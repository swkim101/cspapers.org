The particle swarm optimization algorithm was improved in this paper, a novel self-adaption dynamic sub-swarms hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed, in this algorithm, subgroup partition method based on dynamic clustering of particle adaptive value is adopted to divide particle group to different capability sub-group, then execute different optimize strategy to different subgroup, simultaneity, inertial weight and accelerating coefficient are adaptive set, through contacting adjustment of parameter with sub-group capability, the particle mode method and intersect and aberrance strategy of double deck are designed, The experimental results show that the algorithm has simple programming, good robust capability and strong optimizing capability which established the foundation of task planning of multi-UAV Cooperative.
