The goal of the BenchFlow project is to design the first benchmark for as- sessing and comparing the performance of BPMN 2.0 Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs). WfMSs have become the platform to build composite service-oriented ap- plications, whose performance depends on two factors: the performance of the work- flow system itself and the performance of the composed services (which could lie out- side of the control of the workflow). Our main goal is to present to the community the state of our work, and the open challenges of a complex industry-relevant benchmark.
