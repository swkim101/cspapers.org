According to the characteristics and needs of virtual scenic roaming system, select the appropriate modeling techniques. By using the modeling platform scenic entity object model structure, and then build virtual tourist attractions, we propose hierarchical collision detection methods. This method actually meets the accuracy requirements under the premise, greatly reducing the number and complexity of collision detection; effectively improve the system in real time.
