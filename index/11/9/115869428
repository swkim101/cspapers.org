Contemporary production enterprises operate in conditions, which demand continuous improvement of their activity. Therefore, organization and optimization of the realized production processes becomes a more essential problem. That is why it is necessary to use different modern methods and tools aiding production. The digital factory tools can be an effective basis for improving of production systems. Thanks to computer simulation of virtual production systems it is possible to check if the modeled future solution (improvement of the present production system) fulfils the defined requirements. However, it make possible to find the best improvement variant of the analyzed system in a quicker way.
