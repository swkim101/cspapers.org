Aircraft climbing problem is a typical hard multi-constraint optimization problem. In real applications, it is not most important to find the best solution but to provide a feasible climbing schedule in an acceptable time. Scheduling aircraft climbing is a complex task encountered by most of the control towers. In this paper, we study the aircraft climbing problem in the multiple runway case. This paper proposes a method based on neural network which can effectively solve the aircraft climbing problem while satisfying the real-time need.
