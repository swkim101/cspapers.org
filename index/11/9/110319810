This paper analyzed the reconstruction of cross-cut shredded paper coming from a same printed page, built two association degree optimization models (including edge association degree optimization model and the line space one) based on the characteristics of character information on the edge and line space, and provided the concrete solving process and algorithm for the reconstruction of shredded paper. Moreover, the solving process and algorithm were applied in a reconstruction experiment for pieces of shredded paper from China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM 2013B). The results showed that this reconstruction method was effective.
