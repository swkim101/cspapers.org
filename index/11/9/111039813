A method for condition evaluation based on reliability indices is proposed in this paper. The paper defines the reliability indices: failure rate, MTBF and availability. The condition evaluation system is proposed based on the contents of repair work and the structures of both protective device and the secondary circuit. The reliability indices are applied to evaluating the protection condition.
