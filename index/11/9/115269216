Reliable and accurate navigation of an UAV is crucial for most applications. Nav- igation of the UAV with a single IMU can be potentially dangerous and therefore, a multiple IMU based approach is proposed in which a consensus algorithm is employed to integrate the local information fusion lters in a distributed sensor network. Simulations demonstrate reliable performance of the consensus-based approach that estimates the attitude of the UAV.
