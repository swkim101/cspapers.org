A Free Hand® device (OR ProductivityTM, London, UK) has been connected to an arthroscopic 2D camera 2.4mm. An IR radiation emitting device was placed on the operator’s head. An IR receiver was placed above the monitor to the arthroscopy column. Some movements of the operator’s head were programming commands. The arm guided by IR sensor (top, bottom, right, left, and zoom) for example, to move the camera to the ulnar side, the surgeon should move his head towards right meanwhile his head is being tracked by an infra-red camera that translates this movement into a lighting arrow. Once the arrow turned on towards the desired direction, the surgeon validates the action with a foot pedal. The surgeon has to push the pedal again to activate the movement and hold it as long he wants to Abstract
