Primary fallopian tube carcinoma is an uncommon gynecological malignancy. Management of primary fallopian tube carcinoma using a robotic-assisted approach is also rare. We have described here two cases of adenocarcinoma located in the fallopian tubes that were managed using robotic-assisted staging surgery, followed by subsequent serial chemotherapy. The surgical procedure consisted of a total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, bilateral pelvi lymph node dissection, para-aortic lymph node dissection, appendectomy, omentectomy, peritoneal biopsies, and ascites cytology. After surgery, a test for CA-125 level and a computed tomography (CT) evaluation were conducted every 3 and 6 months, respectively. In Case I, the patient received 6 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and paclitaxel after surgery, and CA-125 level decreased from 55.9 U/mL to 9.5 U/mL over 6 months. At 16 months after surgery, a follow-up CT scan revealed no evidence of local recurrence. In Case II, the patient received 11 cycles of chemotherapy including cisplatin and paclitaxel, and CA-125 level decreased from 52.1 U/mL to 11.1 U/mL over 12 months. At 20 months after surgery, a follow-up CT scan revealed no evidence of local recurrence. In conclusion, robotic-assisted staging surgery is a feasible approach for treating incidentally located tumors in the fallopian tubes.
