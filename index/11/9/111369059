Engineering may be described as the main information and innovation source of a company. For an effective Engineering it is necessary to know well, to monitor, and to control all its processes and activities. Therefore a company needs a dynamic project and process navigation support for every user, which allows to model, to run, to react dynamically, and to evaluate activities in order to process these within given requirement, time, and cost frames. In this contribution, a system for dynamic project navigation in Engineering is presented with aspects of modelling, improvement and evaluation of processes.Copyright Â© 2002 by ASME
