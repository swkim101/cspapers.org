An adaptive dynamic sliding mode pitch control strategy for the output power control of wind generation systems in above rated wind speed range is presented in this paper. The corresponding controller is designed, which consists of an adaptive dynamic sliding mode controller, virtual damping controller. These variable pitch control systems have several advantages over the traditional wind turbines, such as reduction of the mechanical stress, improve quality of electric energy and mitigate tower fore-aft vibration and gearbox vibration. Traditionally, wind turbine pitch control system using mainly proportional integral (PI) controller. However, such kind of controller does not adequately handle some inaccuracies mainly leading to non-optimal power factor. These may decrease wind turbine performances. Therefore, using robust control and additional sensors to help the controller to achieve its objects more effectively, such as adaptive sliding mode control, damping controller will allow to tuning the wind turbine rated power to improve power quality. Finally, simulation results are demonstrated to validate the proposed controllers.
