This paper researches on the detection and tracking technology of ship intrusion and remaining based on the special surveillance video scenes of sea. A ship detection and tracking method that combines the adaptive background subtraction with centroid algorithm is proposed. Compared with the method of edge orientation histogram, the method proposed in this paper shows a lower computational complexity and a better real-time performance. The experiment demonstrate that this method has a high degree of accuracy. And it makes a realization of detecting and tracking of ship intrusion and remaining within the surveillance sea.
