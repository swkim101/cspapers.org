In this article, we used image processing by a webcam connected on top of the arm robot. The robot navigation is in an unknown environment. Then start point and target point were determined for the robot, so the robot needs to have a program for path planning using Voronoi diagrams to find the path. After the possible path for moving the robot was found, the route information obtained was sent to the arm robot. The arm robot moves in the workspace and any time new information was processed via the webcam. The program was written using MATLAB software which at controls the robotâ€™s movement the unknown environment.
