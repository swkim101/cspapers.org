For the problem of poor processing efficiency of iso-parameter tool path planning algorithm, this paper proposed a non iso-parameter trajectory planning algorithm. First established a mathematical model of five-axis machining toroid cutter, then analyzed the toroid cutter and machining surface partial differential geometric properties, proposed one kind of iso-scallop path search algorithm. Finally, using the above algorithm developed an application of trajectory planning for free-form surface and generated tool paths for such surface. The trajectories generated verified the algorithm is practicable.
