This article presents a linear, iterative method to solve the eye-to-hand calibration problem between a wrist-mounted laser scanner and the tool flange of a robot. Measurement data are acquired from a set of non parallel planes where after the plane equations and desired rigid transformation matrix are found in a two-step, iterative fashion. The method is shown to handle large error in the initial estimate of the transform and results are verified in both simulations and experiments using a seam tracking laser sensor for welding applications.
