This is the first in a series of SEI reports to provide periodic updates on the state of software engineering practice in the DoD software community. The SEI has developed, and is refining, a process framework and assessment methodology for characterizing the processes used by software organizations to develop and evolve software products. This report provides a brief overview of the process framework and assessment ap- proach, describes assessment results obtained to date, and dis- cusses implications of the current state of the practice for both customers and suppliers of DoD software.
