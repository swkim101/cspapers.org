This paper describes the application of a adsorption tube to extract the gasoline residues. Then the gasoline residues were detected by vapor sensing arrays. The response profile of the array generated a reproducible pattern unique to gasoline that could be used to reflect subsequent sensor responses. The effects of temperature, time and adsorption tube types on the extraction of gasoline residues has been investigated. The results show that 120Â°C, 1.5min, and TENAX-TA adsorption tube were the optimum extraction conditions. Using the developed method can be used to extract gasoline residues in the fire.
