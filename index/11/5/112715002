CAD, CAE, CAM technologies are tools for design and technical preparation of production in industrial engineering practice. Didactic potential of these applications can be applied in technical education at all levels. Improving of effectiveness of teaching and achievement of technical skills of students and graduates can be implemented due to a systematic deployment of CAx applications in education. Individual students' work on complex projects of virtual prototypes is in accordance with requirements of industrial practice. The data of completed projects can be considered as a carrier of a large amount of information for diagnosis and research of efficiency of teaching.
