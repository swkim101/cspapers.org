EXTENDED ABSTRACT Recently, multiple organizations have started being interested in advancing developments related to the implementation of a first full satellite servicing or de-orbiting mission in space. Multiple related ground facilities have been established in Germany, in the U.S. and at other places. All those facilities have the goal to develop and ground-verify the related robotics and automation technologies related to satellite servicing and debris removal. At ESA, so far, no test-bed has been available that allowed for accurate, hardware-in-the-loop testing of robotic contact operations with objects such as satellites emerged in the weightless space environment.
