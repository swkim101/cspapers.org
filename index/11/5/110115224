Dielectric properties of rat blood is measured in frequency range of 10kHz-10MHz during its coagulation process, excluding the impaction factor of temperature via measuring at 37±2°C, the results reflect the changes of relative permittivity of rat blood after it leaves the body to half an hour. Experimental results show that dielectric properties of rat blood in the coagulation process show very different characteristics in different frequencies, mechanisms of our measurements are also analyzed theoretically. The findings should provide valuable information of biochemical reaction within blood during the process of coagulation, and also provide insight into assessment of electromagnetic field exposure for human body.
