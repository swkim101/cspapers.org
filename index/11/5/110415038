In hydrostatic bearing, the applied load is carried through the compensatory effect of restrictors. Different throttle methods will bring different oil film rigidity and carrying capacity. There are mainly four types restrictors such as capillary,orifice,slide valve and film feedback restrictors. The mathematical models of carrying capacity and oil film rigidity of the hydrostatic bearings throttled by the restrictors mentioned above were presented. The oil film rigidity of hydrostatic bearings throttled by different restrictors were analyzed. Reynolds equation was provided and the numerical solution model was constructed. The pressure fields show the static performances of hydrostatic bearing with different restrictors.
