Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. Post-stroke rehabilitation is a demanding task for the patient and a costly challenge for both society and healthcare systems. We present a novel approach for training of upper extremities after a stroke by utilising an industrial robotic arm and dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) with force feedback. We show how pre-recorded and learned DMPs can act as basis exercises, that can be modified into individualized and adaptive rehabilitation exercises that fit with the patientâ€™s physical properties and impairments. We conclude that our novel approach allows for easy and flexible set-up of rehabilitation exercises and has the potential to provide the therapists and patients much easier interaction with such complex technology.
