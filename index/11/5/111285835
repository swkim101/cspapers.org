This paper addresses the stabilization and optimization problem of networked control systems (NCSs) with long time delays. According to the actual network conditions, the network time delay is divided into the fixed time delay and the random time delay. Then, the stabilization controller is constructed, where the stabilizing control parameters are obtained with cone complementary linearization (CCL) approach and the optimizing control parameters are solved with estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
