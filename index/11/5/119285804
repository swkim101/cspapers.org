Research has shown that various environmental factors impact smartphone interaction and lead
to Situationally-Induced Impairments and Disabilities. In this work we discuss the importance of
thoroughly understanding the effects of these situational impairments on smartphone interaction. We
argue that systematic investigation of the effects of different situational impairments is quintessential
for conducting successful research in the field of SIIDs that might lead to building appropriate sensing,
modelling, and adapting techniques. We also provide insights for future work identifying potential
directions to conduct research in SIIDs.
