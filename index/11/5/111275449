The paper is based on PSCAD/EMTDC. The basic structure and operation principle of DFIG are analyzed and the mathematical model of DFIG is established, based on which the control system of rotor-side and grid-side converters is set up. The stator flux-oriented vector control is adopted for rotor-side converter. The no-load grid connection is realized before cutting in and control strategy is switched after grid connection successfully. DFIG can meet grid connection condition quickly with the control strategy and is connected to grid with no current shock nearly. The output of active and reactive power can be regulated respectively.
