A quote by George Bernhard Dantzig, a famous American mathematical scientist who made important contributions to operations research, computer science, economics, and statistics [1]: “True optimisation is the revolutionary contribution of modern research to decision processes”. Optimisation according to the definition of Merriam-Webster Dictionary Merriam-Webster [2] is an act, process, or methodology of making something (as a design, system, or decision) as fully perfect, functional, or effective as possible.
