This paper introduces TripNet, a robotic vision system that detects trip hazards using raw construction site images. Automated detection of dangers such as trip hazards is difficult. Trip hazards are not entirely defined by an object type, rather trip hazards are affordances typically 
learnt from time consuming intrusive interaction with an environment and its objects. TripNet performs trip hazard identification using only camera imagery and minimal training with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN) rapidly ï¿½ne-tuned on a small corpus of labelled image regions from construction sites. There is no reliance on prior scene segmentation methods during deployment. TripNet achieves comparable performance to a human on a dataset recorded in two distinct real world construction sites. TripNet exhibits spatial and temporal generalization by functioning in previously unseen parts of a construction site and over time periods of several weeks. The dataset is published to stimulate further research in this area. This research is a significant step towards automating detection of hazards on construction sites, where a substantial 
proportion of all workplace related injuries occur.
