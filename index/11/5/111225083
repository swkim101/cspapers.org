According to the characteristics of pulse-load torque of the treadmill, the key technical problems of drive control system in the treadmill with a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM for short) are analyzed. The internal disturbance and external disturbance in the system are observed using the extended state observe (ESO for short) and the system is compensated using the auto-disturbance rejection controller (ADRC for short). The simulation results show that ADRC has better dynamic performance and better robustness to the load disturbance and the motor parameter variation.
