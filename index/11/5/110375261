According to the characteristics of non-linear, time-varying and large time delay in the control of grate cooler, a multi-mode intelligent control method is proposed in the paper.The multi-mode intelligent controller is builded up by variable integral PID control, fuzzy control, Bang-Bang control and expert control. This control method through a multi-mode intelligent control rules automatically identifies different modal and chooses a corresponding control algorithm to correct variable integral PID control.Industrial applications show that the control system has good robustness, achieved good control effect.
