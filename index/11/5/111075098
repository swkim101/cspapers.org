Corner machining accuracy has always been one of the important properties of WEDM. In this paper, the reasons for the corner error of the WEDM were discussed. Then the mathematical deflection model of the electrode wire was established. By experimental measurements, the kerf width and the deflection of the electrode wire were obtained. Then the corner control strategy of the WEDM was proposed. Through experiment of the Comparison of corner error between control strategy with corner control and the one without corner control, it shows that the processing accuracy was improved effectively.
