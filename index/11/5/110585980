Sliding mode controller (SMC) is a significant nonlinear controller under condition of partly uncertain dynamic parameters of system. This controller is used to control of highly nonlinear systems especially for robot manipulators, because this controller is a robust and stable. Conversely, pure sliding mode controller is used in many applications; it has two important drawbacks namely; chattering phenomenon, and nonlinear equivalent dynamic formulation in uncertain dynamic parameter. The nonlinear equivalent dynamic formulation problem and chattering phenomenon in uncertain system can be solved by using artificial intelligence theorem. However fuzzy logic controller is used to control complicated nonlinear dynamic systems, but it cannot guarantee stability and robustness. In this research parallel fuzzy logic theory is used to compensate the system dynamic uncertainty.
