Taking the central heating of Caofeidian for example, this paper introduces the video transmission system which bases on 3G wireless networks and the realization of communication. The video images are collected in remote heat-exchange station and are transmitted to the monitoring and controlling center through 3G wireless network. The result of operation indicates that the system which meets the requirements of long-term stable operation of remote monitoring is not only easily operated, but also with high regulation accuracy and stable.
