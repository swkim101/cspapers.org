This contribution presents some important issues on mobile robots path planning. While it is hard to find a unique architecture for all the applications involving mobile robots, specific approaches can provide suitable solutions. Thus, three distinct structures are discussed, all making use of certain artificial intelligence techniques. They address the use and integration of artificial vision, a planning approach based on temporal logics, and a multi agent scheme. The three methods refer cases of mobile robots evolving in environments where various types of sensorial information can be obtained. Each of the proposed solutions determines advantages when it is used for a certain class of tasks.
