Wire tension as well as wire feed should be controlled tightly for the geometry and corner accuracy of wire-EDM. A closed-loop wire tension control system for Micro-Wire-EDM is presented to guarantee a smooth wire transport and a constant tension value. To keep smooth wire transportation and avoid wire breakage during wire feeding, the reel roller is modified and the clip reel is removed from the wire transport mechanism. A genetic algorithm-based fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is proposed to investigate the dynamic performance of the closed-loop wire tension control system. Theoretical analysis and experimental research demonstrate that the developed wire transport system can result in satisfactory transient response, steady-state response and robustness. The proposed FLC can obtain faster transient response and smaller steady-state error than PI controller.
