Decomposition methods are used to convert general constraint satisfaction problems into an equivalent tree-structured problem that can be solved more effectively. Recently, diagnosis algorithms for treestructured systems have been introduced, but the prerequisites of coupling these algorithms to the outcome of decomposition methods have not been analyzed in detail, thus limiting their diagnostic applicability. In this paper we generalize the TREE* algorithm and show how to use hypertree decomposition outcomes as input to the algorithm to compute the diagnoses of a general diagnosis problem.
