According to acoustic emission mechanism of the material stress process, establish the gray cusp catastrophe model of acoustic emission parameters based on the grey theory and catastrophe theory. Using the model, carried out mutation analysis of the acoustic emission parameters of the coal mining face supporting pressure, then realized to face discrimination and prediction of rock burst. Point mutations in the roof sandstone acoustic emission rate of this parameter, has important significance for fracture mechanics study of working face roof sandstone.
