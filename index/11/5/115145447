We present a fully automatic approach to video colorization with self-regularization and diversity. Our model contains a colorization network for video frame colorization and a refinement network for spatiotemporal color refinement. Without any labeled data, both networks can be trained with self-regularized losses defined in bilateral and temporal space. The bilateral loss enforces color consistency between neighboring pixels in a bilateral space and the temporal loss imposes constraints between corresponding pixels in two nearby frames. While video colorization is a multi-modal problem, our method uses a perceptual loss with diversity to differentiate various modes in the solution space. Perceptual experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on fully automatic video colorization.
