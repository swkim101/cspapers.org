This paper establishs a coupled model on kinetic and tribological of cylinder liner-piston-piston ring system and takes the cylinder liner-piston system as an automatic control system based on the finite difference method and overrelaxation iteration method; the numerical solutions of the model is put forward and designed the overall the calculation process of coupling model, providing theoretical basis for further analyzing the piston system dynamic performance.
