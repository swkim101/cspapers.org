Driving axle intelligent design platform was completed to achieve rapid and automotive design by a computer to do a series of design work,. To make the design platform more intelligent, better educated, case-based reasoning techniques (CBR) were used to achieve the retrieve of similar examples and components variant design. A case base was established by truck driving axle with mature products as an example. Two stage retrieval methods were used to retrieve similar instances. The user interfaces were designed according to the design needs of personnel and platform requirements.
