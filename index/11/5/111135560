Every year, the design and EDA communities are besieged by dire warnings about the impending doom of “design as we know it.” Every year, another unpleasant physical effect from the evil depths of deep submicron physics surfaces, compromising our designs in new and vile ways. Every year, the same story: more nanometer woes. Rather than endorse a new winner in this year's race for the “next worst thing” from the nanometer arena, this panel gathers a set of world-class technology experts to debate what effects are hiding just around the next corner, waiting to pounce on the unwary tool or chip designer. Which among these is really the most important, when will it happen, and why? Panelists Bob Brodersen U.C. Berkeley Anthony Hill Texas Instruments John Kibarian PDF Solutions Desmond A.
