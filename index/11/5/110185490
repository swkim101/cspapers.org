Gun tube is a kind of thin-walled circular tube with special use. Its inner surface are loaded serious gas loading of high temperature and high pressure gas when consecutive shooting. In this paper, the assault rifle gun is taken as the research object and the FEM software ANSYS is taken as a computing platform, data of barrel dynamic temperature and stress under continuous loading are obtained. The calculation results show that, (1) The temperature field and stress field coupling effect is very obvious in the barrel bore surface; (2) Thermal shock has obvious thin-layer effect; (3) The thermal stress caused by heat load significantly higher than the bore pressure produced by chamber pressure .Model and analysis method used in this paper provides an important reference of design for the design and improve of the barrel in the aspect of heat intensity.
