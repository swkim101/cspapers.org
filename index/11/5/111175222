This paper introduces an on-line monitoring system for partial discharge of 10kV cable joint based on LabVIEW. It calculates transfer characteristic of wideband current transformer for monitoring partial discharge current after analyzing the mechanism of production of partial discharge. The proposed current transformer can restrain the noise signal efficiently in electromagnetic induction part. Since the on-line monitoring system was installed in transformer substation, the LabVIEW monitoring platform can keep a lookout over partial discharge current of cable joint constantly. It can monitor the cable joint accurately.
