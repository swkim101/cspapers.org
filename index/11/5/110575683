People recovering from arm injuries are often prescribed limits to the amount of strain they can place on their muscles at a given point during the recovery process. However, it is sometimes difficult for them to know when a given activity creates strain in excess of these limits. To inform this process, we have developed a prototype, the LightWeight, and describe it here. The aim of the LightWeight is to inform users of the strain on targeted muscles as the activity occurs, and to display the relationship of that strain to the aforementioned limits. LightWeight is embedded within a compression sleeve that measures muscle strain through conductive fabric and EMG while displaying that information through an intuitive circular LED display.
