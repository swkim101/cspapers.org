The paper deals with a special class of robots, namely the hyper-redundant arm with continuum elements. First, the dynamic model of the tentacle arm during the motion toward the imposed position is analyzed. The dynamic model of the tentacle arm with continuum elements in conjunction with the electro-rheological fluid is discussed. Also, numerical simulations of the arm motion to the imposed target are presented.
