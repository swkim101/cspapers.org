A popular harmonic current reduction method specifically is to increase the number of rectification pulses such as 18-pulse ATRU. This paper presents a 2-order Butterworth LC filter designed to suppress the DC output voltage ripple of the ATRU. And an EMI filter is designed to overcome the electromagnetic interference caused by the high frequency pulse load. Because of the same position and configuration, the same filter is verified in theory to achieve both purposes. Finally, a simulation model of 18-pulse ATRU is built and the two filter's characteristics in the time domain are tested and analyzed.
