The main goal of this workshop is to understand the opportunities and challenges of developing tools as plug-ins. In particular, we would like to discuss the characteristics of good plug-ins, understand interoperability requirements to making tools available across platforms, identify recent successful tools as plug-ins and specify the medium and long-term challenges of tools as plug-ins.
