taking the rail spectrum of high-speed railways suggested by the China Academy of Railway Sciences for example. maked spectrum estimation of sample space using the equivalent method based on power spectrum in frequency range and obtains the power spectral density of rail irregularity through Matlab programming. Results show that the smaller the mean square value is, the smoother the rail is. For v=200km/h, the simulated peak values of rail irregularity are all smaller than 12mm; when the high-speed train travels at 350km/h, the sensitive wavelength that causes strong vibration of the body can reach 100m.
