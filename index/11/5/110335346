The elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) study of water-based ferrofluid bearing with single sine-shaped peak, rectangular-shaped valley and V-shaped valley was carried out. The influence of the amplitude and the width on the pressure and film thickness was discussed. The results reveal that the pressure and film thickness change apparently with the change of micro-morphology; The amplitudes of the local pressure peak and the film thickness increase with the increase of amplitudes; The widths of the local pressure peak and the film thickness increase with the increase of width.
