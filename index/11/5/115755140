A key component of Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS) are connected Cyber Physical Machines (CPMs), or smart machines, which can act independently to each other and communicate in situation dependant ways. This new era of connected manufacturing has brought about new requirements for machines which are being deployed to the manufacturing shop floor. Cyber physical machines are not only required to execute industrial or manufacturing process, but they need to be capable of meeting other requirements, such as self-diagnoses, intelligent decision making, modularity and networkability. This research explores the design process of cyber physical machines as it is applied to the design of an industrial robotic manipulator.
