In this paper, we propose a new SVRG-style acceleated stochastic algorithm for solving a family of non-convex optimization problems whose objective consists of a sum of $n$ smooth functions and a non-smooth convex function. Our major goal is to improve the convergence of SVRG-style stochastic algorithms to stationary points under a setting with a large condition number $c$ - the ratio between the smoothness constant and the negative curvature constant. The proposed algorithm achieves the best known gradient complexity when $c\geq \Omega(n)$, which was achieved previously by a SAGA-style accelerated stochastic algorithm. Compared with the SAGA-style accelerated stochastic algorithm, the proposed algorithm is more practical due to its low memory cost that is inherited from previous SVRG-style algorithms. Compared with previous studies on SVRG-style stochastic algorithms, our theory provides much stronger results in terms of (i) reduced gradient complexity under a large condition number; and (ii) that the convergence is proved for a sampled stagewise averaged solution that is selected from all stagewise averaged solutions with increasing sampling probabilities instead of for a uniformly sampled solutions across all iterations.
