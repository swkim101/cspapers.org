The ordinary circular stop-hole may not remove the residual stresses associated with the plastic zones which always follow a fatigue crack tip. Plastic deformation will occur at the crack tip as a result of the high stresses that are generated by the sharp stress concentration Irwinâ€™s Approach [1] demonstrates that when yielding occurs, stresses redistribute in order to satisfy equilibrium conditions. To redistribute this excessive force, the plastic zone size must increase Irwin proposed that plasticity makes the crack behave as if it were larger than actual physical size
