Measurement device for rotary kiln axis demands high positioning accuracy, considering the disadvantage of its complex way of measurement and its wired transmission, an on-line measuring method of rotary kiln using the one-point measuring method at each rotary kiln support is put forward. On the basis of it, a wireless transmitting and receiving hardware system is built, and a software is designed to send the information to the PC using the short distance wireless transmission techniques, then the fitting center of the whole axis is formed. The advantages of the method are that measurement and calculation method is simple, and the information transmission is fast.
