Design reuse is expected to be a key enabler for system designs in the 90's. Proponents claim that design reuse increases competitiveness through better quality, improved predictability and better productivity. On the other hand, skeptics say that design reuse is not realizable due to several barriers including rapid changes in technology, lack of standardized libraries and the presence of human, as opposed to technical barriers. Is design reuse a reality? How much is reused in practice? Where is it most applicable? Do concrete metrics exist for reusability? The panel will assess the track record of design reuse and discuss its status and future.
