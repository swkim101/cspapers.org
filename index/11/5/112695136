This paper describes a new Internet telerobot framework suitable for autonomous mobile robots and designed for user edutainment. Our specific implementation allows users to give goals to a biologically inspired navigating robot, the iRat, and SLAM system, RatSLAM. The framework is built on open source tools such as the increasingly popular Robot Operating System and de facto standard Apache web server. The users receive visual updates via their browser at 10Hz on a PC or mobile device. The results demonstrate a reliable autonomous mobile robot system that within 24 hours of continuous operation reached 447 goals, traveled 199 meters, and an Internet telerobot framework that can support many users and uploaded images totaling 19GB. Survey results indicated that users found the site visually pleasing and intuitive, the video was smooth, and that users would stay for a relatively long period.
