Because of the nonlinear motion of the robot-fish and the uncertain water waves, it is difficult to track dynamic target accurately and quickly for the robot-fish. To solve this problem, this paper proposed the target tracking strategy of underwater robot-fish based on Unscented Kalman filter (UKF). UKF is a nonlinear filtering on the basis of unscented transformation, which consists of prediction and update recursively, thus estimate the state of the system. To avoid the particle degeneracy, this paper selects sigma points adopting scale symmetric sampling strategy. We apply UKF method to the underwater robot-fish competition in China. Simulations show that the Robot-fish has fast tracking speed, shorter tracking path and smaller tracking error using UKF method than not using the method. It has excellent tracking performance.
