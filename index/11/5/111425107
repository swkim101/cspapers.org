As technology pushes customers to buy new released products, especially mobile phone, high product replacement from the customers plays a role in increasing production rate for new products and rate of abandoned products. It accelerates environmental degradation like natural resource usage for the new products and pollutions generated by disposing the abandoned products. In this respect, product recovery is needed to reduce landfill rates, and resource usages, and prolong product lifecycle. Modular drivers such as interface design, material type, and components’ lifespan are applied to design modules for product recovery. The objective of this research is to support designers to assess initial modules and then reorganize modules for product recovery. First, according to conventional modular product design, the initial modules are generated. Then, since it is difficult to estimate how much the modules have negative effects on environment, the environmental impacts of a product are assessed by Eco-Indicator 99 based on used materials. Also, the complexity of the interface design is measured to understand how the modules are easily disassembled for upgrading and maintaining end-of-life products by using weighted-modular complexity score (wMCS). After assessing the product based on the Eco-Indicator 99 and wMCS, we apply new design guidelines to improve sustainability of a product in the end of life stage. Consequently, we compare the extent to design for sustainability before and after redesigning a product based on the design guideline. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the modular product design, we carry out a case study with a coffee maker.Copyright © 2015 by ASME
