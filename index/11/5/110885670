In both industrial field and office building, the accurate statistic of people who enter or leave the elevator has important practical meaning in security and analysis of passenger flow. We present a binocular vision system to count the people pass by. The camera is set in the height of 2.45 meters to monitor the people overhead in order to reduce the overlap of pedestrians. The object segment and tracking method proposed in this paper show good result with the disparity map gained by the dual-camera. Dynamic promotion of threshold is used in the object segmentation. Feature matching is used to track the moving objects. The system can get the number of people accurate and timely. Experiment results show that our system has good performance under relatively complex circumstance.
