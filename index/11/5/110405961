TMS320DM6446 was used as a platform to build a video monitoring and controlling system for plant diseases. TMS320DM6446 can capture and encode the plant video. It delivered the video stream to the PC monitoring center by using streaming technology. Monitoring center displayed the received video, monitored the plant condition of growth and disease, and then obtained the image and relevant characteristics of disease. It used a combination of neural networks and expert systems to diagnose the plant diseases, and gave the control methods. The experimental results show that the proposed system can timely collect information about plant growth status and disease, diagnose the type of disease correctly and then reach the purpose of effective prevention and control for plant diseases.
