It is necessary to carry out regular maintenance and replacement of the traditional power transformer pressure and humidity absorber in the long running time. When the transformer in use to upgrade or retrofit, usually need to find a simple, practical solution. Conventional moisture absorbers require the use of silica gel particles or similar desiccant to absorb water, the need for regular replacement of desiccant. In order to improve the working efficiency of desiccant and reduce the cost of desiccant replacement, this paper introduces the latest technology of dual-channel maintenance-free moisture absorber, describes the working principle of the device and the advantages of the element, and its application prospects in the power industry Outlook.
