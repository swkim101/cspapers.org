Active Front Steering (AFS) is an important application to improve the stability of the vehicle, and the driver characteristic is also an important factor for the vehicle stability. In this article, a driver-behavior-based prediction control algorithm for AFS is proposed. According to the informed road trajectory, the ideal preview driver model is introduced to predict the future steering wheel angle. Based on this, a two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) reference vehicle model and a PID controller are used to generate active steering control. The algorithm is verified by Carsim and Matlab/Simulink co-simulation, and the results show that trajectory tracking of the vehicle can be guarantee and driver manipulation duty can be reduced.
