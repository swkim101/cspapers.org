By experiment,adopt clay as the transfer medium between copper bar and pavement,change the grounding mode of electrode,high density electrical method was used for subgrade failure detection. The experiment result show that this method can control all most ground resistance within 10KÎ©m and the subgrade failure can be detected. Because of the electrode grounding area is larger and the resistivity is higher,caused the inversion result has some error. This conclusion of experiment can provide reference for subgrade failure detection of high density electrical method for opening road.
