This dual-ducted SUAV is a nonlinear and strong coupling of multiple-input and multiple-output system, and particularly between the pitch and roll channels channel coupling is strong, in order to implement effective control, it must be decoupled. The traditional methods are difficult to achieve effective control of the strong coupling of multivariable systems. For the SUAV model of nonlinear coupling characteristics, based on the establishment of the UAV attitude model, this paper designed an attitude ADRC decoupling controller. The simulation showed this ADRC decoupling controller had strong robustness and immunity, and solved the channels coupling between the pitch and roll.
