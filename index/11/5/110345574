Work hardening is an important index for the evaluation of the machined surface quality in high-speed milling. The morphology of work hardening can be visually observed by the metallographic pictures of high-speed milling gained from the scanning electron microscope which includes the lattice distortion and cracks etc. Forming mechanism of lattice distortion and micro crack of micro morphology under the workpiece surface is analyzed according to the dislocation theory; meanwhile, the effects on surface quality of the microstructure of the work hardening layer are discussed, which have important guiding significances on improving the surface quality and prolonging the service life of the parts.
