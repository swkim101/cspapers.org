T paper proposes two way model to secure data during transmission and sharing over the Internet, wherein cryptographic and steganographic techniques are combined. It also proposes compressing the cipher-text file using the Lempel-Ziv algorithm to reduce its size so that it uses less space in the cover image after data embedding and also to increase the speed (rate) at which the message is delivered to the destination. The use of Discrete Cosine Transform and Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform for image processing is explained, since they will be used in the process of image compression and decompression respectively.
