Robot soccer competition provides an excellent opportunity for robotics research. In particular, the soccer robots must perform real-time visual recognition, navigate in a dynamic field, avoid the obstacle, collaborate with teammates, and kick the ball in the correct direction. All these tasks demand robots that are autonomous (sensing, thinking, and acting as independent creatures), efficient (functioning under time and resource constraints), cooperative (collaborating with each other robot to accomplish tasks that are beyond individualâ€™s capabilities), and intelligent (reasoning and planing actions and perhaps learning from experience). This paper proposes a method of defining and analysing the attacking robot tasks using Petri nets. Attacking soccer robot behaviors are modeled using the generalized stochastic Petri nets. Using Petri nets allows qualitative and quantitative analysis of the task execution. Petri net model is implemented in Petri Net Toolbox under MATLAB environment. Therefore, it is validated the net topology, the evolution of (their dynamics), the structural and behavioral properties (corresponding to checking if resources usage is stable and the model have no deadlocks), as well as the stochastic performance.
