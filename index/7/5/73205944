The concept nursing grand rounds (NGR) has been reported in the nursing literature since the 1960s. Many of the reported initiatives are based on a presentation forum in the manner of medical grand rounds, as an approach to undergraduate education, or as a means to monitor patients. Among the points of difference in the design of the pilot project undertaken in a busy surgical ward to investigate the effectiveness of NGR in increasing nurses work satisfaction was the inclusion of the nursing librarian as an integral part of the NGR team and processes which previously has not reported in the literature. The nursing librarian’s role was to search the literature and find the best evidence on the predetermined patient topic prior to the NGR to enable the nurse presenting to integrate the research findings into the presentation of the patient. The nursing librarian attended each NGR and commented where appropriate on the level of evidence. Nurses discussed current practice and the impact the retrieved literature would have on patient care comparing best practice with current practice. Outcomes of this project include in some cases change in practice, change in culture where NGRs are now embedded into ward culture, NGR extended to other wards, enthusiasm for EBP, the initiation of a “super searcher” model where the nursing librarian is more of a consultant and develops the searching skills of nominated nurses who become the resource on the ward.
