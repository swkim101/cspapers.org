We present B link, a data-driven system that leverages TCP-induced signals to detect failures directly in the data plane. The key intuition behind B link is that a TCP ﬂow exhibits a predictable behavior upon disruption: retransmitting the same packet over and over, at epochs exponentially spaced in time. When compounded over multiple ﬂows, this behavior creates a strong and characteristic failure signal. B link efﬁciently analyzes TCP ﬂows to: (i) select which ones to track; (ii) reliably and quickly detect major trafﬁc disruptions; and (iii) recover connectivity—all this, completely in the data plane. We present an implementation of B link in P4 together with an extensive evaluation on real and synthetic trafﬁc traces. Our results indicate that B link: (i) achieves sub-second rerouting for large fractions of Internet trafﬁc; and (ii) prevents unnecessary trafﬁc shifts even in the presence of noise. We further show the feasibility of B link by running it on an actual Toﬁno switch.
