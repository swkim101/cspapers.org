Despite recent success of deep neural networks, it remains challenging to efficiently learn new visual concepts from limited training data. To address this problem, a prevailing strategy is to build a meta-learner that learns prior knowledge on learning from a small set of annotated data. However, most of existing meta-learning approaches rely on a global representation of images and a meta-learner with complex model structures, which are sensitive to background clutter and difficult to interpret. We propose a novel meta-learning method for few-shot classification based on two simple attention mechanisms: one is a spatial attention to localize relevant object regions and the other is a task attention to select similar training data for label prediction. We implement our method via a dual-attention network and design a semantic-aware meta-learning loss to train the meta-learner network in an end-to-end manner. We validate our model on three few-shot image classification datasets with extensive ablative study, and our approach shows competitive performances over these datasets with fewer parameters.
