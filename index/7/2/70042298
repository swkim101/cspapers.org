Complex engineered systems are often associated with risk due to high failure consequences, high complexity, and large investments. As a result, it is desirable for complex engineered systems to be resilient such that they can avoid or quickly recover from faults. Ideally, this should be done at the early design stage where designers are most able to explore a large space of concepts. Previous work has shown that functional models can be used to predict fault propagation behavior and motivate design work. However, little has been done to formally optimize a design based on these predictions, partially because the effects of these models have not been quantified into an objective function to optimize. This work introduces a scoring function which integrates with a fault scenario-based simulation to enable the risk-neutral optimization of functional model resilience. This scoring function accomplishes this by resolving the tradeoffs between the design costs, operating costs, and modeled fault response of a given design in a way that may be parameterized in terms of designer-specified resilient features. This scoring function is adapted and applied to the optimization of controlling functions which recover flows in a monopropellant orbiter. In this case study, an evolutionary algorithm is found to find the optimal logic for these functions, showing an improvement over a typical a-priori guess by exploring a large range of solutions, demonstrating the value of the approach.Copyright Â© 2018 by ASME
