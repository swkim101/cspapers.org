Humans interact in rich and diverse ways with the environment. However, the representation of such behavior by artificial agents is often limited. In this work we present motion concepts, a novel multimodal representation of human actions in a household environment. A motion concept encompasses a probabilistic description of the kinematics of the action along with its contextual background, namely the location and the objects held during the performance. We introduce a novel algorithm which learns and recognizes motion concepts from action demonstrations, named Online Motion Concept Learning (OMCL). The algorithm is evaluated on a virtual-reality household environment with the presence of a human avatar. OMCL outperforms standard motion recognition algorithms on an one-shot recognition task, attesting to its potential for sample-efficient recognition of human actions.
