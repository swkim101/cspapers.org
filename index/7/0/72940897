The Thanks feature on Wikipedia, also known as “Thanks”, is a tool with which editors can quickly and easily send one other positive feedback [1]. The aim of this project is to better understand this feature: its scope, the characteristics of a typical “Thanks” interaction, and the effects of receiving a thank on individual editors. We study the motivational impacts of “Thanks” because maintaining editor engagement is a central problem for crowdsourced repositories of knowledge such as Wikimedia. Our main findings are that most editors have not been exposed to the Thanks feature (meaning they have never given nor received a thank), thanks are typically sent upwards (from less experienced to more experienced editors), and receiving a thank is correlated with having high levels of editor engagement. Though the prevalence of “Thanks” usage varies by editor experience, the impact of receiving a thank seems mostly consistent for all users. We empirically demonstrate that receiving a thank has a strong positive effect on short-term editor activity across the board and provide preliminary evidence that thanks could compound to have long-term effects as well.
