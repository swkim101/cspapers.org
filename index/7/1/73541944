The goal of this research is to obtain the optimum design of a new interbody fusion implant for use in lumbar spine fixation. A new minimally invasive surgical technique for interbody fusion is currently in development. The procedure makes use of an interbody implant that is inserted between two vertebral bodies. The implant is packed with bone graft material that fuses the motion segment. The implant must be capable of retaining bone graft and supporting spinal mechanical loads while fusion occurs. Finite element-based optimization techniques are used to drive the design. The optimization process is performed in two stages: topology optimization and shape optimization. Four independent load conditions are analyzed: compression, flexion, extension, and lateral bending. The resulting optimal geometries for each load condition are superimposed to generate an optimum design that is converted to a candidate implant geometry suitable for manufacturing.
