The first workshop on Human Factors and Activity Recognition in Healthcare, Wellness and Assisted Living (Recognise2Interact) aims to enable researchers and practitioners from both, Activity Recognition and Human Computer Interaction to interact and bridge the gap between these two fields. The workshop will provide a comprehensive overview on current technological solutions that benefit from the synergy of activity recognition and human computer interaction with particular focus to Healthcare, Wellness and Assisted living applications. The workshop is supported by the iCareNet network.
