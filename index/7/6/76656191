The objective of STEPS2 "Rover Surface Navigation" work package was the design, development, validation and verification of innovative solutions suitable for the future (manned and unmanned) space robotics mission. A particular focus has been put in the autonomous capabilities to be implemented for the baseline mission scenario: sample canister acquisition and return, simulated in TAS-I ROvers eXploration facilitY.This paper gives an overview of the adopted System Development Life Cycle, that is based on V-model and agile methodologies. Then the infrastructure, including the ROXY facility and research robots are detailed. The paper focuses on the Test activities and relevant results for the Modular GNC developed on the TAS-I Robot Management Framework architecture. Finally, the future envisaged activities are presented, including upgrades to Methodology, ROXY facility and GNC modules and their usage in the frame of TAS-I research activities and ESA funded contracts
