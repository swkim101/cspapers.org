In this paper, we tackle the problem of trajectory planning and control of a vehicle under locally varying traction limitations, in the presence of suddenly appearing obstacles. We employ concepts from adaptive model predictive control for run-time adaptation of tire force constraints that are imposed by local traction conditions. To solve the resulting optimization problem for real-time control synthesis with such time varying constraints, we propose a novel numerical scheme based on Real Time Iteration Sequential Quadratic Programming (RTI-SQP), which we call Sampling Augmented Adaptive RTI (SAA-RTI). Sampling augmentation of conventional RTI-SQP provides additional feasible candidate trajectories for warm-starting the optimization procedure. Thus, the proposed SAA-RTI algorithm enables real time constraint adaptation and reduces sensitivity to local minima. Through extensive numerical simulations we demonstrate that our method increases the vehicleâ€™s capacity to avoid accidents in scenarios with unanticipated obstacles and locally varying traction, compared to equivalent non-adaptive control schemes and traditional planning and tracking approaches.
