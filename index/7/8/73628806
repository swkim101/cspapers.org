There are also the industrial networking associations, which serve to promote communication protocols, and are aligned to leading automation component vendors. For example, Siemens and Bosch, leading suppliers of automation technology, support the Profi and Sercos networking protocols, ensuring that a standard communication backbone can be installed throughout the production system. Particularly in discrete manufacturing, the adoption of communication protocols is transitioning from fieldbus to industrial Ethernet, which is aiding integration with the enterprise. This move is slower in process industries, where fieldbus technologies are more entrenched.
