In this paper, we analyze timed systems with data structures. We start by describing behaviors of timed systems using graphs with timing constraints. Such a graph is called realizable if we can assign time-stamps to nodes or events so that they are consistent with the timing constraints. The logical definability of several graph properties [20], [10] has been a challenging problem, and we show, using a highly nontrivial argument, that the realizability property for collections of graphs with strict timing constraints is logically definable in a class of propositional dynamic logic (EQ-ICPDL), which is strictly contained in MSO. Using this result, we propose a novel, algorithmically efficient and uniform proof technique for the analysis of timed systems enriched with auxiliary data structures, like stacks and queues. Our technique unravels new results (for emptiness checking as well as model checking) for timed systems with richer features than considered so far, while also recovering existing results.
