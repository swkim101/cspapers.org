We present PTracer, a Linux kernel patch trace bot based on an improved PatchNet. PTracer continuously monitors new patches in the git repository of the mainline Linux kernel, filters out unconcerned ones, classifies the rest as bug-fixing or non bug-fixing patches, and reports bug-fixing patches to the kernel experts of commercial operating systems. We use the patches in February 2019 of the mainline Linux kernel to perform the test. As a result, PTracer recommended 151 patches to CGEL kernel experts out of 5,142, and 102 of which were accepted. PTracer has been successfully applied to a commercial operating system and has the advantages of improving software quality and saving labor cost.
