Service Grids with mobile devices are not exploited to their full potential yet because device owners cannot control how much energy is spent on providing a certain service. Solving this problem can increase the willingness of device owners to share their resources. We propose to extend existing middleware for mobile Grids by an energy aware component that allows to implement sophisticated policies of energy management. Based on an energy aware middleware for mobile Grids new systems of incentive and accounting can be derived.
