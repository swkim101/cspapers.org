The formation of a complex network is highly driven by multi-aspect node influences and interactions, reflected on network structures and the content embodied in network nodes. Limited work has jointly modeled all these aspects, which typically focuses on topological structures but overlooks the heterogeneous interactions behind node linkage and contributions of node content to the interactive heterogeneities. Here, we propose a multi-aspect interaction and influence-unified evolutionary coupled system (MAI-ECS) for network representation by involving node content and linkage-based network structure. MAI-ECS jointly and iteratively learns two systems: a multi-aspect interaction learning system to capture heterogeneous hidden interactions between nodes and an influence propagation system to capture multiaspect node influences and their propagation between nodes. MAI-ECS couples, unifies and optimizes the two systems toward an effective representation of explicit node content and network structure, and implicit node interactions and influences. MAI-ECS shows superior performance in node classification and link prediction in comparison with the stateof-the-art methods on two real-world datasets. Further, we demonstrate the semantic interpretability of the results generated by MAI-ECS.
