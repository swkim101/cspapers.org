This paper introduces HopRank, an algorithm for modeling human navigation on semantic networks. HopRank leverages the assumption that users know or can see the whole structure of the network. Therefore, besides following links, they also follow nodes at certain distances (i.e., k-hop neighborhoods), and not at random as suggested by PageRank, which assumes only links are known or visible. We observe such preference towards k-hop neighborhoods on BioPortal, one of the leading repositories of biomedical ontologies on the Web. In general, users navigate within the vicinity of a concept. But they also “jump” to distant concepts less frequently. We fit our model on 11 ontologies using the transition matrix of clickstreams, and show that semantic structure can influence teleportation in PageRank. This suggests that users-to some extent-utilize knowledge about the underlying structure of ontologies, and leverage it to reach certain pieces of information. Our results help the development and improvement of user interfaces for ontology exploration.
