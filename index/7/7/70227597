With the approaching end of Moore’s Law and the end of Dennard scaling, computer architects must look for ways to more effectively use available transistors while respecting power and energy constraints. Researchers have begun to explore heterogeneous systems as a possible solution to this problem. These systems seek to improve their energy efficiency by catering to the fact that applications may have different performance requirements. Chips with heterogeneous microarchitecture, such as ARM’s big.LITTLE architecture [2] and Apple’s A11 processor [1], have become common in mobile processors for this reason. By using the smaller, lower-power cores for applications that do not need the larger cores’ computational power, these processors achieve better energy efficiency without impacting the user’s experience. More recent work by Venkat et al. [7] explored microprocessors with heterogeneous ISAs and heterogeneous microarchitecture in simulation. Their work found that these systems can offer additional performance and energy benefits. Heterogeneous ISA systems pose interesting challenges to system software due to differing per-ISA program state. DeVuyst et al. [5] developed a compiler which generates binaries that can be migrated between ISAs. The researchers behind Popcorn Linux have looked at migrating binaries during runtime [6] and what an OS might look like running on a multi-ISA system [4]. They evaluated an x86-ARM systemwhere the cores were connected over PCI, but the system did not have shared memory, which meant that migration of binaries during execution was extremely expensive. However, it is difficult to create a shared-memory heterogeneous ISA multiprocessor from off the shelf parts without significant engineering efforts.
