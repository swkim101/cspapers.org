Augustus III (1696–1763)—son of Augustus the Strong (1670–1733), and both elector of Protestant Saxony and king of Catholic Poland from 1733—shared his father’s love of Italy from an early age.1 In 1712, the sixteen-year-old was sent off, incognito, on a grand tour through Italy in order to remove him from the Lutheran influence of his mother, Christiane Eberhardine von Brandenburg-Bayreuth. During his stay in Bologna, the prince secretly converted to Catholicism, in accordance with his father’s wishes and the pope’s reconfessionalization policy, thereby fulfilling a precondition for his later election as king of Poland. What the prince saw in northern Italy made a lasting impression and shaped his tastes in art. He traveled to Venice two more times, where he acquired, among other works of art, fifty pastels by Rosalba Carriera; these would later form the core of his pastels cabinet.2 During his reign, Augustus III strove to transform Dresden’s urban appearance and the court’s pageantry, fine arts, and music into those of an Italian city, indeed, to turn Dresden into Venice’s heir. The times were conducive to Augustus’s Italianization of Dresden: as his art agent Francesco Algarotti complained, Italy’s culture, and particularly the Serenissima’s, were in decline, and their cultural treasures, artists, and scholars were migrating to the courts and metropolises of northern Europe.3
