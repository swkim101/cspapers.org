In aquatic ecosystems inputs of matter and energy present in greater or lesser extent depending on the basin, given the origin and quality of these resources, you can alter the balance in metabolism or interactions in the food web. Using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, the link between potential sources of funds and use established by macrozooplankton species in Lake Big and Lake Fellow the Lake Tota sectors. Trophic possible ways the role of each species in the proposed network, as well. In general, most of this study, most species have a bond with the autotrophic pathway, being the phytoplankton the food resource base for the food web, commonly found impoverished carbon signals. Particularly, the analysis showed a variation in the source or resource for two species (Daphnia laevis and Bosmina (Bosmina) cf. longirostris), with an enrichment in its signal to 19.92 ‰ -20.34 ‰ δC, which can be given by plasticity in their food supply, and even if Boeckella gracilis having a signal indicating a specialization in its appeal with carbon impoverished -30 to -26 ‰ values δC while nitrogen values are enriched with an average value 20.21 ‰ in δN. To set the trophic fractionation means establishing three groups, the first (herbivores) consisting of (D. laevis, B. (Bosmina) and Ceriodaphnia pulchella cf. longirostris), the second (omnivore) which is (Daphnia pulex, Macrocyclops sp. and Cyclopoida), and a third group (secondary consumer) where is the only calanoido B. gracilis. In comparing the temporal variation is observed that there is a significant change in signals δC and δ15N of some species in relation to the influence of sources and allochthonous or autochthonous origin, spatial variation was not significant. It is concluded that the macrozooplanton Lake Tota, has a strong link with the autotrophic pathway and pelagic trophic levels have 3 sections, plus the primary producers and the food web in general tends to have an amplitude of trophic niche.
