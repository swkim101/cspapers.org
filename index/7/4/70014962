Person Re-identification(re-ID) has great potential to contribute to video surveillance that automatically searches and identifies people across different cameras. Heterogeneous person re-identification between thermal(infrared) and visible images is essentially a cross-modality problem and important for night-time surveillance application. Current methods usually train a model by combining classification and metric learning algorithms to obtain discriminative and robust feature representations. However, the combined loss function ignored the correlation between classification subspace and feature embedding subspace. In this paper, we use Sphere Softmax to learn a hypersphere manifold embedding and constrain the intra-modality variations and cross-modality variations on this hypersphere. We propose an end-to-end dualstream hypersphere manifold embedding network(HSMEnet) with both classification and identification constraint. Meanwhile, we design a two-stage training scheme to acquire decorrelated features, we refer the HSME with decorrelation as D-HSME. We conduct experiments on two crossmodality person re-identification datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two datasets. On RegDB dataset, rank-1 accuracy is improved from 33.47% to 50.85%, and mAP is improved from 31.83% to 47.00%.
