Oil and gas facilities are required to have continuous production. With recent power supply challenges, it is important to provide reliable and resilient micro energy grid to avoid power interruption and achieve safe operation and shutdown of oil and gas facilities. The proposed power protection strategy is based on the development of micro energy grid with renewable energy sources. Self-healing strategies will be identified against all possible hazards and fault scenarios in oil and gas facility and critical components. This includes safety and performance degradation scenarios, and related power supply issues due to internal and external factors. Risk-based operation scenarios will be evaluated with different micro energy grid designs and configurations. The proposed solution will provide selfhealing and recovery operation using advanced and intelligent control devices.
