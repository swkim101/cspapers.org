The 60s, we are constantly told, were a time of rebellion, a time of change, a time of hope, or just a selfindulgent game of the "me" generation, depending on point of view. The 60s are currently decried by a younger generation, jealous of the alleged freedoms and actions of the baby boomers who have supposedly left them nothing to inherit but the wind. Revisionist writers go to extraordinary lengths to debunk the mythology of the 60s, but in essence they mainly rail against the late 60s early 70s. In their attacks on the baby boomers they conveniently forget that the oldest of this demographic grouping was only 14 in 1960, and the vast majority of them were not even teenagers!
