Nimonic super alloy are extensively used in the aerospace industry because of its unique properties. As they are quite costly and difficult to machine, the machining tool is easy to get worn. To solve the problem, an experiment was carried out on a numerical control slitting automatic lathe to analysis the tool wearing conditions and partsâ€™ surface quality of nimonic super alloy GH2132 under different cutters. The selection of suitable cutter, reasonable cutting data and cutting speed is obtained and some conclusions are made. The excellent coating tool, compared with other hard alloy cutters, along with suitable cutting data will greatly improve the production efficiency and product quality, it can completely meet the process of nimonic super alloy GH2312.
