In this paper is presented the 3D acquisition and reconstruction process of complex geometry objects: two types of hip and cervical-cephalic prosthesis. The reconstruction process is based on triangulation single camera solution method with a 3D optical non-contact scanner which uses an emitted laser beam to sweep the object surfaces.
