The paper presents the design, implementation and use of an automatic test bench for the injection process, using an economical solution for recording successive images of a fuel jet injected into a chamber pressurized with nitrogen at ambient temperature, with a camera. Injection pressure can be adjusted with high precision using a closed loop PID control (closed loop). The test bench operation is synchronized by a computer-assisted system. Experimental results are also summarized for research of the diesel injection process.
