The paper deals with the investigation of stress in the tooth root area of standard external spur gears with thin rim. The stress field was determined by means of 3D finite element analysis, which enabled to consider narrow and wider faced gear. In order to follow the variation of tooth stress for the meshing phase, numerical pinion-wheel model was developed, that can take into account the load sharing between tooth pairs simultaneously in contact. On the basis of the obtained results, the stress variation at the centres of the loaded teeth bottoms was established and compared for characteristic points of a single and double pair tooth contact. This bottom stress variation indicates the effects of the chosen gear geometrical parameters, and the appearance of reversed stress, as the meshing proceeds.
