We present an end-to-end deep learning approach for performing metric scale-sensitive regression tasks such visual odometry with a single camera and no additional sensors. We propose a novel 3D convolutional architecture, 3DC-VO, that can leverage temporal relationships over a short moving window of images to estimate linear and angular velocities. The network makes local predictions on stacks of images that can be integrated to form a full trajectory. We apply 3DC-VO to the KITTI visual odometry benchmark and the task of estimating a pilotâ€™s control inputs from a first-person video of a quadrotor flight. Our method exhibits increased accuracy relative to comparable learning-based algorithms trained on monocular images. We also show promising results for quadrotor control input prediction when trained on a new dataset collected with a UAV simulator.
