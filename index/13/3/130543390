This paper presents a new metric, which we call the lighting variance ratio, for quantifying descriptors in terms of their variance to illumination changes. In many applications it is desirable to have descriptors that are robust to changes in illumination, especially in outdoor environments. The lighting variance ratio is useful for comparing descriptors and determining if a descriptor is lighting invariant enough for a given environment. The metric is analysed across a number of datasets, cameras and descriptors. The results show that the upright SIFT descriptor is typically the most lighting invariant descriptor.
