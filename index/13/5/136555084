In this study, hexagonal honeycombs with a shape memory alloy (SMA) are explored for super-compliant meso-structural design. A nitianol (NiTi) SMA based shear compliant hexagonal cellular materials are introduced and their elastic properties in shear are investigated. The constitutive relation of SMA and Cellular Materials Theory (CMT) are used to develop analytical constitutive equations of SMA honeycombs under isothermal shear loading. A fixed volume based SMA honeycombs are designed with a target shear modulus, (GA*)12 , of 10MPa and minimum uni-axial moduli (E11* and E22*) of 10MPa. About 27 to 70% of elastic shear strains are obtained with NiTi SMA honeycombs when they are designed with a G12* of 10MPa.Copyright Â© 2011 by ASME
