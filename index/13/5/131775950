Recent progress in multiple object tracking (MOT) has shown that a robust similarity score is a key to the success of trackers. A good similarity score is expected to reflect multiple cues, e.g. appearance, location, and topology, over a long period of time. However, these cues are heterogeneous, making them hard to be combined in a unified network. As a result, existing methods usually encode them in separate networks or require a complex training approach. In this paper, we present a unified framework for similarity measurement based on spatial-temporal relation network which could simultaneously encode various cues and perform reasoning across both spatial and temporal domains. We also study the feature representation of a tracklet-object pair in depth, showing a proper design of the pair features can well empower the trackers. The resulting approach is named spatial-temporal relation networks (STRN). It runs in a feed-forward way and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. The state-of-the-art accuracy was achieved on all of the MOT15$\sim$17 benchmarks using public detection and online settings.
