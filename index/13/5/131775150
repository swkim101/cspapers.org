We present a method for creating inconspicuous-looking textures that, when displayed as posters in the physical world, cause visual object tracking systems to become confused. As a target being visually tracked moves in front of such a poster, its adversarial texture makes the tracker lock onto it, thus allowing the target to evade. This adversarial attack evaluates several optimization strategies for fooling seldom-targeted regression models: non-targeted, targeted, and a newly-coined family of guided adversarial losses. Also, while we use the Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) algorithm to generate physical adversaries that fool tracking models when imaged under diverse conditions, we compare the impacts of different scene variables to find practical attack setups with high resulting adversarial strength and convergence speed. We further showcase that textures optimized using simulated scenes can confuse real-world tracking systems for cameras and robots.
