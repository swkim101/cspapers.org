The issue of overlapping or intersection in the toolpath is an issue in the metal deposition as the material is continuously added to the previous layer. Using various control schemes can achieve a better quality. However, such schemes fail to delivery satisfactory results when there are different intersection angles in the deposition toolpath. In order to overcome the problem caused by the intersection angle, the effect of them on the deposition should be well studied. This paper discusses the effect of toolpath intersection angle using design of experiment method. The impact of various parameters in the deposition process is studied. The approach and method can be integrated with path planning for a metal deposition process.Copyright Â© 2009 by ASME
