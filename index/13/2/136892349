In this paper, the effective mechanical properties of the 34 .6 lattice material are characterized theoretically and experimentally. The characterized properties include the stiffness and the strength of the material. A detailed description of the design procedure of the test specimens is presented. Three quasi-static tests are performed, namely, uniaxial tension, uniaxial compression and pure shear. The comparison of the experimental data to the theoretical results shows that the former are in good agreement with the latter. The maximum error obtained of 13% is acceptable according to the literature on experimental studies of cellular solids.Copyright Â© 2010 by ASME
