There is a stark disparity between the step size schedules used in practical large scale machine learning and those that are considered optimal by the theory of stochastic approximation. In theory, most results utilize polynomially decaying learning rate schedules, while, in practice, the "Step Decay" schedule is among the most popular schedules, where the learning rate is cut every constant number of epochs (i.e. this is a geometrically decaying schedule). 
This work examines the step-decay schedule for the stochastic optimization problem of streaming least squares regression (both in the non-strongly convex and strongly convex case), where we show that a sharp theoretical characterization of an optimal learning rate schedule is far more nuanced than suggested by previous work. We focus specifically on the rate that is achievable when using the final iterate of stochastic gradient descent, as is commonly done in practice. Our main result provably shows that a properly tuned geometrically decaying learning rate schedule provides an exponential improvement (in terms of the condition number) over any polynomially decaying learning rate schedule. We also provide experimental support for wider applicability of these results, including for training modern deep neural networks.
