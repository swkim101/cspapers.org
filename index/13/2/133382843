We propose a model of strategic hiding in a network in face of a hostile authority. Given a set of nodes, the hider chooses a network over these nodes together with a node. The network chosen by the hider is observed by the seeker (the hostile authority) but the location choice is not observed. The seeker chooses one of the nodes in the network to inspect. The inspected node is removed from the network. If the hider hides in the inspected node or one of its neighbours, he is caught by the seeker and suﬀers a penalty. Otherwise, he enjoys the beneﬁts from the network that are a convex and increasing function of the number of nodes (including himself) that the hider can access (directly or not) in the network. This form of network beneﬁts, ﬁrst proposed by [3]
