This paper describes work-in-progress aimed at generating dense 3D maps of urban environments using laser range data acquired from a moving platform. These maps display both fine-scale detail (resolving features only a few centimeters across) and large-scale consistency (typical maps are approximately 0.5 km on a side). In this paper, we sketch a basic 3D mapping algorithm (paying particular attention to practical engineering details) and present preliminary results acquired on the USC University Park campus using a Segway RMP vehicle.
