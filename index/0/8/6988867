We present an implemented unification-based parser for relational grammars developed within the stratified feature grammar (SFG) framework, which generalizes Kasper-Rounds logic to handle relational grammar analyses. We first introduce the key aspects of SFG and a lexicalized, graph-based variant of the framework suitable for implementing relational grammars. We then describe a head-driven chart parser for lexicalized SFG. The basic parsing operation is essentially ordinary feature-structure unification augmented with an operation of label unification to build the stratified features characteristic of SFG.
