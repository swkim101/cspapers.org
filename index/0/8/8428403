Data fusion is the ﬁnal step of a typical data integration process, after schematic conﬂicts have been overcome and after duplicates have been correctly identiﬁed. We present the relational data fusion system FuSem , which uses schema mappings and information about duplicates to decide what to fuse, i.e., which tuples to merge into one. The aspect emphasized by the demo is how to fuse the duplicates with FuSem . First, it oﬀers several conﬂict resolution functions to handle data conﬂicts among duplicates. Furthermore, diﬀerent fusion semantics proposed in the literature, such as MatchJoin or ConQuer, can be compared and visually explored. Optimized execution allows interactive access to the data and thus to explore the diﬀerent data fusion procedures.
