Efficient and stable topological structure is the core of a P2P platform. Current research of topology is all designing for some particular application, such as centralized topology for file sharing, decentralized unstructured topology for live streaming, hybrid topology for VoD streaming, and etc. But their inherent disadvantages make them not able to be applied for platform, which will support many kinds of applications. In order to solve the problem above, a new topology is proposed in this paper. It combines the advantages of current topology models, to create a general-purpose structure for large scale of peers. The whole structure is divided into two tiers: the upper is composed of super nodes, while the lower is composed of ordinary nodes. New topology has been applied in Ripple system. Testing shows that it is good for maintaining the platform stable and scalable, as well as processing joining and leaving of the peers. Besides, it improves the systempsilas load balancing.
