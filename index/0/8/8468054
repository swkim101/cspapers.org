CardioWave is a modular system for simulating wavefront conduction in the heart. These simulations may be used to investigate the factors that generate and sustain life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation. The user selects a set of modules which most closely reflects the simulation they are interested in and the simulator is built automatically. Thus, we do not present one monolithic simulator, but rather a simulator-generator which allows the researcher to make the trade-offs of complexity versus performance. The results presented here are from simulations run on an IBM SP parallel computer and a cluster of workstations. The performance numbers show excellent scalability up through 128 processors. With the larger memory of the parallel machines, we have been able to perform highly realistic simulations of the human atria. These simulations include realistic, 3-D geometries with inhomogeneity and anisotropy as we as highly complex membrane dynamics.
