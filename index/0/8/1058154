DiamondHelp is a reusable Java framework for building collaborative task guidance systems for complex devices, such as digitally enabled home appliances. DiamondHelp combines a generic conversational interface, adapted from online chat programs, with an application-specific direct manipulation interface. DiamondHelp provides "a things to say" mechanism for use without spoken language understanding; it also supports extensions to take advantage of speech technology. DiamondHelp's software architecture factors all application-specific content into two modular plug-ins, one of which includes Collagen and a task model.
