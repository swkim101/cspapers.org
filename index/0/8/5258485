While first popularized as a way of creating interactive web content, Java is in fact a general purpose, object-oriented language with such features as garbage collection, exceptions, strong typing, and a clean separation between classes and interfaces. Built around a C-style syntax, Java allows the writing of secure, robust programs that can be relied upon to run in a finite amount of space without crashing into a pile of bits. We will look not only at the language, but at the set of class and interface libraries which are defined as part of any compliant Java implementation.
