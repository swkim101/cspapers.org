The goal of this paper is to present a real-time controller for an omnidirectional wheeled humanoid robot which can be strongly disturbed and tilt around its wheels. It is based on two linear model predictive controllers, managed by a tilt supervisor, which detects changes of the dynamic model caused by the tilt of the robot. Experimental results are proposed on the robot Pepper made by Aldebaran, showing good performance in term of stability an robustness.
