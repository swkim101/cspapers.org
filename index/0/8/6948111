Multilingual applications frequently involve dealing with proper names, but names are often missing in bilingual lexicons. This problem is exacerbated for applications involving translation between Latin-scripted languages and Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) where simple string copying is not a solution. We present a novel approach for generating the ideographic representations of a CJK name written in a Latin script. The proposed approach involves first identifying the origin of the name, and then back-transliterating the name to all possible Chinese characters using language-specific mappings. To reduce the massive number of possibilities for computation, we apply a three-tier filtering process by filtering first through a set of attested bigrams, then through a set of attested terms, and lastly through the WWW for a final validation. We illustrate the approach with English-to-Japanese back-transliteration. Against test sets of Japanese given names and surnames, we have achieved average precisions of 73% and 90%, respectively.
