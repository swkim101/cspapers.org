Modern actuation schematics become increasingly ingenious by deploying springs and locking mechanisms in series and/or parallel. Many of these solutions are, however, tailored for a specific application and a general schematic that allows for drastic energy reduction remains a challenge. We have developed a series-parallel elastic actuator (SPEA) based on a symbiosis of multiple motors, springs and locking mechanisms in parallel, which we call +SPEA. This paper introduces the novel +SPEA concept. We present a first prototype, a +SPEA model and a control strategy that optimizes the energy consumption, and experiments to verify the working principle and recruitment strategy. The experiments show a good fit with the model and currently the actuator reduces the required energy in blocked output experiments by more than a factor 4.
