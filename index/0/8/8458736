Did you read any of the common reads for SIGCSE 2015? Now's your chance to talk about them! Three books: I, Robot by Isaac Asimov (Bantam Spectra, 1950), Bellwether by Connie Willis (Bantam Spectra, 1997) and Ready Player One by Ernest Cline (Broadway Books, 2012) were proposed at the end of the 2014 conference. If you're interested in science fiction, whether on a personal, academic, or pedagogical level, come join us in this BoF and discuss one or more of the three suggested books. We'll provide potential topics and discussion questions targeting how to incorporate these books into a CS course, but the discussion will be open. The BoF will close with a discussion of potential books for the 2016 conference.
