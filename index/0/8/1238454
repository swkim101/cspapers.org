Visitors who browse the web from wireless PDAs, cell phones, and pagers are frequently stymied by web interfaces optimized for desktop PCs. Simply replacing graphics with text and reformatting tables does not solve the problem, because deep link structures can still require minutes to traverse. 
 
In this paper we develop an algorithm, MINPATH, that automatically improves wireless web navigation by suggesting useful shortcut links in real time. MINPATH finds shortcuts by using a learned model of web visitor behavior to estimate the savings of shortcut links, and suggests only the few best links. We explore a variety of predictive models, including Naive Bayes mixture models and mixtures of Markov models, and report empirical evidence that MINPATH finds useful shortcuts that save substantial navigational effort.
