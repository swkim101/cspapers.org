Polygonal meshes have become the industry standard for the representation of surfaces with highly complex geometry and arbitrary genus in computer graphics and geometry processing applications. We investigate how to extend a point-set algorithm that utilizes a quadtree subdivision to construct a quadrilateral mesh with both angle and aspect ratio bounds. The main goal is to adapt the algorithm to respect polygonal edges so that we will obtain a method to mesh polygonal regions (possibly with holes), with quadrilateral elements that have guaranteed worst-case minimum and maximum angles as well as aspect ratio (longest edge over shortest). Currently, there is no known algorithm that generates quadrilateral meshes with both angle and aspect ratio guarantees.
