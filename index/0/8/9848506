This paper presents the CF-kernel method to estimate density functions from large datasets in a “best-efforts under the given resources” manner. By integrating the advantages of both the kernel method [WJ95] and the dynamical and incremental CF tree structure[ZRL96], the CF-kernel method improves time/space efficiency dramatically, while keeping the estimation accuracy as close to the kernel method as the available memory allows. Our theoretical proof shows that the CF-kernel method is equivalent to the kernel method under certain assumptions. Our experimental results of applying the CF-kernel method to various datasets show that it is much more time/space efficient compared with the kernel method whereas its estimation accuracy is comparable with, and converges super linearly to that of the kernel method as the memory increases.
