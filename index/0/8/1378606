Modern social network analysis relies on vast quantities of data to infer new knowledge about human relations and communication. In this paper we describe TwitterEcho, an open source Twitter crawler for supporting this kind of research, which is characterized by a modular distributed architecture. Our crawler enables researchers to continuously collect data from particular user communities, while respecting Twitter's imposed limits. We present the core modules of the crawling server, some of which were specifically designed to focus the crawl on the Portuguese Twittosphere. Additional modules can be easily implemented, thus changing the focus to a different community. Our evaluation of the system shows high crawling performance and coverage.
