We present extensions to the Embedded Xinu educational operating system that, when coupled with a target device like the Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL, provide for an extremely attractive hands-on laboratory platform in network courses. We present classroom and research lab evidence for the usefulness of this platform as a network education tool, and discuss its significance in the context of a wide spectrum of competitor systems. This project is part of a larger effort to bring cost-effective, hands-on embedded system laboratory experiences into systems courses throughout the undergraduate computer science core.
