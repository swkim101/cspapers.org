This paper presents dePENd, a novel interactive system that assists in sketching using regular pens and paper. Our system utilizes the ferromagnetic feature of the metal tip of a regular ballpoint pen. The computer controlling the X and Y positions of the magnet under the surface of the table provides entirely new drawing experiences. By controlling the movements of a pen and presenting haptic guides, the system allows a user to easily draw diagrams and pictures consisting of lines and circles, which are difficult to create by free-hand drawing. Moreover, the system also allows users to freely edit and arrange prescribed pictures. This is expected to reduce the resistance to drawing and promote users' creativity. In addition, we propose a communication tool using two dePENd systems that is expected to enhance the drawing skills of users. The functions of this system enable users to utilize interactive applications such as copying and redrawing drafted pictures or scaling the pictures using a digital pen. Furthermore, we implement the system and evaluate its technical features. In this paper, we describe the details of the design and implementations of the device, along with applications, technical evaluations, and future prospects.
