This research investigates and seeks to mitigate the undesirable effects of biodynamic feedthrough in backhoe operation. Biodynamic feedthrough occurs when motion of the controlled machine excites motion of the human operator, which is fed back into the control input device. This unwanted input can cause significant performance degradation, which can include limit cycles or even instability. Backhoe user interface designers indicate that this is a problem in many conventional machines, and it has also proved to degrade performance in this testbed. A particular backhoe control system, including the biodynamic feedthrough, is modeled and simulated. Cab vibration control is selected as a means to mitigate the biodynamic feedthrough effect. Two controller based methods are developed based on these models and presented, both of which use the working implement itself to reduce the cab motion. In this case, the backhoe arm has dual functionality, to perform excavation operations and to cancel cab vibration. Results show that significant reductions in cab motion can be obtained with minimal tracking performance degradation, without additional actuators.
