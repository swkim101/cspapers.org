This paper presents an experimental system for assembly in space. A weightless and frictionless environment is approximated using an air-hockey table where robots and structural components can float on the surface. The robots use fan propulsion to dock with components and assemble them together to make 2D structures. This system is designed to implement three key technologies for space self-assembly: 1) intelligent components with universal connectors, 2) a set of self-reconfigurable robots that fetch and assemble components, and 3) a distributed method for controlling the robotic-assembly process. An overview of the system's design and experimental results is presented.
