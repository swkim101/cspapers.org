Information Extraction (IE) often involves some amount of partial syntactic processing. This is clear in cases of interesting high-level IE tasks, such as finding information about who did what to whom (when, where, how and why), but it is also true in case of simpler IE tasks, such as finding company names in texts. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of Slavonic phenomena which pose particular problems for IE and partial parsing, and some phenomena which seem easier to treat in Slavonic than in Germanic or Romance; I also mention various tools which have been used for the partial processing of Slavonic.
