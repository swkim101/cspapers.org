Authenticating mobile computing users can require a significant amount of processing and communications resources-particularly when protocols based on public key encryption are invoked. These resource requirements can result in unacceptable response times for the user. In this paper, we analyze adaptations of the public key-enabled Kerberos network authentication protocol to a mobile platform by measuring the service time of a "skeleton" implementation and constructing a closed queuing network model. Our adaptation of Kerberos introduces a proxy server between the client and the server to mitigate potential performance deficiencies and add functional benefits. Our analysis indicates that assistance from the proxy makes public key Kerberos a viable authentication protocol from a performance perspective. However, as wireless network speeds increase from current 2G levels to the 3G targets, the proxy can become a response time liability. The proxy's role in the protocol, while warranted in current applications, will have to be re-modeled and re-considered as both wireless transmission speeds and proxy processing speeds increase.
