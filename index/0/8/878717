Time series motifs are approximately repeated patterns foundwithin the data. Such motifs have utility for many data mining algorithms, including rule-discovery,novelty-detection, summarization and clustering. Since the formalization of the problem and the introduction of efficient linear time algorithms, motif discovery has been successfully applied tomany domains, including medicine, motion capture, robotics and meteorology.
 In this work we show that most previous applications of time series motifs have been severely limited by the definition's brittleness to even slight changes of uniform scaling, the speed at which the patterns develop. We introduce a new algorithm that allows discovery of time series motifs with invariance to uniform scaling, and show that it produces objectively superior results in several important domains. Apart from being more general than all other motifdiscovery algorithms, a further contribution of our work isthat it is simpler than previous approaches, in particular we have drastically reduced the number of parameters that need to be specified.
