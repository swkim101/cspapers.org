This paper describes a new model for human visual classification that enables the recovery of image features that explain human subjects' performance on different visual classification tasks. Unlike previous methods, this algorithm does not model their performance with a single linear classifier operating on raw image pixels. Instead, it represents classification as the combination of multiple feature detectors. This approach extracts more information about human visual classification than previous methods and provides a foundation for further exploration.
