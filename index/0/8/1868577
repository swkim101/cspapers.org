We present PaDIS Emulator, a fully automated platform to evaluate CDN-ISP collaboration for better content delivery, traffic engineering, and cost reduction. The PaDIS Emulator enables researchers as well as CDN and ISP operators to evaluate the benefits of collaboration using their own operational networks, configuration, and cost functions.
 The PaDIS Emulator consists of three components: the network emulation, the collaboration mechanism, and the performance monitor. These layers provide scalable emulation of the interaction between an ISP or a number of ISPs with multiple CDNs and vice versa. PaDIS Emulator design is flexible in order to implement a wide range of collaboration mechanisms on virtualized or real hardware, and evaluate them before introduction to operational networks.
