In this seminal paper on probabilistic Turing machines, Gill asked whether the class PP is closed under intersection and union. We give a positive answer to this question. We also show that PP is closed under a variety of polynomial-time truth-table reductions. Consequences in complexity theory include the definite collapse and (assuming P ? PP) separation of certain query hierarchies over PP. Similar techniques allow us to combine several threshold gates into a single threshold gate. Consequences in the study of circuits include the simulation of circuits with a small number of threshold gates by circuits having only a single threshold gate at the root (perceptrons) and a lower bound on the number of threshold gates that are needed to compute the parity function.
