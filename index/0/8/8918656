This paper presents a new model for controlling information flo w in systems with mutual distrust and decentralized authority. The model allows users to share information with distrusted code (e.g., downloaded applets), yet still control how that code disseminates the shared information to others. The model improves on existing multilevel security models by allowing users to declassify information in a decentralized way, and by improving support for fine-graineddata sharing. The paper also shows how static program analysis can be used to certify proper information flo ws in this model and to avoid most run-time information flo w checks.
