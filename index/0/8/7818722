Ensuring security and privacy within the Grid computing environment is a fundamental and key requirement for users in order to adopt and use secure and trusted Grids. In light of this fact, the majority of grids, nowadays, provide security services by relying on the de facto standard GSI framework which makes use of Public key End Entity Certificates (EEC) and Proxy Certificates as its foundation. But, due to the huge burden in managing, distributing and revoking compromised EEC, Public Key Certificates are becoming an impediment to the wide adoption and use of Grids at scale. Thus, many research efforts stressed how compelling is the adoption of Identity-Based cryptography and Certificateless Public Key Cryptography within the Grid-Computing environment, which could alleviate the burden of using PKI certificates while, still, providing the intended secure, flexible and easy use of the Grid to both non expert users and Grid's administrators.
 In this paper, we propose a new Certificateless Identity-Based Proxy Signature scheme, for the grid environment, in order to enable attribute-based authorization, fine-grained delegation and enhanced delegation chain establishment and validation, all without relying on any kind of PKI Certificates or proxy certificates.
