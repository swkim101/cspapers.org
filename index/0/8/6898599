The enormous computational ability of modern computers has encouraged development of the finite element method of structural analysis. However, preparing the large amount of input data and interpreting the large amount of output data generated by the analysis can be very time consuming and costly. For this reason, the computer programs IDLZ and ØSPL were developed. IDLZ divides a plane surface into triangular elements and generates required input data for the analysis program. ØSPL plots the output data in a form which can be quickly interpreted by the analyst. These two computer aids to input/output are the subject of this paper.
