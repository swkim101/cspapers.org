Studio-based learning (SBL), the centerpiece of architecture and fine arts education for over a century, has become increasingly attractive to computing educators. SBL can be conceptualized as an iterative process of solution refinement that relies heavily on shared physical space and design critiques. This session will explore ways in which CS educators can transition aspects of traditional or face-to-face SBL to an online learning environment. We will discuss the potential for online studios, how they might look and function, and how their effectiveness in promoting student learning might be gauged. As more and more CS courses assume an online presence, we seek to understand both the opportunities and the limitations associated with conducting critical studio work in a digital medium.
