Automated image interpretation is an important task with numerous applications. Until recently, designing such systems required extensive subject matter and computer vision expertise resulting in poor cross-domain portability and expensive maintenance. Recently, a machine-learned system (ADORE) was successfully applied in an aerial image interpretation domain. Subsequently, it was re-trained for another man-made object recognition task. In this paper we propose and implement several extensions of ADORE addressing its primary limitations. These extensions enable the first successful application of this emerging AI technology to a natural image interpretation domain. The resulting system is shown to be robust with respect to noise in the training data, illumination, and camera angle variations as well as competitively adaptive with respect to novel images.
