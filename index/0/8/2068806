It is often difficult for stakeholders with heterogeneous backgrounds to maintain a common understanding of the most important risk and value drivers of a complex software project. Therefore, I propose the concept of a so-called Augmented Interaction Room, i.e. a persistent physical team room whose walls are outfitted with large interactive displays. It provides a dedicated project space for supporting collaborative system design and the communication among members of a software development project. In this paper, I describe the specific challenges regarding visualization and navigation on these large displays and present my approach on how to support stakeholders by automatically identifying inconsistencies, contradictions and potential project risks.
