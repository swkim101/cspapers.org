We introduce the notion of a conditioned-safe ceremony. A “ceremony” is similar to the conventional notion of a protocol, except that a ceremony explicitly includes human participants. Our formulation of a conditioned-safe ceremony draws on several ideas and lessons learned from the human factors and human reliability community: forcing functions, defense in depth, and the use of human tendencies, such as rule-based decision making. We propose design principles for building conditioned-safe ceremonies and apply these principles to develop a registration ceremony for machine authentication based on email. We evaluated our email registrationceremony with auser studyof 200participants. We designed our study to be as ecologically valid as possible: we employed deception, did not use a laboratory environment, and attempted to create an experience of risk. We simulated attacks against the users and found that email registration was significantly more secure than challenge question based registration. We also found evidence that conditioning helped email registration users resist attacks, but contributed towards making challenge question users more vulnerable.
