We release the Simple Paraphrase Database, a subset of of the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) adapted for the task of text simplification. We train a supervised model to associate simplification scores with each phrase pair, producing rankings competitive with state-of-theart lexical simplification models. Our new simplification database contains 4.5 million paraphrase rules, making it the largest available resource for lexical simplification.
