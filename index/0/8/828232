The structure of many languages with "free" word order and r ich morphology l ike Finnish is rather conf igurat ional than l inear . Although non-l inear structures can be represented by l inear formalisms i t is often more natural to study multidimensional arrangement of symbols. Graph grammars are a multidimensional general izat ion of l inear str ing grammars. In graph grammars str ing rewrite rules are generalized into graph rewrite rules. This p a p e r presents a graph grammar formalism and parsing scheme for parsing languages with inherent conf igurat ional f lavor . A small experimental Finnish parsing system has been implemented (Hyv6nen 1983). A SIMPLE GRAPH GRAMMAR FORMALISM WITH A CONTROL FACILITY In applying str ing grammars to parsing natural Finnish several problems arise in representing complex w o r d structures, argeements, "free" word ordering, d iscont inu i ty , and intermediate depencies between morphology, syntax and semantics. A strong, multidimensional formalism that can cope with d i f fe ren t levels of language seems necessary. In th is chapter a graph grammar formalism based on the notions of re la t iona l graph grammars (Raj l ich 1975) and at t r ibuted programmed graph grammars (Bunke 1982) is developed for parsing languages with conf igurat ional structure. Def in i t ion 1.1 ( re la t iona l graph, r-graph) Let ARCS, NODES, and PROPS be f i n i t e sets of symbols. A re la t iona l graph (r-graph) RG is pair RG = (EDGES, NP) consisting of a set of edges EDGES, ARCSxNODESxNODES and a function liP that associates each node in EDGES to a set of labeled property values: tJP: NODESxPROPS -> PVALUES PVALUES is the set of possible node property values. They are represented as sets of symbols or l i s t s . Example: Figure I .1 depicts the morphological r-graph representation of Finnish word "ihmisten" (the humans') and i t s edges as a l i s t . EXT-property expresses the set of symbols the node current ly refers to (extension); CAT t e l l s the syntactico-semantic category of the node.
