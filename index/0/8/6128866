For several years the digital computer has been used to aid in the process of designing industrial pipe systems that will be structurally safe under loads imposed by the thermal expansion of the pipe material. Using these programs an analytical approach may be taken when determining stresses and deflections at points throughout pipe systems of great complexity. These analyses are subject only to the constraints of static loading and elastic behavior of the pipe material. Typically, such an analysis procedure is designed for use in batch-processing systems. Programs that have been adapted for use on interactive systems still retain most of the characteristics of the batch processing programs. These programs fail in one important aspect; they require the input/output data for the program to be a string of alphanumeric and special symbols. Quite apart from this convention, piping flexibility analysis problems are invariably presented in a graphical format. Thus, the engineer with a problem to be solved is faced with the time-consuming and potentially error-laden task of expressing the schematic diagram of the proposed pipe system in the alphanumeric input format of the program.
