In this paper, we describe a randomized Shellsort algorithm. This algorithm is a simple, randomized, data-oblivious version of the Shellsort algorithm that always runs in O(n log n) time and succeeds in sorting any given input permutation with very high probability. Taken together, these properties imply applications in the design of new efficient privacy-preserving computations based on the secure multi-party computation (SMC) paradigm. In addition, by a trivial conversion of this Monte Carlo algorithm to its Las Vegas equivalent, one gets the first version of Shellsort with a running time that is provably O(n log n) with very high probability.
