The Datacomputer is a large-scale specialized computing system dedicated to data storage and data management. It differs from other data management systems in three major respects. First, it has been designed to operate with and take advantage of new tertiary storage devices, such as the IBM 3850 (1) and the Ampex TBM (2). Secondly, it is designed to serve as a data utility in a network of dissimilar, geographically separate computers, such as the Arpanet (3) or Tymnet (4). Third, the Datacomputer is designed to interface with programs running on remote systems, rather than with on-line users. Both datalanguaqe and data are embedded in special protocols for interprocess communication.
