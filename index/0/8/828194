The advent of domain-specific modeling in enterprise systems development has given rise to new tool requirements. Existing tools do not offer sufficient modeling guidance or inconsistency management for the multitude of new metamodels and models. Specifically, there is a need to offer guidance on 1) valid editing operations, 2) ensuring consistency among models, 3) bridging the gap between models and custom code, and 4) managing the evolution of domain-specific languages. Based on two empirical casestudies, we propose a new unirepresentational modeling tool - SmartEMF - which provides guidance and inconsistency management when developing enterprise systems with multipledomain-specific languages.
