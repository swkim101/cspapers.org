This paper presents a proposal of two new modes of collaborative human navigation. Both are used in a situation in which two users depart from different points simultaneously, but they want to reach common goal. One mode of navigation is used in a situation in which both users want to reach the goal independently. The navigation system calculates each route and arrival time for each user. If the two arrival times differ, then the system suggests another route with a dropping point such as a store or park to the user who will reach the goal earlier. The other navigation is used in a situation in which two users want to join somewhere before reaching a common goal. The navigation system suggests not only a juncture point, but also suggests routes from each departure point to the juncture point, and a route from the juncture point to the goal. We developed a prototype system using the city center of Wakayama as a test area. Using it, we evaluated the proposed navigations.
