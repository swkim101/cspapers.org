A central aspect of reducing orientation problems in web navigation concerns the design of adequate navigation aids. Visualization of users' navigation path in form of a temporal-spatial template can function as external memory of users' search history, thereby supporting the user to find previously visited sites, getting an overview of the search process and moreover, provide structure for the complex WorldWideWeb (WWW) environment. This paper presents an application for dynamic 2 and 3 dimensional visualizations of users' navigation paths, called MemoSpace. In an explorative study, users behavior and subjective evaluation of a MemoSpace application was examined.
