New modes of lifelong learning in the workplace require interface designs which support new contexts for learning. We descnie here a workplace learning support system for instmction in User-centered Design [UCD]. The design evolution of this system illustrates how the “why, where, when and with whom” of use affects the “what and how” of the interaction design. The tutorial system includes a multimedia Case Study, a Methods Tour of UCD techniques, and a Test Drive in which users take simulated roles in a UCD project. This paper describes how the content and features were adapted as de target audience evolved from individual learners in a career curricula to collaborative groups within a project team.
