We argue that powerful models for supporting next genera tion database and knowledge base applications can be built by extending semantic data models SDMs in the direction of Object Oriented OO modeling SDMs possess several of the OO features as well as additional useful features e g relationships and the associated constraints which have no counterpart in the OO models We present a conceptual semantic OO data model called Object Relationship OR model OR model captures most of the semantic modeling as well as OO modeling features needed for the new database applications As a second step we lay down the logical foun dations of the OR model and develop a logical language called ORLOG in the spirit of deductive database languages such as Datalog providing a basis for high level OO programming Use of a logical language like Orlog opens up the possibility of applying knowledge representation techniques for seman tic and OO data modeling We illustrate our conceptual and logical models with a substantial design example
