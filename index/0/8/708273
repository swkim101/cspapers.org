Application-level web security refers to vulnerabilities inherent in the code of a web-application itself (irrespective of the technologies in which it is implemented or the security of the web-server/back-end database on which it is built). In the last few months application-level vulnerabilities have been exploited with serious consequences: hackers have tricked e-commerce sites into shipping goods for no charge, user-names and passwords have been harvested and condential information (such as addresses and credit-card numbers) has been leaked.In this paper we investigate new tools and techniques which address the problem of application-level web security. We (i) describe a scalable structuring mechanism facilitating the abstraction of security policies from large web-applications developed in heterogenous multi-platform environments; (ii) present a tool which assists programmers develop secure applications which are resilient to a wide range of common attacks; and (iii) report results and experience arising from our implementation of these techniques.
