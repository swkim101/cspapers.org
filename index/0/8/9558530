This paper describes a Web-based English-Chinese concordance system, Total-Recall, developed to promote translation reuse and encourage authentic and idiomatic use in second language writing. We exploited and structured existing high-quality translations from the bilingual Sinorama Magazine to build the concordance of authentic text and translation. Novel approaches were taken to provide high-precision bilingual alignment on the sentence, phrase and word levels. A browser-based user interface (UI) is also developed for ease of access over the Internet. Users can search for word, phrase or expression in English or Chinese. The Web-based user interface facilitates the recording of the user actions to provide data for further research.
