Traditional enterprise WLAN management systems are hard to extend and require powerful access points (APs). In this paper we introduce and evaluate CloudMAC, an architecture for enterprise WLANs in which MAC frames are generated and processed on virtual APs hosted in a datacenter. The APs only need to forward MAC frames. The APs and the servers are connected via an OpenFlow-enabled network, which allows to control where and how MAC frames are transmitted.
