Outsourcing association rule mining to an outside service provider brings several important benefits to the data owner. These include (i) relief from the high mining cost, (ii) minimization of demands in resources, and (iii) effective centralized mining for multiple distributed owners. On the other hand, security is an issue; the service provider should be prevented from accessing the actual data since (i) the data may be associated with private information, (ii) the frequency analysis is meant to be used solely by the owner. This paper proposes substitution cipher techniques in the encryption of transactional data for outsourcing association rule mining. After identifying the non-trivial threats to a straightforward one-to-one item mapping substitution cipher, we propose a more secure encryption scheme based on a one-to-n item mapping that transforms transactions non-deterministically, yet guarantees correct decryption. We develop an effective and efficient encryption algorithm based on this method. Our algorithm performs a single pass over the database and thus is suitable for applications in which data owners send streams of transactions to the service provider. A comprehensive cryptanalysis study is carried out. The results show that our technique is highly secure with a low data transformation cost.
