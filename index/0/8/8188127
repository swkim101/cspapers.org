An important topic in computer vision is 3D object reconstruction from line drawings. Previous algorithms either deal with simple general objects or are limited to only manifolds (a subset of solids). In this paper, we propose a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of complex general objects, including manifolds, non-manifold solids, and nonsolids. Through developing some 3D object properties, we use the degree of freedom of objects to decompose a complex line drawing into multiple simpler line drawings that represent meaningful building blocks of a complex object. After 3D objects are reconstructed from the decomposed line drawings, they are merged to form a complex object from their touching faces, edges, and vertices. Our experiments show a number of reconstruction examples from both complex line drawings and images with line drawings superimposed. Comparisons are also given to indicate that our algorithm can deal with much more complex line drawings of general objects than previous algorithms.
