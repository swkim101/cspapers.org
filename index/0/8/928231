This paper describes advances in the development of a know ledge-based front-end for the statistics package GLIM 3.77, employing logic programming methods and tools, including sigma-PROLOG and APES. The domain of application - computer-based statistical analysis - requires that a changing knowledge base be handled by the system, GLIMPSE. The developing system is suitable for users with different levels of expertise, including those who wish to act independently of the system' s advice. Two features are incorporated into GLIMPSE that are suitable for other front-ends and expert systems - a facility for suggesting answers to a user who requires guidance; - an evaluator that suspends when information is missing and suggests an action to find the missing information. 
 
Previous and current methods of providing advice are discussed.
