Peer Instruction (PI) is an active learning technique with over 25 years of research supporting its efficacy in Physics Education. More recently, the CS Education community has found that the benefits of PI are true for CS as well, including lower WDF rates, higher exam scores, and improved retention in the CS major. One of the key differences between PI and traditional lecture is the use of a series of multiple choice "clicker questions" in class to challenge the students' conceptual understanding. Students discuss and answer these questions in small groups, then the instructor reviews why each choice was right or wrong with the entire class. The workshop is a practical look at the kinds of clicker questions used in PI. Attendees with see examples of some of our best and worst questions, and also work to design and improve some of their own questions. In addition, we will provide a demonstration of PI, and share our practical experiences in adopting PI in a wide variety of class sizes.
