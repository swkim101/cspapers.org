Robots must have similar mechanical impedance characteristics to humans in order to make safe and efficient contact. This impedance requirement applies not only to the surface but also to the actuation mechanisms. The objective of this research is to develop inherently flexible actuator by realizing backdrivability. A class of hydraulic actuation called electro-hydrostatic actuator was applied to knee joint in humanoid robots to satisfy flexibility and large torque output simultaneously. This paper explains the methodology of performance evaluation of actuators and design concept of joint mechanism. Mathematical model of electro-hydrostatic transmission is also presented. Evaluation of backdrivability, inertia modification control, and compliance control of developed mechanism are performed.
