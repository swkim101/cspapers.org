Application accelerators such as FPGAs hold the promise of delivering significant improvements in performance for a variety of applications. However much work needs to be done to make application accelerators feasible and affordable for a wide range of supercomputing users.Linux Networx is designing its first FPGA-accelerated system designed specifically for high performance multi-paradigm computing. Linux Networx aims to help accelerate adoption of this emerging computing paradigm by offering a powerful platform with open-source tools, at a very competitive price point. The tightly-coupled system design will emphasize a high-bandwidth, low-latency pipe to the host microprocessor, the most powerful reconfigurable device on the market, and an industry-leading local memory system. In keeping with the Linux spirit, the driver, user-space API, and Verilog interfacing IP will all be open-source and transparent.This session will address accelerators and multi-paradigm computing and will outline the work Linux Networx is doing in designing their FPGA-accelerated system
