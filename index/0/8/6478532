We present GoGetIt!, a tool for generating structure-driven crawlers that requires a minimum effort from the users. The tool takes as input a sample page and an entry point to a Web site and generates a structure-driven crawler based on navigation patterns, sequences of patterns for the links a crawler has to follow to reach the pages structurally similar to the sample page. In the experiments we have performed, structure-driven crawlers generated by GoGetIt! were able to collect all pages that match the samples given, including those pages added after their generation.
