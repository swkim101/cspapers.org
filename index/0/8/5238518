This paper reports two studies that measured the effects of different “video skim” techniques on comprehension, navigation, and user satisfaction. Video skims are compact, content-rich abstractions of longer videos, condensations that preserve frame rate while greatly reducing viewing time. Their characteristics depend on the image- and audio-processing techniques used to create them. Results from the initial study helped refine video skims, which were then reassessed in the second experiment. Significant benefits were found for skims built from audio sequences meeting certain criteria.
