Since Fall, 1992, the author has used techniques of collaborative learning in his sections of CS1 at both Grinnell College and The University of Texas at Austin. These experiments have been successful by various measures: drop rates are very low, students perform well on tests, student motivation and enthusiasm are very high, and the class covers about 20% more material during the semester. This paper describes the approach that has evolved through several iterations of this course.
