This paper introduces a new class of self-reconfigurable robot: the variable topology truss (VTT). Related to an existing class of robots, the variable geometry truss (VGT), variable topology trusses have the additional capability to change the topology of the truss through self-reconfiguration. The hardware necessary to achieve this is introduced, and the constraints and capabilities of this new type of robot are analyzed by introducing the concept of a topology neighbor graph. Lastly, the minimal reconfigurable VTTs, which require 18 members, are identified and their achievable topologies are enumerated.
