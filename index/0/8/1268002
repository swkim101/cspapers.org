Previous studies in home energy have taken a service oriented approach to disaggregating direct energy consumption. With a particular focus on media and ICT services in the home, our proposed platform builds upon this work by providing activity oriented data, collected through home network monitoring.This information will be used to build a profile of communication between devices. This includes inter-device communication within the confines of a home environment, and also the use of external resources outside of the home. This provides knowledge of device behaviour and enables profiling of device relationships. Furthermore, monitoring communication to locations outside of the home will enable us to estimate associated indirect energy costs. These are incurred when a user consumes an externally provided service, such as Video-on-Demand.
