Soil contains vast ecosystems that play a key role in the Earth's water and nutrient cycles, but scientists cannot currently collect the high-resolution data required to fully understand them. In this paper, we present Suelo, an embedded networked sensing system designed for soil monitoring. An important challenge for Suelo is that many soil sensors are inherently fragile and often produce invalid or uncalibrated data. Therefore Suelo is an assisted sensing system: it actively requests the help of a human when necessary to validate, calibrate, repair, or replace sensors. This approach allows us to use available sensors without sacrificing data integrity, while minimizing the human resources required. We tested our system in multiple real soil monitoring deployments and demonstrate that, using human assistance, Suelo produced 91% fewer false negatives and false positives than common fault detection solutions on these datasets.
