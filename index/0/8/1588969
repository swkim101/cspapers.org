In the classical consensus problem,each of n processors receives a private input value and produces a decision value which is one of the original input values,with the requirement that all processors decide the same value. A central result in distributed computing is that,in several standard models including the asynchronous shared-memory model,this problem has no determinis- tic solution. The k-set agreement problem is a generalization of the classical consensus proposed by Chaudhuri (Inform. and Comput.,105 (1993),pp. 132-158),where the agreement condition is weak- ened so that the decision values produced may be different,as long as the number of distinct values is at most k .F or n>k â‰¥ 2 it was not known whether this problem is solvable deterministically in the asynchronous shared memory model. In this paper,we resolve this question by showing that for any k<n ,there is no deterministic wait-free protocol for n processors that solves the k-set agreement problem. The proof technique is new: it is based on the development of a topological structure on the set of possible processor schedules of a protocol. This topological structure has a natural interpretation in terms of the knowledge of the processors of the state of the system. This structure reveals a close analogy between the impossibility of wait-free k-set agreement and the Brouwer fixed point theorem for the k-dimensional ball.
