This paper describes an underwater robot navigation strategy in flow. Our aim is to demonstrate that knowing the relative flow speed is advantageous because it permits using more energy efficient and stable control for trajectory following. We use a biomimetic robot that moves in uniform flow using a side-slipping maneuver. Side-slipping permits the robot to move laterally with respect to the incoming flow by exploiting its passive dynamics. The side-slipping maneuver is controlled by adjusting the heading of the robot with respect to the flow. We implement simple PID controllers for controlling the motion of the side-slipping robot laterally and transversely. Also, we compare the performance of the robot in the case where the robot does not know the flow speed. In this latter case the robot's heading towards the waypoint is controlled and the flow effect is considered as a disturbance compensated by the control algorithm. Comparative experiments demonstrate that it is advantageous for a robot to know not just its speed and orientation with respect to the world's frame of reference but also its local flow-relative speed. It permits the robot to follow trajectories more stable and using less energy. In the discussion section we propose possible future directions for implementing the on board flow-relative control.
