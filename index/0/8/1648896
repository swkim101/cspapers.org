We report on a new framework service for design tool encapsulation, based on an information model for design management. The new service uses generated language processors that perform import and export of design files to and from a design management database with the support of nested syntax specifications and extension language scripts. Our prototype design environment is based on the Nelsis CAD Framework and several tools from the Synopsys high-level synthesis and simulation tool suite.
