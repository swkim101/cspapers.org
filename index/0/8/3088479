Practical experiences are necessary to balance the theory discussed in textbooks and in class meetings. Effective practical experiences must have a clear purpose and must motivate students to become involved as active learners. This paper presents some practical experiences for an introductory operating systems course. The experiences employ short programs with unexpected behaviors and open-ended questions. Students use these as starting points to discover more about the concepts involved. The presented experiences provide effective reinforcement of the underlying theory.
