We investigate the logical structure of concepts generated by conjunction and disjunction over a monotonic multiple inheritance network where concept nodes represent linguistic categories and links indicate basic inclusion (ISA) and disjointness (ISNOTA) relations. We model the distinction between primitive and defined concepts as well as between closed-and open-world reasoning. We apply our logical analysis to the sort inheritance and unification system of HPSG and also to classification in systemic choice systems.
