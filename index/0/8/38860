This paper presents a new term extraction approach using relevance between term candidates calculated by a link analysis based method. Different types of relevance are used separately or jointly for term verification. The proposed approach requires no prior domain knowledge and no adaptation for new domains. Consequently, the method can be used in any domain corpus and it is especially useful for resource-limited domains. Evaluations conducted on two different domains for Chinese term extraction show significant improvements over existing techniques and also verify the efficiency and relative domain independent nature of the approach.
