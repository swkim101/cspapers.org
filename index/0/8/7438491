In recent years impressive results have been presented illustrating the potential of quadrotors to solve challenging tasks. Generally, the derivation of the controllers involve complex analytical manipulation of the dynamics and are very specific to the task at hand. In addition, most approaches construct a trajectory and then design a stabilizing controller in a separate step, whereas a fully optimal solution requires finding both simultaneously. In this paper, a generalized approach is presented using an iterative optimal control algorithm. A series of complex tasks are thus solved using the same algorithm without the need for manual manipulation of the system dynamics, heuristic simplifications, or manual trajectory generation. First, aggressive maneuvers are performed by requiring the quadrotor to pass with a slung load through a window not high enough for the load to pass while hanging straight down. Second, go-to-goal tasks with single and double rotor failure are demonstrated. The adaptability and applicability of this unified approach to such diverse tasks with a nonlinear, underactuated, constrained, and in the case of the slung load, hybrid quadrotor systems is thus shown.
