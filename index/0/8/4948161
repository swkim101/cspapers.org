Performing experiments with human-robot interfaces often requires the allocation of expensive and complex hardware and large physical spaces. Those costs constrain development and research to the currently affordable resources, and they retard the testing-and-redevelopment cycle. In order to explore research free from mundane allocation constraints and speed-up our platform development cycle, we have developed a platform for research of multi-human-robot spoken dialog in coherent real and virtual spaces. We describe the system, and speculate on how it will further research in this domain.
