A most challenging direction in the development of operating systems towards the next millennium, is the usage of self-tuning modules, at various levels of the system. Self-tuning can come into play in many aspects of system management: in the broadest sense it implies that computation, as well as storage of data and allocation of resources can be tuned, by monitoring the system behavior throughout its operation.
