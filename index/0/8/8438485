Advanced mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets have become a part of daily lives for digital native students today. The integration of mobile computing with these devices into multiple courses in computer science (CS) curriculum will connect the education to leading-edge information technologies, motivate and engage students in CS learning, fill in the gap with IT industry needs, and help faculties build strong expertise on modern mobile computing. Meanwhile, the hands-on experience with mobile computing will supply the students with a better understanding of the classical CS concepts. In this paper, we propose to develop a cross-curriculum labware based on the Android platform to introduce the knowledge and practice of a wide range of CS subjects with smart phones and tablets.
