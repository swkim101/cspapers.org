In this article we present a novel technique for automated parallel bug-finding based on the sequential analysis tool TACO. TACO is a tool based on SAT-solving for efficient bug-finding in Java code with rich class invariants. It prunes the SAT-solver's search space by introducing precise symmetry-breaking predicates and bounding the relational semantics of Java class fields. The bounds computed by TACO generally include a substantial amount of nondeterminism; its reduction allows us to split the original analysis into disjoint subproblems. We discuss the soundness and completeness of the decomposition. Furthermore, we present experimental results showing that MUCHO-TACO, our tool which implements this technique, yields significant speed-ups over TACO on commodity cluster hardware.
