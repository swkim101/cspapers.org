In this work we present a consistent probabilistic approach to control multiple, but diverse pan-tilt-zoom cameras concertedly observing a scene. There are disparate goals to this control: the cameras are not only to react to objects moving about, arbitrating conflicting interests of target resolution and trajectory accuracy, they are also to anticipate the appearance of new targets.
