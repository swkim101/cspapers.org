This paper presents a "preprocessor" which separates a channel routing problem into two subproblems. One is a specialized channel routing problem where no two nodes of two different nets are of the same y-grid position. The other is a problem of connecting pairs of nodes where each pair of nodes has a path reserved for it. The use of a "preprocessor" in channel routing [5] is justified by the comparison of routing results.
