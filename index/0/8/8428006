Automated planning is the process of automatically selecting actions that achieve a desired outcome. This paper summarises several contributions that improve the efficiency of automated planning via heuristic search. We discuss novel heuristics based on landmarks and a search algorithm for anytime planning. Furthermore, we analyse various search-enhancement techniques and show how the combination of these techniques lead to a planning system that proved highly successful in the 2008 and 2011 International Planning Competitions.
