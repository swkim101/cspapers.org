For several applications, robots and other computer systems must provide route descriptions to humans. These descriptions should be natural and intuitive for the human users. In this paper, we present an algorithm that learns how to provide good route descriptions from a corpus of human-written directions. Using inverse reinforcement learning, our algorithm learns how to select the information for the description depending on the context of the route segment. The algorithm then uses the learned policy to generate directions that imitate the style of the descriptions provided by humans, thus taking into account personal as well as cultural preferences and special requirements of the particular user group providing the learning demonstrations. We evaluate our approach in a user study and show that the directions generated by our policy sound similar to human-given directions and substantially more natural than directions provided by commercial web services.
