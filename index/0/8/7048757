There are many challenging problems for Vietnamese language processing. It will be a long time before these challenges are met. Even some apparently simple problems such as spelling correction are quite difficult and have not been approached systematically yet. In this paper, we will discuss one aspect of this type of work: designing the so-called Vietools to detect and correct spelling of Vietnamese texts by using a spelling database based on TELEX code. Vietools is also extended to serve many purposes in Vietnamese language processing.
