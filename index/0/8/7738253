Smart home research foresees a future where persons afflicted by a type of cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease, could pursue a longer autonomous life at home by being punctually assisted in their everyday activities. Few research teams have begun noticing that not only we need to offer appropriate services at the right time, but also that we need to adapt them to the resident profile. To do so, we must increase the accuracy and the granularity of our knowledge about the current state of environment. In this paper, we propose a new system based on the cheap and non intrusive passive RFID technology for fine grained localization of objects inside a smart home. We do so in regard for better service delivery by providing richer information about the environment.
