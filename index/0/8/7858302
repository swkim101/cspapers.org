Although existing replica allocation protocols perform well in most cases, some challenges still need to be addressed to further improve their performance. The success of such protocols for Ad-hoc Social Networks (ASNETs) depends on the performance of data accessibility and on the easy consistency management of available replica. We contribute to this line of research with replication protocol for maximizing availability of a data. Essentially, we propose ComPAS, a community-partitioning aware replica allocation method. Its goals include integration of social relationship for placing copy of the data in the community to achieve better efficiency and consistency by keeping the replica read cost, relocation cost and traffic as low as possible.
