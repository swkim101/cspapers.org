Uwe Schwiegelshohnt This paper analyzes job scheduling for parallel computers by using theoretical and experimental means. Based on existing architectures we first present a machine and a job model. Then, we propose a simple on-line algorithm employing job preemption without migration and derive theoretical bounds for the performance of the algorithm. The algorithm is experimentally evaluated with trace data from a large computing facility. These experiments show that the algorithm is highly sensitive on parameter selection and that substantial performance improvements over existing (non-preemptive) scheduling methods are possible.
