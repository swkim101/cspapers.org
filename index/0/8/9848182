Phase Change Memory (PCM) suffers from the problem of limited write endurance. This problem is exacerbated because of the high variability in lifetime across PCM cells, resulting in weaker cells failing much earlier than nominal cells. Ensuring long lifetimes under high variability requires that the design can correct a large number of errors for any given memory line. Unfortunately, supporting high levels of error correction for all lines incurs significantly high overhead, often exceeding 10% of overall memory capacity. Such an overhead may be too high for wide-scale adoption of PCM, given that memory market is typically very cost-sensitive. This paper reduces the storage required for error correction by making the key observation that only a few lines require high levels of hard-error correction. Therefore, prior approaches that uniformly allocated large number of error correction entries for all lines are inefficient, as most (> 90%) of these entries remain unused. We propose Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG), an efficient hard-error resilient architecture that allocates error correction entries in proportion to the number of hard-faults in the line. We describe a storage-efficient and low-latency organization for PAYG. Compared to the previously proposed ECP-6 technique, PAYG requires 3X lower storage overhead and yet provides 13% more lifetime, while incurring a latency overhead of < 0.4% for the first five years of system lifetime. We also show that PAYG is more effective than the recent FREE-p proposal.
