The blogosphere - the totality of blog-related Web sites - has become a great source of trend analysis in areas such as product survey, customer relationship, and marketing. Existing approaches are based on simple counts, such as the number of entries or the number of links. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept, coined eigen-trend, to represent the temporal trend in a group of blogs with common interests and propose two new techniques for extracting eigen-trends in blogs. First, we propose a trend analysis technique based on the singular value decomposition. Extracted eigen-trends provide new insights into multiple trends on the same keyword. Second, we propose another trend analysis technique based on a higher-order singular value decomposition. This analyzes the blogosphere as a dynamic graph structure and extracts eigen-trends that reflect the structural changes of the blogosphere over time. Experimental studies based on synthetic data sets and a real blog data set show that our new techniques can reveal a lot of interesting trend information and insights in the blogosphere that are not obtainable from traditional count-based methods.
