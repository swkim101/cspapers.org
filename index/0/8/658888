The authors have investigated a construction methodology for a non-invasive ultrasound theragnostic system, called NIUTS, to track and follow moving body targets, such as tumors / stones located in moving organs (kidneys, livers, etc.), robustly and precisely, so as to compensate for nearly 90 percent of target motions in ultrasound images, while irradiating therapeutic ultrasound to focal lesions. In the present report, we propose a novel servo recovery algorithm for NIUTS. We confirm the effectiveness of the implemented servo recovery algorithm for a real human kidney, which, as far as we know, is the first successful report of semi-autonomous servo recovery systems for lost body targets. This robust servo recovery method could provide an indispensable tool for precise, safe, and efficient treatments of tumors and stones.
