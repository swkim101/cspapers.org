Finite Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRFs) [5] are discriminative models that learn the joint distribution of a class label and a sequence of latent variables conditioned on a given observation sequence, with dependencies among latent variables expressed by an undirected graph. A limitation of the finite HCRFs is that finding the optimal number of hidden states for a given classification problem is not always intuitive, and involves crossâ€“validation, that can be very computationally expensive. This limitation motivated our nonparametric HCRF model that automatically learns the optimal number of hidden states given a specific dataset. This is achieved by using Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDPs) to allow for an infinite number of hidden states for the HCRF. The reader is encouraged to look at [6] for a complete description of Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes [6].
