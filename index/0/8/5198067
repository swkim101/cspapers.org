Increasing complexity and functionality of automotive SoCs (Systems-on-Chip) leads to a growing part of functionality implemented in firmware. Requirements for short-time-to-market and extensive verification due to safety-critical environments requires firmware development and verification to happen concurrent with hardware development, which is challenging in traditional hardware-centric SoC flows. We present in this paper a set of different techniques part of Infineon's ISO 26262 flow for firmware development, which tackle these challenges and enable us to align firmware development to the same time line as the remaining SoC development.
