This system demonstration paper presents IRIS (Informal Response Interactive System), a chat-oriented dialogue system based on the vector space model framework. The system belongs to the class of example-based dialogue systems and builds its chat capabilities on a dual search strategy over a large collection of dialogue samples. Additional strategies allowing for system adaptation and learning implemented over the same vector model space framework are also described and discussed.
