This study presents the survival microinjection into Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) with in vivo observation based on micromanipulation. The microinjections were achieved with micro-gel beads which are enable to encapsulate chemicals for injection. In this study, a fluorescent material was used to evaluate the injection positional precision inside the C. elegans. The fluorescent microbead was picked up at the tip of a micropipette injection tool and injected by a piezo actuated microinjector. The distance between the injected micro-gel bead and closest nerve axon was measured as 20.3 μm and 16.5 μm by in vivo observation of a confocal microscopy. The two types of pipette tools were used to evaluate the success and survival rates of microinjection, and the smaller pipette (pipette A, 0.8 μm in diameter) showed higher rates as 50 % and 67 % respectively.
