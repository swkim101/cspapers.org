This paper presents an algorithm for static termination analysis of active rules in a context of modular design. Several recent works have suggested proving termination by using the concept of triggering graph. We propose here an original approach, based on these works, and that allows to guarantee the termination of a set of rules, conceived by several designers, even when none of the designers knows the set of the active rules. We introduce the notions of private event and of public event, and we refine the notion of triggering graph (by enclosing also events in graphs). We replace then the notion of cycle (which is no more relevant in a context of modular design) by the notion of maximal private path preceding a rule. By means of these tools, we show that it is possible to prove termination of active rules modular sets.
