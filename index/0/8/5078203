We examine the issue of evaluation of model specific parameters in a modified VC-formalism. Two examples are analyzed: the 2-dimensional homogeneous perceptron and the 1-dimensional higher order neuron. Both models are solved theoretically, and their learning curves are compared against true learning curves. It is shown that the formalism has the potential to generate a variety of learning curves, including ones displaying "phase transitions."
