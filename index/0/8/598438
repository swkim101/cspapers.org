Sharing real-time aggregate statistics of private data has given much benefit to the public to perform data mining for understanding important phenomena, such as Influenza outbreaks and traffic congestion. However, releasing time-series data with standard differential privacy mechanism has limited utility due to high correlation between data values. We propose FAST, an adaptive system to release real-time aggregate statistics under differential privacy with improved utility. To minimize overall privacy cost, FAST adaptively samples long time-series according to detected data dynamics. To improve the accuracy of data release per time stamp, filtering is used to predict data values at non-sampling points and to estimate true values from noisy observations at sampling points. Our experiments with three real data sets confirm that FAST improves the accuracy of time-series release and has excellent performance even under very small privacy cost.
