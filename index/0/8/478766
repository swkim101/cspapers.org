The IETF's new protocols for Low-power and Lossy Networks are delegating their several functions to an IP border router that has more resources than other constrained nodes in the network. It makes the complexity of the IP border router higher than other conventional routers. For this reason, a well-designed platform for routers is important for fast development and easy debugging. In this paper, we check the feasibility of Click Modular Router platform to develop the IP border router for LLNs. Then, we present a design and an implementation of the IP border router on top of Click.
