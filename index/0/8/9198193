Since few years, several multimedia applications are proposed on devices that can be mobile (PC, PDA, phone). However, these applications can't give an account of their close environment. The increase of wireless sensors can allow this type of application to give an account of their close environment. This implies an exchange of information between sensors and software components. In this paper, we are interested in design of multimedia flow in this type of sensors. We propose a unique component model that enables collaboration between different components without knowing if there are hardware or software.
