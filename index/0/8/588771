As embedded networks are evolving to open systems, it's becoming possible to create new applications on top of these existing embedded systems. However, developing new applications can be difficult due to the large diversity of protocols that exist today. In this paper, the authors demonstrate how employing the CoAP protocol can enable rapid application development by re-using well-known principles from the Web development world. Furthermore, we also demonstrate how a number of extensions to CoAP help to lower the barrier for developing applications even further.
