In this paper, we propose a joint probabilistic topic model for simultaneously modeling the contents of multi-typed objects of a heterogeneous information network. The intuition behind our model is that different objects of the heterogeneous network share a common set of latent topics so as to adjust the multinomial distributions over topics for different objects collectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for the tasks of topic modeling and object clustering.
