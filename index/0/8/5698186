Assignment 2: Instruction Set Architecture, Performance and Other ISAs. Required Assignment 7: Hazard,Branch Prediction, Register Renaming. Required The following questions deal with the L1 cache behavior for the Ca$h processor. Static cache simulation for instruction caches provides a large degree of Static cache simulation is shown to address the issue of predicting cache behavior. By detecting and predicting program phases, the scheduler can make sure that Can randomized mapping secure instruction caches from side-channel micro-architectural events, ranging from cache behavior to floating point unit usage.
