Synchronicity is a useful abstraction in many sensor network applications. Communication scheduling, coordinated duty cycling, and time synchronization can make use of a synchronicity primitive that achieves a tight alignment of individual nodes' firing phases. In this paper we present the Reachback Firefly Algorithm (RFA), a decentralized synchronicity algorithm implemented on TinyOS-based motes. Our algorithm is based on a mathematical model that describes how fireflies and neurons spontaneously synchronize. Previous work has assumed idealized nodes and not considered realistic effects of sensor network communication, such as message delays and loss. Our algorithm accounts for these effects by allowing nodes to use delayed information from the past to adjust the future firing phase. We present an evaluation of RFA that proceeds on three fronts. First, we prove the convergence of our algorithm in simple cases and predict the effect of parameter choices. Second, we leverage the TinyOS simulator to investigate the effects of varying parameter choice and network topology. Finally, we present results obtained on an indoor sensor network testbed demonstrating that our algorithm can synchronize sensor network devices to within 100 Î¼sec on a real multi-hop topology with links of varying quality.
