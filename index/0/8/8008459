The primary purpose of this research is to explore the impact of perceived time pressure on search behaviors, searcher perceptions of the search system and the search experience. Are there observable behavioral changes when a searcher is time-pressured? To what extent are search behavior differences attributable to objective experimental manipulation versus to the subjective experience of time pressure? An important secondary purpose of this work is to identify appropriate outcome measures that allow for the comparison of session-level search behaviors when time is manipulated.
