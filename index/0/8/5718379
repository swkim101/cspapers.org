Clustering of search results is an important feature in many of today's information retrieval applications. The notion of hit list clustering appears in Web search engines and enterprise search engines as a mechanism that allows users to further explore the coverage of a query. However, there has been little work on exposing temporal attributes for constructing and presentation of clusters. These attributes appear in documents as part of the textual content, e.g., as a date and time token or as a temporal reference in a sentence. In this paper, we outline a model and describe a prototype that shows the main ideas.
