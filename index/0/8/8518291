This paper describes the design, construction, and operation of a closed-loop spherical induction motor (SIM) ball wheel for a balancing mobile robot (ballbot). Following earlier work, this new design has a smaller rotor and higher torques due to the use of six stators in a skewed layout. Actuation and sensing kinematics as well as control methods are presented. In its current implementation, torques of up to 8 Nm are produced by the motor with rise and decay times of 100 ms. Results are presented supporting its potential as a prime mover for mobile robots.
