In order to endow robots with human-like tactile sensory abilities, they must be provided with tactile sensors and intelligent algorithms to select and control useful exploratory movements and interpret data from all available sensors. Current robotic systems do not possess such sensors or algorithms. In this study we integrate multimodal tactile sensing (force, vibration and temperature) from the BioTacÂ® with a Shadow Dexterous Hand and program the robot to make exploratory movements similar to those humans make when identifying objects by their compliance, texture, and thermal properties. Signal processing strategies were developed to provide measures of these perceptual properties. When identifying an object, exploratory movements are intelligently selected using a process we have previously developed called Bayesian exploration [1], whereby exploratory movements that provide the most disambiguation between likely candidates of objects are automatically selected. The exploration algorithm was augmented with reinforcement learning whereby its internal representations of objects evolved according to its cumulative experience with them. This allowed the algorithm to compensate for drift in the performance of the anthropomorphic robot hand and the ambient conditions of testing, improving accuracy while reducing the number of exploratory movements required to identify an object. The robot correctly identified 10 different objects on 99 out of 100 presentations.
