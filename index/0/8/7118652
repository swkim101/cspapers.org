Although HiveQL offers similar features with SQL, it is still difficult to map complex SQL queries into HiveQL and manual translation often leads to poor performance. A tool named QMapper is developed to address this problem by utilizing query rewriting rules and cost-based MapReduce flow evaluation on the basis of column statistics. Evaluation demonstrates that while assuring the correctness, QMapper improves the performance up to 42% in terms of execution time.
