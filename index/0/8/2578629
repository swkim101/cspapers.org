OpenGV is a new C++ library for calibrated realtime 3D geometric vision. It unifies both central and non-central absolute and relative camera pose computation algorithms within a single library. Each problem type comes with minimal and non-minimal closed-form solvers, as well as non-linear iterative optimization and robust sample consensus methods. OpenGV therefore contains an unprecedented level of completeness with regard to calibrated geometric vision algorithms, and it is the first library with a dedicated focus on a unified real-time usage of non-central multi-camera systems, which are increasingly popular in robotics and in the automotive industry. This paper introduces OpenGV's flexible interface and abstraction for multi-camera systems, and outlines the performance of all contained algorithms. It is our hope that the introduction of this open-source platform will motivate people to use it and potentially also include more algorithms, which would further contribute to the general accessibility of geometric vision algorithms, and build a common playground for the fair comparison of different solutions.
