We present the first stage of the discursive annotation of a corpus in Spanish. In contrast with previous annotation projects, we have applied a feature-based description of discourse relations, and we have focussed in the low level organization of discourse. 
 
This first annotation phase has served to settle the annotation framework and to provide empirical support to theoretical claims. Systematic guidelines have been established for the interpretation of relations between discourse units, by tests and interpretation procedures that characterize the presence of the features characterizing discourse relations.
