However, alignment weights for the current target word often decrease to the left and right by linear distance centering on the aligned source position and neglect syntax distance constraints. In this paper, we extend the local attention with syntax-distance constraint, which focuses on syntactically related source words with the predicted target word to learning a more effective context vector for predicting translation. Moreover, we further propose a double context NMT architecture, which consists of a global context vector and a syntax-directed context vector from the global attention, to provide more translation performance for NMT from source representation. The experiments on the large-scale Chinese-to-English and English-to-German translation tasks show that the proposed approach achieves a substantial and significant improvement over the baseline system.
