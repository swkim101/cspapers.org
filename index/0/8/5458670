BGP is unique among IP-routing protocols in that routing is determined using semantically rich routing policies. However, this expressiveness has come with hidden risks. The interaction of locally defined routing policies can lead to unexpected global routing anomalies, which can be very difficult to identify and correct in the decentralized and competitive Internet environment. These risks increase as the complexity of local policies increase, which is precisely the current trend. BGP policy languages have evolved in a rather organic fashion with little effort to avoid policy-interaction problems. We believe that researchers should start to consider how to emphdesign policy languages for path-vector protocols that avoid such risks and yet retain other desirable features. We take a few steps in this direction by identifying the important dimensions of this design space and characterizing some of the inherent design trade-offs. We attempt to do this in a general way that is not constrained by the details of BGP.
