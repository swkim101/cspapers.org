With the advances in smartphone technologies, sustainable mobility has become an active research topic in the field of ubiquitous computing. We present a persuasive mobile application that automatically tracks the transportation modes and CO2 emissions of the trips of the user and utilizes this information to present a set of actionable mobility challenges to the user. A longitudinal pilot experiment with the system showed that subjects perceived the concept of challenges as positive, with constructive findings to inform further development of the application especially related to personalized challenges.
