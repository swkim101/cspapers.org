Epidural anaesthesia is a medical gesture commonly performed by an anaesthesiologist. However, it remains one of the most difficult gestures to master for medical students. Given the lack of sufficiently realistic training devices available for future physicians, we propose a new haptic simulator which reproduces the haptic sensations felt by anaesthesiologists when performing this kind of operation. The originality of this simulator is the coupling of a Geomagic Touch® device with a pneumatic cylinder to reproduce the “Loss of Resistance” phenomenon which helps the physician to control the needle depth. In this paper, we introduce the parametric 3D model of the region of interest and the control laws used jointly. Even though this device could not reproduce the right level of forces required in this type of anaesthesia, an anaesthesiologist involved in the project gave positive feedback about its haptic tissue rendering.
