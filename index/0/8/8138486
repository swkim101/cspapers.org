Beginning with the publication of Curriculum 68, ACM and IEEE-Computer Society have sponsored various efforts to establish international curricular guidelines for undergraduate programs in computing. Work on the next volume, Computer Science 2013 is well underway, with the Ironman draft out shortly before SIGCSE 2013. The Ironman draft includes course and curricular exemplars, which should serve as a rich resource for those trying to meet the curriculum standards. This special session highlights the exemplar section of the Ironman report through a description of its purpose, presentation of several exemplars, and an invitation to the SIGCSE community to participate by submitting exemplars and providing feedback on what they would find useful in this section of the CS 2013 final report.
