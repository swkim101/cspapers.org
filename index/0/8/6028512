We study the problem of deploying a high number of low-cost, low-complexity robots inside a known environment with the objective that at least one robotic platform reaches each of N preassigned goal locations. Our study is inspired by SensorFly, a micro-aerial vehicle successfully used for mobile sensor network applications. SensorFly nodes feature limited on-board sensors, so one has to rely on simple navigation strategies and increase performance through redundance in the team. We introduce a simple, fully scalable deployment algorithm exploiting the limited capabilities offered by the SensorFly platform, and we explore its performance by feeding the simulation system with parameters extracted from the real SensorFly platform.
