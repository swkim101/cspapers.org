This paper deals with the automatic building of personalized hypermedia. We build upon ideas developed for educational hypermedia; the definition of a domain model and the use of overlay user models. Since much work has been done on learning user models and adapting hypermedia based on such models, we tackle the core problem: the automatic definition of a domain model for a static hypermedia.
