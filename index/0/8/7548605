A system has been developed to extract diagnostic information from jet engine carcass vibration data. Support Vector Machines applied to novelty detection provide a measure of how unusual the shape of a vibration signature is, by learning a representation of normality. We describe a novel method for Support Vector Machines of including information from a second class for novelty detection and give results from the application to Jet Engine vibration analysis.
