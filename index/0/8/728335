This paper describes ongoing work on distributional models for word meaning in context. We abandon the usual one-vector-per-word paradigm in favor of an exemplar model that activates only relevant occurrences. On a paraphrasing task, we find that a simple exemplar model outperforms more complex state-of-the-art models.
