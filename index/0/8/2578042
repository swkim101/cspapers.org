Recent litigation and intense regulatory focus on secure retention of electronic records have spurred a rush to introduce Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) storage devices for retaining business records such as electronic mail. However, simply storing records in WORM storage is insuffcient to ensure that the records are trustworthy, i.e., able to provide irrefutable proof and accurate details of past events. Specifically, some form of index is needed for timely access to the records, but unless the index is maintained securely, the records can in effect be hidden or altered, even if stored in WORM storage. In this paper, we systematically analyze the requirements for establishing a trustworthy inverted index to enable keyword-based search queries. We propose a novel scheme for effcient creation of such an index and demonstrate, through extensive simulations and experiments with an enterprise keyword search engine, that the scheme can achieve online update speeds while maintaining good query performance. In addition, we present a secure index structure for multi-keyword queries that supports insert, lookup and range queries in time logarithmic in the number of documents.
