We hypothesized that language modeling retrieval would improve if we reduced the need for document smoothing to provide an inverse document frequency (IDF) like effect. We created inverse collection frequency (ICF) weighted query models as a tool to partially separate the IDF-like role from document smoothing. Compared to maximum likelihood estimated (MLE) queries, the ICF weighted queries achieved a 6.4\% improvement in mean average precision on description queries. The ICF weighted queries performed better with less document smoothing than that required by MLE queries. Language modeling retrieval may benefit from a means to separately incorporate an IDF-like behavior outside of document smoothing.
