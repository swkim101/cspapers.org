While professional programmers report on the advantages of test-first design discipline, typical introductory programming courses do not require that students design comprehensive test suites for their programs. For the past ten years we (and a number of our adopters in a variety of settings) have used our tester library to support novice programmers in adopting test-first design.
 This workshop illustrates hands-on the benefits of test-first pedagogy on a series of typical introductory programming assignments and shows how the focus on testing fosters a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts of object-oriented program design. The workshop prepares the participants to adopt test-first design approach in their introductory (and advanced) Java-based courses.
 The tester library with tutorials, samples, and all downloads is available at: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/javalib/Tester and https://github.com/TesterViera/JavaLibTester/
