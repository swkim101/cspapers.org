Neural network methods have achieved promising results for sentiment classification of text. However, these models only use semantics of texts, while ignoring users who express the sentiment and products which are evaluated, both of which have great influences on interpreting the sentiment of text. In this paper, we address this issue by incorporating userand productlevel information into a neural network approach for document level sentiment classification. Users and products are modeled using vector space models, the representations of which capture important global clues such as individual preferences of users or overall qualities of products. Such global evidence in turn facilitates embedding learning procedure at document level, yielding better text representations. By combining evidence at user-, productand documentlevel in a unified neural framework, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performances on IMDB and Yelp datasets1.
