In this work, we design and evaluate a novel greedy forwarding algorithm using metrics in hyperbolic spaces. Hyperbolic geometry has a natural topological reflection of scale-free networks, and greedy algorithm failed in Euclidean space becomes possible in hyperbolic one. We show that mobile social networks can be successfully embedded in such spaces, and obtains competitive performance in terms of message delivery ratio and cost. Under this result, we thus intuitively reveal the fundamental reason that why the famous BUBBLE Rap achieves the optimal performance.
