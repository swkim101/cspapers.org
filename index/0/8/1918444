In this paper, we show that one benefit of FUG, the ability to state global constraints on choice separately from syntactic rules, is difficult in generation systems based on augmented context free grammars (e.g., Definite Clause Grammars). They require that such constraints be expressed locally as part of syntactic rules and therefore, duplicated in the grammar. Finally, we discuss a reimplementation of FUG that achieves the similar levels of efficiency as Rubinoff's adaptation of MUMBLE, a deterministic language generator.
