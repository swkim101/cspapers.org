In many image classification applications, input feature space is often high-dimensional and dimensionality reduction is necessary to alleviate the curse of dimensionality or to reduce the cost of computation. In this paper, we extract discriminant features for image classification by learning a low-dimensional embedding from finite labeled samples. In the new feature space, intra-class compactness and extra-class separability are achieved simultaneously. Target dimensionality of the embedding is selected by spectral analysis. Our method is designed suitable for data with both uni- and multi-modal class distributions. We also develop its two-dimensional variant which makes use of the matrix representation of images. Experimental results on three real image datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method compared to the state of the art.
