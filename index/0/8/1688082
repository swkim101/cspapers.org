We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization. SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware. While ultra-wideband radio hardware can provide the timing primitives necessary for a simple adaptation of two-way ranging, we show that with the addition of frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve a 53% decrease in median ranging error. Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range estimate, we next develop an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for localization that ameliorates this overhead. We evaluate the performance of this ranging protocol in stationary and fast-moving environments and find that it achieves up to 0.08 m median error and 0.53 m 99th percentile error. As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we next develop a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space. This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference phenomenon. The ultra-wideband PHY uses a different modulation scheme compared to the narrowband PHY used by previous work, thus we first explore the viability and performance of constructive interference with ultra-wideband radios. Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we develop TriPoint, a dedicated "drop-in" ranging module that provides a simple I2C interface. We show that this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to handle other tasks.
