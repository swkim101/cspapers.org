Existing keyword suggestion tools from various search engine companies could automatically suggest keywords related to the advertisers' products or services, counting in simple statistics of the keywords, such as search volume, cost per click (CPC), etc. However, the nature of the generalized Second Price Auction suggests that better understanding the competitors' keyword selection and bidding strategies better helps to win the auction, other than only relying on general search statistics. In this paper, we propose a novel keyword suggestion strategy, called Competitive Analysis, to explore the keyword based competition relationships among advertisers and eventually help advertisers to build campaigns with better performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Competitive Analysis can both help advertisers to promote their product selling and generate more revenue to the search engine companies.
