This paper reports on an active simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework that leverages the Bayes tree data structure for efficient planning. Evaluating information-theoretic objective functions in the context of active SLAM is a very expensive process that requires significant computational overhead. The contributions of this work involve exploiting the structure of the planning problem integrated with SLAM via the Bayes tree graphical model. Specifically, we propose a constrained variable ordering and subtree caching scheme that reduce computational complexity by eliminating redundant computations between candidate actions that are similar. We also propose an active SLAM framework that utilizes these concepts, and demonstrate the benefits of the approach with an underwater robot performing visual SLAM in a hybrid simulation environment.
