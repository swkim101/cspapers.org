The conferences ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) and EMNLP (Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing) rank among the premier venues that track the research developments in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics. In this paper, we present a study on the research papers of approximately two decades from these two NLP conferences. We apply keyphrase extraction and corpus analysis tools to the proceedings from these venues and propose probabilistic and vector-based representations to represent the topics published in a venue for a given year. Next, similarity metrics are studied over pairs of venue representations to capture the progress of the two venues with respect to each other and over time.
