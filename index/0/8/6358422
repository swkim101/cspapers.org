This paper presents a high fidelity force feedback teleoperation control for surgical applications. Advanced control methods, such as flexible joint tracking control and passivity observation, are introduced in the direct force reflecting control architecture. A full state feedback controller of the flexible joint slave robot controls the motor position, velocity, the joint torque, and the torque derivative. The pose of the haptic device and the first three derivatives are observed to generate reference states for the robot control using the robot's inverse dynamics model. Interaction forces of the slave and the environment are measured with a force/torque sensor and directly sent back to the master device. Stability is guaranteed with a passivity observer that monitors the energy in the teleoperation system online and disconnects master and slave if the system operates beyond its stable region. The proposed control architecture is implemented with the sigma.7 haptic device and the MIRO robot. It is experimentally shown, that appropriately considering elasticities with full state reference and control of the slave, increases the dynamic range of the system enabling transparent and stable interaction with hard and soft environments.
