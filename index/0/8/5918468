There has been a paradigm shifting trend towards feature-less methods due to their elegant formulation, accuracy and ever increasing computational power. In this work, we present a direct edge alignment approach for 6-DOF tracking. We argue that photo-consistency based methods are plagued by a much smaller convergence basin and are extremely sensitive to noise, changing illumination and fast motion. We propose to use the Distance Transform in the energy formulation which can significantly extend the influence of the edges for tracking. We address the problem of non-differentiability of our cost function and of the previous methods by use of a sub-gradient method. Through extensive experiments we show that the proposed method gives comparable performance to the previous method under nominal conditions and is able to run at 30 Hz in single threaded mode. In addition, under large motion we demonstrate our method outperforms previous methods using the same runtime configuration for our method.
