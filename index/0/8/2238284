We introduce a new method, combination of random testing and abstract interpretation, for the analysis of programs featuring both probabilistic and non-probabilistic nondeterminism. After introducing "ordinary" testing, we show how to combine testing and abstract interpretation and give formulas linking the precision of the results to the number of iterations. We then discuss complexity and optimization issues and end with some experimental results.
