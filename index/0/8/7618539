Sentiment classification refers to the task of automatically identifying whether a given piece of text expresses positive or negative opinion towards a subject at hand. The proliferation of user-generated web content such as blogs, discussion forums and online review sites has made it possible to perform large-scale mining of public opinion. Sentiment modeling is thus becoming a critical component of market intelligence and social media technologies that aim to tap into the collective wisdom of crowds. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning high-quality sentiment models with minimal manual supervision. We propose a novel approach to learn from lexical prior knowledge in the form of domain-independent sentiment-laden terms, in conjunction with domain-dependent unlabeled data and a few labeled documents. Our model is based on a constrained non-negative tri-factorization of the term-document matrix which can be implemented using simple update rules. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of real-world sentiment prediction tasks.
