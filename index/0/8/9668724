This paper presents the architecture of a context-addressed cellular system for non-numeric information processing, using an inexpensive, large-capacity circulating memory device. The system allows data to be represented in a structure very close to the form as the user perceives it (information structure) and allows the search operations of high level queries to be implemented directly. The information structures currently used in existing information systems are described. Then the architecture of the system as a whole is presented, as well as the implementation of these information structures as basic data types and hardware management of storage allocation and garbage collection.
 The paper intends to demonstrate that distributing intelligence throughout a rotating memory device can decrease the time required for search operations in large data bases. And that the search strategy and storage management functions can be efficiently carried out in hardware, greatly simplifying the software of information systems. Thus, data not only becomes faster but easier to access, verify, insert and delete.
