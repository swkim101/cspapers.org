While saliency in images has been extensively studied in recent years, there is very little work on saliency of point sets. This is despite the fact that point sets and range data are becoming ever more widespread and have myriad applications. In this paper we present an algorithm for detecting the salient points in unorganized 3D point sets. Our algorithm is designed to cope with extremely large sets, which may contain tens of millions of points. Such data is typical of urban scenes, which have recently become commonly available on the web. No previous work has handled such data. For general data sets, we show that our results are competitive with those of saliency detection of surfaces, although we do not have any connectivity information. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm in two applications: producing a set of the most informative viewpoints and suggesting an informative city tour given a city scan.
