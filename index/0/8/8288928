This paper describes a new method of restricting search space for maze routing, to achieve a higher routing completion ratio and shorter machine time. The router is applied iteratively, expanding the width of L-shaped search space restriction from narrow one to wider ones successively. Using this method, machine time was reduced to one-fourth and the routing completion ratio was more than 10% higher in experimental comparison with singly restricted routers of no iteration. This paper also discusses an analysis to help to decide the iteration number and L-shaped path width.
