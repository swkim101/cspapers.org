Algorithms for the derivation and drafting of stonewalls are discussed and illustrated. They are of two basic types. Stone-by-stone algorithms which simulate procedures known to be applied in practice, and joint-by-joint algorithms which pursue techniques aimed at deriving "good" results without simulating known procedures.
