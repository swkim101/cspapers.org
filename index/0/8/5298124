In this paper a humanoid robot named as WABIAN-RIV (WAseda BIpedal humANoid Refined IV) is analyzed in terms of stiffness characteristics. This paper proposes basic models and a formulation in order to deduce the stiffness matrix as a function of the most important stiffness parameters of the WABIAN architecture. The proposed formulation is useful for numerical estimation of stiffness performances.
