Abstract. We conducted a non-invasive method to detect ligament injuries of knee. The detection tool is an electronic stethoscope made by myself. We detect and record the sound around knee-joint to determine the possibility of ligament injury . The subjects’ knee-joint sound was recorded during the passive motion of knee joint. In our study, we increase the sensing positions around the knee joint. Using the mean square method could make the sound signals of stricken ligament more distinct than normal sound signals. Adopting the MFCC as the characteristic value of sound, thus classify sound signals to judge whether the subject’s ligament get hurt and the extent of damage. We conducted experiments and evaluated factors. The results suggested that the proposed KSLDM had accuracy about 89 % of ligament identification. In this study, the KSLDM showed good recognition performance under 46 subjects being detected with the knee sound signal. Keywords: Knee sound signal, Non-invasive, Mel-frequency, Mean-square.
