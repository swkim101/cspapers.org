In design, people often seek examples for inspiration. However, current example-finding practices suffer many drawbacks: templates present designs without a usage context; search engines can only examine the text on a page. This paper introduces exploratory techniques for finding relevant and inspiring design examples. These novel techniques include searching by stylistic similarity to a known example design and searching by stylistic keyword. These interactions are manifest in d.tour, a style-based design exploration tool. d.tour presents a curated database of Web pages as an explorable design gallery. It extracts and analyzes design features of these pages, allowing it to process style-based queries and recommend designs to the user. d.tour's gallery interface decreases the gulfs of execution and evaluation for design example-finding.
