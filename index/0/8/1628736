The I/O bottleneck represents a major problem in architectures hat have been pro-posed to implement hard database operations such as join and projection. It is recognized that solutions to this problem cannot be based on new database machine architectures alone if satisfactory performance goals are to be atteined. A case in point is illustrated by the comparison of cellular/associative and in- stream pipeline based architectures. A metho- dology based on a global order preserving and dynamic partitioning is presented. The relevance of this approach to the solution of the I/O bottleneck problem is demonstrated through the efficient parallel processing of the join and projection operations. Finaly, this methodology is incorporatated into a specific database machine architecture; namely, the RAP.3 database machine. The partitioning strategy has been previously proven to be supe- rior to he other known methods.
