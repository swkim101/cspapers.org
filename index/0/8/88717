Quantum annealing device has shown a great potential in solving discrete problems that are theoretically and empirically hard. Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem, determining if there is an assignment of variables that satisfies a given Boolean function, is the first proven NP-complete problem widely used in various domains. Here, we present a novel mapping of the SAT problem to the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO), and further develop a tool flow embedding the proposed QUBO to the architecture of the commercialized quantum computer D-Wave. By leveraging electronic design automation techniques including synthesis, placement and routing, this is not only the first work providing the detail flow that embeds the QUBO, but also a technique scalable for real world applications and some hard SAT problems with over 6000 variables in QUBO. Based on our results, we discuss the challenges in solving SAT using the current generation of annealing device, and explore the problem solving capability of future quantum annealing computers.
