Scratchpad memory (SPM) has been utilized as prefetch buffer in embedded systems and parallel architectures to hide memory access latency. However, the impact of reuse pattern on SPM prefetching has not been fully investigated. In this paper we quantify the impact of reuse on SPM prefetching efficiency and propose a reuse-aware SPM prefetching (RASP) scheme. The average performance and energy improvements are 15.9% and 22.0% over cache prefetching, 12.9% and 31.2% over prefetch-only SPM management, 18.5% and 10% over DRDU [1] with SPM prefetching support.
