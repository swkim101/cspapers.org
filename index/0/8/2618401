Under heavy and dynamic traffic, the SPF routing algorithm often suffers from wild oscillation and severe congestion, and results in degradation of the network performance. In this paper, we present a new routing algorithm (SPF-EE) which attempts to eliminate the problems associated with the SPF algorithm by providing alternate paths as emergency exits. With the SPF-EE algorithm, traffic is routed along the shortest-paths under normal condition. However, in the presence of congestion and resource failures, the traffic can be dispersed temporarily to alternate paths without route re-computation. Simulation experiments show that the SPF-EE algorithm achieves grater throughput, higher responsiveness, better congestion control and fault tolerance, and substantially improves the performance of routing in a dynamic environment.
