Omega is a description system for knowledge embedding which incorporates some of the attractive modes of expression in natural language such as descriptions, inheritance, quantification, negation, attributions and multiple viewpoints. It combines mechanisms of the predicate calculus, type systems, and pattern matching systems. Description abstraction is a construct which we introduce to extend the expressive power of the system. The logic foundations for the basic constructs of Omega are investigated. Semantic models are provided, an axiomatization is derived and the consistency and completeness of the.
