We present a new treebank of English and French technical forum content which has been annotated for grammatical errors and phrase structure. This double annotation allows us to empirically measure the effect of errors on parsing performance. While it is slightly easier to parse the corrected versions of the forum sentences, the errors are not the main factor in making this kind of text hard to parse.
