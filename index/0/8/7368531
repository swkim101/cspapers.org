In a text retrieval community, many researchers have shown a good quality of searching a current snapshot of the Web. However, only a small number have demonstrated a good quality of searching a long-term archival domain, where documents are preserved for a long time, i.e., ten years or more. In such a domain, a search application is not only applicable for archivists or historians, but also in a context of national library and enterprise search (searching document repositories, emails, etc.). In the rest of this paper, we will explain three problems of searching document archives and propose possible approaches to solve these problems. Our main research question is: How to improve the quality of search in a document archive using temporal information?
