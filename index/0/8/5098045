The MIX mediator system, MIX<italic>m</italic>, is developed as part of the MIX Project at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, and the University of California, San Diego.<supscrpt>1</supscrpt> MIX<italic>m</italic> uses XML as the common model for data exchange. Mediator views are expressed in XMAS (<italic>XML Matching And Structuring Language</italic>), a declarative XML query language. To facilitate user-friendly query formulation and for optimization purposes, MIX<italic>m</italic> employs XML DTDs as a structural description (in effect, a “schema”) of the exchanged data. The novel features of the system include:<list><item>Data exchange and integration solely relies on XML, i.e., instance and schema information is represented by XML documents and XML DTDs, respectively. XML queries are denoted in XMAS, which builds upon ideas of languages like XML-QL, MSL, Yat, and UnQL. Additionally, XMAS features powerful grouping and order constructs for generating new integrated XML “objects” from existing ones.
</item><item>The graphical user interface BBQ (<italic>Blended Browsing and Querying</italic>) is driven by the mediator view DTD and integrates browsing and querying of XML data. Complex queries can be constructed in an intuitive way, resembling QBE. Due to the nested nature of XML data and DTDs, BBQ provides graphical means to specify the nesting and grouping of query results.
</item><item>Query evaluation can be demand-driven, i.e., by the user's navigation into the mediated view.
