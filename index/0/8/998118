This paper sets out to explore whether data about the usage of hashtags on Twitter contains information about their semantics. Towards that end, we perform initial statistical hypothesis tests to quantify the association between usage patterns and semantics of hashtags. To assess the utility of pragmatic features - which describe how a hashtag is used over time - for semantic analysis of hashtags, we conduct various hashtag stream classification experiments and compare their utility with the utility of lexical features. Our results indicate that pragmatic features indeed contain valuable information for classifying hashtags into semantic categories. Although pragmatic features do not outperform lexical features in our experiments, we argue that pragmatic features are important and relevant for settings in which textual information might be sparse or absent (e.g., in social video streams).
