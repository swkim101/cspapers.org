Existing Geographic Information Systems lack many important features such as the ability to model the real world more adequately and facilities for logical deduction and geometric computation. In this paper, we study the structure and behavior of existing Geographic Information Systems, isolate their drawbacks and explore the applicability of object oriented design, logical deduction and hypermedia to developing better and more efficient geographic information systems. In particular, we focus on the concept, design and development of an architecture for the next generation geographic information systems, which will be able to access, synthesize and reason about large volumes of geographic information more efficiently and effectively, without sacrificing functionality, extensibility and consistency. Of significance is the integration of many diverse forms of technological advancements, including object oriented design, expert systems and multi-media systems.
