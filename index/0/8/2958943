Enabling human-robot collaboration raises new challenges in safety-oriented robot design and control. Indices that quantitatively describe human injury due to a human-robot collision are needed to propose suitable pre-collision control strategies. This paper presents a novel model-based injury index built on the concept of dissipated kinetic energy in a potential inelastic impact. This quantity represents the fracture energy lost when a human-robot collision occurs, modeling both clamped and unclamped cases. It depends on the robot reflected mass and velocity in the impact direction. The proposed index is expressed in analytical form suitable to be integrated in a constraint-based pre-collision control strategy. The exploited control architecture allows to perform a given robot task while simultaneously bounding our injury assessment and minimizing the reflected mass in the direction of the impact. Experiments have been performed on a lightweight robot ABB FRIDA to validate the proposed injury index as well as the pre-collision control strategy.
