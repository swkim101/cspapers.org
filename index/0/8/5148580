The Athena Lecturer Award, given by the ACM Committee on Women in Computing (ACM-W), recognizes women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to Computer Science. The first Athena Award was made in 2006, to Deborah Estrin. The SIGIR Executive Committee decided in November 2006 to nominate Karen for the 2007 Athena Award. That nomination was successful, and the good news was communicated to Karen in February 2007, just weeks before her death. The next section is an edited version of the Athena Award nomination text that was prepared in consultation with Karen.
