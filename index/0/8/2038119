The College Board's guidelines for the coming AP CS Principles course are broad enough to allow many different interpretations. In particular, different courses have different levels of technical depth. The "Beauty and Joy of Computing" curriculum, used by two of the initial five pilot sites, aims high, with recursion and higher order functions included in the programming half of the course. This session is for high school or college level instructors considering teaching an AP CS Principles course and interested in using the BJC curriculum, and/or the Snap! (formerly BYOB) visual programming language used in the curriculum. See http://bjc.berkeley.edu for the curriculum and http://snap.berkeley.edu for the language.
