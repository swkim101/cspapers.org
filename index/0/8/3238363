Building a bilingual dictionary for transfer in a machine translation system is conventionally done by hand and is very time-consuming. In order to overcome this bottleneck, we propose a new mechanism for lexical transfer, which is simple and suitable for learning from bilingual corpora. It exploits a vector-space model developed in information retrieval research. We present a preliminary result from our computational experiment.
