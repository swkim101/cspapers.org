We consider the problem of calibrating a highly generic imaging model, that consists of a non-parametric association of a projection ray in 3D to every pixel in an image. Previous calibration approaches for this model do not seem to be directly applicable for cameras with large fields of view and non-central cameras. In this paper, we describe a complete calibration approach that should in principle be able to handle any camera that can be described by the generic imaging model. Initial calibration is performed using multiple-images of overlapping calibration grids simultaneously. This is then improved using pose estimation and bundle adjustment-type algorithms. The approach has been applied on a wide variety of central and non-central cameras including fisheye lens, catadioptric cameras with spherical and hyperbolic mirrors, and multi-camera setups. We also consider the question if non-central models are more appropriate for certain cameras than central models.
