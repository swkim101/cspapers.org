The authors describe a new research framework for applying empirical software engineering methods in industrial practice and accomplishments in using it. The selected target for applying the framework is a governmentally funded software development project involving multiple vendors. This project involved in-process project data measurement in real time, data sharing with industry and academia, data analysis, and feedback to the project members. Today the project is in the system integration process. This paper shows the value of this research framework and describes issues of empirical data sharing between industry and academia which have emerged while using it. This experiment raised two major issues. One is the necessity of a new research framework for project measurement called the "Macro Measurement Tool". The other is effects of the software industry structure on this framework.
