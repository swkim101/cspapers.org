Today, many developers try to create a new scripting language to provide scripting features to their own application domain. We proposed The DeSugar parser that provides a flexible means of extending the user-defined syntax by scripting. The goal of the DeSugar parser is to make it easier for users to adopt the language syntax to their own application domain. This paper presents Konoha, which is fully integrated with the DeSugar parser, and which allows users to extend its own syntax through the DeSugar parser scripting interfaces.
