The Inverse Augmented Data Manipulator (IADM) is a multistage interconnection network based on the Augmented Data Manipulator (ADM) and Feng's data manipulator. It is designed to be used in large-scale parallel/distributed processing systems for communication among processors, memories, and other system devices. Two aspects of IADM network design are discussed: performance and fault tolerance. A single stage look-ahead scheme for predicting blockage is presented to enhance performance. Next, one method of adding some links to the network to enable it to tolerate one link failure is described. Finally, a different method of adding links is shown that both improves performance and allows the network to tolerate two switching element or two link failures. Included is a new routing tag scheme that accommodates the new links.
