This lightning talk describes our current effort to implement and use Discord - a new tool to facilitate group work that an instructor can use to moderate the level of group participation of students. By utilizing Discord's features to their full extent, an instructor can actively moderate the group's interactions, keep track of who is/isn't participating, and even send messages to student groups. Instructors have the ability to create a Discord server, which acts as a virtual classroom, and then use the server to store student accounts, sort students into groups, and enable group chatrooms. Within these chatrooms, the instructor can observe for language, how well teams are keeping on task, and most importantly, level of participation. This tool keeps students accountable for how often they collaborate with the team by using a chat log with timestamps that the instructor can audit. A goal of implementing Discord is to introduce a user-friendly tool that instructors can use to moderate group interactions and hold students accountable for their level of participation within their groups. A second goal of this project is to utilize the ability to programmatically access the communications in an effort to automate content and sentiment analysis to determine team effectiveness.
