This position paper is not based upon direct experience with the design and implementation of a "non-normat ive" n a t u r a l language system, but r a t h e r draws upon our work on cascade [11] architectures for understanding systems in which syntactic, semantic and discourse processes cooperate to determine the "best" interpretation of an utterance in a given discourse context. The RUS and PSI-KLONE systems [I, 2, 3, 4, 5], which embody some of these principles, provide a strong framework for the development of non-normatlve systems as illustrated by the work of Sondhelmer and Welschedel [8, 9, 10]and others.
