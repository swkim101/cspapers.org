With the increasing popularity of portable wireless computers, mechanisms to efficiently transmit information to such clients are of significant interest. The environment under consideration is asymmetric in that the information server has much more bandwidth available, as compared to the clients. It has been proposed that in such systems the server should broadcast the information periodically. A broadcast schedule determines what is broadcast by the server and when. This paper makes the simple, yet useful, observation that the problem of broadcast scheduling is closely related to the problem of fair queueing. Based on this observation, we present a log-time algorithm for scheduling broadcast, based on an existing fair queueing algorithm. This algorithm significantly improves the time-complexity over previously proposed broadcast scheduling algorithms. Also, for environments where different users may be listening to different number of broadcast channels, we present an algorithm to coordinate broadcasts over different channels. Simulation results are presented for proposed algorithms.
