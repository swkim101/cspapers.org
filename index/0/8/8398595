A combined neural network and rule-based approach is suggested as a general framework for pattern recognition. This approach enables unsupervised and supervised learning, respectively, while providing probability estimates for the output classes. The probability maps are utilized for higher level analysis such as a feedback for smoothing over the output label maps and the identification of unknown patterns (pattern "discovery"). The suggested approach is presented and demonstrated in the texture - analysis task. A correct classification rate in the 90 percentile is achieved for both unstructured and structured natural texture mosaics. The advantages of the probabilistic approach to pattern analysis are demonstrated.
