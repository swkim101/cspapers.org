In this paper, we investigate the self-healing problem of mobile robot formation after some robots have been damaged, and present a gradient-based algorithm which enables mobile robots to restore the topology of the formation through local interactions among neighboring robots. Firstly, in order to optimize the repair path in a distributed manner, a gradient generation and diffusion mechanism is proposed to generate a specific gradient distribution in the formation. Then, utilizing several predefined path selection rules, a path selection algorithm is presented to guarantee the optimality of the selected repair path. Furthermore, several optimization indices are presented to quantitatively characterize the performance of self-healing algorithms. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations and the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can restore the topology of the formation with the fewer repair robots and lower energy consumptions.
