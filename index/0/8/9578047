Application performance tuning is a complex process that requires correlating many types of information with source code to locate and analyze performance problems bottle-necks. Existing performance tools don't adequately support this process in one or more dimensions. We describe two performance tools, MHsim and HPCView, that we built to support our own work on data layout and optimizing compilers. Both tools report their results in scope-hierarchy views of the corresponding source code and produce their output as HTML databases that can be analyzed portably and collaboratively using a commodity browser.
