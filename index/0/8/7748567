This paper describes IPEXI, a library of dynamic Pascal examples for use in an introductory Pascal course. Several modules of examples are designed to help students overcome conceptual difficulties. Additionally, the examples should direct students toward a better understanding of the constructs available in Pascal. Finally, visualizing the execution of the examples should give the students a better feel for what goes on inside the computer as a program executes.
