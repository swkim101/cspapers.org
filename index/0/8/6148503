We achieve anO(logn) amortized time bound per operation for the off-line version of the dynamic convex hull problem in the plane. In this problem, a sequence ofninsert,delete, andqueryinstructions are to be processed, where each insert instruction adds a new point to the set, each delete instruction removes an existing point, and each query requests a standard convex hull search. We process the entire sequence in totalO(nlogn) time andO(n) space. Alternatively, we can preprocess a sequence ofninsertions and deletions inO(nlogn) time and space, then answer queries in history inO(logn) time apiece (a query in history means a query comes with a time parametert, and it must be answered with respect to the convex hull present at timet). The same bounds also hold for the off-line maintenance of several related structures, such as the maximal vectors, the intersection of half-planes, and the kernel of a polygon. Achieving anO(logn) per-operation time bound for theon-lineversions of these problems is a longstanding open problem in computational geometry.
