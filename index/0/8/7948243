The problem of creating search dialogs which are consistent with normal user interface dialogs is posed. The ART user interface tool kit is presented. The features of top-down fiitering of interactive events and the modeling of interactor semantics as editing variables are discussed. Two special interactor filters are described which when wrapped around an editing dialog will transform that dialog into one which edits search patterns for the same class of objects.
