The committee approach has been proposed for reducing model uncertainty and improving generalization performance. The advantage of committees depends on (1) the performance of individual members and (2) the correlational structure of errors between members. This paper presents an input grouping technique for designing a heterogeneous committee With this technique, all input variables are first grouped based on their mutual information. Statistically similar variables are assigned to the same group. Each member's input set is then formed by input variables extracted from different groups. Our designed committees have less error correlation between its members, since each member observes different input variable combinations. The individual member's feature sets contain less redundant information, because highly correlated variables will not be combined together. The member feature sets contain almost complete information, since each set contains a feature from each information group. An empirical study for a noisy and nonstationary economic forecasting problem shows that committees constructed by our proposed technique outperform committees formed using several existing techniques.
