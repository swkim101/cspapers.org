Biology has become an increasingly data-driven science. Modern experimental techniques, including automated DNA sequencing, gene expression micro arrays, and X-ray crystallography are producing molecular data at a rate that has made traditional data analysis methods impractical. Computational methods are becoming an increasingly important aspect of the evaluation and analysis of experimental data in molecular biology. Bioinformatics is the term coined for the new field that merges biology and computer science to manage and analyze this data, with the ultimate goal of understanding and modeling living systems [1].
