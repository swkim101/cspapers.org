Swarms consist of large numbers of individual agents that generally maintain no fixed relative positions, which makes describing the behavior of the swarm as a whole difficult. Furthermore, the high number of agents leads to frequent occlusions that prevent observations of the entire swarm. In this paper, we represent the behavior of swarms using velocity fields, yielding a description which is invariant to the number of agents in a swarm, and the position, orientation, and scale of the swarm. The velocity field representation allows the behavior of swarms to be modeled as a Gaussian distribution. We demonstrate that this Gaussian model can be used to reconstruct the behavior of the swarm as a whole from partial observations.
