In this demonstration paper we will present our test application which has been designed for using geosensor network (GSN) nodes with low-rate communication. Our demonstration will show how GSN nodes can be used in low-rate networks based standardized binary encoding communication. The designed geosensor application has been created over the Locawe platform which is a location-aware system platform in CENTRIA Research and Development, Finland.
