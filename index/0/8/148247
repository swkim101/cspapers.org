In teaching a course that includes the analysis of algorithms, songs can be used as teaching examples. Multiple examples can be done at one time, or in one homework set, without the background explanation required to analyze real algorithms. Many components of algorithm analysis can be introduced using an analysis of songs. This is particularly useful at gaining experience extracting summations from "word problems."
