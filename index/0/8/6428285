The ever increasing sizes of on-chip caches and the growing domination of wire delay necessitate significant changes to cache hierarchy design methodologies. Many recent proposals advocate splitting the cache into a large number of banks and employing a network-on-chip (NoC) to allow fast access to nearby banks (referred to as Non-Uniform Cache Architectures--NUCA). Most studies on NUCA organizations have assumed a generic NoC and focused on logical policies for cache block placement, movement, and search. Since wire/router delay and power are major limiting factors in modern processors, this work focuses on interconnect design and its influence on NUCA performance and power. We extend the widely-used CACTI cache modeling tool to take network design parameters into account. With these overheads appropriately accounted for, the optimal cache organization is typically very different from that assumed in prior NUCA studies. To alleviate the interconnect delay bottleneck, we propose novel cache access optimizations that introduce heterogeneity within the inter-bank network. The careful consideration of interconnect choices for a large cache results in a 51% performance improvement over a baseline generic NoC and the introduction of heterogeneity within the network yields an additional 11-15% performance improvement.
