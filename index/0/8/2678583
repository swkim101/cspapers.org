We propose CMSMs, a novel type of generic compositional models for syntactic and semantic aspects of natural language, based on matrix multiplication. We argue for the structural and cognitive plausibility of this model and show that it is able to cover and combine various common compositional NLP approaches ranging from statistical word space models to symbolic grammar formalisms.
