This poster presents the design of single channel full-duplex wireless radios. The design uses a combination of RF and baseband techniques to achieve full-duplexing with minimal effect on link reliability. The poster shows two designs with different RF cancellation techniques, Antenna Cancellation and Signal Inversion Cancellation. It also discusses potential MAC and network gains with full-duplexing. It suggests ways in which a full-duplex system can solve some important problems with existing wireless systems including hidden terminals, loss of throughput due to congestion, and large end-to-end delays.
