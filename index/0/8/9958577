We introduce epistemic quantified boolean logic (EQBL), an extension of propositional epistemic logic with quantification over propositions. We show that EQBL can express relevant properties about agents' knowledge in multi-agent contexts, such as "agent a knows as much as agent b". We analyse the expressiveness of EQBL through a translation into monadic second-order logic, and provide completeness results w.r.t. various classes of Kripke frames. Finally, we prove that model checking EQBL is PSPACE-complete. Thus, the complexity of model checking EQBL is no harder than for (non-modal) quantified boolean logic.
