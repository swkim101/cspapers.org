We address the problem of considering debugging requirements during high level synthesis by providing low-cost hardware support and scheduling and assignment methods for ensuring controllability and observability of the user specified variables. Two key conceptually new design ideas that enable efficient debugging are developed: pipelining of debugging variables for improving their scheduling and assignment freedom and use of I/O buffers for improving resource utilization of I/O pins. The provably optimal bounds for the maximum cardinality of the set of controllable and observable variables for a given design specification are derived. A polynomial time complexity synthesis algorithm for achieving the bounds is developed. The minimization of hardware overhead gives rise to a combinatorial optimization problem which is solved using a non-greedy heuristic algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed Design-for-Debugging approach is demonstrated on several examples.
