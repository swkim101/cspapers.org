The Evolving Stories Project builds database driven story spaces designed to elicit interaction from a participating public. Stories change and grow with each (re)mediation, much like oral tradition, only now the collective memory resides in the database.This project expands a practice, narrated by living memory, known as 'storyliving' to encompass a process of immersive interactive story creation. Unlike stories fixed in text, 'storyliving' constructs history through a multiplicity of memories that make up the stories. The personal is no longer confined to identity politics and history is freed from its role as 'master narrator.' Through remembering what we have forgotten, we are enabled to (re)invent our worlds as we imagine them.
