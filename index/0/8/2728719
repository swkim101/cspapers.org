The aim of my work is to establish a computational framework for commonsense spatial reasoning about dynamic domains. The work accomplished so far consists of theoretical investigation of a framework based on a paradigm of Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories and its implementation. The developed system enables to integrate geometrical and qualitative spatial information, reason about indirect spatial effects and perform non-monotonic reasoning in a context of spatio-temporal contexts. In future it might be applied to a wide range of dynamic domains such as cognitive robotics, computer-aided architecture design, geographic information systems, etc.
