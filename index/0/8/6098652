In order to understand the relationship of office information to office products and to telecommunications, the category of information media must be introduced. Voice, image, text and data information media can be related to one another, to computer and telecommunications technologies and to the needs of different types of workers.
 The purpose of business offices, however, is not usually primarily information, computing or telecommunications, but rather knowledge, products and useful work. The information categories including media, transfer, products and work can be related to one another for a better understanding of office information products and telecommunications and in order to predict their future.
