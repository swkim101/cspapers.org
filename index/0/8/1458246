Malicious PDF files remain a real threat, in practice, to masses of computer users, even after several high-profile security incidents. In spite of a series of a security patches issued by Adobe and other vendors, many users still have vulnerable client software installed on their computers. The expressiveness of the PDF format, furthermore, enables attackers to evade detection with little effort. Apart from traditional antivirus products, which are always a step behind attackers, few methods are known that can be deployed for protection of end-user systems. In this paper, we propose a highly performant static method for detection of malicious PDF documents which, instead of analyzing JavaScript or any other content, makes use of essential differences in the structural properties of malicious and benign PDF files. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a data corpus containing about 660,000 real-world malicious and benign PDF files, both in laboratory conditions and during a 10-week operational deployment with weekly retraining. Additionally, we present the first comparative evaluation of several learning setups with regard to resistance against adversarial evasion and show that our method is reasonably resistant to sophisticated attack scenarios.
