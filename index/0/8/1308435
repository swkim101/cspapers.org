The paper considers possibilities of distributed architecture to improve the reliability of microcomputer systems to realize a fault-tolerant system. By using and extending existing redundancies of hardware, software, and time, a partially meshed ring structure that meets the requirements of a fault-tolerant architecture has been designed. Aspects of hardware implementation, system software structure, operating system requirements, fault diagnosis, and reconfiguration are explained, based on the fault-tolerant architecture basic fault-tolerant systemâ€”BFS.
