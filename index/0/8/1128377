We present the TreeScape system that, unlike any other system known to the authors, enables the reuse of pre-computed aggregate query results for irregular dimension hierarchies, which occur frequently in practice. The system establishes a foundation for obtaining high query processing performance while pre-computing only limited aggregates. The paper shows how this reuse of aggregates is enabled through dimension transformations that occur transparently to the user.
