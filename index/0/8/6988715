Microblogging service has emerged to be a dominant web medium for billions of individuals sharing and spreading instant news and information, therefore monitoring the event evolution on microblog sphere is crucial for providing both better user experience and deeper understanding on real-time events. In this paper we explore the problem of generating storylines from microblogs for user input queries. This problem is challenging due to the sparse, dynamic and social nature of microblogs. Given a query of an ongoing event, we propose to sketch the real-time storyline of the event by a two-level solution. We first propose a language model with dynamic pseudo relevance feedback to obtain relevant tweets, and then generate storylines via graph optimization. Comprehensive experiments on Twitter data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in each level and the overall framework.
