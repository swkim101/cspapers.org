Stereo matching algorithms conventionally match over a range of disparities sufficient to encompass all visible 3D scene points. Human vision however does not do this. It works over a narrow band of disparities - Panumâ€™s fusional band - whose typical range may be as little as 1/20 of the full range of disparities for visible points. Points inside the band are fused visually and the remainder of points are seen as "diplopic" - that is with double vision. The Panum band restriction is important also in machine vision, both with active (pan/tilt) cameras, and with high resolution cameras and digital pan/tilt.
