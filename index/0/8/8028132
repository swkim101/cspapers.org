In this paper we study three basic and key issues related to Web query processing: load balance, broker behavior, and performance by individual index servers. Our study, while preliminary, does reveal interesting tradeoffs: (1) load unbalance at low query arrival rates can be controlled with a simple measure of randomizing the distribution of documents among the index servers, (2) the broker is not a bottleneck, and (3) disk utilization is higher than CPU utilization.
