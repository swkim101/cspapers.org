Chemistry has long presented an interesting problem domain in which basic AI research has been conducted. Work on knowledge-based systems in this domain began in the early 1970â€™s. Two particularly active areas in the early years were reaction prediction and synthesis design. Because there were no really large reaction databases at this time, the amount of knowledge required for high performance knowledge-based systems was greatly underestimated. Nevertheless, success in circumscribed areas of chemistry has served to maintain interest in this research. Over the years it has become clear that, the greatest weakness of these systems is their knowledge base. This is not simply a result of fundamental inadequacies in the kind of knowledge they contain, but also because the body of knowledge they represent is not sufficiently large for the task at hand. In this paper we describe an unsupervised machine learning system, BRANGANE, developed to extract chemical knowledge from reaction databases in terms of graph rewriting rules. This system is based on conceptual clustering and inductive generalization components. Although these methods are not new [1, 2, 3], the iterative alternation of these techniques is new. We show that by carefully selecting domain constraints, these techniques can be used to progressively refine the hypothesized context of a graph rewriting rule using very little domain-specific knowledge IVe have intentionally limited the amount, of domain-specific knowledge used in order to extract generally useful lessons that may be relevant in other domains.
