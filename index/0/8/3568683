Reflection is a way to get quick opinions from users, clients, etc. Analysis of reflection often involves subjective review and interpretations. On the other hand, data analytics provides guidelines to collect and measure as well as analyze and reflect on data. In our case, learning analytics of students' reflections reveals information about learners, their learning experience, and all their related contexts. Eventually, learning analytics aim is to understand and optimize learning and the corresponding environments (in which learning occurs). It plays a critical role in evaluating students performance and making decisions on how to improve students' success and overall retention. In our study, we focus on applying learning analytics to a heterogeneous data set collected in the introductory programming course. This data set integrated self-assessment reflections along with the existing active learning group activities. By integrating self-assessment reflections, large amounts of valuable data can be gathered to facilitate continuous assessment of students' learning. Using activity-based active learning and peer-instruction, the effectiveness of the content interventions targeting students to understand the fundamental concepts of computer programming is also evaluated. For analysis purposes, we applied a time-based learning analytics model called sequence analysis to learn about the pattern of our at-risk students and use the learned model to predict at-risk students based on their reflections as well as performance in the course.
