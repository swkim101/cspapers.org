In this paper, we consider the filter step of the spatial join problem, for the case where neither of the inputs are indexed. We present a new algorithm, Scalable Sweeping-Based Spatial Join (SSSJ), that achieves both efficiency on real-life data and robustness against highly skewed and worst-case data sets. The algorithm combines a method with theoretically optimal bounds on I/O transfers based on the recently proposed distribution-sweeping technique with a highly optimized implementation of internal-memory plane-sweeping. We present experimental results based on an efficient implementation of the SSSJ algorithm, and compare it to the state-ofthe-art Partition-Based Spatial-Merge (PBSM) algorithm of Patel and DeWitt.
