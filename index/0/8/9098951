A control law for the automatic guidance is proposed in this paper as if each obstacle exerts upon the mobile robot a repulsion, which varies inversely with the distance between the robot and the obstacle, and becomes infinite as the robot approaches the obstacle. Stability of the automatic guidance is studied when the mobile robot deviates from the ideal path. The results lead to criteria of selecting control parameters for better guidance.
