The World Wide Web (WWW) has become an indispensable part of the modern life, providing many benefits in diverse ways. For instance, the huge amount of information from the web offers people unprecedented levels of opportunities for education, entertainments, social activities, productivity improvements, and business. The web, however, has also become perilous with many dangers, such as privacy violation and security breaches, and therein exist many villains who would like to turn into victims scrupulous as well as casual users. In this regard, WWW has become almost like Wild Wild West, where wonderful opportunities and great perils co-existed. Tizen (www.tizen.org) is a web-centric open-source, standards-based software platform for smart devices, such as smartphones, smart TVs, IVI (In-Vehicle Infotainment) and other consumer devices like cameras, printers, and more. Tizen is web-centric in that it directly supports web apps - applications (apps) written in HTML5 and Javascript - even outside the web-browsers and provides seamless supports for the web. As such, Tizen not only shares the benefits and perils of the web with other platforms, but also has the additional burden to meet the performance of non-web platforms: platforms that directly support only conventional programming languages. In this talk, we present Tizen's approaches to taming the web to maximize its benefits while minimizing the risks of its perils. We also describe various optimizations of Tizen that enable delivering web-app performance on par with that of non-web platforms.
