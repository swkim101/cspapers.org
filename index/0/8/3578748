Scratch and other blocks languages have introduced millions of young people to coding. However, as students get older they naturally seek new horizons and new programming languages. At the same time, CS educators in higher grades want to explore concepts that go beyond the scope of Scratch. Unfortunately, text-based languages present challenges. Syntax issues, cryptic error messages, and complex programming environments can alienate students and consume valuable classroom time. GP allows exploration of computational ideas in the context of a welcoming, media-rich blocks language.
