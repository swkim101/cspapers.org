A method is proposed for analyzing group behaviors described by the dynamic equations of the individual members guided by a leader. Behaviors described by fuzzy rules were studied to see whether the leader can guide the individual members. The simulation results lead to the following conclusions: (1) Simple rules make it possible for members to form a group. (2) A leader with a fuzzy controller can guide the members or confine the members in a circle. (3) Some members placed far from the group are susceptible to straying. (4) The position of the front of the group is a greater determinant of guidance control than the center of the gravity. (5) Zigzag movements can make the group move slowly, enabling a delayed member to catch up to the group. (6) Parameter changes cause apparent effects on the behaviors of the group.
