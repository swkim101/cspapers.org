The goal of our work is to provide a fast and accurate method to estimate the camera motion from RGB-D images. Our approach registers two consecutive RGB-D frames directly upon each other by minimizing the photometric error. We estimate the camera motion using non-linear minimization in combination with a coarse-to-fine scheme. To allow for noise and outliers in the image data, we propose to use a robust error function that reduces the influence of large residuals. Furthermore, our formulation allows for the inclusion of a motion model which can be based on prior knowledge, temporal filtering, or additional sensors like an IMU. Our method is attractive for robots with limited computational resources as it runs in real-time on a single CPU core and has a small, constant memory footprint. In an extensive set of experiments carried out both on a benchmark dataset and synthetic data, we demonstrate that our approach is more accurate and robust than previous methods.
