We present the ICARUS Coreference Explorer, an interactive tool to browse and search coreference-annotated data. It can display coreference annotations as a tree, as an entity grid, or in a standard textbased display mode, and lets the user switch freely between the different modes. The tool can compare two different annotations on the same document, allowing system developers to evaluate errors in automatic system predictions. It features a flexible search engine, which enables the user to graphically construct search queries over sets of documents annotated with coreference.
