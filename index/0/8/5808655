We analyze the problem of finding the optimal placement of tracked primitives for robust vision-based control of a mobile robot. The analysis evaluates the properties of the Image Jacobian matrix, used for direct generation of the control signals from the error signal in the image, and the accuracy of the underlying sensor system. The analysis is then used to select optimal tracking primitives that ensure good observability and controllability of the mobile system for a variety of sensor system configurations. The theoretical results are validated with our mobile robot for system configurations that use standard video cameras mounted on a pan-tilt head and catadioptric systems.
