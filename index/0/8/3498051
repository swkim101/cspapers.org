Work-integrated learning is a common approach to add practical, real-world work experience to academic settings. Traditional co-op programs in colleges and universities alternate courses with semesters spent as an intern at a relevant workplace. We have designed an academic-industry partnership that takes work-integrated learning further by deliberately aligning workplace experience to the academic curriculum. Our students earn a Bachelor of Computer Science from the university, and are paid employees of the industry partner throughout their degree. While advanced courses and electives are taken on campus as usual, some core computer science classes and practicum courses are delivered with the industry partner so as to integrate them with placements on site. Assessment remains the responsibility of the university. In this report, we describe the partnership from the perspective of the industry partner. We describe our goals, partnership design, and first two iterations of the implementation. We discuss the challenges we have faced with our first cohort, and share suggestions for others looking to create similar programs.
