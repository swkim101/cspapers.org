Object-oriented languages have been taught for some time at universities. The most common approach has been to teach those constructs required for imperative programming fmt and to introduce the notion of classes and objects somewhat later in the course. More recently, many educators have been promoting the notion of teaching about classes and objects first. This helps students to adopt the object-oriented paradigm at an early stage and encourages them to focus on the application structure before beginning coding. Most new textbooks have followed such an approach.
