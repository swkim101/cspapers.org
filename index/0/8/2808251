We demonstrate "Factal"--a system for integrating deep web sources. Factal is based on the recently introduced source selection method "SourceRank"; which is a measure of trust and relevance based on the agreement between the sources. SourceRank selects popular and trustworthy sources from autonomous and open collections like the deep web. This trust and popularity awareness distinguishes Factal from the existing systems like Google Product Search. Factal selects and searches active online databases on multiple domains. The demonstration scenarios include improved trustworthiness, relevance of results, and comparison shopping. We believe that by incorporating effective source selection based on the SourceRank, Factal demonstrates a significant step towards a deep-web-scale integration system.
