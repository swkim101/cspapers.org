A technique for segmenting sounds using processing based on mammalian early auditory processing is presented. The technique is based on features in sound which neuron spike recording suggests are detected in the cochlear nucleus. The sound signal is bandpassed and each signal processed to enhance onsets and offsets. The onset and offset signals are compressed, then clustered both in time and across frequency channels using a network of integrate-and-fire neurons. Onsets and offsets are signalled by spikes, and the timing of these spikes used to segment the sound.
