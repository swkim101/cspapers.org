We present an improved system combination technique, iROVER, Our approach obtains significant improvements over ROVER, and is consistently better across varying numbers of component systems. A classifier is trained on features from the system lattices, and selects the final word hypothesis by learning cues to choose the system that is most likely to be correct at each word location. This approach achieves the best result published to date on the TC-STAR 2006 English speech recognition evaluation set.
