Sentence level evaluation in MT has turned out far more difficult than corpus level evaluation. Existing sentence level metrics employ a limited set of features, most of which are rather sparse at the sentence level, and their intricate models are rarely trained for ranking. This paper presents a simple linear model exploiting 33 relatively dense features, some of which are novel while others are known but seldom used, and train it under the learning-to-rank framework. We evaluate our metric on the standard WMT12 data showing that it outperforms the strong baseline METEOR. We also analyze the contribution of individual features and the choice of training data, language-pair vs. target-language data, providing new insights into this task.
