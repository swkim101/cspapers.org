We propose the first generative models for three types of extra-grammatical word formation phenomena abounding in slang: Blends, Clippings, and Reduplicatives. Adopting a data-driven approach coupled with linguistic knowledge, we propose simple models with state of the art performance on human annotated gold standard datasets. Overall, our models reveal insights into the generative processes of word formation in slang â€“ insights which are increasingly relevant in the context of the rising prevalence of slang and non-standard varieties on the Internet
