There are increasingly visible demands for structured/ unstructured information integration and advanced analytics. However, conventional database technology has not been able to present a robust and practical implementation of a truly integrated architecture for such purposes. After working on several industrial applications (in particular, in the healthcare and life sciences area), we have identified fundamental issues and technical approaches to tackle the issues. In this paper, we propose data representations and algebraic operations for integrating semantic information (e.g., ontologies) into OLAP systems, which allow us to analyze a huge set of textual documents with their underlying semantic information. The performance of the prototype implementation has been evaluated using real world datasets, and the high scalability and flexibility of our approach have been confirmed with respect to the computation time.
