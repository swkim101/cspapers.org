Bricklayer is a freely-available online educational ecosystem designed in accordance with a "low-threshold infinite-ceiling" philosophy. Its purpose is to teach coding to people of all ages and coding backgrounds. A significant portion of the Bricklayer ecosystem has been developed specifically to help novices, especially primary school children, learn how to code. When executed, Bricklayer programs can produce LEGOÂ® artifacts, Minecraft artifacts, and even artifacts suitable for 3D printing. Bricklayer resides in a domain in which there is a strong connection between math, art, and computer science. This workshop is suitable for (1) university instructors and faculty who are interested in freshmen-level programming, (2) CS educators who work with and/or teach K-12 teachers in order to deliver coding-based curricula, (2) K-12 teachers and facilitators interested in exploring options for how they might teach coding - either directly as part of the in-school curriculum, or indirectly as part of an after school program. No background in coding is assumed. The aim of the workshop is to provide participants with a general understanding of what Bricklayer coding entails, how it relates to math, as well as providing a framework and road map for learning how to code in Bricklayer. An example of a 10 week (1 hour/week) primary school curriculum will be provided.
