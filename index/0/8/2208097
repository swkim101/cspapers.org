Recently, several methods have been proposed for optimal delete-free planning. We present an incremental compilation approach that enables these methods to be applied to problems with conditional effects, which none of them support natively. With an h+ solver for problems with conditional effects in hand, we also consider adapting the h++ anytime lower bound function to use the more space-efficient PceC compilation. This avoids the memory limitation of the original h++ caused by its reliance on an exponential-space compilation. It also leads to improvements on some problems where memory is not an issue.
