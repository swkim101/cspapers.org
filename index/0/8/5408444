One of the weak points of the present critics of AI is their lack of an alternative cognitive theory. In the paper the outline of such a theory is sketched, based on (one reading) of Piaget's genetic epistemology. This is used to clarify the ambiguity of the terms 'symbol' and 'representation', thereby making it possible to suggest a reconciliation of the positions of the critics and defenders of the representational theory of the mind.
