Sorting, duplicate suppression and grouping are important operations in relational database management systems. This paper is devoted to the related language features and their implementation in the Advanced Information Management Prototype AIM-P. The query language HDBL is an SQL-like database language supporting the extended NF* data model. The proposed language extensions follow the classical SQL approach for sorting and duplicate elimination by extending the SFW construct with appropriate clauses. For the grouping operation we chose a new syntactical construct because the implicit structure transformation of grouping differs from the sorting and duplicate suppression operations. Finally, the integration into the query evaluation of the AIM prototype is described.
