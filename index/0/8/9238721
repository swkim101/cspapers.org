Register allocation schemes are presented that effectively use many registers in the execution of block-structured languages. Simulation statistics for a machine with many registers and a conventional architecture are compared. The results indicate that the average operand access time and the required memory bandwidth of conventional machines can be significantly reduced. The implications of the register allocation schemes for machine architecture are discussed.
