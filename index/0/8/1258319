Web applications are growing fast in popularity and complexity. One of the major problems faced by web developers is writing JavaScript code that can retrieve Document Object Model (DOM) tree elements, and is consistent among multiple DOM states. We attempt to solve this problem by automatically synthesizing JavaScript code that interacts with the DOM. We present an automated tool called LED, to analyze the DOM elements, and synthesize code to select the DOM elements based on the DOM hierarchy as well as the nature of task that the user wants to perform. LED provides an interactive drag and drop support inside the browser for selecting positive and negative examples of DOM elements. We find that LED supports at least 86% of the locators used in the JavaScript code of deployed web applications, and that the locators synthesized by LED have a recall of 98% and a precision of 63%. LED is fast, taking only 0.23 seconds on average to synthesize a locator.
