In a software development project of any appreciable size, the production of usable, accurate documentation may well consume more effort than the production of the software itself. Several years of experience on many Programmer's Workbench projects have shown that document preparation should not be separated from software development and that the combination of a flexible operating system, a powerful command language, and good text processing facilities permits quick and convenient production of many kinds of documentation which might be otherwise unobtainable, impractical, or very expensive. Our basic approach has been to develop techniques for effective combination of existing UNIX facilities. A number of case histories are given to illustrate the flexibility, convenience, and general usefulness of these techniques.
