A network was trained by back propagation to map locative expressions of the form "noun-preposition-noun" to a semantic representation, as in Cosic and Munro (1988). The network's performance was analyzed over several simulations with training sets in both English and German. Translation of prepositions was attempted by presenting a locative expression to a network trained in one language to generate a semantic representation; the semantic representation was then presented to the network trained in the other language to generate the appropriate preposition.
