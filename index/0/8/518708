We advocate the use of Gaussian Process Dynamical Models (GPDMs) for learning human pose and motion priors for 3D people tracking. A GPDM provides a lowdimensional embedding of human motion data, with a density function that gives higher probability to poses and motions close to the training data. With Bayesian model averaging a GPDM can be learned from relatively small amounts of data, and it generalizes gracefully to motions outside the training set. Here we modify the GPDM to permit learning from motions with significant stylistic variation. The resulting priors are effective for tracking a range of human walking styles, despite weak and noisy image measurements and significant occlusions.
