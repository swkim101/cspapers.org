As digital integrated circuits become more complex, Computer Aided Design (CAD) must support more hierarchical design methods. Top-down design is supported in logic simulators by the inclusion of functional models. The SAndia LOGic Simulator (SALOGS) has functional modelling capability but until now only as FORTRAN subroutines. The new Structural Interface to the SALOGS Language (SISL) allows the design engineer access to the functional modelling capabilities without requiring the associated programming skills. The SISL syntax is described and a sample functional model library is presented.
