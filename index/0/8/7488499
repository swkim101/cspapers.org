Word alignment problem between parallel corpora is based on the similar characteristics of two aligned words in two languages. We investigate linguistic-knowledge-based word similarity measures while other previous works heavily rely on statistical information, and their limits will be discussed. Linguistic knowledge is acquired from linguistic comparison of all layers between two languages, for Chinese and Korean in this paper.
