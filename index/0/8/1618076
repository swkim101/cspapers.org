The generalization ability of a neural network can sometimes be improved dramatically by regularization. To analyze the improvement one needs more refined results than the asymptotic distribution of the weight vector. Here we study the simple case of one-dimensional linear regression under quadratic regularization, i.e., ridge regression. We study the random design, misspecified case, where we derive expansions for the optimal regularization parameter and the ensuing improvement. It is possible to construct examples where it is best to use no regularization.
