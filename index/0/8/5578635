Most previous graph-based parsing models increase decoding complexity when they use high-order features due to exact-inference decoding. In this paper, we present an approach to enriching high-order feature representations for graph-based dependency parsing models using a dependency languagemodel and beam search. The dependency language model is built on a large-amount of additional auto-parsed data that is processed by a baseline parser. Based on the dependency language model, we represent a set of features for the parsing model. Finally, the features are efficiently integrated into the parsing model during decoding using beam search. Our approach has two advantages. Firstly we utilize rich high-order features defined over a view of large scope and additional large raw corpus. Secondly our approach does not increase the decoding complexity. We evaluate the proposed approach on English and Chinese data. The experimental results show that our new parser achieves the best accuracy on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy with the best known systems on the English data.
