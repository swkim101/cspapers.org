We prove three results about colorings of the simplex reminiscent of Sperner's Lemma, with applications in hardness of approximation and fair division. 
 
First, we prove a coloring lemma conjectured by [5]: Let [EQUATION] and [EQUATION]. Then for every Sperner-admissible labeling (l: Vk,q → [k] such that vl(v) > 0 for each v ∈ Vk,q), there are at least (q+k-3k-2) non-monochromatic hyperedges in Ek,q. This implies an optimal Unique-Games hardness of (k − 1 − e)-approximation for the Hypergraph Labeling with Color Lists problem [2]: Given a k-uniform hypergraph H = (V, E) with color lists L(v) ⊆ [k] ∀v ∈ V, find a labeling l(v) ∈ L(v) that minimizes the number of non-monochromatic hyperedges. We also show that a (k − 1)-approximation can be achieved. Second, we show that in contrast to Sperner's Lemma, there is a Sperner-admissible labeling of Vk,q such that every hyperedge in Ek,q contains at most 4 colors. We present an interpretation of this statement in the context of fair division: There is a preference function on Δk,q = [EQUATION] such that for any division of q units of a resource, (x1, x2, . . ., xk) ∈ Δk,q such that [EQUATION] = q − 1, at most 4 players out of k are satisfied. 
 
Third, we prove that there are subdivisions of the simplex with a fractional labeling (analogous to a fractional solution for Min-CSP problems) such that every hyperedge in the subdivision uses only labelings with 1 or 2 colors. This means that a natural LP cannot distinguish instances of Hypergraph Labeling with Color Lists that can be labeled so that every hyperedge uses at most 2 colors, and instances that must have a rainbow hyperedge. We prove that this problem is indeed NP-hard for k = 3.
