The analysls, design and evaluation of the interconnection subsystem for massively parallel arch i~ectures is norm ally carried out using computer simulation tools, requiring great computational costs. This w or-k shows the suitability of the use of formal representation methods, like SPN (Stochastic Petri Nets), for the description of the message routers, focusing on tw a important features. Firstly, the possibility of obtaining network performance indicators using simulation but with a lower computational cost than using conventional techniques. And secondly, making the basic parameters of the network design independent of the router implementation issues, thus simplifying the method of establishing the behavior of new router stnwtures. This approach has been successfully applied to the analysis of both symmetrical torus and asymmetrical mesh interconnection topologies, with cut-through ,flow control, oblivious routing and random traffic. Two different functional router structures have been used in each case: transit buffers located at the inPut [jr at the output router channels.
