Internet traffic is exposed to potential eavesdroppers. Standard encryption mechanisms do not provide sufficient protection: Features such as packet sizes and numbers remain visible, opening the door to so-called side-channel attacks against web traffic. This paper develops a framework for the derivation of formal guarantees against traffic side-channels. We present a model which captures important characteristics of web traffic, and we define measures of security based on quantitative information flow. Leaning on the well-studied properties of these measures, we provide an assembly kit for countermeasures and their security guarantees, and we show that security guarantees are preserved on lower levels of
