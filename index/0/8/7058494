The authors have developed a bed-type non-invasive ultrasound theragnostic system (NIUTS) that compensates for movement by tracking and following the area to be treated by stereo ultrasound imaging while irradiating high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) onto the affected area. In this paper, we propose a novel robust template matching method to track and follow body targets, which include tumors and stones for the NIUTS. The proposed novel robust template matching method could be applied to a motion tracking of the real human kidney based on the ultrasound images, which is the first successful report as far as I know. This robust visual servoing method could be a great tool to treat the tumors and stones precisely and safely.
