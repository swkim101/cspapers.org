Different from normal logic programs, the computational complexities of recognizing elementary loops and proper loops for disjunctive programs are coNP-complete. To address this problem, we introduce weaker versions of both elementary loops and proper loops and provide polynomial time algorithms for identifying them respectively. On the other hand, based on the notion of elementary loops, the class of Head-Elementary-loop-Free (HEF) programs was presented, which can be turned into equivalent normal logic programs by shifting head atoms into bodies. However, the problem of recognizing an HEF program is coNP-complete. Then we present a subclass of HEF programs which generalizes the class of Head-Cycle-Free programs and provide a polynomial time algorithm to identify them. At last, some experiments show that both elementary loops and proper loops could be replaced by their weak versions in practice.
