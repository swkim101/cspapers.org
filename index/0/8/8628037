We have been working on home automation to support eldercare. This is an instance of long term humanautomation interaction in very intimate and personal settings with a potentially difficult user population. We report our design philosophy and some of the lessons learned relative to that philosophy from a six month field test with representatives of this user community. As a separate research thread, we report on the importance of "etiquette" in human-automation interactions in this domain, along with some initial models and findings about how to configure human-automation reminder interactions to support longterm "livability".
