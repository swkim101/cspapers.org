This is a system demo for a set of tools for translating texts between multiple languages in real time with high quality. The translation works on restricted languages, and is based on semantic interlinguas. The underlying model is GF (Grammatical Framework), which is an open-source toolkit for multilingual grammar implementations. The demo will cover up to 20 parallel languages. 
 
Two related sets of tools are presented: grammarian's tools helping to build translators for new domains and languages, and translator's tools helping to translate documents. The grammarian's tools are designed to make it easy to port the technique to new applications. The translator's tools are essential in the restricted language context, enabling the author to remain in the fragments recognized by the system. 
 
The tools that are demonstrated will be applied and developed further in the European project MOLTO (Multilingual On-Line Translation) which has started in March 2010 and runs for three years.
