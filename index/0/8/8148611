In this paper we describe a smart way to apply dynamic wireless sensor networks (WSN) in logistics. Especially in the temperature controlled supply chain (cold chain), perishable goods like fruits and pharmaceuticals greatly benefit from real-time quality monitoring during storage and transport in order to avoid quality degradation and spoilage. In our system, wireless sensor nodes called SmartPoints monitor the environmental conditions and generate alarms when specific events are detected. Additionally, they calculate the remaining shelf life of the perishable goods they travel with. When there is an Internet-connected WSN available during travel, the shelf-life prediction and associated alarms are directly sent to a back-end server. Alternatively they are logged on the SmartPoints and flushed upon arrival, such that the remaining shelf-life and alarms are immediately clear and a full history will be available later. Our dynamic WSN supports a number of protocols that enable support for the dynamic processes in logistic processes. The Ambient middleware supports real-time monitoring and remote maintenance across the Internet via wired and mobile wireless network access technologies. Additionally, the middleware offers easy integration with third-party applications. Ambient Studio utilizes the middleware for remote WSN configuration and monitoring.
