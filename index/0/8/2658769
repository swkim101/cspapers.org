The complexity and high development costs of user interfaces has led to research into the design of User Interface Management Systems (UIMSs). At the heart of a UIMS is a facility for specifying a dialog control component, which processes user actions and coordinates program responses. This paper describes a language called ALGAE, which allows the specification of multi-threaded, event driven dialogs.
