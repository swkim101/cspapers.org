This paper describes the development of “intelligent” tools aimed at improving the retrieval facilities from large relational databases. When a natural language query does not correspond directly to the data contained in the base, a class of inferential processes called “transformations” is applied. The original query is thus automatically converted into one or more “semantically close” ones. “Semantically close” means that the data possibly obtained with the new query will give useful information about the data originally searched for.
