This paper is on Requirements methods and associated tools. It provides general overview of requirement engineering approaches and propose a multi-view approach, and deep comparison on tools and techniques used to manage requirements. The comparison is based on five items, requirement traceability, requirements integration, requirement prioritizing, requirement status, and customer satisfaction. By this comparison it becomes easy to assist the requirement tools and techniques. The paper concentrates on tracing requirement and proposes to develop a model that can be used to handle and manage requirement traceability on large and complex systems.
