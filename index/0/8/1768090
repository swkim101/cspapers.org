We present a general framework for automatically extracting social networks and biographical facts from conversational speech. Our approach relies on fusing the output produced by multiple information extraction modules, including entity recognition and detection, relation detection, and event detection modules. We describe the specific features and algorithmic refinements effective for conversational speech. These cumulatively increase the performance of social network extraction from 0.06 to 0.30 for the development set, and from 0.06 to 0.28 for the test set, as measured by f-measure on the ties within a network. The same framework can be applied to other genres of text â€” we have built an automatic biography generation system for general domain text using the same approach.
