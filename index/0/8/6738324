It is our firm belief that solving problems in the domain of computational linguistics (CL) can provide a set of metaphors or powerful ideas which are of great importance to many fields. We have taught several experimental classes to students from high schools and universities and a major part of our work was centered around problems dealing with language. We have set up an experimental Language Laboratory in which the students can explore existing computer programs, modify them, design new ones and implement them. The goal was that the student should gain a deeper understanding of language itself and that he/she should learn general and transferable problem solving skills.
