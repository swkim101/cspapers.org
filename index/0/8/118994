In this paper a simulation environment for indoor transmissions in the ultra high frequency band is presented. The simulator comprises hardware as well as channel models that were derived from extensive measurement campaigns. In case of hardware modeling, nonlinear memory-polynomial models are used in order to accurately describe the intermodulation between multiple receive signals. The presented channel model is structured into three layers for indoor line of sight, non line of sight as well as outdoor to indoor transmissions. The indoor models utilize a Saleh-Valenzuela approach and a Clarke's model, while the outdoor model makes use of a Hata model.
