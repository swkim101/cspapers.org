The primate brain must solve two important problems in grasping movements. The first problem concerns the recognition of grasped objects: specifically, how does the brain integrate visual and motor information on a grasped object? The second problem concerns hand shape planning: specifically, how does the brain design the hand configuration suited to the shape of the object and the manipulation task? A neural network model that solves these problems has been developed. The operations of the network are divided into a learning phase and an optimization phase. In the learning phase, internal representations, which depend on the grasped objects and the task, are acquired by integrating visual and somatosensory information. In the optimization phase, the most suitable hand shape for grasping an object is determined by using a relaxation computation of the network.
