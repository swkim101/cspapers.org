We present a fast algorithm for non-linear dimension reduction. The algorithm builds a local linear model of the data by merging PCA with clustering based on a new distortion measure. Experiments with speech and image data indicate that the local linear algorithm produces encodings with lower distortion than those built by five layer auto-associative networks. The local linear algorithm is also more than an order of magnitude faster to train.
