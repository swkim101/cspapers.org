In this paper we consider the problem of aligning multiple non-rigid surface mesh sequences into a single temporally consistent representation of the shape and motion. A global alignment graph structure is introduced which uses shape similarity to identify frames for inter-sequence registration. Graph optimisation is performed to minimise the total non-rigid deformation required to register the input sequences into a common structure. The resulting global alignment ensures that all input sequences are resampled with a common mesh structure which preserves the shape and temporal correspondence. Results demonstrate temporally consistent representation of several public databases of mesh sequences for multiple people performing a variety of motions with loose clothing and hair.
