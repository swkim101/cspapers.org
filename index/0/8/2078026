This paper presents a philosophical view of the changing field of design verification. The evolution of simulation and fault simulation are briefly summarized. Current research issues in design verification are discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the future direction simulation will take, along with other techniques destined to compete with simulation for the design verification task.
