In this work we explore some challenges related to analysing one form of the Arabic language called Arabizi . Arabizi, a portmanteau of Araby-Englizi , meaning Arabic-English, is a digital trend in texting Non-Standard Arabic using Latin script. Arabizi users express their nat-ural dialectal Arabic in text without following a uniﬁed orthography. We address the challenge of identifying Arabizi from multi-lingual data in Twitter, a preliminary step for analysing sentiment from Arabizi data. We annotated a corpus of Twitter data streamed across two Arab countries, extracted linguistic features and trained a classiﬁer achieving an average Arabizi identiﬁcation accuracy of 94.5%. We also present the percentage of Arabizi usage on Twitter across both countries providing important insights for researchers in NLP and sociolinguistics.
