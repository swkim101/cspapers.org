Verification of modern day electronic circuits has become the bottleneck for the timely delivery of complex SoC designs. We develop a novel cross-layer hardware/software co-simulation framework that can effectively debug and verify an SoC design. We combine high-level C/C++ software with cycle-accurate SystemC hardware, uniquely identify various types of bugs, and help the hardware designer localize them. Experimental results show that we are able to detect and aid in localization of logic bugs from both C/C++ specifications as well as the high-level synthesis engine itself. Our framework is fully automated, representing an important step forward targeting fast and effective SoC design verification.
