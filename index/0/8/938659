A CNF formula ψ is <i>k</i>-satisfiable if each <i>k</i> clauses of ψ can be satisfied simultaneously. Let π<inf><i>k</i></inf> be the largest real number such that for each <i>k</i>-satisfiable formula with variables <i>x</i><inf><i>i</i></inf>, there are probabilities <i>p</i><inf><i>i</i></inf> with the following property: If each variable <i>x</i><inf><i>i</i></inf> is chosen randomly and independently to be true with the probability <i>p</i><inf><i>i</i></inf>, then each clause of is satisfied with the probability at least π<inf><i>k</i></inf>.We determine the numbers π<inf><i>k</i></inf> and design a linear-time algorithm which given a formula either outputs that ψ is not <i>k</i>-satisfiable or finds probabilities <i>p</i><inf><i>i</i></inf> such that each clause ψ of is satisfied with the probability at least π<inf><i>k</i></inf>. Our approach yields a robust linear-time deterministic algorithm which finds for a <i>k</i>-satisfiable formula a truth assignment satisfying at least the fraction of π<inf><i>k</i></inf> of the clauses.A related parameter is <i>r</i><inf><i>k</i></inf> which is the largest ratio such that for each <i>k</i>-satisfiable CNF formula with <i>m</i> clauses, there is a truth assignment which satisfies at least <i>r</i><inf><i>k</i></inf><i>m</i> clauses. It was known that π<inf><i>k</i></inf> = <i>r</i><inf><i>k</i></inf> for <i>k</i> = 1, 2, 3. We compute the ratio <i>r</i><inf>4</inf> and show π<inf>4</inf> 6 = <i>r</i><inf>4</inf>. We also design a linear-time algorithm which finds a truth assignment satisfying at least the fraction <i>r</i><inf>4</inf> of the clauses for 4-satisfiable formulas.
