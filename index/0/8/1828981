Animals provide inspiration for developing soft machines in bionics, robotics research as well as potential applications. This paper presents an integrated development of locomotive soft robot platforms: starfish-inspired robots with multi-limb bodies actuated by shape memory alloys (SMAs). The designs of these robots were based on the biological specifications of the locomotion and water-vascular systems of regenerating starfish. Multi-limb robot prototypes were fabricated with soft materials and 3D printing technology, satisfying modest movement requirements with SMA spring actuators. Experimental testing of multi-limb robots were conducted in accordance with biological locomotion principles. The robots vividly displayed typical starfish motion models. Animals provide inspiration for developing soft machines in bionics, robotics research as well as potential applications.
