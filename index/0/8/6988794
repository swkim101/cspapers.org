Data transmission from small-scale data loggers such as human activity recognition sensors is an inherent system's design challenge. Interfaces based on USB or Bluetooth still require platform-dependent code on the retrieval computer system, and therefore require a large maintenance effort. In this paper, we present LedTX, a system that is able to transmit wirelessly through LEDs and the camera included in most user's hardware. This system runs completely in modern browsers and presents a uni- directional, platform-independent communication channel. We illustrate this system on the UbiLighter, an instrumented lighter that tracks ones smoking behaviour.
