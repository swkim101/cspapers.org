In this article, we propose a dialogue-based architecture for foreign language learning in the context of an engaging activity (the simulation of French cooking). Our approach consists in rejecting the “classic” linguistic evaluations (such as multiple choice questionnaires) in order to implement a communicative approach to language learning. A Wizard of Oz study reveals this approach is promising. The system is not implemented yet, but its architecture is based on several implemented systems, in particular on a dialogue model we have developed within the framework of other projects concerning Human-Computer Dialogue.
