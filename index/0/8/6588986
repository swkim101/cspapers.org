Pavlov is a Programming By Demonstration (PBD) system that allows animated interfaces to be created without progrmnming. Using a drawing editor and a clock, designers specify the behavior of a target interface by demonstrating stimuli (end-user actions or time) and the (time-stamped) graphical transformations that should be executed in response. This stimulus-response model "allows interaction and animation to be defined in a uniform manner, and it allows for the demonstration of interactive animation, i.e., game-like behaviors in which the end-user (player) controls the speed and direction of object movement.
