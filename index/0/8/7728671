With the emergence of social networks and computational biology, more data are in the forms of multi-labeled graphs, where a vertex has multiple labels. Since most algorithms focus only on single labeled graphs, these algorithms perform inefficiently when applied to multi-labeled graphs. In this paper, we investigate the problem of subgraph indexing and matching in the multi-labeled graphs. The label set on a vertex is transformed into a high dimensional box. The R-tree is employed to store and index these boxes. The vertex matching problem can be transformed into spatial range queries on the high dimensional space. In addition, we study two types of queries: location and existence queries. In this paper, detailed algorithms are provided to process these two types of queries. Real and synthetic data sets are employed to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our subgraph indexing and query processing methods.
