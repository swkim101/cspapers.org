Learning to rank arises in many information retrieval applications, ranging from Web search engine, online advertising to recommendation system. In learning to rank, the performance of a ranking function heavily depends on the number of labeled examples in the training set; on the other hand, obtaining labeled examples for training data is very expensive and time-consuming. This presents a great need for making use of available auxiliary data, i.e., the within-domain unlabeled data and the out-of-domain labeled data. In this paper, we propose a general framework for ranking with auxiliary data, which is applicable to various ranking applications. Under this framework, we derive a generic ranking algorithm to effectively make use of both the within-domain unlabeled data and the out-of-domain labeled data. The proposed algorithm iteratively learns ranking functions for target domain and source domains and enforces their consensus on the unlabeled data in the target domain.
