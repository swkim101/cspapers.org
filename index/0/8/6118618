A moving range query continuously reports the query result (e.g., restaurants) that are within radius $r$ from a moving query point (e.g., moving tourist). To minimize the communication cost with the mobile clients, a service provider that evaluates moving range queries also returns a safe region that bounds the validity of query results. However, an untrustworthy service provider may report incorrect safe regions to mobile clients. In this paper, we present efficient techniques for authenticating the safe regions of moving range queries. We theoretically proved that our methods for authenticating moving range queries can minimize the data sent between the service provider and the mobile clients. Extensive experiments are carried out using both real and synthetic datasets and results show that our methods incur small communication costs and overhead.
