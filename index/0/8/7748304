A model is proposed for the representation of thematically integratable information in semantic memory and a process for searching through this memory. We assume that releted fects about an individual are not directly attached to the individual node, but rather, are indirectly attached via a thematic sub-node. Thematic sub-nodes allow much faster search of memory under certain conditions, but not others. We tested these predictions with human subjects and found support for these notions.
