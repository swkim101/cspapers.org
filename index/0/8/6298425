The paper studies semantics that evaluate arguments in argumentation graphs, where each argu-ment has a basic strength, and may be attacked by other arguments. It starts by deﬁning a set of principles, each of which is a property that a semantics could satisfy. It provides the ﬁrst formal analysis and comparison of existing semantics. Finally, it deﬁnes three novel semantics that satisfy more principles than existing ones.
