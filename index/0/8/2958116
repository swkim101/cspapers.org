In the present paper, we propose a method to unify information maximization and minimization in hidden units. The information maximization and minimization are performed on two different levels: collective and individual level. Thus, two kinds of information: collective and individual information are defined. By maximizing collective information and by minimizing individual information, simple networks can be generated in terms of the number of connections and the number of hidden units. Obtained networks are expected to give better generalization and improved interpretation of internal representations. This method was applied to the inference of the maximum onset principle of an artificial language. In this problem, it was shown that the individual information minimization is not contradictory to the collective information maximization. In addition, experimental results confirmed improved generalization performance, because over-training can significantly be suppressed.
