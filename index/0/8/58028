This paper describes the development and operation experience of NTT's design automation (DA) system for analog/digital switching systems. The DA system is composed of several subsystems, such as logic design, physical design, documentation and manufacturing data conversion programs, organized around the centralized data base management system. By using this system, hardware standardization and products compatibility among different manufacturers have been achieved. The outlook for the future DA technology is also discussed.
