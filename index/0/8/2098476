During the 1980's there was a lot of activity in the area of Statistical Databases, focusing mostly on socio-economic type applications, such as census data, national production and consumption patterns, etc. In the 1990's the area of On-Line-Analytic Processing (OLAP) was introduced for the analysis of transaction based business data, such as retail stores transactions. Both areas deal with the representation and support of data in a multi-dimensional space. Much of the OLAP literature does not refer to the Statistical Database literature, perhaps because the connection between analyzing business data and socioeconomic data is not obvious. Furthermore, there are papers published in one area or the other whose results can be applied in both application areas.
