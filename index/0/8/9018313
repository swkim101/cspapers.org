This paper addresses post-routing capacitance extraction duringperformance-driven layout.We first show how basic driversin process technology (planarization and minimum metal densityrequirements) actually simplify the extraction problem; wedo this by proposing and validating five "foundations" throughdetailed experiments with representative 0.18Â¿m process parametersand a 3-D field solver.We then present a simple yetaccurate 2 1/2-D extraction methodology directly based on thefoundations.This methodology has been productized and isbeing shipped with the Cadence Silicon Ensemble 5.0 product.We conclude that the 2 1/2-D approach has sufficient accuracyfor current and near-term process generations.
