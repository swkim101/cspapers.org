This paper presents a new indexing scheme, the Subspace Coding Method (SCM), that offers high performance similarity retrieval. It is based on an analysis of the two superior access methods proposed so far: the SR-tree and the VAFile. Our experimental test by real data provides that the SR-tree offers better performance. However, as dimensionality increases, the large volume of entries in non-leaf nodes degrades the search performance. Based on the analysis, we introduce the SCM, a new indexing scheme applicable to any tree index employing MBR (Minimum Bounding Rectangle) and/or MBS (Minimum Bounding Sphere). The basic idea of the SCM is the introduction of Virtual Bounding Rectangle (VBR) and Virtual Bounding quasiSphere (VBS), which contain and approximate MBR and MBS, respectively. Unlike the approximation of absolute vector positions used in the VA-File, VBRs and VBSs are relative to the parentâ€™s VBR. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SCM.
