We propose to bridge the gap between Random Field (RF) formulations for joint categorization and segmentation (JCaS), which model local interactions among pixels and superpixels, and Bag of Features categorization algorithms, which use global descriptors. For this purpose, we introduce new higher order potentials that encode the classification cost of a histogram extracted from all the objects in an image that belong to a particular category, where the cost is given as the output of a classifier when applied to the histogram. The potentials efficiently encode the classification costs of several histograms resulting from the different possible segmentations of an image. They can be integrated with existing potentials, hence providing a natural unification of global and local interactions. The potentials' parameters can be treated as parameters of the RF and hence be jointly learnt along with the other parameters of the RF. Experiments show that our framework can be used to improve the performance of existing JCaS algorithms.
