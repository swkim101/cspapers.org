Recent increases in digitization and archiving efforts on news data have led to overwhelming amounts of online information for general users, thus making it difficult for them to retrospect on past events. One dimension along which past events can be effectively organized is time. Motivated by this idea, we introduce EXPOSÃ‰, an exploratory search system that explicitly uses temporal information associated with events to link different kinds of information sources for effective exploration of past events. In this demonstration, we use Wikipedia and news articles as two orthogonal sources. Wikipedia is viewed as an event directory that systematically lists seminal events in a year; news articles are viewed as a source of detailed information on each of these events. To this end, our demo includes several time-aware retrieval approaches that a user can employ for retrieving relevant news articles, as well as a timeline tool for temporal analysis and entity-based facets for filtering results.
