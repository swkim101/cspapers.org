This is a design track overview tutorial that provides a foundation for exploring and applying the DCI (Data, Context and Interaction) paradigm. DCI is a means to supporting full object orientation that restores much of the original object vision that has been lost by class-based design and programming. DCI focuses on objects and their relationships to the roles of human mental models by which end users and programmers reason about them generally. DCI leads to an architecture that extends contemporary object-oriented programming from its data-centric structure to focus more on the business value of system-level operations.
