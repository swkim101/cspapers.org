Colonoscopy is an important procedure for the diagnosis of various pathologies, in particular cancer of the colon and of the rectum. However, colonoscopy is a procedure often painful for the patient and complex for the doctor. So in the biomedical field, a wireless microrobot in pipe that can move smoothly in water or aqueous medium has urgently been demanded. In this paper, we developed a new kind of wireless microrobot with symmetrical spiral structure, which also had symmetrical kinematic characteristics. According to the hydromechanical lubrication theory and Newton viscous law, we build the motion model of the microrobot, which will provide a theoretical basis on designing the optimal structure parameters of the microrobot. Through analysis, simulations and experiments, this paper had evaluated the effect of spiral angle, which could realize forward-backward, upward-downward motion and stopping at any position we need in the pipe. In addition, we obtained the moving speeds of forward-backward and upward-downward motion in the pipe. The experimental results indicated that the maximum moving speed is 36.5 mm/s at 14 Hz in the horizontal direction and 4.6 mm/s at 16Hz in the vertical direction with input currents of 0.7A. Finally, we designed a control panel for this system, which can control the microrobot current motion states intuitively and easily, and make our system more portable and compact. The developed wireless microrobot can move smoothly in water and other liquid medium and is very useful in the industrial.
