Although substantial efforts have been made to parse Chinese, very few have been practically used due to incapability of handling unrestricted texts. This paper realizes a practical system for Chinese parsing by using a hybrid model of phrase structure partial parsing and dependency parsing. This system showed good performance and high robustness in parsing unrestricted texts and has been applied in a successful machine translation product.
