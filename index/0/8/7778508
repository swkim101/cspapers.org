This paper addresses the issue of numerical computation in machine learning domains based on similarity metrics, such as kernel methods, spectral techniques and Gaussian processes. It presents a general solution strategy based on Krylov subspace iteration and fast N-body learning methods. The experiments show significant gains in computation and storage on datasets arising in image segmentation, object detection and dimensionality reduction. The paper also presents theoretical bounds on the stability of these methods.
