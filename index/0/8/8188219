Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) have shown the great strengths in digital signal processing algorithms such as digital filtering and Fourier analysis. This work is about an implementation for a specific computational unit based on the proposed RISC instruction set architecture (ISA) of 32-bit VLIW Fixed-point DSP processor core presented in our previous work. The computational unit is designed to be flexible for 32-bit/16-bit/8-bit data computations. The implementation is described from top-level to gate-level design and then it is verified to function correctly not only in Modelsim software but also on Altera Cyclone II (2C35) FPGA board.
