This research aims to study the grasping torque profile of the helical climbing robot on the cylindrical pole with constant radius. The modular snake robot is formed into a helical shape which can be described by various parameters such as the helical pitch angle, the radius and the pitch distance. The torque in each axis of rotation is affected by the helical pitch angle parameter. Five grasping configurations with different helical pitch angle were tested on the 18 degree of freedoms, 7 modules wheeled snake robot. The experimental result showed that the torque around yaw axis transferred to the pitch axis when the helical pitch angle was increasing. The profile of torque magnitude along the robot's body resulted in parabolic shape due to the unbalanced grasping force of the discrete points of contact between the robot and the pole.
