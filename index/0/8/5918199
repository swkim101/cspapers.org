In this paper, we describe a novel sensor device which recognizes hand shapes using wrist contours. Although hand shapes can express various meanings with small gestures, utilization of hand shapes as an interface is rare in domestic use. That is because a concise recognition method has not been established. To recognize hand shapes anywhere with no stress on the user, we developed a wearable wrist contour sensor device and a recognition system. In the system, features, such as sum of gaps, were extracted from wrist contours. We conducted a classification test of eight hand shapes, and realized approximately 70% classification rate.
