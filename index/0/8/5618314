A computer-based instructional environment for students learning LISP is described. Its design includes a LISP Interpreter with an extended error-handling capability for evaluating functions written by students. Students can ask questions in natural language about LISP in general and concerning specific LISP functions which they have defined. A fuzzy parser interprets the student requests and builds a LISP function which operates on a semantic network to determine its response.
