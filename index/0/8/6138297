The deformable and continuum nature of soft robots promises versatility and adaptability. However, control of modular, multi-limbed soft robots for terrestrial locomotion is challenging due to the complex robot structure, actuator mechanics and robot-environment interaction. Traditionally, soft robot control is performed by modeling kinematics using exact geometric equations and finite element analysis.
