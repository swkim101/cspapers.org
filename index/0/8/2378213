We present CarSafe, the first driver safety application that uses dual cameras on smartphones to detect and alert drivers to dangerous driving conditions. CarSafe fuses events detected from cameras and readings from embedded sensors on the phone -- such as the GPS, accelerometer and gyroscope -- to detect and alert the driver of dangerous driving behavior in and outside of the car. Results from a 12-driver field trial show CarSafe can infer five of the most commonly occurring dangerous driving conditions with an overall precision and recall of 83% and 75%, respectively.
