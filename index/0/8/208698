Even though research on autonomous robots and human-robot interaction accomplished great progress in recent years, and reusable soft- and hardware components are available, many of the reported findings are only hardly reproducible by fellow scientists. Usually, reproducibility is impeded because required information, such as the specification of software versions and their configuration, required data sets, and experiment protocols are not mentioned or referenced in most publications. In order to address these issues, we recently introduced an integrated tool chain and its underlying development process to facilitate reproducibility in robotics. In this contribution we instantiate the complete tool chain in a unique user study in order to assess its applicability and usability. To this end, we chose three different robotic systems from independent institutions and modeled them in our tool chain, including three exemplary experiments. Subsequently, we asked twelve researchers to reproduce one of the formerly unknown systems and the associated experiment. We show that all twelve scientists were able to replicate a formerly unknown robotics experiment using our tool chain.
