The exponentially increasing number of internet of things (IoT) devices and the data generated by these devices introduces the spectrum crisis at the already crowded ISM 2.4 GHz band. To address this issue and enable more flexible and concurrent communications among IoT devices, we propose B2W2, a novel communication framework that enables N-way concurrent communication among WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. Specifically, we demonstrate that it is possible to enable the BLE to WiFi cross-technology communication while supporting the concurrent BLE to BLE and WiFi to WiFi communications. We conducted extensive experiments under different real-world settings and results show that its throughput is more than 85X times higher than the most recently reported cross-technology communication system [22], which only supports one-way communication (i.e., broadcasting) at any specific time.
