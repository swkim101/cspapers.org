We present a variant of the distribution sort approach which makes use of extra storage to sort a list of <italic>n</italic> elements in an average of about (2+@@@@2)<italic>n</italic> &equil; 3.412...<italic>n</italic> probes into a table. An accurate analysis of this technique is made by introducing a transform from a Poisson approximation to the exact (finite) distribution. This analysis also leads to the solution of an interesting parking problem.
