The traffic volume between origin/destination (OD) pairs in a network, known as traffic matrix, is essential for efficient network provisioning and traffic engineering. Existing approaches of estimating the traffic matrix, based on statistical inference and/or packet sampling, usually cannot achieve very high estimation accuracy. In this work, we take a brand new approach in attacking this problem. We propose a novel data streaming algorithm that can process traffic stream at very high speed (e.g., 40 Gbps) and produce traffic digests that are orders of magnitude smaller than the traffic stream. By correlating the digests collected at any OD pair using Bayesian statistics, the volume of traffic flowing between the OD pair can be accurately determined. We also establish principles and techniques for optimally combining this streaming method with sampling, when sampling is necessary due to stringent resource constraints. In addition, we propose another data streaming algorithm that estimates flow matrix, a finer-grained characterization than traffic matrix. Flow matrix is concerned with not only the total traffic between an OD pair (traffic matrix), but also how it splits into flows of various sizes. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive synthetic experiments on real Internet traffic, we demonstrate that these two algorithms can produce very accurate estimation of traffic matrix and flow matrix respectively.
