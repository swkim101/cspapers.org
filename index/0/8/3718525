The virtual laboratories enhance learning experiences by providing the student with a supplement to the physical lab. The laboratories allow students to perform exercises as in an actual lab and to gather data for preparing lab reports. To increase studentâ€™s engagement and interest, they are allowed to make errors and take wrong directions, and then backtrack to correctly perform the exercise. The architecture of the system is modular and can be easily extended to implement different laboratories and it supports augmentation by animation effects and realistic rendering of virtual objects. Most of the system components, including all the virtual labs, are implemented as Java Beans. The software framework is lightweight and can be downloaded as an applet in a browser. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used for application and data description; students can save their lab reports in XML and review them later. To demonstrate the potential of the architecture, we have developed several virtual laboratories for cell division, centrifugation, spectrophotometry, and virtual microscopy. We report experience in developing and deploying such virtual laboratories as well as their actual usage in the Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience at Rutgers University.
