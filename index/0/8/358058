The BooksOnline Workshop series aims to foster the discussion and exchange of research ideas towards addressing challenges and exploring opportunities around large collections of digital books and complementary media. The fourth workshop in the series, BooksOnline'11 pays special attention to the role of social media and the phenomena of crowdsourcing in the context of online books, which is expected to be key in defining new user experiences in digital libraries and on the Web. The workshop boasts a high quality program, including keynote addresses by Ville Miettinnen, CEO of Microtask and Adam Farquhar, Head of Digital Library Technology at The British Library. From the accepted papers two main themes became salient: 1) Information retrieval and information extraction methods focused on enhancing digital libraries, and 2) Studies and analyses of reading experience and behaviour. This paper provides an overview of the workshop and the accepted contributions.
