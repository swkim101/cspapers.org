During the past several years, data size has increased explosively. This data explosion tendency has impacted various fields ranging from biomedical engineering, business consulting to social media and mobile application. Big Data is a two sided sword. While it provides incredibly treasured insights in commercial scope and innovative discovery in the scientific field, Big Data also has many challenges, such as complication in data storage, data processing, data analysis and data visualization. Among all these challenges, keyword searching over a large volume of data prevails as one of the four tasks defined by Bizer et al. at the year of 2012. Keyword searching refers to retrieving the objects relevant to the entities of concern using scientific computational methods. Consequently, efficiently solving the problem of keyword searching can contribute as a foundation to diverse Big Data applications.
