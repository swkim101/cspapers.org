With the start of current century, Business Intelligence (BI) has become an important and emerging tool, technique and technology in business world. Organizations of all types across the globe are adopting BI for promoting business and getting advantage over competitors. Business Intelligence is the processes, technologies, and tools that help organizations to change the data into information, information into knowledge and knowledge into plans that guide for better and effective decision making. A Business Intelligence Competency Center (BICC) is an eternal legal unit with an organization, which encompasses dedicated members from both IT and business divisions. The major reasons behind establishment of BICC are to ensure the adoption of BI at different levels of the organization by all stakeholders and to provide a platform to maintain and standardized the overall BI application. Responsibilities of BICC include defining and managing the execution of the organization's BI strategy. Moreover success of BI application within an organization can also be ensured through BICC. In this paper, we have reviewed and analyzed BI implementations having BICC versus BI executions having no concept of BICC. This study can also be used for future works like building Business Intelligence Competency Centers and/or measuring impact of Business Intelligence Competency Centers in success/failure of BI applications.
