We consider the problem of illusory or artefactual structure from the visualisation of high-dimensional structureless data. In particular we examine the role of the distance metric in the use of topographic mappings based on the statistical field of multidimensional scaling. We show that the use of a squared Euclidean metric (i.e. the SSTRESS measure) gives rise to an annular structure when the input data is drawn from a high-dimensional isotropic distribution, and we provide a theoretical justification for this observation.
