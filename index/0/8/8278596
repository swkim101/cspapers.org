In my thesis I propose a data-oriented study on how social power relations between participants manifest in the language and structure of online written dialogs. I propose that there are different types of power relations and they are different in the ways they are expressed and revealed in dialog and across different languages, genres and domains. So far, I have defined four types of power and annotated them in corporate email threads in English and found support that they in fact manifest differently in the threads. Using dialog and language features, I have built a system to predict participants possessing these types of power within email threads. I intend to extend this system to other languages, genres and domains and to improve it's performance using deeper linguistic analysis.
