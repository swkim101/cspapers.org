This paper’s approach to semantic integrity management is that in order to maintain an integrity constraint, some variables of the constraint may be operated on while others may not This defines integrity dependencies between vsiables. Various examples of integrity dependencies and their meanings are discussed. In addition to corresponding to real world practice, integrity dependencies can be used to improve the efficiency of checking constraints. This is achieved by delaying the checking (and maintenance) of data which depends on, but does not affect, the data currently operated on It also gives delayed checking and maintenance a chance to be performed in parallel with applications. Simulation results are presented to support the claim that delayed checking is generally more efficient’
