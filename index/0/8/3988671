We propose dynamic reconfiguration of the radio interface in IoT platforms to support multiple link layers simultaneously. This allows us to tackle the increasing link layer heterogeneity in IoT devices, thus bringing a multitude of benefits: extensible and vender agnostic multihop deployments, rapid integration of the new "things" into an existing network, as well as seamless integration of the IoT with the traditional wireless Internet.
