This poster introduces JRD, a novel device-free localization system which can achieve high accuracy with low cost and little human effort, and is even robust to different scenarios. Unlike the previous Radio Signal Strength (RSS)-based systems which depend on the dense deployment to provide high accuracy, JRD extracts the fine-grained RSS distributions of a single link and presents a voting algorithm based on multi-link to identify the object location accurately while maintaining a low-cost deployment. Furthermore, JRD is flexible to different scenarios by using the transferring technique with less time-consuming and human effort. Experimental results show that JRD can improve the localization accuracy by up to 50% with less cost as compared with the existing RSS approaches.
