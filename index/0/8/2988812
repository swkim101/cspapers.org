An abstract class of games unifying these models are the normal-form games with sequential strategies (NFGSS). We show that all games from this class can be modelled as well-formed imperfect-recall extensive-form games and consequently can be solved by counterfactual regret minimization. We propose an adaptation of the CFR+ algorithm for NFGSS and compare its performance to the standard methods based on linear programming and incremental game generation. We validate our approach on two security-inspired domains. We show that with a negligible loss in precision, CFR+ can compute a Nash equilibrium with five times less computation than its competitors.
