Online brokers are inventing strategies as fast as they move online. Some strategies are being implemented already, such as the Yahoo! model of advertiser-supported brokerage, or the eBay model supported by commissions charged to sellers, but there is no theoretical backing for either of these two models compared to the wide variety of auction theory. The services offered by brokers are also evolving very rapidly. In this paper we first provide an overview of the evolving brokering practices and limitations of existing work. We then investigate in detail the effect of search costs on the performance of the brokerâ€™s optimal strategy for the case of M buyers and N sellers where negotiation is on the price attribute of the product or service. The relation to the fees is also analyzed. A time dependent model is constructed and simulation results are reported.
