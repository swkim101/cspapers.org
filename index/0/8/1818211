Qualitative analysis studies the mechanisms with which humans derive the abstract behavior of a complex system from a description of its components and their interconnections, while ignoring unimportant or unknown low-level details. I present a program that analyzes a system by forming and combining mathematical descriptions of its sub-systems. This approach can overcome significant shortcomings in the simulation method used by other qualitative reasoning systems.
