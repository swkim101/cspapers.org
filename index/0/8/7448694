In this paper, we propose a trajectory-adjustable integrated milli-scale jumping-crawling robot with improved ability to overcome obstacles compared to a robot that can only crawl. The robot employs a novel jumping module with enhanced energy storing-capacity and a height-adjustable active trigger. To increase the energy-storing capacity, latex rubber and knee-like joints are employed to utilize large displacement of the elastic material. The active trigger is based on a single DC motor and can release stored energy at any state, enabling the robot to control the take-off speed of jumping. The jumping module is integrated with the lightweight Dash crawler. The integrated jumping-crawling robot weighs 59.4 g and controls its moving trajectory by adjusting both its crawling speed and its jumping take-off speed.
