In structured design a design is expressed in high-level components, which are defined in terms of lower-level components. Structured design combines design information of all levels in one consistent data structure. It promotes a top down design and a bottom-up implementation. High-level components are partitioned into more and more detailed components, whereas low-level components are used to build more and more complex building blocks.
 The components of a design communicate only through well defined interfaces and are otherwise isolated from each other. This increases the modularity of a design, and is a first step towards technology-independent design. A design can be recompiled as new design primitives become available. Capturing the structure of the design also facilitates machine processing, such as logic simulation and verification, automatic placement and layout.
 Structured design greatly improves the ability to understand and maintain a design. It increases the correctness of a design, it makes the designer more productive and shortens the design cycle. Finally, the design itself serves as accurate documentation.
