Pocket Code is a free and open source mobile visual programming system for the Catrobat language. It allows users, starting from the age of eight, to develop games and animations with their smartphones. Children can create programs with their Android phone, iPhone, Windows Phone, or other smartphone with an HTML5 browser. No notebook or desktop computer is needed. Pocket Code is inspired by, but distinct from, the Scratch programming system developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. This tool demo describes an in-practice experience with Pocket Code, the Windows Phone IDE for the Catrobat language.
