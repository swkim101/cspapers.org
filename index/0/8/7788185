Web performance is a key differentiation among content providers. Snafus and slowdowns at major web sites demonstrate the difficulty that companies face trying to scale to a large amount of web traffic. One solution to this problem is to store web content at server-side and edge-caches for fast delivery to the end users. However, for many e-commerce sites, web pages are created dynamically based on the current state of business processes, represented in application servers and databases. Since application servers, databases, web servers, and caches are independent components, there is no efficient mechanism to make changes in the database content reflected to the cached web pages. As a result, most application servers have to mark dynamically generated web pages as non-cacheable. In this paper, we describe the architectural framework of the CachePortal system for enabling dynamic content caching for database-driven e-commerce sites. We describe techniques for intelligently invalidating dynamically generated web pages in the caches, thereby enabling caching of web pages generated based on database contents. We use some of the most popular components in the industry to illustrate the deployment and applicability of the proposed architecture.
