In this paper a three layer control architecture for multiple aerial robotic manipulators is presented. The top layer, on the basis of the desired mission, determines the end-effector desired trajectory for each manipulator, while the middle layer is in charge of computing the motion references in order to track such end-effectors trajectories coming from the upper layer. Finally the bottom layer is a low level motion controller, which tracks the motion references. The overall mission is decomposed in a set of elementary behaviors which are combined together, through the Null Space-based Behavioral (NSB) approach, into more complex compounds behaviors. The proposed framework has been tested conducting an experimental campaign.
