This article depicts an algorithm which matches the output of a Lidar with an initial terrain model to estimate the absolute pose of a robot. Initial models do not perfectly fit the reality and the acquired data set can contain an unknown, and potentially large, proportion of outliers. We present an interval based algorithm that copes with such conditions, by matching the Lidar data with the terrain model in a robust manner. Experimental validations using different terrain model are reported to illustrate the performance of the method.
