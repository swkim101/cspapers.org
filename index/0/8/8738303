Recently a number of systems have been developed to implement and improve the visual communication over screen-camera links. In this paper we study an opposite problem: how to prevent unauthorized users from videotaping a video played on a screen, such as in a theater, while do not affect the viewing experience of legitimate audiences. We propose and develop a light-weight hardware-free system, called Kaleido, that ensures these properties by taking advantage of the limited disparities between the screen-eye channel and the screen-camera channel. Kaleido does not require any extra hardware and is purely based on re-encoding the original video frame into multiple frames used for displaying. We extensively test our system Kaleido using a variety of smartphone cameras. Our experiments confirm that Kaleido preserves the high-quality screen-eye channel while reducing the secondary screen-camera channel quality significantly.
