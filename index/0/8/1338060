Computing least common subsumers (Ics) and most specific concepts (msc) are inference tasks that can support the bottom-up construction of knowledge bases in description logics. In description logics with existential restrictions, the most specific concept need not exist if one restricts the attention to concept descriptions or acyclic TBoxes. In this paper, we extend the notions les and msc to cyclic TBoxes. For the description logic EC (which allows for conjunctions, existential restrictions, and the top-concept), we show that the les and msc always exist and can be computed in polynomial time if we interpret cyclic definitions with greatest fixpoint semantics.
