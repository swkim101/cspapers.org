Much research in software engineering have been focused on improving software quality and automating the maintenance process to reduce software costs and mitigating complications associated with the evolution process. Despite all these efforts, there are still high cost and effort associated with software bugs and software maintenance, software still continues to be unreliable, and software bugs can wreak havoc on software producers and consumers alike. My dissertation aims to advance the state-of-art in software evolution research by designing tools that can measure and predict software quality and to create integrated frameworks that helps in improving software maintenance and research that involves mining software repositories.
