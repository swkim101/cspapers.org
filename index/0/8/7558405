This paper shows how different measures of similarity derived from the citation information and the structural content (e.g., title, abstract) of the collection can be fused to improve classification effectiveness. To discover the best fusion framework, we apply Genetic Programming (GP) techniques. Our experiments with the ACM Computing Classification Scheme, using documents from the ACM Digital Library, indicate that GP can discover similarity functions superior to those based solely on a single type of evidence. Effectiveness of the similarity functions discovered through simple majority voting is better than that of content-based as well as combination-based Support Vector Machine classifiers. Experiments also were conducted to compare the performance between GP techniques and other fusion techniques such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) and linear fusion. Empirical results show that GP was able to discover better similarity functions than other fusion techniques.
