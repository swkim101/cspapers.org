We propose an interaction technique for editing splines that is aimed at professional graphic designers. These users do not take full advantage of existing spline editing software because their mental representations of drawings do not match the underlying conceptual model of the software. Although editing splines by specifying control points and tangents may be appropriate for engineers, graphic designers think more in terms of strokes, shapes, and gestures appropriate for editing drawings. Our interaction technique matches the latter model: curves can be edited by means of marks, similar to the way strokes are naturally overloaded when drawing on paper. We describe this interaction technique and the algorithms used for its implementation.
