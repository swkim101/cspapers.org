Mobile agent technology has gained more importance recently due to the rapid advance of high-performance mobile devices with high-speed wireless telecommunications technology such as 3G. However design methodologies for mobile agent applications are not mature enough to support their software development process. We proposed an extension of Activity Diagrams in UML 1.5 for modelling mobile agent applications and presented a case study in [1]. However we found that the latest version of UML 2.0, which provides better model elements in Activity Diagrams, is more effective and flexible in modelling mobile agent applications. This observation prompted us to upgrade our work in UML 1.5 to UML 2.0. In this paper, we will demonstrate how UML 2.0 Activity Diagrams can be used for modelling mobile agent applications and discuss their underlying computational models which capture mobility of agents.
