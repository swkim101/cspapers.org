Energy Harvesting Active Networked Tags (EnHANTs) are a new class of devices in the domain between RFIDs and sensor networks. EnHANTs will be small, flexible, and energetically self-reliant. Their development is enabled by advances in ultra-low-power ultra-wideband (UWB) communications and in organic semiconductor-based energy harvesting materials. In this demo, we present UWB-enabled EnHANT prototypes. Each prototype is based on a MICA2 mote integrated with a UWB Transceiver and an energy harvesting module (EHM) that allows demonstrating energy harvesting-adaptive communications. Additional information about EnHANTs is available at [2] and http://enhants.ee.columbia.edu.
