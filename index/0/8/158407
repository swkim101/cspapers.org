This is a survey of some theoretical results on boosting obtained from an analogous treatment of some regression and classi cation boosting algorithms. Some related papers include [J99] and [J00a,b,c,d], which is a set of (mutually overlapping) papers concerning the assumption of weak hypotheses, behavior of generalization error in the large time limit and during the process of boosting, comparison to the optimal Bayes error in noisy situations, over tting, and regularization.
