The knowledge compilation map introduced by Darwiche and Marquis takes advantage of a number of concepts (mainly queries, transformations, expressiveness, and succinctness) to compare the relative adequacy of representation languages to some AI problems. However, the framework is limited to the comparison of languages that are interpreted in a homogeneous way (formulae are interpreted as Boolean functions). This prevents one from comparing, on a formal basis, languages that are close in essence, such as OBDD, MDD, and ADD. To fill the gap, we present a generalized framework into which comparing formally heterogeneous representation languages becomes feasible. In particular, we explain how the key notions of queries and transformations, expressiveness, and succinctness can be lifted to the generalized setting.
