This paper presents a novel algorithm to estimate the signal probability and switching activity at all nodes in a combinational logic circuit under a zero-delay model without constructing global BDDs. By using Taylor expansion technique, the first-order signal correlation effects due to reconvergent fan-out nodes are taken into account. High accuracy is achieved by considering the dependency of the signal probability and switching activity on each primary input. High speed is also achieved by using the incremental approach for probability calculation. Our approach is able to handle large circuits, since it does not need to construct global BDDs for the probability calculation. The analysis of the time complexity and the experimental results show the running time of our approach to be about 100 times shorter than that of the most accurate approach previously proposed and that our approach has comparable accuracy. The error of the total power estimation is about 0.5% on average.
