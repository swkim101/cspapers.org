The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a new Web protocol standardized by the IETF. It is not a mere compression of HTTP, but a re-design from scratch following the REST architectural style. Thus, its features are tailored for Internet of Things (IoT) applications and machine-to-machine (M2M) scenarios with highly resource-constrained devices. While this makes CoAP very interesting for the Web of Things (WoT) initiative, it is still detached from the Web world of browsers and intuitive user interaction. We present the first attempts to unite these two worlds, so that everyday objects endowed with tiny, low-cost computing devices can become first class citizens of the Web. Our Copper (Cu) project brings CoAP support to the Web browser and has been out in the wild since late 2010. Thus, we were able to conduct a user study among industry and research developers who know both, Web-based CoAP and earlier proprietary protocols for networked embedded systems. The result shows that industry developers and those with longer experience agree even more that Internet protocols and patterns from the Web ease application development for tiny, resource-constrained devices.
