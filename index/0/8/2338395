Let <i>s</i> and <i>t</i> be vertices in a directed graph <i>G</i> with non-negative edge weights. The replacement paths problem asks us to compute, for each edge <i>e</i> in <i>G</i>, the length of the shortest path from <i>s</i> to <i>t</i> that does not traverse <i>e</i>. We describe an algorithm that solves the replacement paths problem for directed graphs embedded on a surface of any genus <i>g</i> in <i>O</i>(<i>gn</i> log <i>n</i>) time, generalizing a recent <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>)-time algorithm of Wulff-Nilsen for planar graphs [SODA 2010].
