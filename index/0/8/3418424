Fabrication of artificial blood vessels in micro scale significantly benefits the regeneration of functional human vascular networks. In this paper, we develop an efficient multi-microrobotic system with an innovative motorized sample holder (MSH) and two manipulators. Air is injected into the solution through a glass pipette fixed on one manipulator to create bubbles. These bubbles conduct a regular rising movement, which is utilized to assemble the 2D ring-shaped microgels fabricated in a simple micro fluidic device. With this novel bubble-based method and the robotic system, we achieve the automation of the assembly. A 1.2 mm long vascular-like microtube with an outer diameter of 200 Î¼m is fabricated. The whole process of the bubble-based assembly is visually observed and analyzed with side view. Key parameters are characterized to improve the assembly. Results show that the automated bubble-based assembly success rate is 100% and average time cost of assembling every microgel is as low as 3.25s.
