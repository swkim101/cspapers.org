CycSecure™ is a network risk assessment and network monitoring application that relies on knowledge-based artificial intelligence technologies to improve on traditional network vulnerability assessment. CycSecure integrates public reports of software faults from online databases, data gathered automatically from computers on a network and hand-ontologized information about computers and computer networks. This information is stored in the Cyc® knowledge base (KB) and reasoned about by the Cyc inference engine and planner to provide detailed analyses of the security (and vulnerability) of networks.
