We have developed an applied computer science project to introduce students in upper secondary schools to computer science and engineering. In the project, students build and code their own air quality sensor kits before investigating a research question by analyzing their collected data. An important part of the analysis is to investigate the air quality data in context of other data sources, such as data from other sensor kits or climate data. The task of curating such datasets are too complex for such an introductory project and it therefore requires a specialized service. In this poster we present the design and implementation of an air pollution data analysis platform that stores air quality measurements collected by students, combines it with open environmental data, and provides students with an open interface to analyze their data. During spring 2018, ten school classes from Northern Norway are going to use the platform, online at airbit.uit.no, to study air quality patterns across Northern Norway. We also provide the source code for the platform at the same address.
