We have developed the first technique for synthesis of trustable ICs using untrusted CAD tools. The approach enables the use of CAD tools for difficult synthesis tasks and very simple trusted tools developed by the designer for checking results and modifying specifications. The main idea is to specify the pertinent design in such a way that there is no room for the untrusted tool to add any malicious circuitry.
