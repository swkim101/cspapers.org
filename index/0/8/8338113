TMTprime is a recommender system that facilitates the effective use of both translation memory (TM) and machine translation (MT) technology within industrial language service providers (LSPs) localization workflows. LSPs have long used Translation Memory (TM) technology to assist the translation process. Recent research shows how MT systems can be combined with TMs in Computer Aided Translation (CAT) systems, selecting either TM or MT output based on sophisticated translation quality estimation without access to a reference. However, to date there are no commercially available frameworks for this. TMTprime takes confidence estimation out of the lab and provides a commercially viable platform that allows for the seamless integration of MT with legacy TM systems to provide the most effective (least effort/cost) translation options to human translators, based on the TMTprime confidence score.
