Collaborative Semantic Web applications produce ever changing interlinked Semantic Web data. Applications that utilize these data to obtain their results should provide explanations about how the results are obtained in order to ensure the effectiveness and increase the user acceptance of these applications. Justifications providing meta information about why a conclusion has been reached enable generation of such explanations. We present an encoding approach for justifications in a distributed environment focusing on the collaborative platforms. We discuss the usefulness of linking justifications across the Web. We introduce a vocabulary for encoding justifications in a distributed environment and provide examples of our encoding approach.
