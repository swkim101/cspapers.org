This paper presents the structure, pedagogy and motivation for an introductory undergraduate course in Virtual Reality. The course is offered as an elective at the 400-level, hence students taking the course are juniors and seniors who have completed a substantial portion of their Computer Science curriculum. The course incorporates multiple components of VR theory and practice, including hardware and software survey and analysis, human perception, and applications. It also contains a semester-long, hands-on development component utilizing a specific virtual reality environment. In addition, because VR is a broad, multidisciplinary field of study, the course provides an ideal environment for incorporating capstone elements that allow undergraduate students to tie together many of the computing principles learned during their undergraduate academic careers.
