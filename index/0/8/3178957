In this paper, we present a new construct, called Transitive Changeset, that can be used for feature location. Transitive Changesets are created by extending changesets from revision control systems with additional information. A changeset temporally associate changes and conceptual descriptions provided in a commit transaction. By following transitive relationships from these changesets, we can create a Transitive Changeset that relates concepts in the problem domain to a list of program elements that enclose changes made in the transaction and other relevant program elements. We have implemented a prototype Eclipse plug-in, Kayley, to create Transitive Changesets.
