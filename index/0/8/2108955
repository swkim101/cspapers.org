In this paper we deal with several kinds of anaphora in unrestricted texts. These kinds of anaphora are pronominal references, surfacecount anaphora and one-anaphora. In order to solve these anaphors we work on the output of a part-of-speech tagger, on which we automatically apply a partial parsing from the formalism: Slot Unification Grammar, which has been implemented in Prolog. We only use the following kinds of information: lexical (the lemma of each word), morphologic (person, number, gender) and syntactic. Finally we show the experimental results, and the restrictions and preferences that we have used for anaphor resolution with partial parsing.
