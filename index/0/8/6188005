Structured Overlay Networks (SONs) provide a promising platform for high performance applications since they are scalable, fault-tolerant and self-managing. SONs provide lookup services that map keys to nodes that can be used as processing or storage resources. In SONs, lookups for a key may return inconsistent results. Consequently, it is difficult to provide consistent data services on top of SONs that build on key-based search. In this paper, we study the frequency of occurrence of inconsistent lookups. We show that the affect of lookup inconsistencies can be reduced by using node responsibilities. We present our results as a trade-off between consistency and availability of keys.
