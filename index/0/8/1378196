Efficient operation of an energy storage device is a fundamental problem, yet classical algorithms such as $Q$-learning can diverge for millions of iterations, limiting practical applications. We have traced this behavior to the max-operator bias, which is exacerbated by high volatility in the reward function, and high discount factors due to the small time steps. We propose an elegant bias correction procedure and demonstrate its effectiveness.
