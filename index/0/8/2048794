A large class of relational database update transactions is investigated with respect to equivalence and optimization. Several basic results are obtained. It is shown that transaction equivalence can be decided in polynomial time. A number of optimality criLeria for transactions are then proposed, as well as two normal forms. Polynomial algorithms for transaction optimization and normalization are exhibited. Also, an intuitively appealing system of axioms for proving transaction equivalence is introduced. Finally. a simple, natural subclass of transactions. called t-aiyclic, is shown LO have particularly desirable properties.
