(iii) f is a bijection. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is composed of a large number of densely deployed sensing devices, which are equipped with limited computing and radio communication capabilities. The objective of a WSN is to reliably estimate the features of a surveillance area, especially the events of interest, relying on the collective effort of sensor nodes observing the physical phenomenon. An important feature of WSNs is the possible redundancy of the data continuously collected by the sensor nodes, i.e. only a limited number of sensor measurements collected from the sensor nodes working at certain reporting frequencies might be adequate to convey the event feature to the sink with a given loss tolerance. A key underlying observation is that the reporting frequencies of the sensor nodes determine not only the amount of useful data received at the sink, but also the amount of traffic injected into the sensor network. Therefore, if we can adaptively regulates the reporting frequencies of sensor nodes based on the dynamic environment features and network conditions, we can minimize the traffic injected into the WSN while guaranteeing the required event transport reliability achieved at the sink. Further, it helps to decrease the unnecessary in-network communication, thus helping cut down the energy consumption and bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we propose a distributed reliable data transport strategy for event based WSN in order to solve the above
