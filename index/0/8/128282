In this paper we present near-optimal bounds for fullydynamic graph connectivity which is the most basic nontrivial fully-dynamic graph problem. Connectivity queries are supported in O(log n/log log log n) time while the updates are supported in O(log n(log log n) 3) expected amortized time. The previous best update time was O((log n)2). Our new bound is only doubly-logarithmic factors from a general cell probe lower bound of f2(log n~ log log n). Our algorithm runs on a pointer machine, and uses only standard AC Â° instructions. In our developments we make some comparatively trivial observations improving some deterministic bounds. The space bound of the previous O((log n) ~) connectivity algorithm is improved from O(m + n log n) to O(m). The previous time complexity of fully-dynamic 2-edge and biconnectivity is improved from O((log n) 4) to O((log n) 3 log log n).
