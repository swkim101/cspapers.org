The Blackbox project, launched in 2013, collects large amounts of data about beginner student behaviour in the BlueJ IDE. In this this workshop, we will introduce researchers to the Blackbox data and show them how to get started with analyzing it to answer their own research question(s). The workshop provides an ideal opportunity to find out what can be done with the Blackbox data, and will be run by the system's architect and maintainer. The data set includes Java source code as well as information about compilations, debugger usage and other compiler interactions. The Blackbox project has over 150,000 users, over 10,000,000 compilations and tens of gigabytes of source code. (For more detailed information, see the paper "Blackbox: A Large Scale Repository of Novice Programmers' Activity" by Brown et al. in the SIGCSE 2014 proceedings.) Computing education researchers may apply for free, permanent access to the data, but is not necessary to do so before this workshop. The session will be hands-on, and participants should bring a laptop that is capable of running an SSH terminal (e.g. Mac OS X, Linux, or PuTTY on Windows) over a wireless connection.
