This paper describes a modular connectionist model of the acquisition of receptive inflectional morphology. The model takes inputs in the form of phones one at a time and outputs the associated roots and inflections. Simulations using artificial language stimuli demonstrate the capacity of the model to learn suffixation, prefixation, infixation, circumfixation, mutation, template, and deletion rules. Separate network modules responsible for syllables enable to the network to learn simple reduplication rules as well. The model also embodies constraints against association-line crossing.
