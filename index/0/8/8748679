Modeling the entailment relation over sentences is one of the generic problems of natural language understanding. In order to account for this problem, we design a theorem prover for Natural Logic, a logic whose terms resemble natural language expressions. The prover is based on an analytic tableau method and employs syntactically and semantically motivated schematic rules. Pairing the prover with a preprocessor, which generates formulas of Natural Logic from linguistic expressions, results in a proof system for natural language. It is shown that the system obtains a comparable accuracy (81%) on the unseen SICK data while achieving the state-of-the-art precision (98%).
