Robust integration of range images is an important task for building high-quality 3D models. Since range images, and in particular range maps from stereo vision, may have a substantial amount of outliers, any integration approach aiming at high-quality models needs an increased level of robustness. Additionally, a certain level of regularization is required to obtain smooth surfaces. Computational efficiency and global convergence are further preferable properties. The contribution of this paper is a unified framework to solve all these issues. Our method is based on minimizing an energy functional consisting of a total variation (TV) regularization force and an L1 data fidelity term. We present a novel and efficient numerical scheme, which combines the duality principle for the TV term with a point-wise optimization step. We demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm on the well-known Middlebury multi-view database and additionally on real-world multi-view images.
