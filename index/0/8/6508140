Photograph retrieval systems face the difficulty to deal with the different ways to apprehend the content of images. We consider and demonstrate here the use of multiple index representations of photographs to achieve effective retrieval. The use of multiple indexes allows integration of the complementary strengths of different indexing and retrieval models. The proposed representation supports multiple labels for regions and attributes, and handles inferences and relationships. We define links between indexing levels and the related query modes. The experiment conducted on 2400 home photographs shows the behavior of the multiple indexing levels during retrieval.
