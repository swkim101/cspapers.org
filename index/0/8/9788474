One of the most serious issues facing the software engineering education community is the lack of qualified tenure-track (full-time) faculty to teach software engineering courses, particularly at the undergraduate level. Similarly, one of the most serious issues facing the software industry is the lack of qualified junior and senior software engineers. This shortage cycle has existed for some time, and if it is not addressed properly will only worsen, thereby affecting the software engineering field in a more general way than it has already. The objective of this panel is to put a number of suggestions for improvement into discussion and debate in order to evaluate their potential and viability.
