Although Social Machines do not have yet a formalized definition, some efforts have been made to characterize them from a ``machinery'' point of view. In this paper, we present a methodology by which we attempt to reveal the sociality of Social Machines; to do so, we adopt the analogy of stories. By assimilating a Social Machine to a story, we can identify the stories within and about that machine and how this storytelling perspective might reveal the sociality of Social Machines. After illustrating this storytelling approach with a few examples, we then propose three axes of inquiry to evaluate the health of a social machine: (1) assessment of the sociality of a Social Machine through evaluation of its storytelling potential and realization; (2) assessment of the sustainability of a Social Machine through evaluation of its reactivity and interactivity; and (3) assessment of emergence through evaluation of the collaboration between authors and of the distributed/mixed nature of authority.
