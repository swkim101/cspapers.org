The market trend of flash memory chips has been going for high density but low reliability. The rapidly increasing bit error rates and emerging reliability issues of the coming triple-level cell (TLC) and even three-dimensional (3D) flash chips would let users take an extremely high risk to store data in such low reliability storage media. With the observations in mind, this paper rethinks the layer design of flash devices and propose a complete paradigm shift to re-configure physical flash chips of potentially massive parallelism into better “virtual chips”, in order to improve the data recoverability in a modular and low-cost way. The concept of virtual chips is realized at hardware abstraction layer (HAL) without continually complicating the conventional flash management software (i.e., flash translation layer (FTL)). The capability and compatibility of the proposed design are then verified by a series of experiments with encouraging results.
