Automatic processing of metaphor can be clearly divided into two subtasks: metaphor recognition (distinguishing between literal and metaphorical language in a text) and metaphor interpretation (identifying the intended literal meaning of a metaphorical expression). Both of them have been repeatedly addressed in NLP. This paper is the first comprehensive and systematic review of the existing computational models of metaphor, the issues of metaphor annotation in corpora and the available resources.
