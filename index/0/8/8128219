Social law is perceived as evolving through the competition of individual social strategies held by the agents. A strategy with strong authority, accepted by many agents, will tend to diffuse to the remaining agents. The authority of a social strategy is determined by not only the number of but also the collective social positions of its overlaid agents. This paper presents a novel collective strategy diffusion model in agent social law evolution. In the model, social strategies that have strong authority are impressed on the other agents. The agents will accept (partially or in full) or reject them based on their own social strategies and social positions. The diffusion of social strategies proceeds in a series of steps and the final result depends on the interplay between the forces driving diffusion and the counteracting forces.
