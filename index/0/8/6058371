We prove that the function d : Ropf<sup>3</sup> times Ropf <sup>3</sup> rarr [0,infin] given by d((x,y,z),(t,u,v)) = ([((t-x) <sup>2</sup>+(u-y)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> + (v-z+2xu-2yt)<sup>2</sup>] <sup>frac12</sup> + (t-x)<sup>2</sup> + (u-y)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>frac12</sup> is a metric on Ropf<sup>3</sup> such that (Ropf<sup>3</sup>,radicd) is isometric to a subset of Hilbert space, yet (Ropf<sup>3</sup>, d) does not admit a bi-Lipschitz embedding into L<sub>1</sub>. This yields a new simple counter example to the Goemans-Linial conjecture on the integrality gap of the semidefinite relaxation of the sparsest cut problem. The metric above is doubling, and hence has a padded stochastic decomposition at every scale. We also study the L<sup>p</sup> version of this problem, and obtain a counter example to a natural generalization of a classical theorem of Bretagnolle et al. (1996) (of which the Goemans-Linial conjecture is a particular case). Our methods involve Fourier analytic techniques, and a breakthrough of Cheeger and Kleiner (2006), together with classical results of Pansu (1989) on the differentiability of Lipschitz functions on the Heisenberg group
