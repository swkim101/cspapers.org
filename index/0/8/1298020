Creating intelligent systems that are able to recognize a user's behavior, understand unrestricted spoken natural language, complete complex tasks, and respond fluently could change the way computers are used in daily life. But fully-automated intelligent systems are a far-off goal -- currently, machines struggle in many real-world settings because problems can be almost entirely unconstrained and can vary greatly between instances. Human computation has been shown to be effective in many of these settings, but is traditionally applied in an offline, batch-processing fashion. My work focuses on a new model of continuous, real-time crowdsourcing that enables interactive crowd-powered systems.
