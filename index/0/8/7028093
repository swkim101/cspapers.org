A referring expression in linguistics is a noun phrase that identifies individuals to listeners. In the context of a query over a first order knowledge base, referring expressions to answers are usually constant symbols. This paper motivates and initiates the exploration of allowing more general formulas, called singular referring expressions, to replace constants in this role. Referring expression types play a novel and significant role in analyzing the properties of candidate expressions.
