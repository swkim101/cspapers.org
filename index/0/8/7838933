We present algorithms for solving quantified Boolean formulas (QBF, or sometimes QSAT) with worst case runtime asymptotically less than <i>O</i>(2<sup><i>n</i></sup>) when the clause-to-variable ratio is smaller or larger than some constant. We solve QBFs in conjunctive normal form (CNF) in <i>O</i>(1.709<sup><i>m</i></sup>) time and space, where <i>m</i> is the number of clauses. Extending the technique to a quantified version of constraint satisfaction problems (QCSP), we solve QCSP with domain size <i>d</i> = 3 in <i>O</i>(1.953<sup><i>m</i></sup>) time, and QCSPs with <i>d</i> ≥ 4 in <i>O</i>(<i>d</i><sup>m/2+ε</sup>) time and space for ε < 0, where <i>m</i> is the number of constraints. For 3-CNF QBF, we describe an polynomial space algorithm with time complexity <i>O</i>(1.619<sup><i>n</i></sup>) when the number of 3-CNF clauses is equal to <i>n</i>; the bound approaches 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> as the clause-to-variable ratio approaches 2. For 3-CNF Π<inf>2</inf>-SAT (3-CNF QBFs of the form ∀<i>u</i><inf>1</inf>…<i>u</i><inf><i>j</i></inf>∃<i>x</i><inf><i>j</i>+1</inf>…<i>x<inf>n</inf>F</i>), an improved polyspace algorithm has runtime varying from <i>O</i>(1.840<sup><i>m</i></sup>) to <i>O</i>(1.415<sup><i>m</i></sup>), as a particular clause-to-variable ratio increases from 1.
