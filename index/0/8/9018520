As chip design becomes ever more complex, fewer design teams are succeeding. Who's to blame? On one hand, tools are hard to use, buggy, not interoperable, and have missing functionality. On the other hand, there is a wide range of engineering skills within the user population, and tools can be abused within flawed methodologies. This panel will quantify and prioritize the key gaps, including interoperability, that must be addressed on both sides.
