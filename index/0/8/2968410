We present GATMO (Generalized Approach to Tracking Movable Objects), a system for localization and mapping that incorporates the dynamic nature of the environment while maintaining semantic labels. Objects in the environment are broken down into multiple mobility levels, from static (walls) to highly mobile (people), by maintaining a history of object movement. Object classification is accomplished through a multi-layer, multi-hypothesis approach that does not rely on any static features such as shape or size. Maps are stored in an efficient manner that incorporates a history of previous orientations of each object. GATMO is initialized with a static map; it subsequently changes the map over time as objects in the map change position.
