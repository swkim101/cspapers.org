The paper addresses the missing user acceptance of web search result clustering. We report on selected analyses and propose new concepts to improve existing result clustering approaches. Our findings in a nutshell are: 1. Don't compete with a search engine's top hits. In response to a query we presume search engines to return an optimal result list in the sense of the probabilistic ranking principle: documents that are expected by the majority of users are placed on top and form the result list head. We argue that, with respect to the top results, it is not beneficial to replace this established form of result presentation. 2. Improve document access in the result list tail. Documents that address the information need of "minorities" appear at some position in the result list tail. Especially for ambiguous and multi-faceted queries we expect this tail to be long, with many users appreciating different documents. In this situation web search result clustering can improve user satisfaction by reorganizing the long tail into topic-specific clusters. 3. Avoid shadowing when constructing cluster labels. We show that most of the cluster labels that are generated by current clustering technology occur within the snippets of the result list head--an effect which we call shadowing. The value of such labels for topic organization and navigating within a clustering of the entire result list is limited. We propose and analyze a filtering approach to significantly alleviate the label shadowing effect.
