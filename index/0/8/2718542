With a more careful approach, this trivial upper bound can be improved for certain natural restrictions of the CSP. In this paper we establish theoretical limits to such improvements, and draw a detailed landscape of the subexponential-time complexity of CSP. We first establish relations between the subexponential-time complexity of CSP and that of other problems, including CNF-Sat. We exploit this connection to provide tight characterizations of the subexponential-time complexity of CSP under common assumptions in complexity theory. For several natural CSP parameters, we obtain threshold functions that precisely dictate the subexponential-time complexity of CSP with respect to the parameters under consideration. Our analysis provides fundamental results indicating whether and when one can significantly improve on the brute-force search approach for solving CSP.
