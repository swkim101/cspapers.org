The primary concern in designing an interface for an electronic trading system is the impact on market liquidity [9]. Current systems make use of efficient order-execution algorithms but fail to capture elements of the trading floor that contribute to an efficient market [9].

Understanding the tasks helps define key components to an interface for electronic trading. These include visualization of the market and its participants, a trading process which allows active participation and price discovery as well as concurrent interaction among each of the participants.
