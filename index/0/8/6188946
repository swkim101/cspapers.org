The emerging of rich sensor networks poses very different design challenges from traditional "mote-class" sensor networks. One important challenge is that these networks are designed to handle the diverse requirements of multiple users. In this work, we demonstrate how multiple end user needs are handled in rich sensor networks using a utility-driven architecture. We instantiate this architecture in the context of geographically distributed wireless radar sensor networks for weather, and demonstrate the real-time operation of the prototype on a radar testbed in Okalahoma.
