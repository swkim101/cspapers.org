Understanding and controlling spreading dynamics in networks presupposes the identification of those influential nodes that will trigger an efficient information diffusion. It has been shown that the best spreaders are the ones located in the core of the network - as produced by the k-core decomposition. In this paper we further refine the set of the most influential nodes, showing that the nodes belonging to the best K-truss subgraph, as identified by the K-truss decomposition of the network, perform even better leading to faster and wider epidemic spreading.
