In this paper we present Valido, a tool that supports the difficult task of validating sense choices produced by a set of annotators. The validator can analyse the semantic graphs resulting from each sense choice and decide which sense is more coherent with respect to the structure of the adopted lexicon. We describe the interface and report an evaluation of the tool in the validation of manual sense annotations.
