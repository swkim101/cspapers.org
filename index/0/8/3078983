(MATH) This paper obtains the following results on pattern matching problems in which the text has length <i>n</i> and the pattern has length <i>m</i><ul><li>An <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>log <i>m</i>) time deterministic algorithm for the String Matching with Wildcards problems, even when the alphabet is large.</li><li>An <i>O</i>(<i>k</i>log<sup>2</sup> <i>m</i>) time Las Vegas algorithm for the Sparse String Matching with Wildcards problem, where <i>k</i>Â«<i>n</i> is the number of non-zeros in the text. We also give Las Vegas algorithms for the higher dimensional version of this problem.</li><li>As an application of the above, an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>log<sup>2</sup> <i>m</i>) time Las Vegas algorithm for the Subset Matching and Tree Pattern Matching problems, and a Las Vegas algorithm for the Geometric Pattern Matching problem.</li><li>Finally, an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>log<sup>2</sup> <i>m</i>) time deterministic algorithm for Subset Matching and Tree Pattern Matching.</li></ul>.The crucial new idea underlying the first three results above is that of confirming matches by convolving vectors obtained by coding characters in the alphabet with non-boolean (i.e., rational or even complex) entries; in contrast, almost all previous pattern matching algorithms consider only boolean codes for the alphabet. The crucial new idea underlying the fourth result is a simpler method of shifting characters which ensures that each character occurs as a singleton in some shift.
