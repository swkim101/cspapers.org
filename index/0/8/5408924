Multiple treebanks annotated under heterogeneous standards give rise to the research question of best utilizing multiple resources for improving statistical models. Prior research has focused on discrete models, leveraging stacking and multi-view learning to address the problem. In this paper, we empirically investigate heterogeneous annotations using neural network models, building a neural network counterpart to discrete stacking and multi-view learning, respectively, Ô¨Ånding that neural models have their unique advantages thanks to the freedom from manual feature engineering. Neural model achieves not only better accuracy improvements, but also an order of magnitude faster speed compared to its discrete baseline, adding little time cost compared to a neural model trained on a single treebank.
