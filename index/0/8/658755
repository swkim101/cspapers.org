A place is a locale that is frequently visited by an individual user and carries important semantic meanings (e.g. home, work, etc.). Many location-aware applications will be greatly enhanced with the ability of the automatic discovery of personally semantic places. The discovery of a user's personally semantic places involves obtaining the physical locations and semantic meanings of these places. In this paper, we propose approaches to address both of the problems. For the physical place extraction problem, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is proposed to firstly extract visit points from the GPS trajectories, and then these visit points can be clustered to form physical places. For the semantic place recognition problem, Bayesian networks (encoding the temporal patterns in which the places are visited) are used in combination with a customized POI (i.e. place of interest) database (containing the spatial features of the places) to categorize the extracted physical places into pre-defined types. An extensive set of experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches based on a dataset of real-world GPS trajectories.
