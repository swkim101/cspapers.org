We present our experience in a Computer Science (CS) introductory course, where three teaching practices were implemented and compared: lectured-based learning, problem-based learning, and peer instruction. We chose Information Systems, a first-term undergraduate course, for this study. It overviews a variety of topics in CS, such as algorithms, data structures and programming logic. We initially conducted interviews with previous instructors, who assisted in the collection of data, requirements, and needs pertaining to both students and instructors. We also carried out a survey among students enrolled in the program, in order to identify suggestions on how the classes could become more dynamic and motivating. In sequence, the experiment was designed to format and evaluate classes in the chosen paradigms. We focused on assessing and analyzing how the students' motivation and learning process were affected, as well as how difficult it was for instructors to prepare classes and how much time they expended in doing so. Results indicate that a paradigm shift from traditional teaching is not only expected by students and instructor; it is well received, and had a positive influence on the students' learning and motivation. We also found, however, that the proposed changes brought on an unwelcome overhead for the instructors, as additional time and effort are required to implement such practices.
