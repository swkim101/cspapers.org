Microprogramming has emerged in the past five years as a major control system design technique for digital systems of all types.
 Starting with a brief review of the basic concepts of microprogramming, its use as a pedagogical tool and role in a computer science curriculum will be considered. This will be followed by a description of a course on microprogramming taught by the author at George Washington University including an example based upon a microprogrammed hardware simulator. Some observations and conclusions on the role of microprogramming within the computer science curriculum concludes the paper.
