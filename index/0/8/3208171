BGP is essential to the operation of the Internet, but is vulnerable to both accidental failures and malicious attacks. We propose a new protocol that works in concert with BGP, which Autonomous Systems will use to help detect and mitigate accidentally or maliciously introduced faulty routing information. The protocol differs from previous efforts at securing BGP in that it is receiver-driven, meaning that there is a mechanism for recipients of BGP UPDATE messages to corroborate the information they receive and to provide feedback. We argue that our new protocol can be adopted incrementally, and we show that there is incentive for network operators to do so. We also describe our prototype implementation.
