This paper describes the creation of a virtual, interactive professional development course to build the capacity of community college faculty to recruit and retain women and underrepresented minorities in computing programs. The project was designed in response to community college faculty reporting need for practical methods to broaden participation in their programs and their feelings of isolation from like-minded faculty. The 12-session prototype has been piloted with eight community college faculty. The finalized PD will be available as free, standalone web-based modules. The course includes instruction on research-based practices for recruiting and retaining women and underrepresented minorities in computing. Evaluation mechanisms are developed to assess the impacts of the PD on faculty attitudes and teaching practices, and the effect of changed practices on introductory computing students' engagement and persistence. Here we report preliminary findings from interviews. The project outputs will include polished online content modules, validated student survey instruments, a classroom observation protocol, and student and faculty interview instruments.
