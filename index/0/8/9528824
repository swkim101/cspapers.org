Aa graduate programs in Computer Science grow and mature and undergraduate populations stabilize, an increasing proportion of our resources is being devoted to the training of researchers in the field. Many inefficiencies are evident in our graduate programs, These include undesirably long average times to thesis completion, studentsâ€™ poor work habits and general lack of professionalism, and the umecessary duplication of having supervisors introduce their students individually to the basics of research. Solving these problems requires specifically targeted education to get students started in their graduate research and introduce them to the skills and tools needed to complete it efficiently and effectively.
