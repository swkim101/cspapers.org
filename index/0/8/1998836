The identification of the dynamic model of a robotic manipulator represents a fundamental step for designing high performance model-based controllers. Despite the huge number of works presented on this topic, the symbolic dynamic model reduction (i.e., the identification of the set of parameters observable through the measure of joint torques and positions) still remain a challenging task, characterized from tailored solutions, adapted from time to time to specific families of mechanisms. The work here presented, introduces an automatic and analytical reduction of the dynamic model, based on a multi-dimensional Fourier series decomposition of the dynamic equations. The procedure enables to obtain symbolically the base dynamic parameters (BP) starting from a given kinematic structure. The Fourier based model reduction can be applied indifferently both to open- and closed-chain kinematics. A simulated example shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
