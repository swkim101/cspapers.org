This paper presents the first polynomial-time algorithm for position and matroid auction environments that learns, from samples from an unknown distribution, an auction with expected revenue arbitrarily close to the maximum possible. In contrast to most previous work, our results do not assume that the unknown distribution is regular, and require only that the distribution does not have an extremely heavy tail (a necessary assumption for any non-trivial results). Our performance guarantee is with respect to the strongest possible benchmark, the Myerson-optimal auction. Learning a near-optimal auction for an irregular distribution is technically challenging because it requires learning the appropriate "ironed intervals", a delicate global property of the distribution.
