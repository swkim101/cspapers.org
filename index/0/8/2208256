In this paper, we propose an integrated optimal planning and control technique for optical manipulation of a group of cells beyond the field of view. The proposed technique consists of a planning layer where a model predictive control is utilized to obtain a virtual input for manipulation of cells, and a control layer where the desired inputs for laser beams and motorized stage are obtained by means of the control allocation technique. Unlike existing methods on simultaneous manipulation of laser and motorized stage which the desired inputs for lasers and stage are given separately, here, the planning and control layers are integrated together to obtain optimal inputs for both laser and motorized stage. Finally, experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.
