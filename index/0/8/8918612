Starting from the assumption that machine translation (MT) should be based on theoretically sound grounds, we argue that, given the state of the art, the only viable solution for the designer of software tools for MT, is to provide the linguists building the MT system with a generator of highly specialized, problem oriented systems. We propose that such theory sensitive systems be generated automatically by supplying a set of definitions to a kernel software, of which we give an informal description in the paper. We give a formal functional definition of its architecture and briefly explain how a prototype system was built.
