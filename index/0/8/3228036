In current research, the minimum cycle times of finite state machines are estimated by computing the delays of the combinational logic in the finite state machines. Even though these methods deal with false paths, they ignore the sequential and periodic nature of minimum cycle times, and hencemay give pessimistic results. In this paper, we first prove conditions under which combinational delays are correct upper bounds on minimum cycle times. Then, we present a sequential approach to compute the minimum cycle times of finite state machines, taking into account the effects of gate delay variations, reachable state space, initial states, unrealizable transitions, multiple cycle false paths, and periodicity of the present state vector sequences. We formulate and solve the problem exactly using Timed Boolean Functions, and give an efficient algorithm to solve for upper bounds of minimum cycle times. The exact formulation with Timed Boolean Functions provides a framework for further improvements on existing algorithms to compute the minimum cycle times. We implemented the algorithm and obtained the tightest bounds known on ISCAS benchmarks. From the experiments, we found that for about 20%of the circuits (not all shown in section 8), combinational delays, e.g. floating, viability, and transition delays, give pessimistic upper bounds for cycle times by as much as 25%.
