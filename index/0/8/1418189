This paper presents and discusses a web-based software tool called GraphPad designed to facilitate interactivity in a CS2 or CS7 (data structures) course in which Tablet PCs or WACOM tablets are available. We describe how GraphPad enables an instructor to: establish a temporary network with the instructor's Tablet as server and the students' Tablets as clients, broadcast instructions and collect student Ink responses, evaluate student submissions and distribute evaluations with a single button-click, use student submissions as examples to guide lecture, and save student submissions in a database. The saved submissions may then be reviewed individually, tagged for errors, and analyzed statistically. An immediate goal is to use GraphPad to deliver CS2/CS7 course content more effectively. A long term goal is to use data collected by GraphPad to help understand the thought process of the CS2/CS7 student for the purpose of identifying students at risk early in order to provide intervention assistance.
