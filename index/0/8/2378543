The fast increase of mobile traffic from smartphone-like devices has created a huge pressure for the cellular operators to manage the network infrastructure and resources. Offloading the mobile traffic to alternative networks such as WiFi is sought as a promising direction to solve this problem cost-effectively. According to our study and experimental findings, existing research proposals are lack of concern for the complexity of network deployment and device limitations, which impedes the solution deployment. To overcome such challenge, we propose SoftOffload, a programmable framework for collaborative mobile traffic offloading. SoftOffload takes the advantage of software defined networking (SDN) paradigm in terms of openness and extensibility. We have implemented the first prototype utilising the open source Floodlight platform.
