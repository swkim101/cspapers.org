Recent results on the asymptotically optimal design of sliding windows for virtual circuits in high speed, geographically dispersed data networks in a stationary environment are exploited here in the synthesis of algorithms for adapting windows in realistic, non-stationary environments. The algorithms proposed here require each virtual circuit's source to measure the round trip response times of its packets and to use these measurements to dynamically adjust its window. Our design philosophy is quasi-stationary: we first obtain, for a complete range of parameterized stationary conditions, the relation, called the “design equation”, that exists between the window and the mean response time in asymptotically optimal designs; the adaptation algorithm is simply an iterative algorithm for tracking the root of the design equation as conditions change in a non-stationary environment. A report is given of extensive simulations of networks with data rates of 45 Mbps and propagation delays of up to 47 msecs. The simulations generally confirm that the realizations of the adaptive algorithms give stable, efficient performance and are close to theoretical expectations when these exist.
