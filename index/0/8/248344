We investigate the deterministic and the randomized decision tree complexities of Boolean functions, denoted by <i>D</i>(<i>f</i>) and <i>R</i>(<i>f</i>), respectively. A long standing conjecture is that, for every Boolean function <i>f, R</i>(<i>f</i>) = Ω(<i>D</i>(<i>f</i>)α where α = log<sub>2</sub> (1+√33/4) = 0.753... [Saks-Wigderson, FOCS '86]. In this paper, we concentrate on the class of read-once Boolean functions and propose a promising approach to attack the conjecture for this class. Precisely, we give a statement about a property of a real-valued function whose correctness implies the conjecture for all read-once Boolean functions. So far we have not succeeded to prove this statement; however, we verified by computer calculation that the statement is "at least approximately true" that implies a lower bound of <i>R</i>(<i>f</i>) = Ω(<i>D</i>(<i>f</i>)<sup>0.99α</sup>) = Ω(<i>D</i>(<i>f</i>)<sup>0.746</sup>). This improves the best known lower bound of Ω(<i>D</i>(<i>f</i>)<sup>0.51</sup>) by Heiman and Wigderson [Comput. Complexity, 1991].
