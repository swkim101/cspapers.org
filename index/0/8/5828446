QBIC (Query By Image Content) is a prototype software system for image retrieval developed at the IBM Almaden Research Center. It allows a user to query an image collection using features of image content – colors, textures, shapes, locations, and layout of images and image objects. For example, a user can query for images with a green background that contain a round red object in the upper left. The queries are formed graphically a query for red objects can be specified by selecting the color red from a color wheel, a texture query can be specified by selecting from a palette of textures, a query for a shape can be specified by drawing the shape on a” blackboard”, and so on. Retrievals are based on similarity, not exact match, computed from nuHarry Road, San Jose, CA 95120
