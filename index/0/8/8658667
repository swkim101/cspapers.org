Mobile wireless sensors in indoor environments will experience multipath fading, causing rapid variations in the capacity of the radio link. We present a strategy that increases the throughput by modifying the trajectory of the sensor so it spends more time at positions where the capacity is high. While doing so, it still maintains some desired average velocity. Our approach includes closed-loop estimation of the parameters of the fading, which may change when moving between rooms. We prove stability of the feedback system and illustrate its behavior through simulations. Finally, we demonstrate robustness to errors in the channel model.
