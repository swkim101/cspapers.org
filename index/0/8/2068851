Future Space Station crewmembers will be working at the computer-based workstations. Command and control critical mission objectives will be conducted from these multi-monitor workstations with direct manipulation interfaces. It is important to determine the workstation design requirements for safe and effective crew interfaces. When developing the design criteria, individual capabilities and limitations such as viewing requirements, head clearances, reach and body size must be considered as well as the tasks to be performed, and resources (i.e., displays and controls) available. The dominant factor in space affecting the crew is "weightlessnes" which creates a challenge for establishing workstation microgravity design requirements.
