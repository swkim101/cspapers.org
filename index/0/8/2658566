We present an online learning algorithm for statistical machine translation (SMT) based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Under the online setting of rank learning, a corpus-wise loss has to be approximated by a batch local loss when optimizing for evaluation measures that cannot be linearly decomposed into a sentence-wise loss, such as BLEU. We propose a variant of SGD with a larger batch size in which the parameter update in each iteration is further optimized by a passive-aggressive algorithm. Learning is efficiently parallelized and line search is performed in each round when merging parameters across parallel jobs. Experiments on the NIST Chinese-to-English Open MT task indicate significantly better translation results.
