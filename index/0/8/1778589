This paper addresses a novel computation method of the Maximal Output Admissible (MOA) set for a limit cycle controller and its application to motion transition. By approximately calculating the MOA set via sample point cloud, we can obtain an analytic form of the MOA set even on a nonlinear system. Formulation provided in this paper can be applicable to various types of controllers. Using the MOA set, we demonstrate a motion transition from a standing posture to steady walking. Switching two types of controllers based on the MOA set realizes motion transition with the COP constraint satisfied. The validity of proposed method is verified with a simulation.
