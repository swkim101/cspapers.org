We propose a lightweight system for (i) semi-automatically discovering and tracking bias themes associated with opposing sides of a topic; (ii) identifying strong partisans who drive the online discussion; and (iii) inferring the opinion bias of "regular" participants. By taking just two hand-picked seeds to characterize the topic-space (e.g., "pro-choice" and "pro-life") as weak labels, we develop an efficient optimization-based opinion bias propagation method over the social/information network. We show how this approach leads to a 20% accuracy improvement versus a next-best alternative for bias estimation, as well as uncovering the opinion leaders and evolving themes associated with these topics. We also demonstrate how the inferred opinion bias can be integrated into user recommendation, leading to a 26% improvement in precision.
