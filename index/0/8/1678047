This paper addresses the problem of visual servo control for a humanoid robot in an unstructured domestic environment. The important issues in this application are autonomous planning, robustness to camera and kinematic model errors, large pose errors, occlusions and reliable visual tracking. Conventional image-based or position-based visual servoing schemes do not address these issues, which motivated the proposed hybrid position-based scheme exploiting fusion of visual and kinematic measurements. Kinematic measurements provide robustness to visual distractions, and allow servoing to continue when the end-effector leaves the field of view. Visual measurements provide the complementary benefits of accurate pose tracking and online estimation of the hand-eye transformation for kinematic calibration. Furthermore, it is shown that calibration errors in the focal length and baseline can be approximated as an unknown scale of the end-effector, which can be estimated in the tracking filter to overcome camera calibration errors. The improved accuracy and robustness compared to conventional position-based servoing is demonstrated experimentally.
