Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) has been a popular method for extracting features which preserve class separability. The projection vectors are commonly obtained by maximizing the between class covariance and simultaneously minimizing the within class covariance. In practice, when there is no sufficient training samples, the covariance matrix of each class may not be accurately estimated. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Semi- supervised Discriminant Analysis (SDA), which makes use of both labeled and unlabeled samples. The labeled data points are used to maximize the separability between different classes and the unlabeled data points are used to estimate the intrinsic geometric structure of the data. Specifically, we aim to learn a discriminant function which is as smooth as possible on the data manifold. Experimental results on single training image face recognition and relevance feedback image retrieval demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
