Energy harvesting wearable sensor nodes offer low maintenance and high mobility, but suffer from unstable power supply and insufficient energy. Featuring low standby power and instant backup and restore operations, nonvolatile processors have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for the improvement of energy harvesting wearable devices. However, device quality of service (QoS) is still limited by lack of sufficient energy. To address this problem, this paper attempts to maximize QoS by optimizing task scheduling for DVFS-enabled nonvolatile processor-based embedded devices. First, we model the task scheduling problem as an optimization problem to maximize the total value (which represents QoS) given available harvested energy and time. We then prove the problem to be NP-hard. In addition, we propose a pseudopolynomial-time optimal algorithm based on dynamic programming, as well as an approximation algorithm that allows for a trade-off between running time and total value. We evaluate algorithm performance on an ultra-lowpower platform produced by Texas Instruments, and conduct extensive simulations with different system models and task sets. The results demonstrate that the platform can execute optimal sequences derived by the dynamic-programming algorithm, with differences between simulation results and real traces of less than 1%. Also, our approximate algorithm executes approximately 10 5 times faster than the dynamic-programming algorithm at a value degradation cost of less than 3%.
