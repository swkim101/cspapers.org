IA-32 Execution Layer (IA-32 EL) is a newtechnology that executes IA-32 applications onIntel® Itanium® processor family systems.Currently, support for IA-32 applications onItanium-based platforms is achieved usinghardware circuitry on the Itanium processors.This capability will be enhanced with IA-32EL-software that will ship with Itanium-basedoperating systems and will convert IA-32instructions into Itanium instructions viadynamic translation.In this paper, we describeaspects of the IA-32 Execution Layertechnology, including the general two-phasetranslation architecture and the usage of asingle translator for multiple operatingsystems.The paper provides details of someof the technical challenges such as preciseexception, emulation of FP, MMXTM, and Intel®Streaming SIMD Extension instructions, andmisalignment handling.Finally, the paperpresents some performance results.
