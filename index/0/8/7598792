Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are widely deployed in mission critical infrastructures such as manufacturing, energy, and transportation. The mission critical nature of ICS devices poses important security challenges for ICS vendors and asset owners. In particular, the patching of ICS devices is usually deferred to scheduled production outages so as to prevent potential operational disruption of critical systems. Unfortunately, anecdotal evidence suggests that ICS devices are riddled with security vulnerabilities that are not patched in a timely manner, which leaves them vulnerable to exploitation by hackers, nation states, and hacktivist organizations. In this paper, we present the results from our longitudinal measurement and characterization study of ICS patching behavior. Our study is based on IP scan data collected from Shodan over the duration of three years for more than 500 known industrial ICS protocols and products. Our longitudinal measurements reveal the impact of vulnerability disclosures on ICS patching. Our analysis of more than 100 thousand Internet-exposed ICS devices reveals that about 50% upgrade to newer patched versions within 60 days of a vulnerability disclosure. Based on our measurement and analysis, we further propose a variation of the Bass model to forecast the patching behavior of ICS devices. The evaluation shows that our proposed models have comparable prediction accuracy when contrasted against traditional ARIMA timeseries forecasting models, while requiring less parameters and being amenable to direct physical interpretation.
