The problem of motion estimation and restoration of objects in a blurred video sequence is addressed in this paper. Fast movement of the objects, together with the aperture time of the camera, result in a motion-blurred image. The direct velocity estimation from this blurred video is inaccurate. On the other hand, an accurate estimation of the velocity of the moving objects is critical for restoration of motion-blurred video. Therefore, restoration needs accurate motion estimation and vice versa, and a joint process is called for. To address this problem we derive a novel model of the blurring process and propose a Mumford-Shah type of variational framework, acting on consecutive frames, for joint object deblurring and velocity estimation. The proposed procedure distinguishes between the moving object and the background and is accurate also close to the boundary of the moving object. Experimental results both on simulated and real data show the importance of this joint estimation and its superior performance when compared to the independent estimation of motion and restoration.
