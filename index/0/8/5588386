An open problem in reinforcement learning is discovering hierarchical structure. HEXQ, an algorithm which automatically attempts to decompose and solve a model-free factored MDP hierarchically is described. By searching for aliased Markov sub-space regions based on the state variables the algorithm uses temporal and state abstraction to construct a hierarchy of interlinked smaller MDPs.
