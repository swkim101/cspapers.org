For massively parallel computing mechanism, broadcasting is widely used in a variety of applications. When the computation is distributed among the powerful processors, communication overhead always limits the speedup. To reduce the influence of communication latency, a variety of routing methods have been discussed. In this paper, we propose an efficient routing method of broadcasting on all-port worrnhole-routed hybercubes. By exploiting the distance-insensitivity of wormhole switching, this efficient broadcasting algorithm reduce communication latency to l_rzl_logz(n+l )11steps in an n-dimensional hypercube, which is much better than previous results and very close to the theoretical optimum, [rz/log2(n+l )1.Further, by adopting the Hamming code, a well-known algebraic approach in coding theory, this proposed algorithm is contention-free in each broadcasting step.
