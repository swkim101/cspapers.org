Rather than words, entity phrases, the relations between the entities, as well as the types of the entities and relations carry much more information to represent the texts. This paper presents a novel text as network classification framework, which introduces 1) a structured and typed heterogeneous information networks (HINs) representation of texts, and 2) a meta-path based approach to link texts. We show that with the new representation and links of texts, the structured and typed information of entities and relations can be incorporated into kernels. Particularly, we develop both simple linear kernel and indefinite kernel based on meta-paths in the HIN representation of texts, where we call them HIN-kernels. Using Freebase, a well-known world knowledge base, to construct HIN for texts, our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the indefinite HIN kernel based on weighted meta-paths outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and other HIN-kernels.
