We present a new notion, Self-certified Ring Signature (SCRS), to provide an alternative solution to the certificate management problem in ring signatures and eliminate private key escrow problem in identity based ring signatures. Our scheme captures all features of ring signatures and exhibits the advantages such as low storage, communication and computation cost. The main contribution of this paper is a precise definition of self-certified ring signatures along with a concrete construction. We also provide a security model of SCRS and a security proof of our scheme.
