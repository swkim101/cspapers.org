The Fuzzball is an operating system and applications library designed for the PDP11 family of computers. It was intended as a development platform and research pipewrench for the DARPA/NSF Internet, but has occasionally escaped to earn revenue in commercial service. It was designed, implemented and evolved over a seventeen-year era spanning the development of the ARPANET and TCP/IP protocol suites and can today be found at Internet outposts from Hawaii to Italy standing watch for adventurous applications and enduring experiments. This paper describes the Fuzzball and its applications, including a description of its novel congestion avoidance/control and timekeeping mechanisms.
