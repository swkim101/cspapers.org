At the conference, the part of Nomen was played by Li Gong of Javasoft; the part of Clavis was played by Barbara Fox of Microsoft; the part of Pastor was played by Brian Dillaway of Microsoft; and I played the part of Chorus myself. Li, Barbara, and Brian participated in this session without the benefit of rehearsal (or even advance knowledge of the script!) and I owe all of them a big “thank you” for their smooth performances and good humor.
