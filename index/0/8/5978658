We present the SPIN system, a computational tool to detect linguistic and dialog structure patterns in a social interaction that reveal the underlying power relations between its participants. The SPIN system labels sentences in an interaction with their dialog acts (i.e., communicative intents), detects instances of overt display of power, and predicts social power relations between its participants. We also describe a Google Chrome browser extension, namely gSPIN, to illustrate an exciting use-case of the SPIN system, which will be demonstrated at the demo session during the conference.
