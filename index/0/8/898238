A dynamic model of a jump glider is presented and correlated with the results obtained with a prototype glider. The glider uses a carbon fiber spring and a main wing that pivots approximately parallel to the airflow during ascent and latches into place for a gliding descent. The robot demonstrates longer traveled distance than an equivalent drag-free ballistic mass. A detailed numerical and a simplified algebraic model are also introduced, which are useful for exploring design tradeoffs and performance. These models suggest ways to improve the traveled distance and indicate that with modest variations in the wing angle of attack during ascent, one can choose from a variety of launch angles to accommodate variations in ground friction without greatly compromising range.
