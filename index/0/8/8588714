We conducted long distance radio propagation experiments at 1-10mW/145MHz, to realize a low-power long-distance communication for wildlife research and disaster prevention telemetry. In this paper, we describe that we succeeded in long distance communications, from a ferryboat to the top of Mt. Asugiyama (elevation: 501m, distance: 15km) in Kure, Hiroshima, Japan, in the verification test of our method using 3W radio power. We found out that our method has sufficient capability to achieve such a long distance communication at 10BPS/10mW in battery cell operation on a marine, if we use SSB mode and the SNR in SSB bandwidth is better than -10dB.
