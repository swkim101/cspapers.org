We present a novel model for the task of joint mention extraction and classification. Unlike existing approaches, our model is able to effectively capture overlapping mentions with unbounded lengths. The model is highly scalable, with a time complexity that is linear in the number of words in the input sentence and linear in the number of possible mention classes. Our model can be extended to additionally capture mention heads explicitly in a joint manner under the same time complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through extensive experiments on standard datasets.
