While users often revisit pages on the Web, tool support for such re-visitation is still lacking. Current tools (such as browser histories) only provide users with basic information such as the date of the last visit and title of the page visited. In this paper, we describe a system that provides users with descriptive topic-phrases that aid re-finding. Unlike prior work, our system considers both the content of a webpage and the context in which the page was visited. Preliminary evaluation of this system suggests users find this approach of combining content with context useful.
