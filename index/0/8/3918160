In this paper we introduce a novel technique for classifying text citations without labeled training examples. We first utilize the search results of a general search engine as original training data. We then proposed a mutually reinforcing learning algorithm (MRL) to mine the classification knowledge and to "clean" the training data. With the help of a set of established domain-specific ontological terms or keywords, the MRL mining step derives the relevant classification knowledge. The MRL cleaning step then builds a naive Bayes classifier based on the mined classification knowledge and tries to clean the training set. The MRL algorithm is iteratively applied until a clean training set is obtained. We show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in the classification of biomedical citations from a large medical literature database.
