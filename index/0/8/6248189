In recent years, the information retrieval (IR) community has witnessed the first successful applications of deep neural network models to short-text matching and ad-hoc retrieval tasks. However, the two communities - focused on deep neural networks and on IR - have less in common when it comes to the choice of programming languages. Indri, an indexing framework popularly used by the IR community, is written in C++, while Torch, a popular machine learning library for deep learning, is written in the light-weight scripting language Lua. To bridge this gap, we introduce Luandri (pronounced "laundry"), a simple interface for exposing the search capabilities of Indri to Torch models implemented in Lua.
