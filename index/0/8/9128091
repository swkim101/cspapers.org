In this paper we propose a statistical parsing technique that simultaneously identifies biomedical named-entities (NEs) and extracts subcellular localization relations for bacterial proteins from the text in MEDLINE articles. We build a parser that derives both syntactic and domain-dependent semantic information and achieves an F-score of 48.4% for the relation extraction task. We then propose a semi-supervised approach that incorporates noisy automatically labeled data to improve the F-score of our parser to 83.2%. Our key contributions are: learning from noisy data, and building an annotated corpus that can benefit relation extraction research.
