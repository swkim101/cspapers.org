This paper presents a method for shared control where real-time bursts of optimal control assistance are applied by an observer on-demand to aid a simulated figure in maintaining balance. The proposed Assistive Controller (AC) calculates the optimal burst control fast, in real time, while accounting for nonlinearities of the dynamic model. The short duration of the AC signals allows a rapid transfer of control authority between the nominal and the assistive controller. This scheme avoids prolonged loss of nominal control authority on the part of the figure while facilitating the real-time integration of an external observer's guidance through the assistive control. We demonstrate the benefits of this control scheme in simulation using the Robot Operating System (ROS), in a context where the nominal controller fails to stabilize the figure and the AC is activated intermittently to not only keep it from falling but to additionally push it back to the upright position. The example signifies the efficiency of the proposed model-based AC even in the absence of force/pressure sensors. This approach presents an opportunity for using exoskeletons in balance support, fall prevention, and therapy. In particular, our simulation results indicate that a therapist equipped with an AC interface can, with minimal effort, increase active participation on the part of the patient while ensuring their safety.
