One of the major difficulties facing anyone trying to teach the first programming course is how to encourage students to thoroughly test their programs. We would argue that the main reasons for this are the lack of suitable tools for testing and the need to write extra "debug" code in order to verify correct operation. We further argue that the problem is even worse with object-oriented languages because of multiple classes and encapsulation. In this paper we describe the testing tools within the Blue programming environment which allow object-oriented programs to be thoroughly tested without writing a single line of new code.
