Pipeline, Delta, and Black Hole are three simple patterns used in concurrent software design. We recently presented these and other patterns for parallelism at a nine-hour workshop for professional embedded systems developers. By grounding these patterns in the context of robotic control on the LEGO Mindstorms, we provided an engaging and enjoyable educational experience for our "students," and reaffirmed that small, powerful languages have a place in education for beginners and experts alike.
