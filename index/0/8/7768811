On July 7-11, 60 computer scientists came together at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington to consider how the undergraduate curricula might be improved in light of recent research in computer science. At this NSF-funded workshop, researchers presented work in four areas where current research might be particularly relevant, and undergraduate faculty (with experience in software engineering, functional programming, artificial intelligence, discrete mathematics or theoretical computer science) explored the current state of undergraduate computer science curricula and ways in which they might be better informed by recent research.Each participant attended sessions in one of the four interest areas--Software Engineering Capstone Courses, Functional Programming, Neural Networks and Their Applications, and Computational Geometry--and faculty developed curricular materials that they could use in their teaching the following year. Those materials are being placed on the WWW, and faculty are refining them as they use them in their courses. A second workshop is planned for summer, 1998.The workshop was sponsored by The Evergreen State College, the Oregon Graduate Institute, the Washington Center for the Improvement of Undergraduate Education, and by the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS).All of the panelists participated in the workshop and each panel member will share his or her experiences in incorporating the recent research results studied at the workshop into their undergraduate curriculum. In addition, the panelists will discuss with the audience their own plans for integrating research results into their own undergraduate programs.
