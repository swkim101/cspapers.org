The scale of weather monitoring is limited by the cost of the automatic weather stations (AWS), which is mainly the cost of high precision instruments and long-distance wireless telecommunication equipments. We propose a wireless sensor network (WSN) based AWS, which takes advantage of the low-cost, real-time and infrastructure-free characteristics of WSN [1]. We can therefore extend the scale of weather monitoring without increasing the number of telecommunication equipments. This WSN-based AWS is able to cover a plane and gather multiple sets of weather measurements in real-time at a better data resolution.
