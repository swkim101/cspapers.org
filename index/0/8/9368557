For the SERAPHIN project, we set up two assessment protocols m order to be able to more accurately assess the • quahty of abstracts-the FAN protocol and the MLffCE protocol, for which we provide the results The FAH protocol assesses the legibdtty of an abstract, independently from the source text The MLUCE protocol ls designed to allow users of automatic abstracts to assess then" quality These protocols were applied to a corpus of 27 texts which vaned m length from between three and twelve pages These texts were randomly chosen from EDF archives They include both sclenUfic and general press articles, extracts from books, and internal EDP notes The results of the FAlq protocol demonstrate the &fficulty of using surface lmgmsuc m&cators to assess the. quality of an abstract, the results of the MLUCE protocol illustrate the importance of user expectations 1 lntroductmn The SERAPHIN system produces abstracts usmg an alternative approach, the contextual exploration method (Descl~ et ai 97), based on the pinpointing of lmgmsttc indications m order to ldenUfy 0 certain structurmg mformaUon, l0 causal arguments and arguments by cause (Jacklewlcz 96), ill) different def'mmg wordings (Cartier 97) The abstracts are made up of sentences extracted from the source text, and to which semantic labels have been attached (Bern et al 96), representing the salient points of the source text from the author's point of view The size of the abstract ss lnmted to 20% of the source text The assessment of abstracts has oRen been approached from the computer documentatmn angle (Salton 89), particularly by using crRena such as system's recall and system's precision The mare problem with these criteria is the posmlatmn of the existence of a user request, expressed in the form of a combmauon of describers It can be seen that this hypothesis does not generally correspond to the reahty of using abstracts Indeed, the reader of the abstract has already selected the source document as being one which belongs to his field of mterest, and he ~s looking to obtain the most accurate understanding possible of the content of the document Thts Is why, wlthm the SERAPHIH project, we set up two assessment protocols, FAN and MLUCE, whtch are designed to better assess the quahty of abstracts. The purpose of the present amcle ~s not the evaluation of the SERAPHIH system Rself ~, but "how to evaluate" the quality of automattc text suraraanzatmn …
