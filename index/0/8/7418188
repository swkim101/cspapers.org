Millions of office workplaces are cleaned by a surprisingly small group of cleaning workers every day, however, cleaning companies struggle to recruit enough personnel these days. One solution to this challenge is to schedule available professionals for demanding tasks while relieving them from simpler activities which are transferred to a robotic cleaning assistant. Two of such tasks are floor cleaning and waste disposal which account for 70% of the daily cleaning efforts. This paper presents the world's first autonomous cleaning robot prototype that masters both of these tasks and whose development was accompanied by the advice of a large cleaning company. Besides a detailed description of the overall system and its individual components an evaluation is provided based on real world experiments. The results indicate that both cleaning tasks can be solved at high quality but with potential for increased efficiency to meet the required performance. Hence, the paper concludes with a discussion on measures necessary for the development of a commercial prototype.
