In this paper, we describe the process of discovering underlying knowledge in a set of isokinetic tests, using a new algorithm to find similar patterns in a set of temporal series. An isokinetic machine is basically a physical support on which patients exercise one of their joints, in this case the knee, according to different ranges of movement and at a constant speed. The data on muscle strength supplied by the machine are processed by an expert system that has built-in knowledge elicited from an expert in isokinetics. It cleans and pre-processes the data and conducts an intelligent analysis of the parameters and morphology of the isokinetic curves. Then, Data Mining methods based on the discovery of sequential patterns in time series by means of which to find similarities and differences among exercises were applied to the processed information to characterise injuries of those patients. The results obtained were applied in two environments: one for the blind and another for elite athletes.
