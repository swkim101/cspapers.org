In this paper, we present a fluidically functionalized soft-bodied robot that integrates both sensing and actuation. Rather than combining these functions as an afterthought, we design sensors and actuators into the robot at the onset, both reducing fabrication complexity and optimizing component interactions. We utilize liquid metal strain sensors and pneumatic actuators embedded into a silicone robotic gripper. The robot's body is formed by curing the silicone in complex 3D printed molds. We show that the liquid metal strain gauges provide a repeatable resistance response during robotic actuation. We further show that, given sufficient control over other time-dependent variables, it is possible to determine when the robot begins gripping an object during actuation.
