This work presents the design, fabrication, capabilities, and obstacle traversal mechanics of MEDIC (Millirobot Enabled Diagnostic of Integrated Circuits), a small legged robot able to overcome a varied array of obstacles. MEDIC features a hull that keeps its body in contact with the ground at all times, and uses only four actuators to move forward, turn, mount obstacles, and move in reverse. The chassis is fabricated using a Smart Composite Microstructures (SCM) approach and the robot is actuated by coiled Shape Memory Alloy (SMA). MEDIC also features a camera which will be useful for navigation in the future.
