We propose the portable situation reporting system by a small robot for daily life, which demands the rapidly system reconstitution for daily life support. In this paper, we established a system by an attachment mechanism assisted the robot system based on device-distributed approach and the patterned processing by the tree structuring of sensor information processing. The attachment mechanism facilitates the hardware system reconstitution and the patterned processing simplifies the software system restructuring. We evaluated the reconfigurable system not to re-write programs and judged the effectiveness of the system by the experiments.
