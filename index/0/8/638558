The computer has undergone revolutionary changes since the introduction in 1946 of ENIAC, which was constructed with 18,000 vacuum tubes, occupied the floor space of 100 square meters and weighed 30 tons. Chip innovations - from transistor to IC to microprocessor to SoC (System on Chip) - were the major enablers for the drastic progress of the computer toward higher intelligence, lower cost, smaller size and lower power. Today, we are in the age of ubiquitous computing and observing the convergence of computer, communication and consumer product.This talk offers a historical review of chip innovations, including some important milestones. An outlook on future chip technologies and their implications for future computing will be provided, focusing on robotics as the key driver.
