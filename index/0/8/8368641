We study Markov chains for randomly sampling k‐colorings of a graph with maximum degree Δ. Our main result is a polynomial upper bound on the mixing time of the single‐site update chain known as the Glauber dynamics for planar graphs when k=Ω(Δ/logΔ) . Our results can be partially extended to the more general case where the maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph is at most Δ1−ϵ , for fixed ϵ>0 .
