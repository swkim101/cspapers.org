We demonstrate our approach for two-dimensional graphs (curves of single variable functions) and three-dimensional graphs (surfaces of two variable functions), studying the properties of convexity and symmetry. Our method uses a Convolutional Neural Network which classifies functions according to these properties, without using any hand-crafted features. We propose algorithms for randomly constructing functions with convexity or symmetry properties, and use the images generated by these algorithms to train our network. Our system achieves a high accuracy on this task, even for functions where humans find it difficult to determine the function's properties from its image.
