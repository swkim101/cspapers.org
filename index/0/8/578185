We have recently launched a reorganized discrete structures course being taught in the computer science department for computer science majors. The main idea of the reorganization is to make the course relevant and productive for the computer science students. During the Spring of 2003, students who were taking both discrete structures and CS2 commented that taking both courses at the same time was helpful. An empirical investigation was conducted to see if there was a benefit to students taking both courses concurrently. The results show that there was a benefit to students taking both courses. The students who were taking both courses were performing better in discrete structures than those students who were not.
