The problem of searching for information in networks like the World Wide Web can be approached in a variety of ways, ranging from centralized indexing schemes to decentralized mechanisms that navigate the underlying network without knowledge of its global structure. The decentralized approach appears in a variety of settings: in the behavior of users browsing the Web by following hyperlinks; in the design of focused crawlers [4, 5, 8] and other agents that explore the Web’s links to gather information; and in the search protocols underlying decentralized peer-to-peer systems such as Gnutella [10], Freenet [7], and recent research prototypes [21, 22, 23], through which users can share resources without a central server. In recent work, we have been investigating the problem of decentralized search in large information networks [14, 15]. Our initial motivation was an experiment that dealt directly with the search problem in a decidedly pre-Internet context: Stanley Milgram’s famous study of the small-world phenomenon [16, 17]. Milgram was seeking to determine whether most pairs of people in society were linked by short chains of acquaintances, and for this purpose he recruited individuals to try forwarding a letter to a designated “target” through people they knew on a first-name basis. The starting individuals were given basic information about the target — his name, address, occupation, and a few other personal details — and had to choose a single acquaintance to send the letter to, with goal of reaching the target as quickly as possible; subsequent recipients followed the same procedure, and the chain closed in on its destination. Of the chains that completed, the median number of steps required was six — a result that has since entered popular culture as the “six degrees of separation” principle [11]. Milgram’s experiment contains two striking discoveries — that short chains are pervasive, and that people are able to find them. This latter point is concerned precisely with a type of decentralized navigation in a social network, consisting of people as nodes and links joining
