Generalized network flow problems generalize normal network flow problems by specifying a flow multiplier ?((v,w)) for each arc (v,w). For every unit of flow entering the arc, ?((v,w)) units of flow exit. We present a strongly polynomial algorithm for a single-source generalized shortest paths problem, using a left-distributive closed semiring. This permits use of a dynamic-programming routine similar to the Bellman?Ford algorithm, given a guess for the value of the optimal solution. Using Megiddo's parametric search scheme, we can compute the optimal value in strongly polynomial time. The algorithm's running time O(mn2logn) matches the previously best known, but the algorithm is simpler, is based on the well-known theory of closed semirings, and directly works with the given graph. All previous polynomial-time algorithms were based on interior-point methods or directly solved the dual problem and translated the solution back to the primal problem. Using this generalized shortest paths algorithm, we present fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for the generalized versions of the maximum flow, the nonnegative-cost minimum-cost flow, the concurrent flow, the multicommodity maximum flow, and the multicommodity nonnegative-cost minimum-cost flow problems with running times independent of the size of the flow multipliers' representation.
