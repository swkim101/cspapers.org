Smart TVs are rapidly replacing conventional TVs. In a number of countries, set-top boxes (STB) are widely used to relay TV channels to smart TVs. In such cases, smart TVs cannot identify which TV channel they are receiving. This situation makes it challenging for smart TVs to provide their users with a variety of personalized services, such as context-aware services and recommendation services. In this paper, we introduce our TV channel matching system that resolves such problems. We propose strategies for scaling-out the matching system and improving its accuracy.
