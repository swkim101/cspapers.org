We present a system for entering common music notation based on 2D gestural input. The key feature of the system is the look-and-feel of the interface which approximates sketching music with paper and pencil. A probability-based interpreter integrates sequences of gestural input to perform the most common notation and editing operations. In this paper, we present the userâ€™s model of the system, the components of the high-level recognition system, and a discussion of the evolution of the system including user feedback.
