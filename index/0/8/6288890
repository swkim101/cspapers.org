We investigate coreference relationships between NPs with the same head noun. It is relatively common in unsupervised work to assume that such pairs are coreferent-- but this is not always true, especially if realistic mention detection is used. We describe the distribution of non-coreferent same-head pairs in news text, and present an unsupervised generative model which learns not to link some same-head NPs using syntactic features, improving precision.
