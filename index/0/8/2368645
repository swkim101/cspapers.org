Data has cross-cutting concerns such as versioning, privacy, and reliability. In this paper we sketch support such concerns by adapting the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) paradigm to data. Our goal, shared by AOP, is to re-engineer applications to support cross-cutting concerns without directly modifying the application's data or queries. We propose modeling a cross-cutting data concern as a data aspect. A data aspect weaves metadata around an application's data and queries, imbuing them with additional semantics for constraint and query processing.
