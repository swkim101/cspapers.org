This paper extends the concepts of the distributed linear hashed main memory file system with the objective of supporting higher level parallel dambase operations. The basic distributed linear hashing technique provides a high speed hash based dynamic file system on a NUMA atchitecture multi-processor system. Distributed linear hashing has been extended to include the ability to perform high speed parallel scans of the hashed file. The fast scan feature provides load balancing to compensate for uneven distributions of records and uneven processing speed among different processors. These extensions are used to implement a parallel projection capability. The performance of distributed linear hashing and parallel projection is investigated.
