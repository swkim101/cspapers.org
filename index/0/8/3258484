Activity recognition fits within the bigger framework of context awareness. In this paper, we report on our efforts to recognize user activity from accelerometer data. Activity recognition is formulated as a classification problem. Performance of base-level classifiers and meta-level classifiers is compared. Plurality Voting is found to perform consistently well across different settings.
