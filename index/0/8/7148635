Within the standard IBVS framework for control of generic robotic systems, a suitable exploitation of redundancy w.r.t. the given visual task can significantly improve the overall task execution. Indeed, redundancy can be used to avoid occlusions, joint limits, or to realize tasks that would be ill-conditioned if addressed altogether. In this respect, we propose an experimental evaluation of the performance of two redundancy resolution schemes, namely Task Priority and Task Sequencing, when adopted to realize IBVS tasks on a mobile robot equipped with a pan-tilt camera onboard.
