This paper presents a structured P2P overlay SCAN that augments CAN overlay with long links based on Kleinberg's small-world model in a <i>d</i>-dimensional Cartesian space. The construction of long links does not require the estimate of network size. Queries in multi-dimensional data space can achieve <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) hops by equipping each node with <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) long links and <i>O</i>(<i>d</i>)short links.
