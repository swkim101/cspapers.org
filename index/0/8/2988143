In this paper, a knee exoskeleton device and its Tele-Impedance based assistive control scheme is presented. The exoskeleton device is an inherently compliant actuated system that was implemented based on the series elastic actuation (SEA) to provide improved and intrinsically soft interaction behaviour. Details of the exoskeleton design are presented. A detailed musculoskeletal model was developed and experimentally identified in order to map electromyographic signals to the antagonistic muscle torques, acting on the human knee joint. The estimated muscle torques are used in order to determine the user's intent and joint stiffness trend. These reference signals are exploited by a novel Tele-Impedance controller which is applied to a knee exoskeleton device to provide assistance and stiffness augmentation to the user's knee joint. Experimental trials of a standing-up motion task were carried out for evaluation of the proposed control strategy. The results indicate that the proposed knee exoskeleton device and control scheme can effectively generate assistive actions that are intrinsically and naturally controlled by the user muscle activity.
