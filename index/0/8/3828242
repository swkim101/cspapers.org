Phrase level translation models are effective in improving translation quality by addressing the problem of local re-ordering across language boundaries. Methods that attempt to fundamentally modify the traditional IBM translation model to incorporate phrases typically do so at a prohibitive computational cost. We present a technique that begins with improved IBM models to create phrase level knowledge sources that effectively represent local as well as global phrasal context. Our method is robust to noisy alignments at both the sentence and corpus level, delivering high quality phrase level translation pairs that contribute to significant improvements in translation quality (as measured by the BLEU metric) over word based lexica as well as a competing alignment based method.
