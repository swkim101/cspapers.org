For many years now, enterprises and cloud providers have been using virtualization to run their workloads. Until recently, this means running an application in a virtual machine (hardware virtualization). However, virtual machines are increasingly replaced by containers (operating system virtualization), as evidenced by the rapid rise of Docker. A containerized software environment can generate a large amount of metadata. If properly managed, these metadata can greatly facilitate the management of containers themselves. This demonstration introduces ConHub, a PostgreSQL-based container metadata management system. Visitors will see that (1) ConHub has a language CQL that supports Docker commands; (2) it has a user-friendly interface for querying and visualizing container relationships; and (3) they can use CQL to formulate sophisticated queries to facilitate container management.
