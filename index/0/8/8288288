A new multi-layer printed circuit board routing technique is presented which combines two existing algorithms with a new cost function. The present implementation of this new technique handles up to four layers at a time. The earlier works are overviewed and enhancements incorporated in the new implementation are pointed out. Experimental results obtained using this new router on printed circuit boards of various sizes and routing densities are also described.
