A bias-voltage generator suitable for measuring a substrate leakage current is disclosed. The bias-voltage generator comprises of an oscillator, a charge-pumping circuit which is driven by the oscillator via a pumping capacitor, and a charge-pumping switch. The charge-pumping switch is connected in series with the charge-pumping circuit. The charge-pumping switch cooperates with an external electrode for controlling the ON or OFF condition of the charge pumping circuit. The charge-pumping switch is turned OFF by the external electrode becoming a floating state and a resistor employed to ensure the charge pumping switch is inoperable after the above-mentioned measurement is completed and the circuit is shipped from the factory.
