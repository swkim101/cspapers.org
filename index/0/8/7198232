In this paper we give a general analysis of dyadic, deontir logics that were introduced in the early eventies to formalize deontic reasoning about subideal behavior Recently it was observed that they are closely related to nonmonotonic logics, theories of diagnosis and dc cision theories In particular, we argue that two types of defeasibihty must be distinguished in a defeasible deontic logic overridden defeasibility that formalizes cancelling of in obligation by other conditional obligations and factual defeasibility that formalizes, overshadowing of an obligation by a violating fact We also show that this, distinction is essential for an adequate analysis of notorious 'paradoxes of deontic logic such as the Chisholm and For rester Paradoxes.
