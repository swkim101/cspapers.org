In order to design microprocessor-based application systems, several cooperating tasks have to be performed, such as the design of the skeletal process, hardware-software partitioning, design of the hardware configuration, interface design for the selected I/O devices, and generation of application specific software code. This paper presents an integrated CAD framework for automatically designing such hardware configurations and software code, to achieve the functionalities of the desired application. The design of an ECG monitoring system has been presented to illustrate the efficacy of the system.
