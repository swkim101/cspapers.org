This paper concentrates on design of a vision-based guidance command for aerial manipulation of a cylindrical object, using a stochastic model predictive approach. We first develop an image-based cylinder detection algorithm that utilizes a geometric characteristic of perspectively projected circles in 3D space. To enforce the object to be located inside sight of a camera, we formulate a visual servoing problem as a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) framework. By regarding x and y axes rotational velocities as stochastic variables, we guarantee the visibility of the camera considering underactuation of the system. We also provide experimental results that validate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
