Heap allocation with copying garbage collection is believed to have poor memory subsystem performance. We conducted a study of the memory subsystem performance of heap allocation for memory subsystems found on many machines. We found that many machines support heap allocation poorly. However, with the appropriate memory subsystem organization, heap allocation can have good memory subsystem performance.
