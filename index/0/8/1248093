However, as it is currently formulated, PLSA strictly requires the number of word latent classes to be equal to the number of document latent classes. In this paper, we propose Bi-mixture PLSA, a new formulation of PLSA that allows the number of latent word classes to be different from the number of latent document classes. We further extend Bi-mixture PLSA to incorporate the sentence information, and propose Bi-mixture PLSA with sentence bases (Bi-PLSAS) to simultaneously cluster and summarize the documents utilizing the mutual influence of the document clustering and summarization procedures. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.
