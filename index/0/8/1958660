Several coupling frameworks have been introduced in the literature to identify and measure the design complexity of object-oriented software systems. The coupling metric COF presented by the unified framework considers inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding, and direct methods of invocations to identify possible interactions in the system that contribute to the software complexity. We evaluate the COF metric in the context of Java interfaces. Interactions are identified, the effectiveness of the model is discussed, and an extension of the model is offered for more accurate measurement of complexity.
