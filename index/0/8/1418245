In this paper we introduce a classification of intrinsically compliant joint mechanisms. Furthermore, we outline design considerations for realizing such devices in order to match the requirements for robust and performant actuation. Based on this elaboration, a new design concept is presented, the DLR QA-Joint. Its performance is investigated by various experiments, covering velocity increase using the elastic energy, joint protection capabilities, and control performance.
