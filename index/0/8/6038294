Catalog management schemes affect many aspects of distributed database systems such as site autonomy, query optimization, view management, authorization mechanism, and data distribution transparency. However, the performance comparison of various catalog management schemes has received relatively little attention. Embedded read queries to the catalogs in a form of data manipulation statements are assumed to be compiled into an access module, since the module is executed repeatedly with different parameters. Update queries to the catalogs are assumed to be interpreted due to their interactive nature. The performance of the catalog management schemes measured in terms of running access modules is investigated using simulation approach in a locally distributed database system. The three alternatives studied include the centralized catalogs, the fully replicated catalogs, and the partitioned catalogs.
