We introduce the concept of a sympathetic inter$ace forcontrolling an animated synthetic character in a 3D virtualenvironment. A plush doll embedded with wireless sensors is used tomanipulate the virtual character in an iconic and intentionalmanner. The interface extends from the novel physical input devicethrough interpretation of sensor data to the behavioral brain ofthe virtual character. We discuss the design of the interface andfocus on its latest instantiation in the Swamped! exhibit atSIGGRAPH 98. We also present what we learned from hundreds ofcasual users, who ranged from young children to adults.
