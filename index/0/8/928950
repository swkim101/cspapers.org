Recently, there has been increasing interest in learning semantic parsers with indirect supervision, but existing work focuses almost exclusively on question answering. Separately, there have been active pursuits in leveraging databases for distant supervision in information extraction, yet such methods are often limited to binary relations and none can handle nested events. In this paper, we generalize distant supervision to complex knowledge extraction, by proposing the first approach to learn a semantic parser for extracting nested event structures without annotated examples, using only a database of such complex events and unannotated text. The key idea is to model the annotations as latent variables, and incorporate a prior that favors semantic parses containing known events. Experiments on the GENIA event extraction dataset show that our approach can learn from and extract complex biological pathway events. Moreover, when supplied with just five example words per event type, it becomes competitive even among supervised systems, outperforming 19 out of 24 teams that participated in the original shared task.
