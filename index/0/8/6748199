In this paper, for efficient clustering of visual image data that have arbitrary mixture distributions, we propose a simple distance metric learning method called Maximum Normalized Spacing (MNS) which is a generalized principle based on Maximum Spacing [12] and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). The proposed Normalized Spacing (NS) can be viewed as a kind of adaptive distance metric for contextual dissimilarity measure which takes into account the local distribution of the data vectors. Image clustering is a difficult task because there are multiple nonlinear manifolds embedded in the data space. Many of the existing clustering methods often fail to learn the whole structure of the multiple manifolds and they are usually not very effective. Combining both the internal and external statistics of clusters to capture the density structure of manifolds, MNS is capable of efficient and effective solving the clustering problem for the complex multi-manifold datasets in arbitrary metric spaces. We apply this MNS method into the practical problem of multi-view image clustering and obtain good results which are helpful for image browsing systems. Using the COIL-20 [19] and COIL-100 [18] multi-view image databases, our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MNS clustering method and this clustering method is more efficient than the traditional clustering methods.
