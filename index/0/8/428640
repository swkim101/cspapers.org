In a sensor spoofing attack, an adversary modifies the physical environment in a certain way so as to force an embedded system into unwanted or unintended behaviors. This usually requires a thorough understanding of the system's control logic. The conventional methods for discovering this logic are manual code inspection and experimentation. In this paper, we design a directed, compositional symbolic execution framework that targets software for the popular MSP430 family of microcontrollers. Using our framework, an analyst can generate traces of sensor readings that will drive an MSP430-based embedded system to a chosen point in its code. As a case study, we use our system to generate spoofed wireless signals used as sensor inputs into AllSee, a recently proposed low-cost gesture recognition system. We then experimentally confirm that AllSee recognizes our adversarially synthesized signals as "gestures."
