In this paper, we propose a new image-based approach using epipolar geometry. The problem which is addressed can be stated as follows: starting from a Cartesian situation, we want to drive the robot to a desired one using only image data provided during the robot motion. With regard to classical image-based visual servoing, we assume no prior knowledge about the 3D structure or about a desired image to reach. Simulation and experimental results are shown.
