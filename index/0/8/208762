The paper* discusses general approaches to using a computer for space planning problems in an architectural, urban and regional context. Programs are classified as under- and over-constrained, of the improvement- or construction-type and various techniques employed for space planning are described and illustrated. Two programs, GRASP and SETUP, are used to illustrate the space planning process. The paper concludes that there is no unique solution for space planning problems and that additional research is needed, primarily to develop a set of heuristic decision rules for internally modifying the search radius for all of the different types of space planning applications that exist.
