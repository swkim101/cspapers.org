Projector-camera (pro-cam) systems afford a wide range of interactive possibilities, combining both natural and mixed-reality 3D interaction. However, the latency inherent within these systems can cause the projection to ?slip? from any moving target, so pro-cam systems have typically shied away from truly dynamic scenarios. We explore software-only techniques to reduce latency; considering the best achievable results with widely adopted commodity devices (e.g. 30Hz depth cameras and 60Hz projectors). We achieve 50% projection alignment on objects in free flight (a 34% improvement) and 69% alignment on dynamic human movement (a 40% improvement).
