In a mobile environment where mobile applications suffer from the limitation and variation of system resources availability, it is desirable for the applications to adapt their behaviors to resource limitations and variations. It is also necessary to exploit optimal application performance. However, adaptation mechanisms by mobile applications usually suffers from the problem of unfairness to other applications, in contrast, adaptation by the operation system focuses more on the overall system performance, while neglecting the needs of individual applications. Hence, the adaptation task is best coordinated by a middleware that is able to cater for individual application's need on a fair ground, while maintaining optimal system performance. This is achieved by a context-aware mobile middleware that sits in between the mobile application and the operating environment.
