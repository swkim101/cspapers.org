Fourteen indicators that measure the frequency of lexico-syntactic phenomena linguistically related to aspectual class are applied to aspectual classification. This group of indicators is shown to improve classification performance for two aspectual distinctions, stativity and completedness (i.e., telicity), over unrestricted sets of verbs from two corpora. Several of these indicators have not previously been discovered to correlate with aspect.
