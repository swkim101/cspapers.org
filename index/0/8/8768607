In this paper we present a package for the creation of Specialized Assignments In LATEX, SAIL. We describe several features which allow an instructor to create sufficiently different instances of the “same” problem so as to encourage student cooperation without fear of plagiarism. The SAIL package also provides support for grading aids and grading automation. In addition, we describe an on-line system for archiving homework problems in a database that can be easily searched and to which new parametrized problems can be easily added. Together, the SAIL package and the searchable database of problems offer a powerful tool for generating, archiving, and retrieving homework assignments (as well as tests and quizzes).
