Although statistical retrieval models are now accepted widely, there has been little research on how to adapt them tothedemands ofhighspeed documeut filtering. The problems of document retrieval and document filtering are similar at an abstract level, but the architectures required, the optirnizations that are possible, andthecluality of the infermation available, are all different. This paper describes a new statistical document filtering system called InRoute, the problems of flteringe ffectiveness and efficiency that arise with such a system, and experiments with various solutions.
