In this paper a performance study of the access channel in a cellular mobile telephone system /1/ is presented. The method used in the Cellular System for multiplexing the population of mobile terminals over the access channel is a hybrid between the methods known as CSMA/CD and BTMA. In the paper we extend an analysis of CSMA/CD to accomodate the function of the particular random multiaccess protocol. Results are shown which illustrate the equilibrium channel performance and the approximate stability-througput-delay tradeoff. Finally an estimate of the average message delay is given.
