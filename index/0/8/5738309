The synchronized and simultaneous access to several vectors that form a single stream is typical in SIMD vector multiprocessors as well as in MIMD superscalar multiprocessors with decoupled access. In this paper we propose a block-interleaved storage scheme and an out-of-order access mechanism that allows conflict-free access to streams with an arbitrary initial address and constant stride between elements. The memory system can have any degree of unmatchness and we consider the use of either a crossbar or a multistage interconnection network. A maximal number of conflict-free families including the most commonly used strides can be obtained. We describe the hardware for address calculation and control and show that their additional costs are minimal compared with the cost of the hardware for in-order access. Finally, we evaluate the applicability of this technique to real loops from some programs of the Perfect Club and SPEC suites.
