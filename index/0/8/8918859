Resistive RAM (RRAM) is a promising non-volatile memory (NVM) device which can replace traditional SRAM as on-chip storage for logic and data in FPGAs. While RRAM outperforms SRAM by offering high scalability, low leakage power, and near-zero power-on delay, RRAM-FPGAs have limited programming cycles, and different writes frequencies of memory and logic blocks make the challenge more severe. To overcome this endurance challenge, we propose an age-aware placement framework for RRAM-FPGAs with uniform reconfigurable logic/memory units. The framework, consisting of a dynamic reconfiguration region allocation algorithm and a logic/memory co-placement algorithm, balances write distributions across the entire FPGA according to logic and memory write frequency differences. The proposed algorithms have been integrated into the VTR synthesis flow. Experiments show that the framework achieves 94.9% write reduction, thus effectively extending RRAM-FPGA programming cycles.
