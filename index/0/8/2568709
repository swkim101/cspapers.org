Despite the growing interest in NLP focused on the Brazilian Portuguese language in recent years, its obvious counterpart -- Natural Language Generation (NLG) -- remains in that case a little-explored research field. In this paper we describe preliminary results of a first project of this kind, addressing the issue of surface realization for Brazilian Portuguese. Our approach, which may be particularly suitable to simpler NLG applications in which a domain corpus of the most likely output sentences happens to be available, is in principle adaptable to many closely-related languages, and paves the way to further NLG research focused on Romance languages in general.
