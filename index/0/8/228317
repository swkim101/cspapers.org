The reliability of flash-memory chips has dropped dramatically in recent years. In order to solve this problem, a reliable memory technology device (MTD) design is proposed to address this concern at the device driver layer so as to release the design complexity of flash-memory management software/firmware and to improve the maintainability and portability of flash management designs for existing and future products. The proposed design was evaluated through a series of experiments based on realistic traces to show that the proposed approach could significantly improve the reliability of flash memory with limited overheads.
