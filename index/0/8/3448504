It has been long established that discrete structures is an important and foundational component of the computer science curriculum. However, the topics covered in this course tend to be more abstract than those covered in most other introductory computer science courses. This leads to additional challenges for instructors and students. To deal with these challenges, we introduce a new pedagogy for teaching this course. Our approach is based on a variant of the flipped classroom paradigm and is comprised of four main components: before class preparatory work, in-class mini lecture, in-class team based problem solving activities, and weekly individual assignments. In this paper, we discuss these components in detail. Our approach is informed by several cutting-edge teaching methodologies including active learning, light weight teams, and gamification. We conclude the paper by discussing the results of a survey taken by the students and a summary of the grades attained in the class. These show that our approach was well received by the students and has led to good learning outcomes.
