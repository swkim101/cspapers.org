Leakage of private information from web applications— even when the traffic is encrypted—is a major security threat to many applications that use HTTP for data delivery. This paper considers the problem of inferring from encrypted HTTP traffic the web sites or web pages visited by a user. Existing browser-side approaches to this problem cannot defend against more advanced attacks, and serverside approaches usually require modifications to web entities, such as browsers, servers, or web objects. In this paper, we propose a novel browser-side system, namely HTTPOS, to prevent information leaks and offer much better scalability and flexibility. HTTPOS provides a comprehensive and configurable suite of traffic transformation techniques for a browser to defeat traffic analysis without requiring any server-side modifications. Extensive evaluation of HTTPOS on live web traffic shows that it can successfully prevent the state-of-the-art attacks from inferring private information from encrypted HTTP flows.
