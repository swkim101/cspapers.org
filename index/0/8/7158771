Recent years have seen an explosion of work in automated program repair. While previous work has focused exclusively on tools for single languages, recent work in multi-language transformation has opened the door for multi-language program repair tools. Evaluating the performance of such a tool requires having a benchmark set of similar buggy programs in different languages. We present QuixBugs, consisting of 40 programs translated to both Python and Java, each with a bug on a single line. The QuixBugs benchmark suite is based on problems from the Quixey Challenge, where programmers were given a short buggy program and 1 minute to fix the bug.
