Female software developers account for only a small portion of the total developer community. This inequality is caused by subtle beliefs and sometimes interactions between different genders and society, referred to as implicit biases and explicit behavior, respectively. In this study, I mined user contribution acceptance from a popular software collaboration service. The contributions of female developers were accepted into open-source projects with roughly equivalent success to those of males, partially discounting recent findings that explicit behavior accompanies implicit gender bias, while bolstering the claim that implicit bias is cultural, rather than as a result of innate differences.
