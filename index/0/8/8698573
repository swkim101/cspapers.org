User defined trajectories are often planned by neglecting the manipulator physical limits. In order to avoid stability problems and to guarantee an accurate path tracking, it is therefore necessary to equip the robot controllers with appropriate scaling mechanisms, that properly slow down assigned trajectories. In the paper, a recently proposed scaling strategy is revised in order to analyze and solve some feasibility issues that could arise on actual systems. The reliability of the proposed approach is tested against an actual 2D planar manipulator.
