Multiprocessors require an interconnection network to connect processors with memory modules. The performance of the interconnection network can have a large effect upon overall system performance, and, therefore, methods are needed to model and compare alternative network architectures.
This paper is concerned with evaluating the performance of multistage interconnection networks consisting of k Ã— s switching elements. Examples of such networks include omega, binary n-cube and baseline networks. We consider clocked, packet switched networks with buffers at switch output ports. An analytical model based on approximate Mean Value Analysis is developed, then validated through simulations.
