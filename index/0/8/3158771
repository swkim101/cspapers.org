This paper presents a systematic flight controller design based on the mathematics of parametrized manifolds and calculus of variations for the Bat Bot (B2), which possesses many articulated wings. Wing kinematics and morphological properties are crucial in the powered flight of flying vertebrates. The articulated skeleton of these mammals, which contains many degrees of actuation and underactuation, has made it difficult to understand the connection between the bat's flight dynamics and its intricate array of physiological and morphological specializations. B2 is a biomimetic micro aerial vehicle (MAV) that possesses similar morphological properties to a bat in order to duplicate bats powered ballistic motion. In an effort to design the advanced flight control algorithm for B2, this paper reports two major contributions. First, a systematic mathematical framework is introduced that evaluates the holonomically-constrained Lagrangian model of a flapping robot with specified active and passive degrees of freedom (DoF) in order to locate physically feasible and biologically meaningful periodic solutions using optimization. These are parametrized constraint manifolds; the flapping wing dynamics are governed by these manifolds. Second, calculus of variations and the well-recognized method of inverse dynamics are applied in order to synthesize the flight control algorithm for the flapping wings.
