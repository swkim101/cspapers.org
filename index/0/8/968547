In this study we consider optimal opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) policies for a transmitter in a multichannel wireless system, where a channel can be in one of multiple states. Each channel state is associated with either a probability of transmission success or a transmission rate. In such systems, the transmitter typically has partial information concerning the channel states, but can deduce more by probing individual channels, e.g. by sending control packets in the channels, at the expense of certain resources, e.g., energy and time. The main goal of this work is to derive optimal strategies for determining which channels to probe (in what sequence) and which channel to use for transmission. We consider two problems within this context,allthe constant data time (CDT) and the constant access time (CAT) problems. For both problems, we derive key structural properties of the corresponding optimal strategy. In particular, we show that it has a threshold structure and can be described by an index policy. We further show that the optimal CDT strategy can only take on one of three structural forms. Using these results we present a two-step lookahead CDT (CAT) strategy. This strategy is shown to be optimal for a number of cases of practical interest. We examine its performance under a class of practical channel models via numerical studies.
