Genetic programming (GP) is an automatic programming technique that has recently been applied to a wide range of problems including blocks-world planning. This paper describes a series of illustrative experiments in which GP techniques are applied to traditional blocks-world planning problems. We discuss genetic planning in the context of traditional AI planning systems, and comment on the costs and benefits to be expected from further work.
