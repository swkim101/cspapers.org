We propose a novel technique that aggregates multiple sensor streams generated by totally different types of sensors into a visually enhanced video stream. This paper shows major features of SENSeTREAM and demonstrates enhancement of user experience in an online live music event. Since SENSeTREAM is a video stream with sensor values encoded in a two-dimensional graphical code, it can transmit multiple sensor data streams while maintaining their synchronization. A SENSeTREAM can be transmitted via existing live streaming services, and can be saved into existing video archive services. We have implemented a prototype SENSeTREAM generator and deployed it to an online live music event. Through the pilot study, we confirmed that SENSeTREAM works with popular streaming services, and provide a new media experience for live performances. We also indicate future direction for establishing visual stream aggregation and its applications.
