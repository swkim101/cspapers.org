This paper presents a novel approach to determine textual similarity. A layered methodology to transform text into logic forms is proposed, and semantic features are derived from a logic prover. Experimental results show that incorporating the semantic structure of sentences is beneficial. When training data is unavailable, scores obtained from the logic prover in an unsupervised manner outperform supervised methods.
