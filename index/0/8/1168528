Efficient algorithms are given for the bidirected network flow problem and the degree-constrained subgraph problem. Four versions of each are solved, depending on whether edge capacities/multiplicities are one or arbitrary, and whether maximum value/maximum cardinality or minimum cost/maximum weight is the objective. A version of the shortest path problem is also efficiently solved. The algorithms use a reduction technique that solves one problem instance by reducing to a number of problems.
