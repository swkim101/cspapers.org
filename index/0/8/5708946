Comparison of the polynomial-time-bounded reducibilities introduced by Cook [1] and Karp [4] leads naturally to the definition of several intermediate truth-table reducibilities. We give definitions and comparisons for these reducibilities; we note, in particular, that all reducibilities of this type which do not have obvious implication relationships are in fact distinct in a strong sense. Proofs are by simultaneous diagonalization and encoding constructions.
 Work of Meyer and Stockmeyer [7] and Gill [2] then leads us to define nondeterministic versions of all of our reducibilities. Although many of the definitions degenerate, comparison of the remaining nondeterministic reducibilities among themselves and with the corresponding deterministic reducibilities yields some interesting relationships.
