Searching data streams has been traditionally very limited, either in the complexity of the search or in the size of the searched dataset. In this paper, we investigate the design and optimization of constructs that enable SQL to express complex patterns. In particular we propose the RSPS (recursive sequential pattern search) algorithm which exploits the inter-dependencies between the elements of a sequential pattern to minimize repeated passes over the same data. Performance gains derived experimental results show impressive speedup up to 100 times.
