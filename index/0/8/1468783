Group meetings and other non-desk situations require that people be able to interact at a distance from a display surface. This paper describes a technique using a laser pointer and a camera to accomplish just such interactions. Calibration techniques are given to synchronize the display and camera coordinates. A series of interactive techniques are described for navigation and entry of numbers, times, dates, text, enumerations and lists of items. The issues of hand jitter, detection error, slow sampling and latency are discussed in each of the interactive techniques.
