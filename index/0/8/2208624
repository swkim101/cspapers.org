We discuss approximation algorithms for the coloring problem and the maximum independent set problem in 3-uniform hypergraphs. An algorithm for coloring ˜ 1 5 Ž. 3-uniform 2-colorable hypergraphs in On colors is presented, improving previously known results. Also, for every fixed 12, we describe an algorithm that, given a 3-uniform hypergraph H on n vertices with an independent set of size ˜ 63 ŽŽ .. n, finds an independent set of size min n, n . For certain values of we are able to improve this using the local ratio approach. The results are obtained through semidefinite programming relaxations of these optimization problems. 2001 Academic Press
