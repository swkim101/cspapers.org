YAGO [9, 6] is one of the largest public ontologies constructed by information extraction. In a recent refactoring called YAGO2s, the system has been given a modular and completely transparent architecture. In this demo, users can see how more than 30 individual modules of YAGO work in parallel to extract facts, to check facts for their correctness, to deduce facts, and to merge facts from different sources. A GUI allows users to play with different input files, to trace the provenance of individual facts to their sources, to change deduction rules, and to run individual extractors. Users can see step by step how the extractors work together to combine the individual facts to the coherent whole of the YAGO ontology.
