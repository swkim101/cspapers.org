Speaker name recognition plays an important role in many spoken language applications, such as rich transcription, information extraction, question answering, and opinion mining. In this paper, we developed an SVM-based classification framework to determine the speaker names for those included speech segments in broadcast news speech, called soundbites. We evaluated a variety of features with different feature selection strategies. Experiments on Mandarin broadcast news speech show that using our proposed approach, the soundbite speaker name recognition (SSNR) accuracy is 68.9% on our blind test set, an absolute 10% improvement compared to a baseline system, which chooses the person name closest to the soundbite.
