Computational neurolinguistics (CN) is an approach to computational linguistics which includes neurally-motivated constraints in the design of models of natural language processing. Furthermore, the knowledge representations included in such models must be supported with documented behaviorial evidence, normal and pathological.This paper will discuss the contribution of CN models to the understanding of linguistic "competence" within recent research efforts to adapt HOPE (Gigley 1981; 1982a; 1982b; 1982c; 1983a), an implemented CN model for "understanding" English to l'ESPERANCE, one which "understands" French.
