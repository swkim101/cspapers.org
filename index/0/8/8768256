We propose a novel approach to automatically growing and pruning Hierarchical Mixtures of Experts. The constructive algorithm proposed here enables large hierarchies consisting of several hundred experts to be trained effectively. We show that HME's trained by our automatic growing procedure yield better generalization performance than traditional static and balanced hierarchies. Evaluation of the algorithm is performed (1) on vowel classification and (2) within a hybrid version of the JANUS [9] speech recognition system using a subset of the Switchboard large-vocabulary speaker-independent continuous speech recognition database.
