The primary focus of this work is to experimentally explore a method for determining three dimensional surface shape from intensity information. A method is developed. using existent theory, for determining the shape of visually textured surfaces exhibiting varying degrees of specularity. The photometric stereo is extended to four source photometry as the basis for this work. The reflectance map approach for determining surface normals is shown to be of little value in this context and a more direct method of computing these normals is used.
