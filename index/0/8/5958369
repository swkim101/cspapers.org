As the cloud computing market continues to grow, the cloud platform is becoming an attractive target for attackers to disrupt services and steal data, and to compromise resources to launch attacks. In this paper, using three months of NetFlow data in 2013 from a large cloud provider, we present the first large-scale characterization of inbound attacks towards the cloud and outbound attacks from the cloud. We investigate nine types of attacks ranging from network-level attacks such as DDoS to application-level attacks such as SQL injection and spam. Our analysis covers the complexity, intensity, duration, and distribution of these attacks, highlighting the key challenges in defending against attacks in the cloud. By characterizing the diversity of cloud attacks, we aim to motivate the research community towards improving future security solutions for cloud systems.
