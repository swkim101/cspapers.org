The user interface for distributed computing environment needs several kinds of transparency for resources which are distributed on many sites connected to the network. Access transparency and location transparency are general concept for distributed resources.
In distributed environment, there are many resources of the same functions in various sites. For example, cashed resources which are complete duplicated resources exist on many sites in order to realize high performance.
In this paper, the resource management scheme in the distributed environment is described. The sophisticated semantics transparency which is a general scheme for manipulating duplicated resources in distributed environment is provided. The specification language for the environment which provides semantics transparency is also discussed.
