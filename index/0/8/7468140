This paper describes a preliminary attempt to apply organizational principles taken from animal perceptual processes to the problem of providing a robot visual qrasp reflex. The goal is to provide a cheap, rapid mechanism for directinq a hand/arm to grasp one of several arbitrarily shaped objects in the visual scene. A proqram which implements a simple form of such a reflex is described.
