INTRODUCTION The AMODEUS project (Assimilating Models Of DEsign, User and System) [3] aims to investigate how various kinds of modelling approaches – for modelling the user, modelling the system, and modelling design – can be integrated into HCI design. The approaches represented in the project draw on different parent disciplines, including Cognitive Science and Computer Science. The project recently undertook an exercise adapted from the scenarios methodology described in [6], in which a matrix is formed by crossing different modelling approaches with a number of scenarios in order to probe and compare the different modelling techniques. Of the five main modelling approaches represented within the project, two focus on system aspects (Coutaz and Harrison), two on user aspects (Barnard and Young) and one on representing design (MacLean). These approaches are described briefly under the panellist’s position statements. An agreed set of five behavioral scenarios (descriptions of fragments of user-system behaviour exemplifying a phenomenon supported by empirical data) and, more briefly, two design scenarios (descriptions of questions that could arise during interface design) were analysed by each of the approaches. Further details on scenario sampling are given below; brief descriptions of Lhe two scenarios to be discussed in the session are presented in an Appendix. The outcome of the scenario methodology exercise, consisting of five individual analyses of each of five behavioral scenarios, is a body of material that provides a basis for understanding better the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, their interrelationships and patterns of complementarily, In the panel, the participants will briefly outline their approach and present the highlights of how it fared with two of the scenarios. The Moderator will then summarise the approach to analysing the outputs from the models, the utility of the methodology and the lessons learned from the exercise.
