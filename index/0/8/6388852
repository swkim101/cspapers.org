It has become increasingly popular to use mobile social networking applications for weight loss and management. Users can not only create profiles and maintain their records but also perform a variety of social activities that shatter the barrier to share or seek information. Due to the open and connected nature, these applications produce massive data that consists of rich weight-related information which offers immense opportunities for us to enable advanced research on weight loss. In this paper, we conduct the initial investigation to understand weight loss with a large-scale mobile social networking dataset with near 10 million users. In particular, we study individual and social factors related to weight loss and reveal a number of interesting findings that help us build a meaningful model to predict weight loss automatically. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the significance of social factors in weight loss.
