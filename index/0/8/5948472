The encoding is based on a combination of sophisticated MBD preprocessing algorithms and SAT compilation techniques which together provide concise CNF formula. Experimental evidence indicates that our approach is superior to all published algorithms for minimal cardinality MBD. In particular, we can determine, for the first time, minimal cardinality diagnoses for the entire standard ISCAS-85 benchmark. Our results open the way to improve the state-of-the-art on a range of similar MBD problems.
