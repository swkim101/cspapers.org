In the context of increasing pressure to adopt global approaches to software development, the importance of teaching skills for geographically distributed software development (GSD) becomes essential. This paper reports the experience of teaching a course to prepare graduates for software engineering (SE) in global customer-developer teams, and which was taught in three-University collaboration (Canada, Australia and Italy). The course emphasized the learning of requirements management activities in frequent synchronous computer-mediated client-developer relationships and created a GSD environment with significant time zone and language differences. We describe our instructional approach and assessment strategies within a GSD instructional design framework which integrates (a) required GSD skills and strategies for aligning classroom projects with contemporary and authentic GSD conditions, (b) strategies for assessment of learning of GSD skills and (c) examples from our GSD course.
