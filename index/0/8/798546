Separation of Duty (SoD) is widely considered to be a fundamental principle in computer security. A Static SoD (SSoD) policy states that in order to have all permissions necessary to complete a sensitive task, the cooperation of at least a certain number of users is required. In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Statically Mutually Exclusive Role (SMER) constraints are used to enforce SSoD policies. In this paper, we pose and answer fundamental questions related to the use of SMER constraints to enforce SSoD policies. We show that directly enforcing SSoD policies is intractable (<b>coNP</b>-complete), while checking whether an RBAC state satisfies a set of SMER constraints is efficient. Also, we show that verifying whether a given set of SMER constraints enforces an SSoD policy is intractable (<b>coNP</b>-complete) and discuss why this intractability result should not lead us to conclude that SMER constraints are not an appropriate mechanism for enforcing SSoD policies.
 We show also how to generate SMER constraints that are as accurate as possible for enforcing an SSoD policy.
