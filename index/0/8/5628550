In this paper, we discuss interactions between XP (eXtreme Programming) practices. We discuss 2 case studies of introducing XP practices selectively from the 13 practices which are defined in XP, and we analyze how to select practices. Our analysis is based on interviews with developers. While it is difficult to introduce all the XP practices at once, our knowledge makes it easier to determine more effective combinations of practices.
