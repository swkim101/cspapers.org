The Department of Fish and Game keeps observational sites in remote locations for such purposes as counting fish, measuring weather, and various research projects. In Alaska, fishing and natural tourism are vital to the economy of the state, making these measurements all the more important. However, due to large geographic spread with little transportation infrastructure (none, between many villages), helicopters must be used to visit these sites. It is extremely expensive, primarily in fuel costs, to fly helicopters all over the state, so optimal or near-optimal routing of these helicopters is paramount. Currently, the “by-eye” technique is used, in which a route is chosen that simply looks like it would have the lowest total distance.
