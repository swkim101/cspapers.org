We investigate the testing of hierarchical (modular) systems, in which individual modules are modeled by finite state machines. Given a hierarchical system, we are interested in finding a small set of tests that exercises all the transitions of the system. We present tight approximation algorithms and hardness results for the problem. Our techniques extend to other criteria and metrics.
