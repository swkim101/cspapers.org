A new instructional television series for a beginning computer programming course was prepared, using a new format that was designed to be both informative (presented in a well organized, meaningful, clear, and concise manner) and interesting (gaining and maintaining close attention) and making use of special capabilities of the television medium. A television series so designed can overcome to a large extent the negative attitudes of students toward the use of instructional television.
