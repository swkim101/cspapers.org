Computer Science education in the K-12 school system is in the forefront of education news. Schools, districts, and states are looking for guidance in developing and delivering standards-based computer science curriculum in K-12 schools, and many are turning to the CSTA standards. The CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards have been revised and align to the K-12 CS Framework. The standards delineate what CS concepts students are to know and what CS practices students are to be able to do at the various grade levels. President Obama and the OSTP have initiated a widely supported Computer Science for all initiative for K-12 education in the US. How do the newly revised CSTA K-12 CS Standards support the CS for All initiative? How can the standards be used by individual teachers, curriculum developers, and administrators to develop their K-12 Computer Science Education program? This BOF will provide a forum for participants to share how they are using the CSTA standards and what successes and challenges they have encountered.
