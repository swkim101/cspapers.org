Speed and accuracy are fundamental simulation requirements. Simulation is not worthwhile without adequate accuracy, and massive simulations and fault simulations are impossible without adequate speed. Accuracy requirements for simulation are a sufficient repertoire of nodal states, quantitative timing, and, most importantly, adequate structural detail. A variety of techniques have provided speed for simulation, but additional speed is needed.
