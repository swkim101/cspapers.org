In this paper we present the Infocious Web search engine [23]. Our goal in creating Infocious is to improve the way people find information on the Web by resolving ambiguities present in natural language text. This is achieved by performing linguistic analysis on the content of the Web pages we index, which is a departure from existing Web search engines that return results mainly based on keyword matching. This additional step of linguistic processing gives Infocious two main advantages. First, Infocious gains a deeper understanding of the content of Web pages so it can better match users' queries with indexed documents and therefore can improve relevancy of the returned results. Second, based on its linguistic processing, Infocious can organize and present the results to the user in more intuitive ways. In this paper we present the linguistic processing technologies that we incorporated in Infocious and how they are applied in helping users find information on the Web more efficiently. We discuss the various components in the architecture of Infocious and how each of them benefits from the added linguistic processing. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the performance of a component which leverages linguistic information in order to categorize Web pages.
