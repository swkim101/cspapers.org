We describe an intelligent tutor for LISP programming. This tutor achieves a set of pedagogical objectives derived from Anderson's (1983) learning theory provide instruction in the context of problem-solving, have the student generate as much of each solution as possible, provide immediate feedback on errors, and represent the goal structure of the problem-solving. The tutorial interface facilitates communication and prevents distracting low-level errors Field tests of the tutor in college classes demonstrate that it is more effective than conventional classroom instruction.
