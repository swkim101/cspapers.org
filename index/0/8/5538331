The mechanism design and the fundamental concepts of the dinosaur-like robot called TITRUS-II are reported. It is based on practical concepts so that it can be applied in the real world. The design features include: 1) realizing high dynamic stability by using a neck and a tail as an active damper when the robot walks; 2) standing with the tail to compose a stable supporting triangle so that the robot can work stably; and 3) enabling it to do various tasks by applying a manipulator as a neck. The mechanism of the legs is also distinctive, using a coupled drive to compose four degrees of freedom.
