In this article we present a mathematical model of a spincopter - an inherently stable and easy to control unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Although the devised model represents only the first approximation of spincopter's physics, it captures basic phenomena that are sufficient for derivation and testing of a simple control algorithm. Results obtained by simulations in Simulink速, presented herein, demonstrate efficient performance of the proposed simple controller structure. Further tests, including investigation of complex aerodynamics effects and hardware-specified limitations, have been done using X-Plane速 software package. Finally, the proposed controller has been tested experimentally. Both, X-Plane速 and experimental results confirmed the outcome from Simulink速.
