In this paper, we present a Chinese event extraction system. We point out a language specific issue in Chinese trigger labeling, and then commit to discussing the contributions of lexical, syntactic and semantic features applied in trigger labeling and argument labeling. As a result, we achieved competitive performance, specifically, F-measure of 59.9 in trigger labeling and F-measure of 43.8 in argument labeling.
