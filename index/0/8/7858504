Ford and Fulkerson’s original 1956 max flow/min cut paper formulated max flow in terms of flows on paths, rather than the more familiar flows on arcs. In 1974 Hoffman pointed out that Ford and FuIkerson’s original proof was quite abstract, and. applied to a wide range of max flow-like problems. In this abstract model we have capacitated elements, and linearly ordered subsets of elements called paths. When two Daths share an element (“cross”). then there must be a paih that is a subset of t&e first ‘iath up to the cross, and a subset of the second path after the cross. (Hoffman’s neneralization of1 Ford and Fulkerson’s oroof showed that The max ilow m& 4 cut theorem still hold’s under this weak assumption. owever, this proof is non-constructive. To get an algorithm, we assume that we have an oracle whose input is an arbitrary subset of elements, and whose output is either a path contained in that subset, or the statement that no such path exists. We then use complementary slackness to shbw how to augment any feasible set of oath flows to a set with a strictlv lamer total flow value us&g a polynomial number of calls io thi oracle. Then standard scaling techniques yield an overall polynomial algorithm for finding both a max flow and a min cut. Hoffman’s paper actually considers a sort of supermod&r obiective on the oath flows. which allows him to include transportation proble-ms and this min-cost flow in his framework. We also discuss extending our algorithm to this more general ~88x3.
