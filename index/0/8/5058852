We present a novel probabilistic method for topic segmentation on unstructured text. One previous approach to this problem utilizes the hidden Markov model (HMM) method for probabilistically modeling sequence data [7]. The HMM treats a document as mutually independent sets of words generated by a latent topic variable in a time series. We extend this idea by embedding Hofmann's aspect model for text [5] into the segmenting HMM to form an aspect HMM (AHMM). In doing so, we provide an intuitive topical dependency between words and a cohesive segmentation model. We apply this method to segment unbroken streams of New York Times articles as well as noisy transcripts of radio programs on SpeechBot, an online audio archive indexed by an automatic speech recognition engine. We provide experimental comparisons which show that the AHMM outperforms the HMM for this task.
