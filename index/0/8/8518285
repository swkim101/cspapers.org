We give a survey of the ParInt project for Parallel/ distributed Integration. We analyze the \generic" distributed adaptive integration algorithm and modify it to retain an e(cid:14)cient distribution of the global work load over the processors. With this goal we consider a distributed adaptive integration method based on a global heap priority queue, which remains load balanced and assures that the subregions are processed according to their (global) priority (size of error); as well as a local heap priority queue enhanced by receiver-initiated or neighbor load balancing. We report results of these methods.
