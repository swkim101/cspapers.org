In this paper, we propose a method for assessing the quality of Wikipedia editors. By effectively determining whether the text meaning persists over time, we can determine the actual contribution by editors. This is used in this paper to detect vandal. However, the meaning of text does not always change if a term in the text is added or removed. Therefore, we cannot capture the changes of text meaning automatically, so we cannot detect whether the meaning of text survives or not. To solve this problem, we use crowdsourcing to manually detect changes of text meaning. In our experiment, we confirmed that our proposed method improves the accuracy of detecting vandals by about 5%.
