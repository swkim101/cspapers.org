We give necessary and sufficient conditions for uniqueness of the support vector solution for the problems of pattern recognition and regression estimation, for a general class of cost functions. We show that if the solution is not unique, all support vectors are necessarily at bound, and we give some simple examples of non-unique solutions. We note that uniqueness of the primal (dual) solution does not necessarily imply uniqueness of the dual (primal) solution. We show how to compute the threshold b when the solution is unique, but when all support vectors are at bound, in which case the usual method for determining b does not work.
