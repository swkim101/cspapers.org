Interactive wearable devices bring dramatic changes to apps and hardware, leaving operating system (OS) design in the mist. To this end, we thoroughly examine the execution efficiency of Android Wear, a popular wearable OS. By running a suite of fifteen benchmarks, we profile four system aspects: CPU usage, idle episodes, thread-level parallelism, and microarchitectural behaviors. We present the discovered inefficiencies and their root causes, together with a series of widespread, yet unknown OS design flaws. Towards designing future wearable OSes, our study has yielded a generic lesson, key insights, and specific action items.
