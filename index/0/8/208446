DTLâ€™s DataSpot is a database publishing tool that enables non-technical end users to explore a database using free-form plain language queries combined with hypertext navigation. DataSpot is based on a novel representation of data in the form of a schema-less semi-structured graph called a hyperbase. The DataSpot Publisher takes one or more possibly heterogeneous databases, predefined knowledge banks such as a thesaurus, and userdefined associations, and creates the hyperbase. The DataSpot Search Server performs searches and navigation against the hyperbase, returning answers to the user either in HTML pages or through an object API. The DataSpot product has been successfilly deployed in diverse application areas including electronic catalogs, yellow pages, classified ads, help desks and finance.
