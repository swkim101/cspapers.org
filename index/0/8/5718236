Challenging the implicit reliance on document collections, this paper discusses the pros and cons of using query logs rather than document collections, as self-contained sources of data in textual information extraction. The differences are quantified as part of a large-scale study on extracting prominent attributes or quantifiable properties of classes (e.g., top speed, price and fuel consumption for CarModel) from unstructured text. In a head-to-head qualitative comparison, a lightweight extraction method produces class attributes that are 45% more accurate on average, when acquired from query logs rather than Web documents.
