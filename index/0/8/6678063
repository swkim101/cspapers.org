The Microsoft Kinect® provides a low-cost solution for measuring distance; however, it has poor performance in bright light conditions. The focus of this project is to design a system to autonomously adjust a pair of polarizing filters in order to effectively utilize the Kinect®'s depth measurement capabilities in different lighting conditions, including outdoor applications. A system designed to dynamically change the orientation of the polarizing filters to select the optimal depth image, without manual adjustment, is the novel contribution of this work. Our approach involves a feedback loop that allows the system to autonomously determine which filter position results in the best image and rotates the filter automatically. Furthermore, the system can perform these tasks periodically over time as light conditions change. This system captured images of objects at various distances from the sensor in different lighting conditions to determine the system performance. Our experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of dynamically adjusted polarization filters to actively select the best depth image, even in environments challenging for the Kinect®.
