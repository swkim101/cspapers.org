This paper presents a new navigation method for mobile robots, based on direct kinematics model and predictive control approach. It is adaptable to all types of robots taking into account their specific constraints. The research of the optimal trajectory is shifted in the continuous parameters space, which enables the exploitation of all of the robot's capabilities. The use of a stochastic algorithm enables the determination of obstacle bypass trajectories, and simulation results show that the navigation in cluttered environment is improved.
