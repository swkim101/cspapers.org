We propose a database logic which accounts in a clean declarative fashion for most of the “object-oriented” features such as object identity, complex objects, inheritance, methods, etc. Furthermore, database schema is part of the object language, which allows the user to browse schema and data using the same declarative formalism. The proposed logic has a formal semantics and a sound and complete resolution-based proof procedure, which makes it also computationally attractive.
