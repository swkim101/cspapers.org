The last twenty years have seen enormous leaps forward in computers' abilities to generate sound and video. What happens when computers can produce scents on demand? In this talk, I present three approaches to this question. I first look at human olfactory processing: what is our olfactory bandwidth, and what are the limitations of our sense of smell? I then explore the use of scent to accompany other media, from historical examples like Sense-o-Rama and Aromarama, to more recent work including firefighter training systems, augmented gaming, and food and beverage applications. Finally, I look at the possibilities of olfactory output as an ambient display medium. I conclude with an overview of current computer-controlled olfactory output devices: off the shelf solutions for incorporating scent into user interface applications.
