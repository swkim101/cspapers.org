A new scheme for iterative clipping and filtering (ICF) method is proposed for PAPR (peak-to-average power ratio) reduction of OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexed) signals. The proposed one-iteration-clipping-filtering (OICF) scheme achieves target PAPR in one iteration, instead of K (>1) iterations as in conventional ICF method. An empirical expression is derived to scale original clipping threshold so that the target PAPR can be achieved in first iteration.
