Peer review is widely recognized for advancing student learning, in particular for developing reflective processes like critical thinking. The classroom is ripe for peer review because the subject matter is fresh and in-depth interactivity is possible. Yet the limited time available in class conflicts with peer review's deliberative nature. We hypothesize that peer review -- at least the initial stages of it -- can be supported in the classroom with tools for facilitating the rapid identification of interesting issues for discussion. The potential benefits of such a tool include: furthering the student-focus of in-class active learning activities, further implanting critical analysis skills through frequent in-class use, supporting immediate feedback, and enabling comparison of student and instructor-modeled critical analysis.This paper explores tool support for in-class lightweight preliminary peer-review (LPPR): peer review that is instigated in the classroom, but does not necessarily end there. We proposed that students classify peer solutions in 4 dimensions: correctness, comprehension (e.g., "do I understand this solution"), worthiness for discussion, and similarity to the evaluator's own solution. We designed an LPPR extension to Ubiquitous Presenter, and then conducted an exploratory study in a mock classroom setting. We found that LPPR can quickly identify a subset of student solutions that warrant immediate discussion, and that modest amounts of reflection arise from the LPPR process.
