Online learning, defined broadly as recording and delivering classroom experience with technology, has tremendous potential. However, success to date has been very limited in science and engineering. We believe this is because traditional video recording is cumbersome and not suitable for technical lectures and removing live classroom interaction is detrimental to learning. Employing Tablet PCs with slide presentation software has made it simple and convenient to develop and record high quality lectures. We employ such videos in a hybrid model of coursework. All lectures are made available as online videos, but limited classroom interaction is an important component; the classroom is used for review of lecture material, examinations, demonstrations, tutorials, and hands-on sessions. The hybrid framework is particularly suitable for students with logistical difficulties, e.g., because of work schedule. This paper is an evaluation of the hybrid learning approach as applied to upper level computer science coursework. We report our experience in teaching a suite of hybrid courses at the University of Houston and discuss the detailed feedback we received from the students who participated in the courses.
