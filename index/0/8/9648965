This paper examines the various manifestations of input-expectation discrepancy that occurs in a broad spectrum of research on intelligent behavior. It makes the point that each of the different research activities highlights different aspects of an input-expectation reduction mechanism and neglects others. 
 
A comprehensive view of this mechanism has been constructed and applied in the design of a cognitive industrial robot. The mechanism is explained as both a key for machine learning strategies, and a guide for the selection of appropriate memory structures to support intelligent behavior.
