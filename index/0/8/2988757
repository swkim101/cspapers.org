This paper presents a novel approach to generate implicit key phrases which are ignored in previous researches. Recent researches prefer to extract key phrases with semi-supervised transductive learning methods, which avoid the problem of training data. In this paper, based on a transductive learning method, we formulate the phrases in the document as a hypergraph and expand the hypergraph to include implicit phrases, which are ranked by an inductive learning approach. The highest ranked phrases are seen as implicit key phrases, and experimental results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of this approach.
