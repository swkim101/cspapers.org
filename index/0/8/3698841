Driving through a constantly changing environment is one of the main challenges of autonomous driving. To navigate successfully, the vehicle should be able to handle a variety of possible situations on the road by constantly analyzing the traffic environment and determine which objects might influence its current behavior. This paper presents an artificial intelligence method to improve the perception and situation awareness of autonomous vehicles by detecting and extracting meaningful information from different traffic scenarios, and inferring the correct driving behavior for each of them. Our method uses a state of the art technique based on semantic reasoning previously used for recognizing human activities in cooking scenarios. This algorithm has been adapted and extended to the automotive domain by introducing new object properties such as ObjectInFront, ObjectActedOn, MoveForward, Turn. The main advantage of our proposed method is its adaptability to different mobile domains without any additional training. First, our system is trained on traffic situations. The obtained semantic models are later used to autonomously navigate a mobile robot in an indoor environment by utilizing the acquired knowledge and inference from the automotive domain. The results show that the overall positive classification rate for traffic scenarios recognition is 90.14% of the cases. In addition, the average processing and behavior generation time for the implemented system is 0.177 seconds, which allows the mobile robot to react online to the newly encountered situations.
