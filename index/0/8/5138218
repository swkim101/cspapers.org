We define a connection subgraph as a small subgraph of a large graph that best captures the relationship between two nodes. The primary motivation for this work is to provide a paradigm for exploration and knowledge discovery in large social networks graphs. We present a formal definition of this problem, and an ideal solution based on electricity analogues. We then show how to accelerate the computations, to produce approximate, but high-quality connection subgraphs in real time on very large (disk resident) graphs.We describe our operational prototype, and we demonstrate results on a social network graph derived from the World Wide Web. Our graph contains 15 million nodes and 96 million edges, and our system still produces quality responses within seconds.
