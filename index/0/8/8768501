This research is intended to automatically detect emergent behaviors of scenario based Distributed Software Systems (DSS) in design phase. The direct significance of our work is reducing the cost of verifying DSS for unexpected behavior in execution time. Existing approaches have some drawbacks which we try to cover in our work. The main contributions are modeling the DSS components as a social network and not using behavioral modeling, detecting components with no emergent behavior, and investigating the interactions of instances of one type.
