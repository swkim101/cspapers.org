We present four training and prediction schedules from the same character-level recurrent neural network. The efficiency of these schedules is tested in terms of model effectiveness as a function of training time and amount of training data seen. We show that the choice of training and prediction schedule potentially has a considerable impact on the prediction effectiveness for a given training budget.
