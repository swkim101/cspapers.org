We propose a way to approximate games played over networks of increasing size by using the graph limiting concept of graphon. To this end, we introduce the new class of graphon games for populations of infinite size. We investigate existence and uniqueness properties of the Nash equilibrium of graphon games and we derive upper bounds for the distance between the Nash equilibria of the infinite population graphon game and of finite population sampled network games. We then show that it is possible to design almost optimal interventions for sampled network games by relying on the graphon model.
