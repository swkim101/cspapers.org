Although many data communications courses are taught with no programming content, courses designed for computer science majors should include programming. Many data communications courses with a programming component make use of serial ports on PCs while some deal with detailed network layer projects. UNIX socket programming allows the students to deal with the same issues and problems, but in a context that is more likely to be useful and that is more interesting. In addition, if socket classes are used with C++, only as much detail of socket operation as desired need be presented.
