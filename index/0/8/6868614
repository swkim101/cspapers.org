Liquid Computing has delivered the world's first Interconnect Driven Server. The company's flagship product, LiquidIQ(tm), merges computing and communications resources into a scalable system that delivers sustained performance throughput. It also introduces entirely new manageability and control characteristics that cannot be achieved with today's commodity servers, switching equipment and software overlays. The underlying IQInterconnect(tm) delivers highly redundant communications across multiple chassis by addressing key routing and load balancing limitations of common interconnect technologies. LiquidIQ server instances are defined in software; computing, memory and I/O resources can be combined from any location in the system without performance degradation. LiquidIQ provides the flexibility to support both large SMP and cluster operations using MPI and UPC. This session will review the specifics of its integrated, optimized and controlled system architecture and provide session attendees with performance results from its beta program with several leading high performance computing users.
