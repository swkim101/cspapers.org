ALCOVE is a connectionist model of human category learning that fits a broad spectrum of human learning data. Its architecture is based on well-established psychological theory, and is related to networks using radial basis functions. From the perspective of cognitive psychology, ALCOVE can be construed as a combination of exemplar-based representation and error-driven learning. From the perspective of connectionism, it can be seen as incorporating constraints into back-propagation networks appropriate for modelling human learning.
