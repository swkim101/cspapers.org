In this demonstration, we describe a system for storing and querying faceted hierarchies. We have developed a general faceted domain model and a query language for hierarchically classified data. We present here the use of our system on two real archaeological datasets containing thousands of artifacts. Our system is a sharable, evolvable resource that can provide global access to sizeable datasets in queriable format, and can serve as a valuable tool for data analysis and research in many application domains.
