Detection of traversable road regions, positive and negative obstacles, and water hazards is a fundamental task for autonomous driving vehicles, especially in off-road environment. This paper proposes an efficient method, called Lidar-histogram. It can be used to integrate the detection of traversable road regions, obstacles and water hazards into one single framework. The weak assumption of the Lidar-histogram is that a decent-sized area in front of the vehicle is flat. The Lidar-histogram is derived from an efficient organized map of Lidar point cloud, called Lidar-imagery, to index, describe and store Lidar data. The organized point-cloud map can be easily obtained by indexing the original unordered 3D point cloud to a Lidar-specific 2D coordinate system. In the Lidar-histogram representation, the 3D traversable road plane in front of vehicle can be projected as a straight line segment, and the positive and negative obstacles are projected above and below the line segment, respectively. In this way, the problem of detecting traversable road and obstacles is converted into a simple linear classification task in 2D space. Experiments have been conducted in different kinds of off-road and urban scenes, and we have obtained very promising results.
