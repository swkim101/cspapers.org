The aim of this study was to compare a robot designed using a virtual reality (VR) system (termed VR robot) with a real robot by using a psychological evaluation to investigate whether the VR robot can be used in the same manner as a real robot. To make the direct comparison between a VR and real robots possible, the same designed robots in both VR and real are used in the experiment. For evaluating the robots on a psychological basis, we focused on six basic dimensions (Utility, Clumsiness of motion, Possibility of communication, Controllability, Vulnerability, and Objective hardness) that ordinary people generally use to perceive robots. Sixty-one participants observed and evaluated a real and VR humanoid robots using a psychological scale. Results show that the real robot was evaluated to have higher scores for Utility, Possibility of communication, and Objective hardness and lower ones for Controllability as compared to a VR robot. The Vulnerability scores of the real robot and the VR robot were not significantly different. The usability of a VR robot is discussed in the paper.
