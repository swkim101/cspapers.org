This paper presents the usage of a nanorobotic handling technique for the transfer of individual copper-nanowires with diameters between 150nm and 400nm and length of about 10 Î¼m. Handling and assembly are inside the SEM and use electron beam induced deposition as well as focused ion beam milling. The handled nanowires are used to assembly a NEMS device, namely an electrostatic switch design, where the nanowire acts as switching contact. Working principle, reproducibility and specific values of the switches are investigated, as well as the conductivity of the nanowires themself.
