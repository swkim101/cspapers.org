Projective tests are personality tests that reveal individuals' emotions (e.g., Rorschach inkblot test). Unlike direct question-based tests, projective tests rely on ambiguous stimuli to evoke responses from individuals. In this paper we develop one such test, designed to be delivered automatically, anonymously and to a large community through public displays. Our work makes a number of contributions. First, we develop and validate in controlled conditions a quantitative projective test that can reveal emotions. Second, we demonstrate that this test can be deployed on a large scale longitudinally: we present a four-week deployment in our university's public spaces where 1431 tests were completed anonymously by passers-by. Third, our results reveal strong diurnal rhythms of emotion consistent with results we obtained independently using the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM), literature on affect, well-being, and our understanding of our university's daily routine.
