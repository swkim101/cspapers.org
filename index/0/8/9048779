Snake robots are controlled by implementing gaits inspired from their biological counterparts. However, transitioning between these gaits often produces undesired oscillations which cause net movements that are difficult to predict. In this paper we present a framework for implementing gaits which will allow for smooth transitions. We also present a method to determine the optimal time for each module of the snake to switch between gaits in a decentralized fashion. This will allow for each module to participate in minimizing a cost by communicating with a set of modules in a local neighborhood. Both of these developments will help to maintain desired properties of the gaits during transition.
