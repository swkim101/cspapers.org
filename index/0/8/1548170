We investigate automatic geolocation (i.e. identification of the location, expressed as latitude/longitude coordinates) of documents. Geolocation can be an effective means of summarizing large document collections and it is an important component of geographic information retrieval. We describe several simple supervised methods for document geolocation using only the document's raw text as evidence. All of our methods predict locations in the context of geodesic grids of varying degrees of resolution. We evaluate the methods on geotagged Wikipedia articles and Twitter feeds. For Wikipedia, our best method obtains a median prediction error of just 11.8 kilometers. Twitter geolocation is more challenging: we obtain a median error of 479 km, an improvement on previous results for the dataset.
