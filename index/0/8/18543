Many tools for object-oriented software design focus on assisting individuals in creating UML models for documentation and implementation purposes. Since software design is a highly collaborative activity, one must ask whether the requirements for facilitating collaborative design are similar.We report on a study of design teams, focusing on their use of notations and artifacts. Our findings highlight the unique characteristic of the use of UML in these settings and emphasize the importance of context and relations between artifacts over the details of specific artifacts.
