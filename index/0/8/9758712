Visual marker is a useful assistive tool for service robots. Existing planar visual markers have poor accuracy and stability in pose estimation, especially in frontal direction. In this study, we developed a novel visual marker based on a new principle enabling accurate and stable pose estimation even by observation from frontal direction. The marker has moireÃÅ patterns which consist of lenticular lens and stripe pattern, which vary their appearance according to visual-line angle of observation. We can extract pose information from the pattern by a single camera. We developed a prototype of the marker and an algorithm for pose estimation, and then demonstrated its superiority to existing markers by some validation tests.
