An account is given of flexible idiom processing within a lexicon based parser. The view is a compositional one. The parser's behaviour is basically the "literal" one, unless a certain threshold is crossed by the weight of a particular idiom. A new process will then be added. The parser, besides yielding all idiomatic and literal interpretations embodies some claims of human processing simulation.
