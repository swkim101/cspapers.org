We describe a course for non-majors that teaches computer science concepts and programming by creating simple animations and building 2D and 3D virtual worlds. Students work with scripting languages, an interactive programming environment, a programmable modeling environment, and finish with a simple programming language. Students work in pairs on computers during class. Each student creates a web portfolio to display their work.
