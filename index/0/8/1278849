We consider suffix tree construction for situations with missing suffix links. Two ex- amples of such situations are suffix trees for parameterized strings and suffix trees for two-dimensional arrays. These trees also have the property that the node degrees may be large. We add a new back- propagation component to McCreight's algorithm and also give a high probability hashing scheme for large degrees. We show that these two features enable construction of suffix trees for general sit- uations with missing suffix links in O(n) time, with high probability. This gives the first randomized linear time algorithm for constructing suffix trees for parameterized strings.
