We consider the problem of decoding block coded data, using a physical dynamical system. We sketch out a decompression algorithm for fractal block codes and then show how to implement a recurrent neural network using physically simple but highly-nonlinear, analog circuit models of neurons and synapses. The nonlinear system has many fixed points, but we have at our disposal a procedure to choose the parameters in such a way that only one solution, the desired solution, is stable. As a partial proof of the concept, we present experimental data from a small system a 16-neuron analog CMOS chip fabricated in a 2m analog p-well process. This chip operates in the subthreshold regime and, for each choice of parameters, converges to a unique stable state. Each state exhibits a qualitatively fractal shape.
