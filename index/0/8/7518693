Linguistics studies have shown that action verbs often denote some Change of State (CoS) as the result of an action. However, the causality of action verbs and its potential connection with the physical world has not been systematically explored. To address this limitation, this paper presents a study on physical causality of action verbs and their implied changes in the physical world. We ﬁrst conducted a crowd-sourcing experiment and identiﬁed eighteen categories of physical causality for action verbs. For a subset of these categories, we then deﬁned a set of detectors that detect the corresponding change from visual perception of the physical environment. We further incorporated physical causality modeling and state detection in grounded language understanding. Our empirical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of causality modeling in grounding language to perception.
