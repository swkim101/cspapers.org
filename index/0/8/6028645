This paper deals with the intelligent exploration of an unknown environment by autonomous robots. In particular, we present an algorithm and associated analysis for collaborative exploration using two mobile robots. Our approach is based on robots with range sensors limited by distance. By appropriate behavioural strategies, we show that odometry (motion) errors that would normally present problems for mapping can be severely reduced. Our analysis includes polynomial complexity bounds and a discussion of possible heuristics.
