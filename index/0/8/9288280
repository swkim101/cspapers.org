Computer vision in general, and object proposals in particular, are nowadays strongly influenced by the databases on which researchers evaluate the performance of their algorithms. This paper studies the transition from the Pascal Visual Object Challenge dataset, which has been the benchmark of reference for the last years, to the updated, bigger, and more challenging Microsoft Common Objects in Context. We first review and deeply analyze the new challenges, and opportunities, that this database presents. We then survey the current state of the art in object proposals and evaluate it focusing on how it generalizes to the new dataset. In sight of these results, we propose various lines of research to take advantage of the new benchmark and improve the techniques. We explore one of these lines, which leads to an improvement over the state of the art of +5.2%.
