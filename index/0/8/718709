This paper proposes a robust controller/observer for UAVs network anomaly estimation which is based on both Lyapunov Krasovkii functional and dynamic behavior of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Several research works on network anomaly estimation have been led using automatic control techniques and provide methods for designing both observer and command laws dedicated to time delay problem while estimating the anomaly or intrusion in the system. The observer design is based on a linearized fluid-flow model of the TCP behavior and must be associated to an AQM (Active Queue Management) to perform its diagnosis. The developed robust controller/observer in this paper has to be tuned by considering the time delay linear state-space representation of TCP model. As a first result, the designed controller/observer system has been successfully applied to some relevant practical problems such as topology network for aerial vehicles and the effectiveness is illustrated by using real traffic traces including Denial of Service attacks. Our first results show promising perspectives for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in a fleet of UAVs.
