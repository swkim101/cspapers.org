Recently we presented several disk array architectures designed to increase the data rate and I/O rate of supercomputing applications, transaction processing, and file systems [Patterson 88]. In this paper we present a hardware performance measurement of two of these architectures, mirroring and rotated parity. We see how throughput for these two architectures is affected by response time requirements, request sizes, and read to write ratios. We find that for applications with large accesses, such as many supercomputing applications, a rotated parity disk array far outperforms traditional mirroring architecture. For applications dominated by small accesses, such as transaction processing, mirroring architectures have higher performance per disk than rotated parity architectures.
