This paper describes the research and development of an interface for a mobile computing device to be used by Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) in rural India. We describe the insights of the team from Apple Research Lab (ARL), who have had the privilege of working in a very different culture from the ones they are used to. We show how our observations of the healthcare workers performing their caring and administrative functions informed the design of the user interface. We illustrate how we developed the graphical language, navigational structure and data entry techniques. We provide a summary of the feedback we received from early field trials and some thoughts on the appropriateness of our approach to design in this environment.
