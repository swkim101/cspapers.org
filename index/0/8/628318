Let P be a linear relaxation of an integer polytope Z such tha t the integrali ty gap of P with respect to Z is at most r , as verified by a poly-t ime heuristic A, which on any positive cost function e returns an integer solution (extreme point of Z) whose cost is at most r t imes the opt imal cost over P. Then for any point z" in P (fractional solution), rx" dominates some convex combination of extreme points of Z. A constructive version of this theorem is presented with applications to approximation algorithm% and can be viewed as a generalization of randomized rounding.
