Daily continuous spirometry is expected to detect lung disease initial symptoms that occur in daily contexts. Current medical spirometers are insufficient for such usage because they force uncomfortable conditions for users, such as pinching their noses with a clip and holding a mouthpiece in their mouths. To solve this issue, we propose an e-textile-based wearable spirometer called SpiroVest that estimates lung behavior from torso-girth movements. It does not require any uncomfortable conditions that interfere with daily activity. In addition, our wearable spirometer is able to estimate accurate respiratory volume against variety of postures by a simple and posture-independent error reduction mechanism.
