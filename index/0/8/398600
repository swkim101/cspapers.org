We seek to gain improved insight into how Web search engines shouldcope with the evolving Web, in an attempt to provide users with themost up-to-date results possible. For this purpose we collectedweekly snapshots of some 150 Web sites over the course of one year,and measured the evolution of content and link structure. Our measurements focus on aspects of potential interest to search engine designers: the evolution of link structure over time, the rate ofcreation of new pages and new distinct content on the Web, and the rate of change of the content of existing pages under search-centric measures of degree of change.Our findings indicate a rapid turnover rate of Web pages, i.e.,high rates of birth and death, coupled with an even higher rate ofturnover in the hyperlinks that connect them. For pages that persistover time we found that, perhaps surprisingly, the degree of contentshift as measured using TF.IDF cosine distance does not appear to beconsistently correlated with the frequency of contentupdating. Despite this apparent non-correlation, the rate of content shift of a given page is likely to remain consistent over time. That is, pages that change a great deal in one week will likely change by a similarly large degree in the following week. Conversely, pages that experience little change will continue to experience little change. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the potential implications ofour results for the design of effective Web search engines.
