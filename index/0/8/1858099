We show that more head-driven parsing algorithms can be formulated than those occurring in the existing literature. These algorithms are inspired by a family of left-to-right parsing algorithms from a recent publication. We further introduce a more advanced notion of "head-driven parsing" which allows more detailed specification of the processing order of non-head elements in the right-hand side. We develop a parsing algorithm for this strategy, based on LR parsing techniques.
