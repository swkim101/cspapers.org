Device to Device communication in LTE technology has been standardized with the recent release of the 3GPP standardization documentation (Release-13). Aerial networks on the other hand are being considered for many applications including the cellular communications. In this paper we consider the D2D technology to be part of an aerial access network for providing terrestrial cellular coverage. To enable D2D in aerial access networks, we present and study a power control mechanism for D2D transmissions when the same radio resources are shared between D2D and aerial networks. We present a simulation based performance analysis for the power control mechanism, and the results show considerable improvement in the outage performance especially at the cell edge.
