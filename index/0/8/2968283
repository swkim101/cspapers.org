The single row approach represents a systematic suboptimal approach to the general multilayer rectilinear wire routing problem. With this approach, the single row wiring problem (i.e., one where all the points are collinear) forms the backbone of the general multilayer wiring problem. We consider the problem of generating minimum width layouts for single row wiring problems. Our algorithm, which is not grid-based, is enumerative and uses a strong bounding criterion.
