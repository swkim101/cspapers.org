This paper introduces novel interaction and applications using smartphones with kinetic capabilities. We develop an accessory module with robot wheels for a smartphone. With this module, the smartphone can move in a linear direction or rotate with sufficient power. The module also includes rotary encoders, allowing us to use the wheels as an input modality. We demonstrate a series of novel mobile interaction for mobile devices with kinetic capabilities through three applications.
