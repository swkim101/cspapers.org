In knowledge processing frameworks for advanced DBMS (such as OODBMS or KBMS) suitable for client-server architectures, the efficient realization of client-based, mainmemory query processing represents a promising and important step towards an effective support of application processing. In this paper we present a plan-operator concept developed along these lines as part of an algebraic queryprocessing framework for the KBMS KRISYS [24]. We motivate the main goals (support of extensibility, client-based query processing, and dynamic query optimization) as well as the resulting design objectives followed and give a detailed description of the specification and implementation of the resulting plan-operator concept. It can be characterized as highly modular and orthogonal w.r.t. the overall functionality and allows a flexible and extensive utilization of precompiled code fragments. Additionally, we sketch the advantages of the concept w.r.t. our design objectives and point out that the presented ideas are not limited to KRISYS but also apply in a more general setting.
