In this paper we describe the first singly exponential algorithm for computing the first Betti number of a given semi-algebraic set. We also describe algorithms for obtaining semi-algebraic descriptions of the semi-algebraically connected components of any given real algebraic or semi-algebraic set. Singly exponential algorithms for computing the zero-th Betti number, and the Euler-Poincar√© characteristic, were known before. No singly exponential algorithm was known for computing any of the individual Betti numbers other than the zero-th one.
