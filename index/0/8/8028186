Automated text summarization is aimed at extracting essential information from original text and presenting it in a minimal, often predefined, number of words. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for unsupervised extractive summarization, based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, using the Krimp dataset compression algorithm (Vreeken et al., 2011). Our approach represents a text as a transactional dataset, with sentences as transactions, and then describes it by itemsets that stand for frequent sequences of words. The summary is then compiled from sentences that compress (and as such, best describe) the document. The problem of summarization is reduced to the maximal coverage, following the assumption that a summary that best describes the original text, should cover most of the word sequences describing the document. We solve it by a greedy algorithm and present the evaluation results.
