Cognitive modeling techniques provide a way of evaluating user interface designs, based on what is known about human cognitive strengths and limitations. Cognitive modelers face a tradeoff, however: more detailed models require disproportionately more time and effort to develop than coarser models. In this paper we describe a system, G2A, that automatically produces translations from abstract GOMS models into more detailed ACT-R models. G2A demonstrates how even simple AI techniques can facilitate the construction of cognitive models and suggests new directions for improving modeling tools.
