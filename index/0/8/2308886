A first level implementation of AL, a high-level programming system for manipulator control, has been completed and is now in operation. Several new modules have been added to the system including: POINTY an interactive system for specifying representation of parts, and ALAID an interactive debugger for AL. Recent work in vision has been incorporated into the AL system. This paper describes the present implementation of AL and discusses current work.
