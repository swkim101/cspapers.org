In my talk, I will describe the important aspects of our distributed architecture, covering both itâ€™s strengths and weaknesses. I will talk about five aspects of the distributed DBMS that we have implemented distributed dictionary, distributed &ta, distributed processing, location independence, and local autonomy. For continuous availability I would like to mention thee features that have been implemented 1. On-line reorganization 2. Add, drop, spli~ move partition 3. opens on demand. Finally I will talk about parallelism, both inter-transaction and intra-transaction parallelism, including how it allows linear scale-up and speed-up.
