We study a novel data management scenario, in which social networks participants use protocols in order to manage their activities and the ever-growing data available to them in the network. In particular, we study protocols which operate on a consistent network (that we define), and transform it into another consistent state by atomically performing a set of changes. Multiple protocol instances, which work on intersecting parts of the network graphs are able to operate concurrently.
