Introduction NASA has embarked upon a Robotics Research Project at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the purpose of which is to establish a technology base in robotics and semi-autonomous control of unmanned machines or vehicles to support lunar and planetary exploration. The long term objective of the robotics work at JPL is to provide an integrated hardware/software system which is capable of nearly autonomous performance. The present design philosophy seeks to limit the need for human interaction to selection of goals and similar higher level functions. The Rover must then analyze the scene for traversability, generate a planned path to the goal, and follow that path, avoiding any obstacles along the route. We have achieved the capability of performing the scenario just described in a simplified environment; a laboratory with a flat surface, a limited number of obstacles and constant illumination. This paper focuses upon the autonomous guidance and control functions of the Rover which executes the planned trajectory in an incompletely defined environment.
