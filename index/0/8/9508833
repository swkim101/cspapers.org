Our research group has started a collaboration that analyzes data collected from biological snakes to provide insight on how to better program snake robots. Most data collected on biological snakes views the snakes from above and thus can only detect motion in the horizontal plane. However, both our robots and biological snakes are capable of generating motions both in the horizontal and vertical planes. Vertical waves naturally play a major role in limbless locomotion in that they simultaneously provide thrust motion and make-and-break contact between the mechanism and environment. Analysis on the data, collected from sidewinder rattle snakes, revealed that disparate modes of locomotion emerged from different contact patterns. We conclude that the same horizontal undulation can cause dramatically different motions for both the biological and robotic snakes depending upon the choice of contacts. With this knowledge, we introduce contact scheduling, a technique that plans positions of contacts along the body to design gaits for snake robots. Contact scheduling results in a novel turning gait, which can reorient a snake robot more than 90 degrees in one gait cycle.
