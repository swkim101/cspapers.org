Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of flipped classrooms (e.g. peer instruction) in computer science courses. Flipped classrooms rely on students having obtained first exposure to concepts through pre-class activities such as viewing videos or reading a textbook. Having engaged with the material before class, class time can be spent on more challenging activities with feedback from the instructor and classmates. These pre-class activities can be a challenge for students, who often do not have the skills necessary to critically engage with the assigned reading/viewing. As a result students often come to class under-prepared despite completing the pre-class activities. This paper presents the author's experience with adding guided practice worksheets to improve student preparedness in two courses: a CS1 course and a lower-division "Introduction to Computer Systems" course. These pre-class worksheets provided a structured set of learning objectives for students to focus on in their reading as well as exercises to test those objectives. Limited results indicate a high worksheet completion rate and a strong positive correlation between individual completion rates and final course grade. This paper also presents recommendations for those instructors wishing to adopt guided practice in their class.
