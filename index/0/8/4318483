We present the result of assessing first-year students' misconceptions related to algorithms and data structures. Our study confirms findings from previous small-scale studies but additionally broadens the scope of the topics and methods investigated. The evaluation of our experiments sheds light on dependencies between active and passive knowledge as well as on the instruments used; in particular, we conclude that there is no "one size fits all" instrument but that instruments should be selected depending on the topic at hand.
