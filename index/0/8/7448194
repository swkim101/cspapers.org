Existing on-demand ad-hoc routing algorithms initiate route discovery only after a path breaks, incurring a significant cost in detecting the disconnection and establishing a new route. In this work, we investigate adding proactive route selection and maintenance to on-demand ad-hoc routing algorithms. More specifically, when a path is likely to be broken, a warning is sent to the source indicating the likelihood of a disconnection. The source can then initiate path discovery early, potentially avoiding the disconnection altogether. A path is considered likely to break when the received packet power becomes close to the minimum detectable power (other approaches are possible). Care must be taken to avoid initiating false route warnings due to fluctuations in received power caused by fading, multipath effects and similar random transient phenomena. Experiments demonstrate that adding proactive route selection and maintenance to DSR and AODV (on-demand ad hoc routing protocols) significantly reduces the number of broken paths, with a small increase in protocol overhead. Packet latency and jitter also goes down in most cases. We also show some experimental results obtained by running TCP on top of the proactive routing schemes proposed. Several improvements and extensions are also discussed. Pro-active route selection and maintenance is general and can be used with other routing algorithms and optimizations to them.
