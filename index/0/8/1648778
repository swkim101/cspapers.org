In this paper we present a distributed, message passing implementation of a dynamic dictionary structure for range queries. The structure is based on a distributed fine-grain implementation of skip lists that can scale across a cluster of multicore machines. Our implementation makes use of the unique features of Fine-Grain MPI and introduces novel algorithms and techniques to achieve scalable performance on a cluster of multicore machines. Unlike concurrent data structures the distributed skip list operations are deterministic and atomic. Range-queries are implemented in a way that parallelizes the operation and takes advantage of the recursive properties of the skip list structure. We report on the performance of the skip list for range-queries, on a medium sized cluster with two hundred cores.
