Using solar panels to power wireless sensor nodes is feasible in most of WSNs applications. We present an efficient solar-charging system and a remote energy-profile monitoring system which can monitor the dynamic charging procedure of wireless sensor nodes in different environments. We design and implement dynamic routing policies according to the current available energy of nodes for WSNs powered by solar panels.
