This paper proposes a new class of online policies for scheduling in input-buffered crossbar switches. Given an initial configuration of packets at the input buffers, these policies drain all packets in the system in the minimal amount of time provided that there are no further arrivals. These policies are also throughput optimal for a large class of arrival processes which satisfy strong-law of large numbers. We show that it is possible for policies in our class to be throughput optimal even if they are not constrained to be maximal in every time slot.
 Most algorithms for switch scheduling take an edge based approach; in contrast, we focus on scheduling (a large enough set of) the most congested ports. This alternate approach allows for lower-complexity algorithms, and also requires a non-standard technique to prove throughput-optimality. One algorithm in our class, Maximum Vertex-weighted Matching (MVM) has worst-case complexity similar to Max-size Matching, and in simulations shows slightly better delay performance than Max-(edge)weighted-Matching (MWM).
