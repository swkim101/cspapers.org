This paper describes how a language for building interfaces to information systems, that is being developed by the Office of Research at OCLC, can be linked to an artificial intelligence environment, Poplog. A demonstration system, showing how Poplog could provide some intelligent support for a D interface, has been developed. It is suggested that this could form the basis for intelligent support for interface systems.
