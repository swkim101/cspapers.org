We describe the main features of an Internet based distance learning environment that we are developing to teach a course on logic and functional programming for computer science students. The main goal of the system is to provide a minimal set of capabilities for a generic interpreter that will be instantiated for different programming languages and paradigms. The architecture of the system is based on the use of XML and web services to facilitate the integration and independence between the different development platforms and systems.
