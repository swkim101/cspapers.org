SRI International has recently established the Computer Dialogue Laboratory with the goal of dramatically shifting the burden of human-computer interaction towards the machine. That is, rather than the userâ€™s having to learn the intricacies of different application systems and different interfaces, our goal is to develop interface technology that shields the user from the details of the underlying application, yet leverages those applications through high-level interaction. The interface should offer precise control via an integration of direct manipulation with new sensory and communication modalities, among them speech and handwriting technologies, natural language processing, image processing, eye-tracking, and virtual reality. Our intent is not merely to develop and combine these input and output modalities, but to use them for their strengths and for overcoming weaknesses of companion modalities. This r multidisciplinary research program draws on existing SRI programs and personnel in related disciplines, including artificial intelligence, computer science, electrical engineering, experimental psychology, linguistics, speech perception, and visual perception. The Computer Dialogue Laboratory will thus serve as an environment for basic and applied research on interfaces and their component technologies, for demonstrations, and for empirical evaluation.
