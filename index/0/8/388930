Images (i.e., figures or tables) are important experimental results that are typically reported in bioscience full-text articles. Biologists need to access the images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. We designed, evaluated, and implemented a novel user-interface, BioEx, that allows biologists to access images that appear in a full-text article directly from the abstract of the article.
