In the recent years, intensive studies have been carried out on the measurement of distance by using stereo camera systems. However, image systems with multiple image sensors are usually very complex and are inconvenient to use. In this paper, we present a new method that is based on the fact that the viewpoint depends on the position of aperture. We show images from different viewpoints can be obtained by using a monocular system. In the proposed method, stereo image analysis is carried out by using a viewpoint switching iris. A prototype of the viewpoint switching iris has be developed, which can be used along with a monocular camera for distance measurement. Furthermore, we have verified that this system can be used to a moving object by using a compensation method.
