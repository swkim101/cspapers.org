We utilize the ensemble of trees framework, a tractable mixture over super-exponential number of tree-structured distributions [1], to develop a new model for multivariate density estimation. The model is based on a construction of tree-structured copulas - multivariate distributions with uniform on [0, 1] marginals. By averaging over all possible tree structures, the new model can approximate distributions with complex variable dependencies. We propose an EM algorithm to estimate the parameters for these tree-averaged models for both the real-valued and the categorical case. Based on the tree-averaged framework, we propose a new model for joint precipitation amounts data on networks of rain stations.
