Location-dependent data are central to many emerging applications, ranging from traffic information services to sensor networks. The standard pull- and push-based data dissemination models become unworkable since the data volumes and number of clients are high.We address this problem using locale covers, a subset of the original set of locations of interest, chosen to include at least one location in a suitably defined neighborhood of any client. Since location-dependent values are highly correlated with location, a query can be answered using a location close to the query point.We show that location-dependent queries may be answered satisfactorily using locale covers, with small loss of accuracy. Our approach is independent of locations and speeds of clients, and is applicable to mobile clients.
