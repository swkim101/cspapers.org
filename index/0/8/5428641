There has been a great amount of work on query-independent summarization of documents. However, due to the success of Web search engines query-specific document summarization (query result snippets) has become an important problem, which has received little attention. We present a method to create query-specific summaries by identifying the most query-relevant fragments and combining them using the semantic associations within the document. In particular, we first add structure to the documents in the preprocessing stage and convert them to document graphs. Then, the best summaries are computed by calculating the top spanning trees on the document graphs. We present and experimentally evaluate efficient algorithms that support computing summaries in interactive time. Furthermore, the quality of our summarization method is compared to current approaches using a user survey.
