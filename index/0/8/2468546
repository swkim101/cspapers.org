There has been a great interest in defining a new network architecture that can meet the needs of a future Internet. One of the main challenges in this context is how to realize the many different technical solutions that have developed in recent years in a single coherent architecture. In addition, it is necessary to consider how to ensure economic viability of architecture solutions. In this work, we discuss how to design a network architecture where choices at different layers of the protocol stack are explicitly exposed to users. This approach ensures that innovative technical solutions can be used and rewarded, which is essential to encourage wide deployment of this architecture.
