Grasp quality metrics which analyze the contact wrench space are commonly used to synthesize and analyze preplanned grasps. Preplanned grasping approaches rely on the robustness of stored solutions. Analyzing the robustness of such solutions for large databases of preplanned grasps is a limiting factor for the applicability of data driven approaches to grasping. In this work, we will focus on the stability of the widely used grasp wrench space epsilon quality metric over a large range of poses in simulation. We examine a large number of grasps from the Columbia Grasp Database for the Barrett hand. We find that in most cases the grasp with the most robust force closure with respect to pose error for a particular object is not the grasp with the highest epsilon quality. We demonstrate that grasps can be reranked by an estimate of the stability of their epsilon quality. We find that the grasps ranked best by this method are successful more often in physical experiments than grasps ranked best by the epsilon quality.
