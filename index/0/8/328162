The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed database that allows convenient storing and retrieving of resource records. DNS has been extended to provide security services (DNSSEC) mainly through public-key cryptography. We propose a new approach to DNSSEC that may result in a significantly more efficient protocol. We introduce a new strategy to build chains of trust from root servers to authoritative servers. The techniques we employ are based on symmetric-key cryptography.
