In an ever changing and globalizing work environment, Educational institutions in the field of Information Technology (IT) face a constant challenge in developing relevant and competitive courses and curricula that stay up to date with changes in technology. Developing curriculum should go beyond the supply-centered educational approach where institutions and faculty alone are responsible for the design of curricula and instead, should be from end-to-end a collaborative effort from all stakeholders. However, the current collaborative efforts in developing curricula only involve industry and academia. Even though students are the raison d'Ãªtre of the curriculum, they are still perceived as merely consumers of knowledge. Students are kept out of the curriculum development process and their expectations, perceptions, and opinions often are not taken into consideration. In this poster, the author proposes a distributed and collaborative curricula design framework that promotes a closer integration of all stakeholders namely academia, industry, and students. Similar to the PIECE (Partnering Industry and Education for Curricular Enhancement) model, the proposed framework prescribes a multi-stage curriculum design process from initial analysis to final assessment. In addition, the author plans to conduct an anonymous survey of CS/IT major students at WNEU and explores the benefits of integrating students in the curriculum development process. Preliminary investigation suggests that the integration of students in the curriculum development process would improve students' engagement in classes, and create an atmosphere of trust and a sense of ownership for students. Ultimately, this would enable institutions to create consumer-friendly curriculum and programs.
