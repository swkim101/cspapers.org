Crowd based online work is leveraged in a variety of applications such as semantic annotation of images, translation of texts in foreign languages, and labeling of training data for machine learning models. However, annotating large amounts of data through crowdsourcing can be slow and costly. In order to improve both cost and time efficiency of crowdsourcing we examine alternative reward mechanisms compared to the "Pay-per-HIT" scheme commonly used in platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. To this end, we explore a wide range of monetary reward schemes that are inspired by the success of competitions, lotteries, and games of luck. Our large-scale experimental evaluation with an overall budget of more than 1,000 USD and with 2,700 hours of work spent by crowd workers demonstrates that our alternative reward mechanisms are well accepted by online workers and lead to substantial performance boosts.
