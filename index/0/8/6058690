Recently, Location-based Services (LBS) became proactive by supporting smart notifications in case the user enters or leaves a specific geographical area, well-known as Geofencing. However, different geofences cannot be temporally related to each other. Therefore, we introduce a novel method to formalize sophisticated Geofencing scenarios as state and transition-based geofence models. Such a model considers temporal relations between geofences as well as duration constraints for the time being within a geofence or in transition between geofences. These are two highly important aspects in order to cover sophisticated scenarios in which a notification should be triggered only in case the user crosses multiple geofences in a defined temporal order or leaves a geofence after a certain amount of time. As a proof of concept, we introduce a prototype of a suitable user interface for designing complex geofence models in conjunction with the corresponding proactive LBS.
