We present the first optimal algorithm to compute the maximum <i>Tukey depth</i> (also known as <i>location or halfspace depth</i>) for a non-degenerate point set in the plane. The algorithm is randomized and requires <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) expected time for <i>n</i> data points. In a higher fiexed dimension <i>d</i> â‰¥ 3, the expected time bound is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>d-1</sup>), which is probably optimal as well. The result is obtained using an interesting variant of the author's randomized optimization technique, capable of solving "implicit" linear-programming-type problems; some other applications of this technique are briefly mentioned.
