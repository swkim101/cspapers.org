Sleep quality plays a significant role in personal health. A great deal of effort has been paid to design sleep quality monitoring systems, providing services ranging from bedtime monitoring to sleep activity detection. However, as sleep quality is closely related to the distribution of sleep duration over different sleep stages, neither the bedtime nor the intensity of sleep activities is able to reflect sleep quality precisely. To this end, we present Sleep Hunter, a mobile service that provides a fine-grained detection of sleep stage transition for sleep quality monitoring and intelligent wake-up call. The rationale is that each sleep stage is accompanied by specific yet distinguishable body movements and acoustic signals. Leveraging the built-in sensors on smartphones, Sleep Hunter integrates these physical activities with sleep environment, inherent temporal relation and personal factors by a statistical model for a fine-grained sleep stage detection. Based on the duration of each sleep stage, Sleep Hunter further provides sleep quality report and smart call service for users. Experimental results from over 30 sets of nocturnal sleep data show that our system is superior to existing actigraphy-based sleep quality monitoring systems, and achieves satisfying detection accuracy compared with dedicated polysomnography-based devices.
