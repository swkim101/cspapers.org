Rotating a piece of paper while drawing is an integral andalmost subconscious part of drawing with pencil and paper. In asimilar manner, the advent of lightweight pen-based computers allowdigital artwork to be rotated while drawing by rotating the entirecomputer. Given this type of manipulation we explore theimplications for the user interface to support artwork orientation.First we describe an exploratory study to further motivate our workand characterize how artwork is manipulated while drawing. Afterpresenting some possible UI approaches to support artworkorientation, we define a new solution called a rotating userinterface (RUIs). We then discuss design issues and requirementsfor RUIs based on our exploratory study.
