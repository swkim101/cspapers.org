We present a decentralized algorithm for group-based coherent and reciprocal multi-agent navigation. In addition to generating collision-free trajectories for each agent, our approach is able to simulate macroscopic group movements and proxemic behaviors that result in coherent navigation. Our approach is general, makes no assumptions about the size or shape of the group, and can generate smooth trajectories for the agents. Furthermore, it can dynamically adapt to obstacles or the behavior of other agents. The additional overhead of generating proxemic group behaviors is relatively small and our approach can simulate hundreds of agents in real-time. We highlight its benefits on different benchmarks.
