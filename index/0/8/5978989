Recent developments in generation algorithms have enabled work in unification-based computational linguistics to approach more closely the ideal of grammars as declarative statements of linguistic facts, neutral between analysis and synthesis. From this perspective, however, the situation is still far from perfect; all known methods of generation impose constraints on the grammars they assume.We briefly consider a number of proposals for generation, outlining their consequences for the form of grammars, and then report on experience arising from the addition of a generator to an existing unification environment. The algorithm in question (based on that of Shieber et al. (1989)), though among the most permissive currently available, excludes certain classes of parsable analyses.
