In our algorithm the gradient of Î¸ (the gradient direction) in a grey level image is employed for detecting candidates for corner points. Two theorems show that this quantity attains a local maximum at a corner point. Two approaches, median filtering and Hough transform are used effectively to distinguish corner points from noise points. The corner points formed by our algorithm are used in interframe matching.
