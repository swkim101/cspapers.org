This paper deals with design and implementation of a stabilization algorithm for a car like robot performing high speed turns. The control of such a kind of system is rather difficult because of the complexity of the physical wheel- soil interaction model. In this paper, it is planned to analyze the complex dynamic model of this process to elaborate a stabilization algorithm only based on the measurement of the system yaw rate. Finally, a 3D simulation is performed to evaluate the efficiency of this designed stabilization algorithm.
