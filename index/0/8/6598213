Over the past several years we have created or borrowed algorithms for combinatorial pattern matching and pattern discovery on sequences [2] and trees.In matching problems, given a pattern, a set of data objects and a distance metric, we find the distance between the pattern and one or more data objects. In discovery problems by contrast, given a set of objects, a metric, and a distance, we seek a pattern that matches many of those objects within the given distance. (So, discovery is a lot like data mining.) Our toolkit performs both matching and discovery with current targeted applications in molecular biology and document comparison.
