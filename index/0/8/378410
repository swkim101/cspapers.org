We propose a general framework called Network Dissection for quantifying the interpretability of latent representations of CNNs by evaluating the alignment between individual hidden units and a set of semantic concepts. Given any CNN model, the proposed method draws on a data set of concepts to score the semantics of hidden units at each intermediate convolutional layer. The units with semantics are labeled across a broad range of visual concepts including objects, parts, scenes, textures, materials, and colors. We use the proposed method to test the hypothesis that interpretability is an axis-independent property of the representation space, then we apply the method to compare the latent representations of various networks when trained to solve different classification problems. We further analyze the effect of training iterations, compare networks trained with different initializations, and measure the effect of dropout and batch normalization on the interpretability of deep visual representations. We demonstrate that the proposed method can shed light on characteristics of CNN models and training methods that go beyond measurements of their discriminative power.
