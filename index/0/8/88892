Replicated data management protocols have been pro posed that exploit a logically structured set of copies. These protocols have the advantage that they provide limited fault-tolerance at low communication cost. The propceed protocols can be viewed as analogues of the read-one write-all protocol in the context of logical structures. In this paper, these protocols are generalized in two ways for a grid and a tree structure. First, the quorum based approach is applied to develop protocols that use structured read and write quorums, thus attaining a high degree of data availability for both read and write operations. Next, the reconfiguration or views approach is developed for both grid and tree structures resulting in protocols that attain high degrees of availability at significantly low communication cost for read operations. In this sense, the proposed protocols have the advantages of the readone write-all protocol for low cost read operations as well as the majority quorum protocol for high data availability. *This research is supported by the NSF under grant numbers IRI-9004998 and IRI-9117904.
