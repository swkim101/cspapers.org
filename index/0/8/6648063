In this paper, we characterize the performance of the TPC-H benchmark for a popular column-oriented database called MonetDB running on a dual-core AMD Athlon machine. Specifically, we measure the performance of key microarchitectural components and analyze in detail the nature of various stalls namely cache stalls, branch misprediction stalls and resource stalls. We compare our results with published results on the characterization of TPC-H for row-oriented databases. As opposed to the previous approaches, we use thread-level monitoring of database threads to study the performance of the database in isolation from the rest of the system.
