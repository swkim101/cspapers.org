Synchronous tree substitution grammars are a translation model that is used in syntax-based machine translation. They are investigated in a formal setting and compared to a competitor that is at least as expressive. The competitor is the extended multi bottom-up tree transducer, which is the bottom-up analogue with one essential additional feature. This model has been investigated in theoretical computer science, but seems widely unknown in natural language processing. The two models are compared with respect to standard algorithms (binarization, regular restriction, composition, application). Particular attention is paid to the complexity of the algorithms.
