Mundane discourse abounds with utterances referring to other utterances. These meta-language utterances appear with surprising frequency in task-oriented dialogues, such as those arising in the context of a natural language interface to an operating system. This paper identifies some simpler types of dialogue-level metalanguage utterance and provides a computational framework to process such phrases in the context of a case-frame parser exploiting strongly-typed domain semantics.
