My dissertation is aimed at enabling people to collaborate to create complex artifacts: for example, to develop software, sketch GUI prototypes, play music together, or write a novel. Such creative processes are not well defined and can evolve dynamically. We introduce interactive systems that help users collaborate and communicate in the open-ended process. In particular, we investigate the benefits of both integrating asynchronous interactions into real-time collaborations and of having real time components in asynchronous collaborative settings. The systems provide tools that combine the two different types of interaction techniques, and we validate them via user study, participatory performing arts, and the online deployments of systems and crowdsourced tasks. The hybrid methods are designed to help users recover collaborative context, make the process approachable to nonexperts, collaborate online crowds on demand in real-time, and sustain liveness during collaboration. The dissertation will result in cross-domain knowledge in designing collaborative systems and it will help us create a framework for future intelligent systems that will help people solve more complex tasks effectively.
