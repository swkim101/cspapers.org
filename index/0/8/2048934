Retiming is a sequential optimization technique based on repositioning of memory elements within a circuit. The goal of retiming is to meet the circuit performance goal (specified by a target clock period) while keeping the area overhead to a minimum. However, to evolve from a purely theoretical formulation to a practical optimization technique that can be successfully applied to industrial designs, requires insight in issues in design equivalence, delay modeling and extensions to existing synthesis methods.
