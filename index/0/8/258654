Despite traditional web caching techniques, redundant data is often transferred over HTTP links. These redundant transfers result from both resource modification and aliasing. Resource modification causes the data represented by a single URI to change; often, in transferring the new data, some old data is retransmitted. Aliasing, in contrast, occurs when the same data is named by multiple URIs, often in the context of dynamic or advertising content. Traditional web caching techniques index data by its name and thus often fail to recognize and take advantage of aliasing.Despite traditional web caching techniques, redundant data is often transferred over HTTP links.
