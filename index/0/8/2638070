1. I N T R O D U C T I O N Many recent proposals for the support of Video-on-Demand (VoD) use a form of periodic broadcast scheduling and assume Constant Bi t -Rate (CBR) encoded videos [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10]. The few existing proposals [5, 9] for support of the more efficient Variable Bit-Rate (VBI:t) video encoding schemes, employ forms of lossy multiplexing. Thus they can be used for VBR video but at the cost of data losses. In this paper we address the issue of the VBR encoded video broadcast and we propose an inherently Loss-Less and Bandwidth-Efficient (LLBE) scheme. Given ample client storage, LLBE can satisfy any a-priori prescribed per-video startup latency, w. In LLBE, the bandwidth necessary for the transmission and downloading of a video is minimized through an optimization process. We also note that minimization of the server bandwidth can be stated as a shortest path problem and solved in polynomial time.
