We investigate the meaning extensions of very frequent and highly polysemous verbs, both in terms of their compositional contribution to a light verb construction (LVC), and the patterns of acceptability of the resulting LVC. We develop compositionality and acceptability measures that draw on linguistic properties specific to LVCs, and demonstrate that these statistical, corpus-based measures correlate well with human judgments of each property.
