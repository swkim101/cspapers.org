While a lot of progress has recently been made in dynamic motion planning for humanoid robots, much of this work has remained limited to simulation. Here we show that executing the resulting trajectories on a Darwin-OP robot, even with local feedback derived from the optimizer, does not result in stable movements. We then develop a new trajectory optimization method, adapting our earlier CIO algorithm to plan through ensembles of perturbed models. This makes the plan robust to model uncertainty, and leads to successful execution on the robot. We obtain a high rate of task completion without trajectory divergence (falling) in dynamic forward walking, sideways walking, and turning, and a similarly high success rate in getting up from the floor (the robot broke before we could quantify the latter). Even though the planning is still done offline, the present work represents a significant step towards automating the tedious scripting of complex movements.
