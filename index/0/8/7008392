The general approach to humanoid feet design considers the use of rectangular plate sole structures that are relatively stiff and compatible for flat terrain locomotion. Although this can be adequate the inability of these stiff feet to cope with small terrain irregularities, it makes them inappropriate for rough terrains. Toward improvement of humanoids feet this paper presents mechanism of new variable compliant humanoid feet which can provide functionality and adaptability to humanoids locomotion on uneven terrains. The proposed feet design introduces new toe mechanism in the feet with variable stiffness implemented using a leaf spring and rubber balls in series. We present the mechanism design and the implementation of the sensor, and discuss the estimation of variable stiffness range and coefficient of damping at sole. A prototype of the feet was built and experimental results are included to validate the feet design.
