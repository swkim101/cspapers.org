As application developers today we all face a problem of great complexity. Because of the diversity of our users, and the variety of their equipment, applications must run in many different configurations. They must support displays of varying size, resolution, and color depth. Different types of input devices are required, from keyboards to touch screens. Applications must run in different countries, being able to reformat messages in varying lengths in each language. Messages should be available in large font sizes for vision impaired users. Interface style should be consistent with other applications running on similar hardware. Style should at the same time conform to guidelines being developed by many organizations for presentation and interaction behaviors.
