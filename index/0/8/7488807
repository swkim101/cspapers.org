We present BFL, a hybrid logic for representing uncertain knowledge. BFL attaches a quantified notion of belief -- based on Dempster-Shafer's theory of belief functions -- to classical first-order logic. The language of BFL is composed of objects of the form F:[a,b], where F is a first-order sentence, and a and b are numbers in the [0,1] interval (with aâ‰¤b). Intuitively, a measures the strength of our belief in the truth of F, and (1-b) that in its falseness. A number of properties of first-order logic nicely generalize to BFL; in return, BFL gives us a new perspective on some important points of Dempster-Shafer theory (e.g., the role of Dempster's combination rule.)
