We introduce NetMagic to demonstrate the efficacy of RLI architecture RLI for the fine-grained per-flow latency measurements. In this demo, the main function of RLI is implemented in NetMagic, which is the key component of our experimental network comprising several computers and switches. We are going to show how NetMagic can provide rapid implementation and evaluation of RLI architecture that is difficult with commercial switch or router platforms. In the demo, the estimated fine-grained per-flow latency by RLI is monitored and dynamically presented. Further, the true latency with a resolution of 8ns is also provided by NetMagic for the evaluation. The efficacy of RLI architecture can be observed in a real-time fashion by the difference between estimated latencies and true ones.
