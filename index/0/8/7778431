Recent work in agency has explored the interactive nature of goal-driven behavior ("activity"). An interactive agent is responsive to events and is affected by and effects the context in which it exists. Our contention is that interaction is also an important characteristic of a reader. By treating reading as an activity, the reading agent can interact with the text, achieving goals and planning what to read, when to read, and how to read. This paper will discuss how reading within a context of activity provides goals and enables planning, thus creating the reading agent. The system described, SPRITe, reads natural language, primarily instructions, in order to facilitate other activities.
