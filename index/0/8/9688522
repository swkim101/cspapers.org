With the rapid proliferation of camera-equipped smart devices (e.g., smartphones, pads, tablets), visible light communication (VLC) over screen-camera links emerges as a novel form of near-field communication. Such communication via smart devices is highly competitive for its user-friendliness, security, and infrastructure-less (i.e., no dependency on WiFi or cellular infrastructure). However, existing approaches mostly focus on improving the transmission speed and ignore the transmission reliability. Considering the interplay between the transmission speed and reliability towards effective end-to-end communication, in this paper, we aim to boost the throughput over screen-camera links by enhancing the transmission reliability. To this end, we propose RDCode, a robust dynamic barcode which enables a novel packet-frame-block structure. Based on the layered structure, we design different error correction schemes at three levels: intra-blocks, inter-blocks and inter-frames, in order to verify and recover the lost blocks and frames. Finally, we implement RDCode and experimentally show that RDCode reaches a high level of transmission reliability (e.g., reducing the error rate to 10%) and yields a at least doubled transmission rate, compared with the existing state-of-the-art approach COBRA.
