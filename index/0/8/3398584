Populated IP addresses (PIP) -- IP addresses that are associated with a large number of user requests are important for online service providers to efficiently allocate resources and to detect attacks. While some PIPs serve legitimate users, many others are heavily abused by attackers to conduct malicious activities such as scams, phishing, and malware distribution. Unfortunately, commercial proxy lists like Quova have a low coverage of PIP addresses and offer little support for distinguishing good PIPs from abused ones. In this study, we propose PIPMiner, a fully automated method to extract and classify PIPs through analyzing service logs. Our methods combine machine learning and time series analysis to distinguish good PIPs from abused ones with over 99.6% accuracy. When applying the derived PIP list to several applications, we can identify millions of malicious Windows Live accounts right on the day of their sign-ups, and detect millions of malicious Hotmail accounts well before the current detection system captures them.
