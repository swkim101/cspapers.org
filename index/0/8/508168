Denial-of-service (DoS) research community lacks accurate metrics to evaluate an attack's impact on network services, its severity and the effectiveness of a potential defense. We propose several DoS impact metrics that measure the quality of service experienced by end users during an attack, and compare these measurements to application-specific thresholds. Our metrics are ideal for testbed experimentation, since necessary traffic parameters are extracted from packet traces gathered during an experiment.
