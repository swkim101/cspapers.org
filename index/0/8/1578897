Variants of delay-cost functions have been used in a class of technology mapping algorithms [1, 2, 3, 4]. We illustrate that in an industrial environment the delay-cost function can grow unboundedly and lead to very large runtimes. The key contribution of this work is a novel bounded compression algorithm. We introduce a concept of delaycost curve, ( -DC-curve) that requires upto exponentially less delay-cost points to be stored compared to that stored by the delay function. We prove that the solution obtained by this exponential compaction of the delay-function is bounded to % of the optimal solution. We also suggest a large set of CAD applications which may bene t from using -DC-curve. Finally, we demonstrate the e ectiveness of our compaction scheme on one such application, namely technology mapping for low power. Experimental results on industrial environment show that we are more than 17 times faster than [2] on certain MCNC circuit.
