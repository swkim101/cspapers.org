Drawing or dragging an object on a mobile device is annoying today because the latency is manifested spatially with an obvious gap between the touch point and the line head or dragged object. This work identifies the multiple synchronization points in the input to display path of modern mobile systems as a major source of latency, contributing about 30 ms to the overall latency. We present Presto, an asynchronous design of the input to display path. By focusing on the main application and relaxing conventional requirements of no frame drop and no tearing effects, Presto is able to eliminate much of the latency due to synchrony. By carefully guarding against consecutive frame drops and limiting the risk of tearing to a small region around the touch point, Presto is able to reduce their visual impact to barely noticeable. Using a prototype based on Android 5, we are able to quantify the effectiveness, overhead and user experience of Presto through both objective measurements and subjective user assessment. We show that Presto is able to reduce the latency of legacy Android applications by close to half; and more importantly, we show this reduction is orthogonal to that by other popular approaches. When combined with touch prediction, Presto is able to reduce the touch latency below 10 ms, a remarkable achievement without any hardware support.
