Users frequently experience situations in which their ability to differentiate screen colors is affected by a diversity of situations, such as when bright sunlight causes glare, or when monitors are dimly lit. However, designers currently have no way of choosing colors that will be differentiable by users of various demographic backgrounds and abilities and in the wide range of situations where their designs may be viewed. Our goal is to provide designers with insight into the effect of real-world situational lighting conditions on people's ability to differentiate colors in applications and imagery. We therefore developed an online color differentiation test that includes a survey of situational lighting conditions, verified our test in a lab study, and deployed it in an online environment where we collected data from around 30,000 participants. We then created ColorCheck, an image-processing tool that shows designers the proportion of the population they include (or exclude) by their color choices.
