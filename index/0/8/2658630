This paper proposes a probabilistic model for associative anaphora resolution in Japanese. Associative anaphora is a type of bridging anaphora, in which the anaphor and its antecedent are not coreferent. Our model regards associative anaphora as a kind of zero anaphora and resolves it in the same manner as zero anaphora resolution using automatically acquired lexical knowledge. Experimental results show that our model resolves associative anaphora with good performance and the performance is improved by resolving it simultaneously with zero anaphora.
