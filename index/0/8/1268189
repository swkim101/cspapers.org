This paper proposes a new template matching method that is robust to outliers and fast enough for real-time operation. The template and image are densely transformed in binary code form by projecting and quantizing histograms of oriented gradients. The binary codes are matched by a generic method of robust similarity applicable to additive match measures, such as Lp- and Hamming distances. The robust similarity map is computed efficiently via a proposed Inverted Location Index structure that stores pixel locations indexed by their values. The method is experimentally justified in large image patch datasets. Challenging applications, such as intra-category object detection, object tracking, and multimodal image matching are demonstrated.
