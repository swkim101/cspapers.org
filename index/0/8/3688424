This paper presents a new method to design digital circuits for low pattern counts, one of the key factors shaping cost-effective VLSI test schemes. The method identifies the largest conflicts between internal signals that prevent efficient test compaction in ATPG. These locations are modified by inserting conflict-reducing test points (CRTP) to significantly reduce the ATPG-produced pattern counts. Experimental results obtained for large industrial designs with on-chip test compression demonstrate, on average, 3x - 4x reduction in stuck-at and transition patterns and 3x shorter ATPG times.
