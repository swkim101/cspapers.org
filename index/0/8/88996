This paper outlines a dynamic theory of development and adaptation in neural networks with feedback connections. Given input ensemble, the connections change in strength according to an associative learning rule and approach a stable state where the neuronal outputs are decorrelated. We apply this theory to primary visual cortex and examine the implications of the dynamical decorrelation of the activities of orientation selective cells by the intracortical connections. The theory gives a unified and quantitative explanation of the psychophysical experiments on orientation contrast and orientation adaptation. Using only one parameter, we achieve good agreements between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data.
