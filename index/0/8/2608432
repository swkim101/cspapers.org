Extensional (table) constraints are an important tool for attacking combinatorial problems with constraint programming. Recently there has been renewed interest in fast propagation algorithms for these constraints. We describe the use of two alternative data structures for maintaining generalised arc consistency on extensional constraints. The first, the Next-Difference list, is novel and has been developed with this application in mind. The second, the trie, is well known but its use in this context is novel. Empirical analyses demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting approaches, both in GAC-schema, and in the watched-literal table constraint in Minion.
