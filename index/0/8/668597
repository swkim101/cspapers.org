The most obvious observable activities that accompany reading are the eye fixations on various parts of the text. Our laboratory has now developed the technology for automatically measuring and recording the sequence and duration of eye fixations that readers make in a fairly natural reading situation. This paper reports on research in progress to use our observations of this real reading behavior to construct computational models of the cognitive processes involved in natural reading.In the first part of this paper we consider some constraints placed on models of human language comprehension imposed by the eye fixation data. In the second part we propose a particular model whose processing time on each word of the text is proportional to human readers' fixation durations.
