This paper introduces the CableRobot simulator, which was developed at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA. The simulator is a completely novel approach to the design of motion simulation platforms in so far as it uses cables and winches for actuation instead of rigid links known from hexapod simulators. This approach allows to reduce the actuated mass, scale up the workspace significantly, and provides great flexibility to switch between system configurations in which the robot can be operated. The simulator will be used for studies in the field of human perception research and virtual reality applications. The paper discusses some of the issues arising from the usage of cables and provides a system overview regarding kinematics and system dynamics as well as giving a brief introduction into possible application use cases.
