Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) is a teaching and learning strategy based on the interaction between web-based study assignments and an active learner classroom. The essence of JiTT is the feedback loop formed by the students' preparation outside the classroom that shapes their in-class experience. The goal of JiTT is to use feedback to guide teaching and to empower and motivate learners. This paper describes a successful implementation of the JiTT strategy for an introductory computer science course.
