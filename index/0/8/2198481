Participatory design typically focuses on envisionment and evaluation activities. We explored a method for pushing the participatory activities further “upstream” in the design process, to the initial analysis of requirements. We used a variant of the task-artifact fi-arnework, carrying out a participatory claims analysis during a design workshop fm a project addressing collaborative science education. The analysis used videotaped classroom sessions as source material. The participant-teachers were highly engaged by the analysis process and contributed significantly to the analysis results. We conclude that the method has promise as a technique for evoking self-reflection and analysis in a participatory design setting.
