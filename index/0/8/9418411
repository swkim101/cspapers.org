This paper presents a system that retrieves descriptive phrases of proper nouns from free text. Sentences holding the specified noun are ranked using a technique based on pattern matching, word counting, and sentence location. No domain specific knowledge is used. Experiments show the system able to rank highly those sentences that contain phrases describing or defining the query noun. In contrast to existing methods, this system does not use parsing techniques but still achieves high levels of accuracy. From the results of a large-scale experiment, it is speculated that the success of this simpler method is due to the high quantities of free text being searched. Parallels between this work and recent findings in the very large corpus track of TREC are drawn.
