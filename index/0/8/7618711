This paper presents a new, relatively inexpensive method for detecting regions (e.g. loops and procedures) in a program where the memory hierarchy is performing poorly. By observing where actual measured execution time differs from the time predicted given a perfect memory system, we can isolate memory bottlenecks. MTOOL, an implementation of the approach aimed at applications programs running on MIPS-chip based workstations is described and results for some of the Perfect Club and SPEC benchmarks are summarized.
