We cannot use non-local features with current major methods of sequence labeling such as CRFs due to concerns about complexity. We propose a new perceptron algorithm that can use non-local features. Our algorithm allows the use of all types of non-local features whose values are determined from the sequence and the labels. The weights of local and non-local features are learned together in the training process with guaranteed convergence. We present experimental results from the CoNLL 2003 named entity recognition (NER) task to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.
