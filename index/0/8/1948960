A Survey of Introductory Computer Science Curricula Jeffrey Forbes Duke University forbes@cs.duke.edu Daniel D. Garcia University of California, Berkeley ddgarcia@cs.berkeley.edu SUMMARY Our field continues to be blessed (and plagued) with continual curriculum change, from languages to techniques (objects first) to perspectives (“sage on the stage” vs. “guide on the side”). Particular emphasis has been spent crafting and re-crafting our introductory curricula [1]. This makes sense, since that not only defines the foundation upon which our upper-division courses are based, but is exactly where we attract (or lose) our best students who had not considered majoring in computer science. With enrollments declining, retaining our fence-sitting prospective majors takes on that much more importance.
