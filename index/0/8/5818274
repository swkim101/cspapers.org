A paired robot system is developed for a class of tasks where two end-effectors work together; one placed inside and the other outside a confined box. The work was motivated by practical needs for aircraft wing box manufacturing and maintenance. Two robots, each carrying an end-effector, are engaged using strong magnets attracting each other and thereby supporting each body against gravity. The robots must move across the surface of the box, while avoiding interference with obstacles fixed to the surface. A novel paired robot with magnetic feet is presented that can flip and go over an obstacle while tightly holding each body against gravity. Furthermore, the paired robots can automatically be loaded and unloaded from the confined box through a small entry hole by flipping and sliding on the box surface. First the task conditions and functional requirements are described, and then the design concept of the flip-and-slide magnetic paired robots is presented. Kinematic and static models of the system are obtained, and the conditions for successful flipping and sliding are analyzed. Control algorithms for detaching as well as engaging magnetic feet are obtained. A prototype flip-and-slide paired robot system is designed and the feasibility of the approach is demonstrated.
