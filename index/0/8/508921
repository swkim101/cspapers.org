This paper deals with visually guided grasping of unmodeled objects for robots which exhibit an adaptive behavior based on their previous experiences. Nine features are proposed to characterize three-finger grasps. They are computed from the object image and the kinematics of the hand. Real experiments on a humanoid robot with a Barrett hand are carried out to provide experimental data. This data is employed by a classification strategy, based on the k-nearest neighbour estimation rule, to predict the reliability of a grasp configuration in terms of five different performance classes. Prediction results suggest the methodology is adequate.
