In the first part we discuss the problem of recovering the calibration of a network of pan-tilt-zoom cameras. The intrinsic parameters of each camera over its full range of zoom settings are estimated through a two step procedure. We first determine the intrinsic parameters at the camera's lowest zoom setting very accurately by capturing an extended panorama. The camera intrinsics are then determined at discrete steps in a monotonically increasing zoom sequence that spans the full zoom range of the cameras. Both steps are fully automatic and do not assume any knowledge of the scene structure. We validate our approach by calibrating two different types of pan tilt zoom cameras placed in an outdoor environment. We also show the high-resolution panoramic mosaics built from the images captured during this process. The second section deals with the calibration of omnidirectional cameras. A broad class of both central and non-central cameras, such as fish-eye and catadioptric cameras, can be reduced to 1D radial cameras under the assumption of known center of radial distortion. We study the multi-view geometry of 1D radial cameras. For cameras in general configuration, we introduce a quadrifocal tensor. From this tensor a metric reconstruction of the 1D cameras as well as the observed features can be obtained. In a second phase this reconstruction can then be used as a calibration object to estimate a non-parametric non-central model for the cameras. We study some degenerate cases, including pure rotation. In the case of a purely rotating camera we obtain a trifocal tensor. This allows us to obtain a metric reconstruction of the plane at infinity. Next, we use the plane at infinity as a calibration device to non-parametrically estimate the radial distortion.
