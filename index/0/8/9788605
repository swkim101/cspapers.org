This paper presents a solution to the problem of performance-driven buffered routing tree generation in electronic circuits. Using a novel bottom-up construction algorithm and a local neighborhood search strategy, this method finds the best solution of the problem in an exponential size solution subspace in polynomial time. The output is a hierarchical buffered rectilinear Steiner routing tree that connects the driver of a net to its sink nodes. The two variants of the problem, i.e. maximizing the driver required time subject to a total buffer area constraint and minimizing the total buffer area subject to a minimum driver required time constraint, are handled by propagating three-dimensional solution curves during the construction phase. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of this technique compared to the other solutions for this problem.
