Adaptive production systems are defined and used to illustrate adaptive techniques in production system construction. A learning paradigm is described with in the framework of adaptive production systems, and is applied to a simple rote learning task, a nonsense syllable association and discrimination task, and a serial pattern acquisition task. It is shown that with the appropriate production building mechanism, all three tasks can be solved using similar adaptive production system learning techniques.
