Program slicing is an analysis that answers questions such as “Which statements might affect the computation of variable 11 at stat.ement s?” or “Which statements depend on the value of u computed in statement s?“. The answers computed by program slicing are generally a set of statements. We introduce the idea of iteration spacing slicing: we refine program slicing to ask questions such as “Which iterations of which statements might effect. the computation in iterations I of statement R?” or “Which iterations of which statements depend on the value computed by iterations I of statement s?“. One application of this general-purpose technique is optimization of interprocessor communication in data-parallel compilers. For example, we can separate a code fragment into 1) those iterations that must be done before a send, 2) t,hose it,erations that don’t need to be done before a send and don’t depend on non-local data and 3), those iterations that depend on non-local data. We examine applications of iteration space slicing to communication optimizations in parallel executions of programs such as stencil computations and block-cyclic Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.
