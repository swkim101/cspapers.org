This work presents a study on the effects of different mem-ory sizes in the Minority Game (MG) market model [Zhang,1998]. We analyse the effects on an agent’s performancewhen this agent is endowed with a different memory size withrespect to other agents in the game. Our aim is to identify inwhich situations a large or small memory might be advanta-geous in the game. From the obtained results we argue thatthere exist convergence to and evolutionary stability aroundcertain memory sizes and we consider an evolutionary setupwhich conﬁrms our hypothesis.The MG is deﬁned as an odd number of agents ( N) whichmust choose at each turn of the game whether they will be inone of two possible groups. After all agents have made theirchoices, agents in the minority group are rewarded. In orderto make a decision, agents use an inductive learning algorithmin order to try to exploit patterns from previous outcomes.The number of past turns that agents consider to decide de-ﬁnes their memory size (M).One of the main properties in a MG is its efﬁciency , whichis evaluated by the statistical variance (σ
