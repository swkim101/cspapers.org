In this paper, we study the problem of applying data mining to facilitate the investigation of money laundering crimes (MLCs). We have identified a new paradigm of problems --- that of automatic community generation based on uni-party data, the data in which there is no direct or explicit link information available. Consequently, we have proposed a new methodology for Link Discovery based on Correlation Analysis (LDCA). We have used MLC group model generation as an exemplary application of this problem paradigm, and have focused on this application to develop a specific method of automatic MLC group model generation based on timeline analysis using the LDCA methodology, called CORAL. A prototype of CORAL method has been implemented, and preliminary testing and evaluations based on a real MLC case data are reported. The contributions of this work are: (1) identification of the uni-party data community generation problem paradigm, (2) proposal of a new methodology LDCA to solve for problems in this paradigm, (3) formulation of the MLC group model generation problem as an example of this paradigm, (4) application of the LDCA methodology in developing a specific solution (CORAL) to the MLC group model generation problem, and (5) development, evaluation, and testing of the CORAL prototype in a real MLC case data.
