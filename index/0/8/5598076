The computation of specific functions using the most general form of concurrentread-concurrent-write parallel RAM is considered. It is shown that such a machine can compute any function of Boolean inputs in time log n log log n + 0( 1) given a polynomial number of processors and memory cells and that this bound is tight for integer addition. Despite this evidence of the power of the model we show that a very simple function, namely parity, requires time Q (Jiogn) to compute given a polynomial bound on the number of processors, independent of the number of memory cells. 13‚Äù 1988 Academic Press, Inc
