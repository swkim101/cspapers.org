We present a system for protein crystal micromanipulation with focus on automated crystal mounting for the purposes of X-ray data collection. The system features a set of newly designed micropositioner end-effectors we call microshovels which address some limitations of the traditional cryogenic loops. We have used micro-electrical mechanical system (MEMS) techniques to design and manufacture various shapes and quantities of microshovels. Visual feedback from a camera mounted on the microscope is used to control the micropositioner as it lowers a microshovel into the liquid containing the crystals and approaches a selected crystal for pickup. We present experimental results that illustrate the applicability of our approach.
