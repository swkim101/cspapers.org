This paper describes our experiences incorporating Java in a Data Structures course. We describe the features of Java that made for a more interesting course, the difficulties that we encountered, and compare Java to the prior languages used in this course, Ada and C++. All in all, we found Java to be a reasonable, but not overwhelming better, alternative. Our students were particularly happy with the experiment.
