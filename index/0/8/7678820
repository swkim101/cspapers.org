This paper is in the nature of a challenge to a r t i f i c ia l intelligence experts. It suggests that the techniques of a r t i f i c ia l intelligence should be applied to some real ist ic problems which exist in the programming and data processing f ields. After a br ief review of the l i t tle related existing work which has been done, the character ist ics of programming problems which make them suitable for the application of a r t i f i c ia l intelligence techniques are given. Specif ic i l lustrat ions of problems are provided under the broad categories of data structure and organization, program structure and organizat ion, improvements and corrections of programs, and language.
