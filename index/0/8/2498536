In recent years, the amount of entities in large knowledge bases available on the Web has been increasing rapidly, making it possible to propose new ways of intelligent information access. Within the context of globalization, there is a clear need for techniques and systems that can enable multilingual and cross-lingual information access. In this paper, we present XKnowSearch!, a novel entity-based system for multilingual and cross-lingual information retrieval, which supports keyword search and also allows users to influence the search process according to their search intents. By leveraging the multilingual knowledge base on the Web, keyword queries and documents can be represented in their semantic forms, which can facilitate query disambiguation and expansion, and can also overcome the language barrier between queries and documents in different languages.
