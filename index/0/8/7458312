We present a new approximation algorithm based on an exact representation of the state space S, using decision diagrams, and of the transition rate matrix R, using Kronecker algebra, for a Markov model with K submodels. Our algorithm builds and solves K Markov chains, each corresponding to a different aggregation of the exact process, guided by the structure of the decision diagram, and iterates on their solution until their entries are stable. We prove that exact results are obtained if the overall model has a product-form solution. Advantages of our method include good accuracy, low memory requirements, fast execution times, and a high degree of automation, since the only additional information required to apply it is a partition of the model into the K submodels. As far as we know, this is the first time an approximation algorithm has been proposed where knowledge of the exact state space is explicitly used.
