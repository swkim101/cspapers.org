In this paper, for the first time, we model and extract the parasitic capacitance between TSVs and their surrounding wires in 3D IC. For a fast and accurate full-chip extraction, we propose a pattern-matching-based algorithm that considers the physical dimensions of TSVs and neighboring wires and captures their field interactions. Our extraction method is accurate within 1.9% average error for a full-chip-level design while requiring negligible runtime and memory compared with a field solver. We also observe that TSV-to-wire capacitance has a significant impact on the noise of TSV-based connections and the longest path delay. To reduce TSV-to-wire coupling, we present two full-chip optimization methods, i.e., increasing KOZ and guard ring protection that are shown to be highly effective in noise reduction with minimal overhead.
