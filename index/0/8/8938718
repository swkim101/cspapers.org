An effective means of retrieving relevant photographs from the web is to search for terms that would likely appear in the surrounding text in multimedia documents. In this paper, we investigate the complementary search strategy, where relevant multimedia documents are retrieved using the photographs they contain. We concentrate our efforts on the retrieval of large numbers of personal stories posted to Internet weblogs that are relevant to a particular search topic. Photographs are often included in posts of this sort, typically taken by the author during the course of the narrated events of the story. We describe a new story search tool, PhotoFall, which allows users to quickly find stories related to their topic of interest by judging the relevance of the photographs extracted from top search results. We evaluate the accuracy of relevance judgments made using this interface, and discuss the implications of the results for improving topic-based searches of multimedia content.
