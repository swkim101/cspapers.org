Systems with changeable mechanical properties show promise for expanding the applications of dynamic robots. We proposed the Torque-Angle Relationship Control System (TARCS) for musculoskeletal robots with changeable output properties. First, we formulated TARCS and examined its static properties. Next, we used TARCS to change the properties and investigated the effect of the same on the jumping ability through simulations. We found that TARCS in a biarticular muscle determined the general shape of the jumpable range. Furthermore, TARCS in a monoarticular muscle could change the amplitude of the jumpable range. Both TARCS also changed the directional property of the reaction to the disturbance. Finally, we developed a musculoskeletal quadruped robot in which TARCS was implemented. This robot could change its jumping direction using TARCS, and it jumped to a height of 0.254 m at the lowest point of its body.
