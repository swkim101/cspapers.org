Malware and phishing are two major threats for users seeking to perform security-sensitive tasks using computers today. To mitigate these threats, we introduce Unicorn, which combines the phishing protection of standard security tokens and malware protection of trusted computing hardware. The Unicorn security token holds user authentication credentials, but only releases them if it can verify an attestation that the user's computer is free of malware. In this way, the user is released from having to remember passwords, as well as having to decide when it is safe to use them. The user's computer is further verified by either a TPM or a remote server to produce a two-factor attestation scheme. We have implemented a Unicorn prototype using commodity software and hardware, and two Unicorn example applications (termed as uApps, short for Unicorn Applications), to secure access to both remote data services and encrypted local data. Each uApp consists of a small, hardened and immutable OS image, and a single application. Our Unicorn prototype co-exists with a regular user OS, and significantly reduces the time to switch between the secure environment and general purpose environment using a novel mechanism that removes the BIOS from the switch time.
