While domain adaptation (DA) aims to associate the learning tasks across data domains, heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA) particularly deals with learning from cross-domain data which are of different types of features. In other words, for HDA, data from source and target domains are observed in separate feature spaces and thus exhibit distinct distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel learning algorithm of Cross-Domain Landmark Selection (CDLS) for solving the above task. With the goal of deriving a domain-invariant feature subspace for HDA, our CDLS is able to identify representative cross-domain data, including the unlabeled ones in the target domain, for performing adaptation. In addition, the adaptation capabilities of such cross-domain landmarks can be determined accordingly. This is the reason why our CDLS is able to achieve promising HDA performance when comparing to state-of-the-art HDA methods. We conduct classification experiments using data across different features, domains, and modalities. The effectiveness of our proposed method can be successfully verified.
