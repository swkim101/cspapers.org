PHONY is a program to do phonological analysis. Within the generative model of grammar the function of the phonological component is to assign a phonetic representation to an utterance by modifying the underlying representations (URs) of its constituent morphemes. Morphemes are the minimal meaning units of language, i.e. the smallest units in the expression system which can be correlated with any part of the content system, e.g. un+tir+ing+ly. URs are abstract entities which contain the idiosyncratic information about pronounciations of morphemes.
