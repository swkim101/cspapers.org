We propose a novel version and implementation of the Policy-based Authority Evaluation Scheme (PAES) to protect data disseminated amongst the responders to an emergency situation when no network connectivity is available. In such situations Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) are used to disseminate the data by exploiting the peers' mobility in the area. However, existing DTN protection models require recipients to be known in advance. In emergency situations the data may instead be received by unknown responders who might need it while carrying out their duties. Existing data dissemination solutions such Enterprise Rights Management (ERM) systems rely on centralized architectures where recipients must contact the authorities that can grant access to data. Such centralized solutions cannot be deployed when connectivity cannot be guaranteed. Our solution combines data protection schemes such as ERM systems with DTNs. The result allows us to implement a distributed policy evaluation procedure for DTNs. Simulations demonstrate that the approach permits recipients to obtain fast access to protected data even when no authority can be contacted. This is particularly important in crisis situations where timely access to data is necessary.
