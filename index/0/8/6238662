The “concordance” of an information retrieval system can often be stored in form of bit-maps, which are usually very sparse and should be compressed. Hierarchical bit-vector compression consists of partitioning a vector <italic>v<subscrpt>i</subscrpt></italic> into equi-sized blocks, constructing a new bit-vector <italic>v<subscrpt>i</subscrpt></italic>+1 which points to the non-zero blocks in <italic>v<subscrpt>i</subscrpt></italic>, dropping the zero-blocks of <italic>v<subscrpt>i</subscrpt></italic>, and repeating the process for <italic>v<subscrpt>i</subscrpt></italic>+1. We refine the method by pruning some of the tree branches if they ultimately point to very few documents; these document numbers are then added to an appended list which is compressed by the prefix-omission technique. The new method was thoroughly tested on the bit-maps of the Responsa Retrieval Project, and gave a relative improvement of about 40% over the conventional hierarchical compression method.
