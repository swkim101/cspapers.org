This panel will focus on exploring future enhancements of Web technology for active Internet-scale information delivery and dissemination. It will ask the questions of whether the current Web technology is sufficient, what can be leveraged in this endeavor, and how a combination of ideas from a variety of existing disciplines can help in meeting the new challenges of large scale information dissemination. Relevant existing technologies and research areas include: active databases, agent systems, continual queries, event Web, publish/subscribe technology, sensor and stream data management. We expect that some suggestions may be in conflict with current, well-accepted approaches.
