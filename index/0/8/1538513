We conduct a study of the spatio-temporal dynamics of Twitter hashtags through a sample of 2 billion geo-tagged tweets. In our analysis, we (i) examine the impact of location, time, and distance on the adoption of hashtags, which is important for understanding meme diffusion and information propagation; (ii) examine the spatial propagation of hashtags through their focus, entropy, and spread; and (iii) present two methods that leverage the spatio-temporal propagation of hashtags to characterize locations. Based on this study, we find that although hashtags are a global phenomenon, the physical distance between locations is a strong constraint on the adoption of hashtags, both in terms of the hashtags shared between locations and in the timing of when these hashtags are adopted. We find both spatial and temporal locality as most hashtags spread over small geographical areas but at high speeds. We also find that hashtags are mostly a local phenomenon with long-tailed life spans. These (and other) findings have important implications for a variety of systems and applications, including targeted advertising, location-based services, social media search, and content delivery networks.
