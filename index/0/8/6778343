Software developers often face steep learning curves in using a new framework, library, or new versions of frameworks for developing their piece of software. In large organizations, developers learn and explore use of frameworks, rarely realizing, several peers may have already explored the same. A tool that helps locate samples of code, demonstrating use of frameworks or libraries would provide benefits of reuse, improved code quality and faster development. This paper describes an approach for locating common samples of source code from a repository by providing extensions to an information retrieval system. The approach improves the existing approaches in two ways. First, it provides the scalability of an information retrieval system, supporting search over thousands of source code files of an organization. Second, it provides more specific search on source code by preprocessing source code files and understanding elements of the code as opposed to considering code as plain text.
