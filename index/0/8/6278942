An important issue in the development of force guidance assembly strategies is the specification of an appropriate admittance control law. This paper identifies procedures for selecting the appropriate admittance to achieve reliable planar force-guided assembly for multi-point contact cases. Conditions that restrict the admittance behavior for each of the various types of two-point contact are presented. These conditions ensure that the motion that results from contact reduces part misalignment for each case. We show that, for bounded misalignments, if the conditions are satisfied for a finite number of contact configurations, the conditions ensure that force guidance is achieved for all configurations within the specified bounds.
