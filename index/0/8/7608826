MIMOSA is an experimental software for the automatic generation and optimization of microcode for horizontal microprogrammed computers. Achieving peak performance on this class of machines depends heavily upon efficient use of low-level parallelism. MIMOSA takes advantage from high level dependence analysis done by a front-end vectorizer. It translates a FORTRAN loop into horizontal microcode, combining several techniques of optimization such as vectorization, pipeline scheduling, microcode compaction. This paper explains how these different tools are coupled together when applied to simple regular loops.
