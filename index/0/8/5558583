We present CSbots, an ongoing program to use robots as educational tools in the Introduction to Computer Science CS1) course. We aim to use robotics to improve learning and retention by altering course work so that it is more relevant to students.
 In our development process we use an iterative cycle composed of design, pilot, and evaluation steps. We have completed the first of these cycles, the alpha cycle, and describe the robot hardware, software, and curriculum development processes as well as key evaluation results from pilots conducted at two community colleges in Fall 2007. We discuss the implications of these results and our experiences on the in-progress beta design cycle and planned pilots.
