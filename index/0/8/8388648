We present an activity recognition feature inspired by human psychophysical performance. This feature is based on the velocity history of tracked keypoints. We present a generative mixture model for video sequences using this feature, and show that it performs comparably to local spatio-temporal features on the KTH activity recognition dataset. In addition, we contribute a new activity recognition dataset, focusing on activities of daily living, with high resolution video sequences of complex actions. We demonstrate the superiority of our velocity history feature on high resolution video sequences of complicated activities. Further, we show how the velocity history feature can be extended, both with a more sophisticated latent velocity model, and by combining the velocity history feature with other useful information, like appearance, position, and high level semantic information. Our approach performs comparably to established and state of the art methods on the KTH dataset, and significantly outperforms all other methods on our challenging new dataset.
