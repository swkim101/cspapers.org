A data-parallel implementation on a SIMD platform of an operational numerical weather forecast model is presented. The performances of two popular numerical techniques within these models are discussed, namely finite difference (gridpoint) methods and spectral methods. In this paper in particular the performance achieved for a full production run is investigated. Also the price/performance ratios of several compute platforms for this forecast model are shown.
