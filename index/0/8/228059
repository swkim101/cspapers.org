The creation of excellent online teaching material is challenging because it requires that designers are able to apply learning theories and usability principles. In this paper we describe a web-based tutorial we developed to teach database students about SQL-like operators that can be used to access data in data warehouses (very large collections of data used by analysts). This paper describes the processes and methods used to develop the tutorial and the techniques we used to test prototypes of our tutorial. We show how ideas from user-centered design and learning theory can be usefully combined to create a new process for developing online teaching material that meets learning and usability aims.
