ReAgents are remotely executing agents that customize Web browsing for non-standard clients. A reAgent is essentially a one-shot" mobile agent that acts as an extension of a client dynamically launched by the client to run on its behalf at a remote more advantageous location. ReAgents simplify the use of mobile agent technology by transparently handling data migration and run-time network communications and provide a general interface for programmers to more easily implement their application-specific customizing logic. This is made possible by the identification of useful remote behaviors i.e. common patterns of actions that exploit the ability to process and communicate remotely. Examples of such behaviors are transformers monitors cachers and collators. In this paper we identify a set ofuseful reAgent behaviors for interacting with Web services via astandard browser describe how to program and use reAgents and show that the overhead of using reAgents is low and outweighed by its benefits.
