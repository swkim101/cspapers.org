We prove that for all integer k â‰¥ 3, there is a predicate P on k Boolean variables with 2~O(k1/3) accepting assignments that is approximation resistant even on satisfiable instances. That is, given a satisfiable CSP instance with constraint P, we cannot achieve better approximation ratio than simply picking random assignments. This improves the best previously known result by Hastad and Khot where the predicate has 2O(k1/2) accepting assignments. Our construction is inspired by several recent developments. One is the idea of using direct sums to improve soundness of PCPs, developed by Chan [5]. We also use techniques from Wenner [32] to construct PCPs with perfect completeness without relying on the d-to-1 Conjecture.
