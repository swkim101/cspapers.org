Guarded recursion in the sense of Nakano allows general recursive types and terms to be added to type theory without breaking consistency. Recent work has demonstrated applications of guarded recursion such as programming with codata, reasoning about coinductive types, as well as constructing and reasoning about denotational models of general recursive types. Guarded recursion can also be used as an abstract form of step-indexing for reasoning about programming languages with advanced features.
