The task of community detection over complex networks is of paramount importance in a multitude of applications. The present work puts forward a top-to-bottom community identification approach, termed DC-EgoTen, in which an egonet-tensor (EgoTen) based algorithm is developed in a divide-and-conquer (DC) fashion for breaking the network into smaller subgraphs, out of which the underlying communities progressively emerge. In particular, each step of DC-EgoTen forms a multi-dimensional egonet-based representation of the graph, whose induced structure enables casting the task of overlapping community identification as a constrained PARAFAC decomposition. Thanks to the higher representational capacity of tensors, the novel egonet-based representation improves the quality of detected communities by capturing multi-hop connectivity patterns of the network. In addition, the top-to-bottom approach ensures successive refinement of identified communities, so that the desired resolution is achieved. Synthetic as well as real-world tests corroborate the effectiveness of DC-EgoTen.
