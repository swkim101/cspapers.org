This article shows cutting-edge computer vision methods employed in advanced vision sensing technologies for medical, safety and security applications, where the human eye represents the object of interest for both the imager and the computer. As the eye scans the environment, or focuses on particular objects in the scene, the processor simultaneously localizes the eye position, tracks its position and movement over time, and infers counter measures such as fatigue level, attention level, and gaze direction in real-time and automatically. The focus of this demonstration is placed on four different algorithms: auto-initialization (RHED), eye position tracking (SIRAT), eye closure recognition (HRA), driver head pose categorization.
