Current search engines offer limited assistance for exploration and information discovery in complex search tasks. Instead, users are distracted by the need to focus their cognitive efforts on finding navigation cues, rather than selecting relevant information. Interactive intent modeling enhances the human information exploration capacity through computational modeling, visualized for interaction. Interactive intent modeling has been shown to increase task-level information seeking performance by up to 100%. In this demonstration, we showcase SciNet, a system implementing interactive intent modeling on top of a scientific article database of over 60 million documents.
