The formation of internet-based social networks has revived research on traditional social network models as well as interest-matching, or match-making, systems. In order to automate or augment the process of interest-matching, we describe a method for the comparison of preference orderings represented by CP-nets, which allows one to determine a shared interest level between agents. Empirical results suggest that this distance measure for preference orderings agrees with the intuitive assessment of shared interest levels.
