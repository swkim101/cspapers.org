A framework for describing semantic relationships among nodes in XML documents is presented. In contrast to earlier work, the XML documents may have ID references (i.e., they correspond to graphs and not just trees). A specific interconnection semantics in this framework can be defined explicitly or derived automatically. The main advantage of interconnection semantics is the ability to pose queries on XML data in the style of keyword search. Several methods for automatically deriving interconnection semantics are presented. The complexity of the evaluation and the satisfiability problems under the derived semantics is analyzed. For many important cases, the complexity is tractable and hence, the proposed interconnection semantics can be efficiently applied to real-world XML documents.
