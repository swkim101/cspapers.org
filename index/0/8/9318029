Multicast routing enables efficient data distribution to multiple recipients. However, existing work has concentrated on extending single-domain techniques to wide-area networks, rather than providing mechanisms to realize inter-domain multicast on a global scale in the Internet.We describe an architecture for inter-domain multicast routing that consists of two complementary protocols. The Multicast Address-Set Claim (MASC) protocol forms the basis for a hierarchical address allocation architecture. It dynamically allocates to domains multicast address ranges from which groups initiated in the domain get their multicast addresses. The Border-Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP), run by the border routers of a domain, constructs inter-domain bidirectional shared trees, while allowing any existing multicast routing protocol to be used within individual domains. The resulting shared tree for a group is rooted at the domain whose address range covers the group's address; this domain is typically the group initiator's domain. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of these complementary protocols through simulation.This architecture, together with existing protocols operating within each domain, is intended as a framework in which to solve the problems facing the current multicast addressing and routing infrastructure.
