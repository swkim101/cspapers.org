We present an automata model which concisely captures the constraints imposed by a data-path, such as bus hazards, register constraints, and control encoding limitations. A set of uniform base components for depicting general data-paths and techniques for systematic translation of such depictions into Boolean functions are described. Finally, this model is expanded to represent the limitations of generating as well as moving operands by incorporating data-flow graphs. The benefits of this representation are demonstrated by modeling a commercial DSP microprocessor.
