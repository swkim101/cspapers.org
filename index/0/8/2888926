AllInOneNews is the largest news metasearch engine in the world, connecting to over 1,000 news sites over 150 countries. Implementing a large-scale metasearch engine like AllInOneNews needs to overcome unique challenges not faced by building small metasearch engines such as developing highly scalable search engine selection techniques. In this paper, we discuss these unique challenges and our solutions to these challenges. We also discuss some novel features of AllInOneNews such as highly automated solution and semantic query match. This paper also reports the results of a comparative evaluation of three commercial news search systems, one search engine - Google News and two metasearch engines - Mamma News and AllInOneNews. Several measures such as effectiveness, diversity and time-sensitivity are used to perform the comparison. Another contribution of this paper is that we introduce a novel scheme to compare multiple news search systems in a combined measure that takes both relevance and time-sensitivity of retrieved information into consideration.
