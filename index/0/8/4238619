We study a class of synchronous, perfect-recall multi-agent systems with imperfect information and broadcasting, i.e., fully observable actions. We define an epistemic extension of strategy logic with incomplete information and the assumption of uniform and coherent strategies. In this setting, we prove that the model checking problem, and thus rational synthesis, is non-elementary decidable. We exemplify the applicability of the framework on a rational secret-sharing scenario.
