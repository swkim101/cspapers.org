In the last years, this new paradigm has been used for providing users with abstract (independent from technological and system-oriented aspects), effective, and reasoning-intensive mechanisms for querying the data residing at the information system sources. In this paper we argue that OBDA, besides querying data, provides the right principles for devising a formal approach to data quality. In particular, we concentrate on one of the most important dimensions considered both in the literature and in the practice of data quality, namely consistency. We define a general framework for data consistency in OBDA, and present algorithms and complexity analysis for several relevant tasks related to the problem of checking data quality under this dimension, both at the extensional level (content of the data sources), and at the intensional level (schema of the data sources).
