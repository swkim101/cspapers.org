In this paper, we consider the projection task (determining what does or does not hold after performing a sequence of actions) in a general setting where a solution to the frame problem may or may not be available, and where online information from sensors may or may not be applicable. We formally characterize the projection task for actions theories of this sort, and show how a generalized form of regression produces correct answers whenever it can be used. We characterize conditions on action theories, sequences of actions, and sensing information that are sufficient to guarantee that regression can be used, and present a provably correct regressionbased procedure in Prolog for performing the task under these conditions.
