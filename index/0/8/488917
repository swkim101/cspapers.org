This paper describes the software architecture of Stanley, an autonomous land vehicle developed for high-speed desert driving without human intervention. The vehicle recently won the DARPA Grand Challenge, a major robotics competition. The article describes the software architecture of the robot, which relied pervasively on state-of-the-art AI technologies, such as machine learning and probabilistic reasoning.
