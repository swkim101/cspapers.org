Because the efficiency of sparse codes is very much dependent on the size and structure of input data, peculiarities of the nonzero structures of sparse matrices must be accounted for in order to avoid unsatisfying performance. Usually, this implies retargeting a sparse application to specific instances of the same problem. However, if characteristics of the input data are collected at compile-time and used in the data structure selection and code generation by a compiler that converts dense programs into sparse programs automatically, the complexity of sparse code development can be greatly reduced, and an efficient way for this retargeting results. Such a “sparse compiler” requires an analysis engine, which is the topic of this paper.
