This paper introduces a smooth control algorithm for controlling fully actuated distributed manipulation systems that operate by frictional contact. The control law scales linearly with the number of actuators and is simple to implement. Moreover, we prove that control law has desirable robustness properties in the presence of the nonsmooth mechanics inherent in distributed manipulation systems that rely upon frictional contact. This algorithm has been implemented on an experimental distributed manipulation test-bed, whose structure is briefly reviewed. The experimental results confirm the validity and performance of the algorithm.
