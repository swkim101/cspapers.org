In this work, we present a brief overview of the Hypercycles which is a class of multidimensional graphs. These graphs can be used to structure Concurrent Multiprocessor Systems so as to best match the requirements of a given application. We present the backtrack-to-the-origin-andretry routing as applied to Hypercycles, as well as its performance evaluation based on simulations. Also, we present the a First Fit processor allocation strategy for Hypercycle-based Multiprocessors, and prove that such a strategy is statically optimal. Finally, we discuss the implementation status of a router component for the backtrackto-the-origin-and-retry routing.
