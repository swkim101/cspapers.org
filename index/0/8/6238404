We consider the vector fixed point equations arising out of the analysis of the saturation throughput of a single cell IEEE 802.11e wireless local area network with nodes that have different back-off parameters, including different Arbitration InterFrame Space (AIFS) values. We consider balanced and unbalanced solutions of the fixed point equations arising in homogeneous and nonhomogeneous networks. We are concerned, in particular, with (i) whether the fixed point is balanced within a class, and (ii) whether the fixed point is unique. Our simulations show that when multiple unbalanced fixed points exist in a homogeneous system then the time behaviour of the system demonstrates severe short term unfairness (or multistability). Implications for the use of the fixed point formulation for performance analysis are also discussed. We provide a condition for the fixed point solution to be balanced within a class, and also a condition for uniqueness. We then provide an extension of our general fixed point analysis to capture AIFS based differentiation; again a condition for uniqueness is established. An asymptotic analysis of the fixed point is provided for the case in which packets are never abandoned, and the number of nodes goes to âˆž. Finally the fixed point equations are used to obtain insights into the throughput differentiation provided by different initial back-offs, persistence factors, and AIFS, for finite number of nodes, and for differentiation parameter values similar to those in the standard.
