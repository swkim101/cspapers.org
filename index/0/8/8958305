Recent experimental data indicate that the strengthening or weakening of synaptic connections between neurons depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. A Hebbian synaptic modification rule based on these data leads to a stable state in which the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a neuron are balanced, producing an irregular pattern of firing. It has been proposed that neurons in vivo operate in such a mode.
