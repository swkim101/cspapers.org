We present NICE, a key-value storage system design that leverages new software-defined network capabilities to build cluster-based network-efficient storage system. NICE presents novel techniques to co-design network routing and multicast with storage replication, consistency, and load balancing to achieve higher efficiency, performance, and scalability. We implement the NICEKV prototype. NICEKV follows the NICE approach in designing four essential network-centric storage mechanisms: request routing, replication, consistency, and load balancing. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach brings significant performance gains compared to the current key-value systems design: up to 7× put/get performance improvement, up to 2× reduction in network load, 3× to 9× load reduction on the storage nodes, and the elimination of scalability bottlenecks present in current designs.
