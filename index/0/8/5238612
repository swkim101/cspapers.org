Generating alternative queries, also known as query suggestion, has long been proved useful to help a user explore and express his information need. In many scenarios, such suggestions can be generated from a large scale graph of queries and other accessory information, such as the clickthrough. However, how to generate suggestions while ensuring their semantic consistency with the original query remains a challenging problem.
 In this work, we propose a novel query suggestion algorithm based on ranking queries with the hitting time on a large scale bipartite graph. Without involvement of twisted heuristics or heavy tuning of parameters, this method clearly captures the semantic consistency between the suggested query and the original query. Empirical experiments on a large scale query log of a commercial search engine and a scientific literature collection show that hitting time is effective to generate semantically consistent query suggestions. The proposed algorithm and its variations can successfully boost long tail queries, accommodating personalized query suggestion, as well as finding related authors in research.
