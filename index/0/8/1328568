Our goal is to provide a sufficient schedulability test -ideally polynomial- for the scheduling of Non-Cyclic Generalized Multiframe Task Model using Fixed-Task-Priority schedulers. We report two first results: (i) we present and prove correct the critical instant for the Non-Cyclic Generalized Multiframe Task Model then (ii) we propose an algorithm which provides a sufficient (but pseudo-polynomial) schedulability test.
