The dynamic workspace and the motion plans for a micro biped walking robot are studied in the paper. The dynamic model and controller of an under-actuated walking robot system are developed. Two optimal navigation algorithms for the motion of the robot in the same plane without obstacles are developed, and optimality is proved. The motion of the robot is divided into normal motion status and transition status. The complete scheme to perform the two status and this real time implementation are presented. The dynamic simulation results and 2D-rendering of the robot navigation is given.
