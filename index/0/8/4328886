This paper presents the introduction of WordNet semantic classes in a dependency parser, obtaining improvements on the full Penn Treebank for the first time. We tried different combinations of some basic semantic classes and word sense disambiguation algorithms. Our experiments show that selecting the adequate combination of semantic features on development data is key for success. Given the basic nature of the semantic classes and word sense disambiguation algorithms used, we think there is ample room for future improvements.
