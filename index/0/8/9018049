We present Lumitrack, a novel motion tracking technology that uses projected structured patterns and linear optical sensors. Each sensor unit is capable of recovering 2D location within the projection area, while multiple sensors can be combined for up to six degree of freedom (DOF) tracking. Our structured light approach is based on special patterns, called m-sequences, in which any consecutive sub-sequence of m bits is unique. Lumitrack can utilize both digital and static projectors, as well as scalable embedded sensing configurations. The resulting system enables high-speed, high precision, and low-cost motion tracking for a wide range of interactive applications. We detail the hardware, operation, and performance characteristics of our approach, as well as a series of example applications that highlight its immediate feasibility and utility.
