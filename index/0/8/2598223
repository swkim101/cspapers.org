Dynamic, hierarchical, command menus are practical when 1) certain entered commands can be used to predict the following commands (in other words, when there exist commands that stimulate a change of menu) and 2) when a small, changing menu is preferable to a large menu that includes the entire command set. A project on possible menu form tested the relevance of the first of these criteria to a friendly graphics environment. The order in which commands were entered during production use of an IC design system was analyzed. Results not only indicate that the criterion is met, but also suggest the form of a possible dynamic menu.
