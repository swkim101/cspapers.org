A new model of a communication system was proposed which takes advantage of both Shannon's as well as Marko's models. Such a model was realized by turning our attention to the point that a two-way communication channel may be understood as a unidirectional channel changing its direction alternatively so long as short time duration is concerned. In contradiction to Marko's view that the Shannon's theory is a special case of Marko's theory, the author takes a view that both theories must be included in his new single model. 
 
Communication between three information nodes was also discussed as an example of multiple inter-locutional communications. The full paper will be divided into following parts. 1. Introduction 2. Shannon's Model 3. Marko's Model 4. Improved Model 5. Multiple Inter-Locutional Communications 6. Conclusion
