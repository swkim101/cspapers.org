In this paper we describe a computationally efficient approach to generating reduced-order models from PEEC-based three-dimensional electromagnetic analysis programs. It is shown that a recycled multipole-accelerated approach applied to recent model order reduction techniques requires nearly two orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations than direct techniques thus allowing the analysis of larger, more complex three-dimensional geometries.
