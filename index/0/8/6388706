In the past, the physical interconnection problem for digital computer circuits has been solved mostly without considering the electrical properties of the wires or, equivalently, the transfer function of the interconnections. Further, the semiconductor devices, which represent another part of the system, are designed using network analysis computer programs with only secondary considerations given to the interconnections. The purpose of this paper is to establish general relations between the physical and electrical aspects of the interconnection wiring design and to present an overview of the state of the art of interconnection analysis techniques.
