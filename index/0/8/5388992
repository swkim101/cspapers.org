The Common Lisp User Interface Environment (CLUE) is a portable system for user interface programming in Common Lisp. CLUE extends the X Window System to provide an architectural model for the construction of interactive Lisp applications. CLUE is also an objectoriented programming system based on the proposed Common Lisp Object System (CLOS). By emphasizing both simplicity for the application programmer and flexibility for the user interface programmer, CLUE supports the construction of higher-level user interface management systems. This paper describes the motivations for the design of CLUE and summarizes the features CLUE offers for programming user interfaces.
