The paper describes the image acquisition system able to capture images in two separated bands of light, used to underwater autonomous navigation. The channels are: the visible light spectrum and near infrared spectrum. The characteristics of natural, underwater environment were also described together with the process of the underwater image creation. The results of an experiment with comparison of selected images acquired in these channels are discussed.
