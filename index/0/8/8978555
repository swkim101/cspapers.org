We give new rounding schemes for the standard linear programming relaxation of the correlation clustering problem, achieving approximation factors almost matching the integrality gaps: For complete graphs our approximation is 2.06 - Îµ, which almost matches the previously known integrality gap of 2. For complete k-partite graphs our approximation is 3. We also show a matching integrality gap. For complete graphs with edge weights satisfying triangle inequalities and probability constraints, our approximation is 1.5, and we show an integrality gap of 1.2. Our results improve a long line of work on approximation algorithms for correlation clustering in complete graphs, previously culminating in a ratio of 2.5 for the complete case by Ailon, Charikar and Newman (JACM'08). In the weighted complete case satisfying triangle inequalities and probability constraints, the same authors give a 2-approximation; for the bipartite case, Ailon, Avigdor-Elgrabli, Liberty and van Zuylen give a 4-approximation (SICOMP'12).
