Lego Mindstorms is an inexpensive robotics system consisting of a microprocessor brick, various sensors and motors, and numerous Lego pieces. It can be programmed in a variety of languages, including Java and C++. Since its initial release in 1996, dozens of papers have been written on its use in computer science education. In fact, a recent search for “MindStorms” in the ACM Digital Library produced 271 hits. Many of these papers describe its use, one way or another, in laboratory settings. Numerous workshops on its use in CS education have been held, attended by hundreds of faculty. Yet the platform’s adoption is not as widespread as this level of interest would suggest. In fact, some early adopters of MindStorms have come to feel that the platform is not all that well suited to CS education, or at least that its supposed benefits have not been proven.
