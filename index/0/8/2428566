This paper presents a novel 3D modeling framework that reconstructs an indoor scene as a structured model from panorama RGBD images. A scene geometry is represented as a graph, where nodes correspond to structural elements such as rooms, walls, and objects. The approach devises a structure grammar that defines how a scene graph can be manipulated. The grammar then drives a principled new reconstruction algorithm, where the grammar rules are sequentially applied to recover a structured model. The paper also proposes a new room segmentation algorithm and an offset-map reconstruction algorithm that are used in the framework and can enforce architectural shape priors far beyond existing state-of-the-art. The structured scene representation enables a variety of novel applications, ranging from indoor scene visualization, automated floorplan generation, Inverse-CAD, and more. We have tested our framework and algorithms on six synthetic and five real datasets with qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
