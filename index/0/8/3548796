With more and more large networks becoming available, mining and querying such networks are increasingly important tasks which are not being supported by database models and querying languages. This paper wants to alleviate this situation by proposing a data model and a query language for facilitating the analysis of networks. Key features include support for executing external tools on the networks, flexible contexts on the network each resulting in a different graph, primitives for querying subgraphs (including paths) and transforming graphs. The data model provides for a closure property, in which the output of every query can be stored in the database and used for further querying.
