This paper will present a generalisation of chart parsing able to cope with the case where the object being parsed is a particular kind of diagram (a flowgraph) and the grammar is an appropriate type of graph grammar (a flowgraph grammar). A feature that often occurs in such diagrams is structure sharing. This paper also discusses the problem of diagram recognition in the case where structure sharing is allowed, noting that we want to permit structure sharing, but not enforce it.
