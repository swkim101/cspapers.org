Given an undirected graph or an Eulerian directed graph G and a subset S of its vertices, we show how to determine the edge connectivity C of the vertices in S in time O(C3 n log n+m). This algorithm is based on an efficient construction of tree packings which generalizes Edmonds' Theorem. These packings also yield a characterization of all minimal Steiner cuts of size C from which an efficient data structure for maintaining edge connectivity between vertices in S under edge insertion can be obtained. This data structure enables the efficient construction of a cactus tree for representing significant C-cuts among these vertices, called C-separations, in the same time bound. In turn, we use the cactus tree to give a fast implementation of an approximation algorithm for the Survivable Network Design problem due to Williamson, Goemans, Mihail and Vazirani.
