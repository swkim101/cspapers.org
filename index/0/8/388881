The paper studies hierarchical pursuit strategies for groups of mobile agents in the plane. It is shown that fascinating global patterns emerge from simple two-layer pursuit schemes, including rendezvous, uniform circular motion, complex circular motion, concentric circular motion, and concentric logarithmic spiral motion. Both rigorous analysis and simulations are provided.
