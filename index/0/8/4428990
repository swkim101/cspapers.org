This paper introduces a locality discriminating indexing (LDI) algorithm for document classification. Based on the hypothesis that samples from different classes reside in class-specific manifold structures, LDI seeks for a projection which best preserves the within-class local structures while suppresses the between-class overlap. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method isable to derives compact discriminating document representations for classification.
