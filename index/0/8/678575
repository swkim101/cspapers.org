This paper describes the new architecture for supporting the Teradata commercial VLDB on several new operating environments. We start with an overview of the Teradata database software architecture, specifically the Parallel Database Extensions (PDE) that serve as a layer between the NCR Unix OS and the database software. We then describe the challenges of implementing an Open PDE for several new platforms, (Microsoft Windows 2000, Linux, HP-UX, and Microsoft Windows XP). Finally we show some performance data to compare the original NCR Unix version with the new Open Version of PDE for Teradata using published one-terabyte TPC-R data.
