Conventional off-chip voltage regulators are typically bulky and slow, and are inefficient at exploiting system and workload variability using Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). On-die integration of voltage regulators has the potential to increase the energy efficiency of computer systems by enabling power control at a fine granularity in both space and time. The energy conversion efficiency of on-chip regulators, however, is typically much lower than off-chip regulators, which results in significant energy losses. Fine-grained power control and high voltage regulator efficiency are difficult to achieve simultaneously, with either emerging on-chip or conventional off-chip regulators. A voltage conversion framework that relies on a hierarchy of off-chip switching regulators and on-chip linear regulators is proposed to enable fine-grained power control with a regulator efficiency greater than 90%. A DVFS control policy that is based on a reinforcement learning (RL) approach is developed to exploit the proposed framework. Per-core RL agents learn and improve their control policies independently, while retaining the ability to coordinate their actions to accomplish system level power management objectives. When evaluated on a mix of 14 parallel and 13 multiprogrammed workloads, the proposed voltage conversion framework achieves 18% greater energy efficiency than a conventional framework that uses on-chip switching regulators. Moreover, when the RL based DVFS control policy is used to control the proposed voltage conversion framework, the system achieves a 21% higher energy efficiency over a baseline oracle policy with coarse-grained power control capability.
