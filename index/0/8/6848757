This paper presents MyExperience, a system for capturing both objective and subjective in situ data on mobile computing activities. MyExperience combines the following two techniques: 1) passive logging of device usage, user context, and environmental sensor readings, and 2) active context-triggered user experience sampling to collect in situ, subjective user feedback. MyExperience currently runs on mobile phones and supports logging of more than 140 event types, including: 1) device usage such as communication, application usage, and media capture, 2) user context such as calendar appointments, and 3) environmental sensing such as Bluetooth and GPS. In addition, user experience sampling can be targeted to moments of interest by triggering off sensor readings. We present several case studies of field deployments on people's personal phones to demonstrate how MyExperience can be used effectively to understand how people use and experience mobile technology.
