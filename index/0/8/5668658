Multi-processor systems are becoming more commonplace and affordable. Based on analyses of actual parsings, we argue that to exploit the capabilities of such machines, unification-based grammar parsers should distribute work at the level of individual unification operations. We present a generic approach to parallel chart parsing that meets this requirement, and show that an implementation of this technique for LinGO achieves considerable speedups.
