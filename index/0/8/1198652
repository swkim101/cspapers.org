In particular, inner regions represent subsets of the search space in which all points are solutions. Our main contribution is the use of recent and new inner region extraction algorithms in the upper bounding phase of constrained global optimization. Convexification is a major key for efficiently lower bounding the objective function. We have adapted the convex interval taylorization proposed by Lin and Stadherr for producing a reliable outer and inner polyhedral approximation of the solution set andÂ  alinearization of the objective function. Other original ingredients are part of our optimizer, including an efficient interval constraint propagation algorithm exploiting monotonicity of functions. We end up with a new framework for reliable continuous constrained global optimization. Our interval B&B is implemented in the interval-based explorer Ibex and extends this free C++ library. Our strategy outperforms the best reliable global optimizers.
