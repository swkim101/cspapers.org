Despite outperforming humans in many tasks, deep neural network models are also criticized for the lack of transparency and interpretability in decision making. The opaqueness results in uncertainty and low confidence when deploying such a model in model sharing scenarios, where the model is developed by a third party. For a supervised machine learning model, sharing training process including training data is a way to gain trust and to better understand model predictions. However, it is not always possible to share all training data due to privacy and policy constraints. In this paper, we propose a method to disclose a small set of training data that is just sufficient for users to get the insight into a complicated model. The method constructs a boundary tree using selected training data and the tree is able to approximate the complicated deep neural network models with high fidelity. We show that data point pairs in the tree give users significantly better understanding of the model decision boundaries and paves the way for trustworthy model sharing.
