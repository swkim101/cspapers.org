We have completed the collection of one of the richest accurately annotated mobile dataset of modes of transportation and locomotion. To do this, we developed a highly reliable Android application called DataLogger capable of recording multisensor data from multiple synchronized smartphones simultaneously. The application allows real-time data annotation. We explain how we designed the app to achieve high reliability and ease of use. We also present an evaluation of the application in a big-data collection (750 hours, 950 GB of data, 17 different sensor modalities), analysing the data loss (less than 0.4%) and battery consumption (â‰ˆ 6% on average per hour). The application is available as open source.
