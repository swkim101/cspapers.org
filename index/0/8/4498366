The localization of a radioactive source can be solved in closed-form using 4 ideal sensors and the Apollonius circle in a noise- and error-free environment. When measurement errors and noise such as background radiation are considered, a larger number of sensors is needed to produce accurate results, particularly for extremely low source intensities. In this paper, we present an efficient fusion algorithm that can exploit measurements from n sensors to improve the localization accuracy, and show how the accuracy scales with n. We report testbed results for a 0.911 μCi source to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, in particular performance comparisons with state-of-the-art fusion algorithms based on Mean of Estimates (MoE) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We show that ITP is more accurate than MoE, whereas the choice between ITP and MLE is generally a tradeoff between accuracy and run time efficiency. Higher-intensity radioactive sources are not safe for actual experiments. In this case, we present simulation results based on a validated simulation model. We show that a low-intensity 400 μCi source, similar to the radioactivity of a concealed dirty bomb, can be localized to within 32.5 m using a sensor density of about 1 per 1100 m2 in a surveillance area.
