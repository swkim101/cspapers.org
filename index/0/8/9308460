In this paper, we present an approach for the introduction of problem solving and algorithm development in the first computer science course. Our technique is a more formal and systematic approach to programming based on generalizing a pattern after studying and expanding on a sequence of specific problem instances. In our approach, the algorithm and justification of its correctness are developed together.
