Networks composed of mobile nodes inherently suffer from intermittent connections and high delays. Performance can be improved by adding supporting infrastructure, including base stations, meshes, and relays, but the cost-performance trade-offs of different designs is poorly understood. To examine these trade-offs, we have deployed a large-scale vehicular network and three infrastructure enhancement alternatives. The results of these deployments demonstrate some of the advantages of each kind of infrastructure; however, these conclusions can be applied only to other networks of similar characteristics, including size, wireless technologies, and mobility patterns. Thus we complement our deployment with a demonstrably accurate analytical model of large-scale networks in the presence of infrastructure.
 Based on our deployment and analysis, we make several fundamental observations about infrastructure-enhanced mobile networks. First, if the average packet delivery delay in a vehicular deployment can be reduced by a factor of two by adding x base stations, the same reduction requires 2x mesh nodes or 5x relays. Given the high cost of deploying base stations, relays or mesh nodes can be a more cost-effective enhancement. Second, we observe that adding small amount of infrastructure is vastly superior to even a large number of mobile nodes capable of routing to one another, obviating the need for mobile-to-mobile disruption tolerant routing schemes.
