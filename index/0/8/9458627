We present designs for in-circuit monitoring of custom hardware designs implemented in reconfigurable hardware. The monitors check hardware designs against temporal logic specifications. Compared to previous work, which uses custom hardware to monitor software, our designs can run at higher speeds and make better use of hardware resources, such as shift registers and embedded memory blocks. We evaluate our monitor circuits on example hardware designs targeting FPGA implementation, showing that they have low overhead in terms of circuit area, and can run at the same speed as the circuits they monitor.
