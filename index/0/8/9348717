We consider the problem of high-speed I/O for a single application running on multiple nodes of a distributed-memory parallel computer. Our model is that the parallel system is connected to an I/O system that provides the interface between the internal connections of the parallel system and one or more external connections, such as HIPPI links. We identify two primary operations for this I/O system: scattering data from a high speed link across several lower speed links and gathering data from multiple links onto a single high speed link. We show that these core operations are the basis of the I/O system, independent of the relative speeds of the internal and external connections.
We identify several architectural features that are critical for supporting high-speed scatter and gather operations. They include flexible routing methods in the parallel system, low overhead communication, and the ability to support multiple data streams in and out of the memory on the I/O node.
