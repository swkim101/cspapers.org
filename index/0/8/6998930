New single-machine environments are emerging from abundant computation available through multiple cores and secure virtualization. In this paper, we describe the research challenges and opportunities around diversified replication as a method to increase the Byzantine-fault tolerance (BFT) of single-machine servers to software attacks or errors. We then discuss the design space of BFT protocols enabled by these new environments.
