Capitalizing on the intuitive underlying assumptions of Language Modelling for Ad-Hoc Retrieval we present a novel approach that is capable of injecting the user's context of the document collection into the retrieval process. The preliminary findings from the evaluation undertaken suggest that improved IR performance is possible under certain circumstances. This motivates further investigation to determine the extent and significance of this improved performance.
