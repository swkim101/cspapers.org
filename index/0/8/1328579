We propose a concept of reinforceable-muscle humanoid with hyper parallel muscle-tendon systems. By the facilitation of changing the assignment of actuators, we can easily strengthen a specific part of robot body, while changing the arrangement of actuators of current humanoid robots is quite difficult. By developing muscle units in each of which a motor and sensors are integrated, and by adopting musculo-skeletal structure, the rearrangeability of muscles has been realized. This paper describes the concept, prototype design and implementation of the reinforceable muscle humanoid, and the evaluating experiment by a musculo-skeletal humanoid is presented.
