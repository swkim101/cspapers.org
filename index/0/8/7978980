Typical visual servoing control objectives are formulated by the desire to position/orient a camera based on a reference image obtained by a priori positioning the camera in the desired location. In this paper, projective geometric techniques are used to formulate a visual servo control problem based on a cooperative camera scheme that provides an alternative to the typical "teach by showing" methodology. Specifically, by using a second camera with zoom capabilities, the proposed "teach by zooming" alternative approach eliminates the need for the camera to be a priori positioned in the desired location. To achieve this result, development is provided that illustrates how cameras with different intrinsic parameters can be used (i.e., camera independent). Control objectives are developed for cases when the intrinsic camera calibration matrices for the camera-in-hand and fixed camera are both known or both unknown.
