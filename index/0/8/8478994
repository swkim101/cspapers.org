This paper introduces a lightweight, scalable and accurate framework, called Meridian, for performing node selection based on network location. The framework consists of an overlay network structured around multi-resolution rings, query routing with direct measurements, and gossip protocols for dissemination. We show how this framework can be used to address three commonly encountered problems, namely, closest node discovery, central leader election, and locating nodes that satisfy target latency constraints in large-scale distributed systems without having to compute absolute coordinates. We show analytically that the framework is scalable with logarithmic convergence when Internet latencies are modeled as a growth-constrained metric, a low-dimensional Euclidean metric, or a metric of low doubling dimension. Large scale simulations, based on latency measurements from 6.25 million node-pairs as well as an implementation deployed on PlanetLab show that the framework is accurate and effective.
