During the core development phases, managers and software developers rightfully focus on the activities needed to complete the software's first release. They strive to minimize the project risk and to keep the schedule.
 The management of future releases, version identification, compatibility checks, migration and update strategies are often treated as an afterthought. In many systems this amount of naivety is what brings a project forward: solving the problems at their time. However, insufficiencies or inconsistencies here have all the potential to cause trouble once the software has met the customer.
