Based on a theoretical approach, we tried to implement a system for assistance to a programmer during the most difficult phase of the programming activity: software design. As we carried out the system project, it become apparent that the system could encompass more than just program design. In the paper, the main ideas of the theoretical approach are outlined. Briefly described is the state-oriented architecture of the system. The system structure is also presented.
