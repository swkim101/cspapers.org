Cellular networks are constantly evolving due to frequent changes in radio access and end user equipment technologies, applications, and traffic. Network upgrades should be performed with extreme caution since millions of users heavily depend on the cellular networks. Before upgrading the entire network, it is important to conduct field evaluation of upgrades.The choice and number of field test locations have significant impact on the time-to-market and confidence in how well various network upgrades will work out in the rest of the network. We propose a novel approach -- Reflection to automatically determine where to conduct the upgrade field tests to accurately identify important features that affect the upgrade and predict for the performance of untested locations. We demonstrate its effectiveness using real traces collected from a major US cellular network as well as synthetic traces.
