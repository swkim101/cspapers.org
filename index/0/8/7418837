Collusion-secure fingerprinting codes are an important primitive used by many digital watermarking schemes [1, 10, 9]. Boneh and Shaw [3] define a model for these types of codes and present an explicit construction. Their code has length <i>O</i>(<i>c</i><sup>3</sup> log(l/ε)) and attains security against coalitions of size <i>c</i> with ε error. Boneh and Shaw also present a lower bound of Ω (<i>c</i><sup>3</sup>log(1/<i>c</i>ε)) on the length of any collusion-secure code.We give new lower bounds on the length of collusion-secure codes by analyzing a weighted coinflipping strategy for the coalition. As an illustration of our methods, we give a simple proof that the Boneh-Shaw construction cannot be asymptotically improved. Next, we prove a general lower bound: no secure code can have length <i>O</i>(<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>1og(1/<i>c</i>ε)), which improves the previous known bound by a factor of <i>c</i>. In particular, we show that any secure code will have length Ω(<i>c</i><sup>2</sup> log(1/<i>c</i>ε)) as long as log(l/ε) ≥ <i>K</i> <i>k</i> log <i>c</i>, where <i>K</i> is a constant and <i>k</i> is the number of columns in the code (in some sense, a measure of the code's complexity). Finally, we describe a general paradigm for constructing fingerprinting codes which encompasses the construction of [3], and show that no secure code that follows this paradigm can have length <i>O</i>((c<sup>3</sup>/log c) log(1/<i>c</i>ε)) follows this (again, by showing a lower bound for large values of ln(1/ε)). This suggests that any attempts at improvement should be directed toward techniques that lie outside our paradigm.
