In this work, we present ChildSafe, a classification system which exploits human skeletal features collected using a 3D depth camera to classify visual characteristics between children and adults. ChildSafe analyzes the histograms of training samples and implements a bin-boundary-based classifier. We train and evaluate ChildSafe using a large dataset of visual samples collected from 150 elementary school children and 43 adults, ranging in the ages of 7 and 50. Our results suggest that ChildSafe successfully detects children with a proper classification rate of up to 97%, a false negative rate of as low as 1.82%, and a low false positive rate of 1.46%. We envision this work as an effective sub-system for designing various child protection applications.
