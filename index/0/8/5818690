This paper presents a hybrid system for route planning. The system is composed of two principal modules: a case based reasoning (CBR) and a genetic module. The CBR module responsible for the user interface. It retrieves the solutions founded by the genetic module, and adapts these solutions to the user preferences. The genetic module is responsible for generating new routes, based on the shortest path between the origin and destination points. 1
