We formulate the regression problem as one of maximizing the minimum probability, symbolized by Ω, that future predicted outputs of the regression model will be within some ±e bound of the true regression function. Our formulation is unique in that we obtain a direct estimate of this lower probability bound Ω. The proposed framework, minimax probability machine regression (MPMR), is based on the recently described minimax probability machine classification algorithm [Lanckriet et al.] and uses Mercer Kernels to obtain nonlinear regression models. MPMR is tested on both toy and real world data, verifying the accuracy of the Ω bound, and the efficacy of the regression models.
