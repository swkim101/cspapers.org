Convolution tree kernel has shown promising results in semantic role classification. However, it only carries out hard matching, which may lead to over-fitting and less accurate similarity measure. To remove the constraint, this paper proposes a grammardriven convolution tree kernel for semantic role classification by introducing more linguistic knowledge into the standard tree kernel. The proposed grammar-driven tree kernel displays two advantages over the previous one: 1) grammar-driven approximate substructure matching and 2) grammardriven approximate tree node matching. The two improvements enable the grammardriven tree kernel explore more linguistically motivated structure features than the previous one. Experiments on the CoNLL-2005 SRL shared task show that the grammardriven tree kernel significantly outperforms the previous non-grammar-driven one in SRL. Moreover, we present a composite kernel to integrate feature-based and tree kernel-based methods. Experimental results show that the composite kernel outperforms the previously best-reported methods.
