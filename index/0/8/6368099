We study the effect of user supplied relevance feedback in improving web search results. Rather than using query refinement or document similarity measures to rerank results, we show that the web-graph distance between two documents is a robust measure of their relative relevancy. We demonstrate how the use of this metric can improve the rankings of result URLs, even when the user only rates one document in the dataset. Our research suggests that such interactive systems can significantly improve search results.
