In many entity extraction applications, the entities to be recognized are constrained to be from a list of "target entities". In many cases, these target entities are (i) ad-hoc, i.e., do not exist in a knowledge base and (ii) homogeneous (e.g., all the entities are IT companies). We study the following novel disambiguation problem in this unique setting: given the candidate mentions of all the target entities, determine which ones are true mentions of a target entity. Prior techniques only consider target entities present in a knowledge base and/or having a rich set of attributes. In this paper, we develop novel techniques that require no knowledge about the entities except their names. Our main insight is to leverage the homogeneity constraint and disambiguate the candidate mentions collectively across all documents. We propose a graph-based model, called MentionRank, for that purpose. Furthermore, if additional knowledge is available for some or all of the entities, our model can leverage it to further improve quality. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on targeted entity disambiguation for ad-hoc entities.
