As our economy and critical infrastructure increasingly relies on the Internet, the insecurity of the underlying border gateway routing protocol (BGP) stands out as the Achilles heel. Recent misconfigurations and attacks have demonstrated the brittleness of BGP. Securing BGP has become a priority.In this paper, we focus on a viable deployment path to secure BGP. We analyze security requirements, and consider tradeoffs of mechanisms that achieve the requirements. In particular, we study how to secure BGP update messages against attacks. We design an efficient cryptographic mechanism that relies only on symmetric cryptographic primitives to guard an ASPATH from alteration, and propose the Secure Path Vector (SPV) protocol. In contrast to the previously proposed S-BGP protocol, SPV is around 22 times faster. With the current effort to secure BGP, we anticipate that SPV will contribute several alternative mechanisms to secure BGP, especially for the case of incremental deployments.
