We adapt the popular LDA topic model (Blei et al., 2003) to the representation of stylistic lexical information, evaluating our model on the basis of human-interpretability at the word and text level. We show, in particular, that this model can be applied to the task of inducing stylistic lexicons, and that a multi-dimensional approach is warranted given the correlations among stylistic dimensions.
