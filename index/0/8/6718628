SPROUTÂ² is a query answering system that allows users to ask structured queries over tables embedded in Web pages, over Google Fusion tables, and over uncertain tables that can be extracted from answers to Google Squared. At the core of this service lies SPROUT, a query engine for probabilistic databases. This demonstration allows users to compose and ask ad-hoc queries of their choice and also to take a tour through the system's capabilities along pre-arranged scenarios on, e.g., movie actors and directors, biomass facilities, or leveraging corporate databases.
