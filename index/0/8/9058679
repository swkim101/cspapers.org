In dark silicon chips, a significant amount of on-chip resources cannot be simultaneously powered on and need to stay dark, i.e., power gated, in order to avoid thermal emergencies. This paper presents a resource management technique, called DsRem, that selects the number of active cores jointly with their voltage/frequency (v/f) levels, considering the high Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) or Thread Level Parallelism (TLP) nature of different applications, in order to maximize the overall system performance. DsRem leverages the positioning of dark cores, to efficiently dissipate the heat generated by the active cores. This facilitates increasing the v/f level of the active cores, which leads to further performance improvement. Compared to state-of-the-art thermal-aware task application mapping, DsRem achieves up to 46% performance gain, while avoiding any thermal emergencies. Additionally, DsRem outperforms the boosting technique with 26%.
