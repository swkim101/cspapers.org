Perceptual learning is defined as fast improvement in performance and retention of the learned ability over a period of time. In a set of psychophysical experiments we demonstrated that perceptual learning occurs for the discrimination of direction in stochastic motion stimuli. Here we model this learning using two approaches: a clustering model that learns to accommodate the motion noise, and an averaging model that learns to ignore the noise. Simulations of the models show performance similar to the psychophysical results.
