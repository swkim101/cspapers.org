HMCS (Heterogeneous Multi-Computer System) is a new parallel processing platform combining massively parallel processors for continuum simulation and particle simulation to realize multi-scale computational physics simulations. We are constructing a prototype system of HMCS with a general purpose scientific parallel processor CP-PACS and a gravity calculation parallel processor GRAPE-6 connecting them via commodity-base parallel network.On the prototype of HMCS, a microscopic gravity calculation on GRAPE-6 and a macroscopic radiation hydrodynamic calculation on CP-PACS are performed simultaneously to realize very detailed simulation on computational astrophysics. Both systems are connected via parallel network controlling system named PIO (Parallel I/O System).In this paper, we report the overall concept, design and implementation of HMCS, and our application result for radiative transfer smoothed particle hydrodynamics with self gravity for analysis of galaxy generation.
