Networks for reconstructing a sparse or noisy function often use an edge field to segment the function into homogeneous regions, This approach assumes that these regions do not overlap or have disjoint parts, which is often false. For example, images which contain regions split by an occluding object can't be properly reconstructed using this type of network. We have developed a network that overcomes these limitations, using support maps to represent the segmentation of a signal. In our approach, the support of each region in the signal is explicitly represented. Results from an initial implementation demonstrate that this method can reconstruct images and motion sequences which contain complicated occlusion.
