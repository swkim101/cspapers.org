Evaluating network components such as network intrusion detection systems, firewalls, routers, or switches suffers from the lack of available network traffic traces that on the one hand are appropriate for a specific test environment but on the other hand have the same characteristics as actual traffic. Instead of just capturing traffic and replaying the trace, we identify a set of packet trace manipulation operations that enable us to generate a trace bottom-up: our trace primitives can be traces from different environments or artificially generated ones; our basic operations include merging of two traces, moving a flow across time, duplicating a flow, and stretching a flow's time-scale. After discussing the potential as ell as the dangers of each operation with respect to analysis at different protocol layers, we present a framework within which these operations can be realized and show an example configuration for our prototype.
