Conceptual graphs are both a language for representing knowledge and patterns for constructing models. They form models in the AI sense of structures that approximate some actual or possible system in the real world. They also form models in the logical sense of structures for which some set of axioms are true. When combined with recent developments in nonstandard logic and semantics, conceptual graphs can form a bridge between heuristic techniques of AI and formal techniques of model theory.
