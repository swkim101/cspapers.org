Information in today's enterprises commonly resides in a variety of heterogeneous data sources, including relational databases, web services, files, packaged applications, and custom data repositories. BEA's enterprise information integration product, Liquid Data for WebLogic, takes an XML-based approach to providing integrated access to such heterogeneous information. This demonstration highlights the XML technologies involved - including web services, XQuery, and XML Schema - and shows how they can be brought to bear on the enterprise information integration problem. The demonstration uses a simple end-to-end example, one that involves integrating data from relational databases and web services, to walk the audience through the overall architecture, XML-based data modeling approach, programming model, declarative query and view facilities, and distributed processing features of Liquid Data.
