Fall prevention is one of the most important functions of walking assistance devices for user's safety. It is preferable that these devices obviates factors which induce falling over rather than helping them recovering from falling motion. Tandem stance, where both legs form a line along walking direction, is a factor of falling. It is often observed in turning motion because a swing leg moves in lateral direction as well as forward. Generally, upper body's turning of a person proceeds before lower limb's turning during walking, and the behavior of the lower limb is constrained by upper body turning. It is thus possible to control behavior of the lower limb for tandem stance prevention by constraining behavior of the upper body. This paper therefore introduces a tandem stance prevention method for safer walk of the elderly or physically challenged person. The method adjusts admittance of cane robot's turning motion according to the positions of a support leg and a swing leg. The cane robot measures user's leg position and estimates a walk phase of the user. By adjusting an admittance model of the cane robot based on the walk phase, the cane robot resists to turn while support leg is on the same side of the turning direction. As a result, the tandem stance is avoided. Through experiments, we confirmed that the cane robot successfully controls user's upper body's behavior to prevent the user from being in tandem stance.
