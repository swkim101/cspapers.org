This paper presents a first step towards a unifying framework for Knowledge Discovery in Databases. We describe links between data mining, knowledge discovery, and other related fields. We then define the KDD process and basic data mining algorithms, discuss application issues and conclude with an analysis of challenges facing practitioners in the field.
