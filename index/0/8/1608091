Computerised mfonnation spaces evolved using the Boolean logic paradigm for retrieval of their stored mfonnatitm. While many studies have looked at ways to improve training to enable users to create queries appropriate to their infomlation need, little attention has been paid to users' cognitive models of the mfonnation Tlus research shows that when people can illustrate their queries graplucally, they have at least two quite different mental models. These incorporate the information space they are working with and the particular approach applied to their search This paper presents the tlndings to date and indicates the additional avenues which we believe warrant investigation.
