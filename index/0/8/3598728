Developments for 3D control of the center of mass (CoM) of biped robots are currently located in two local minima: on the one hand, methods that allow CoM height variations but only work in the 2D sagittal plane; on the other hand, nonconvex direct transcriptions of centroidal dynamics that are delicate to handle. This paper presents an alternative that controls the CoM in 3D via an indirect transcription that is both low-dimensional and solvable fast enough for real-time control. The key to this development is the notion of boundedness condition, which quantifies the capturability of 3D CoM trajectories.
