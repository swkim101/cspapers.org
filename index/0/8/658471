Yatin Saraiya Bellcore yatin~bellcore.com Several recently-proposed query languages have extended relational languages to a data model that involves nested records and sets, as ameansof combining the declarative and object-oriented paradigms. These proposals have been converging, indicating a core set of operations that seem essential to any such language. Optimization is an essential ingredient in the success of any declarative query language, and the propagation of query information into a view definition is an important component of most current optimization strategies for declarative languages. We address the optimization of the emerging languages , in the context of one such language V, which has been developed and implemented at Bellcore. Our basic contribution is the introduction of a technique that takes advantage of static type in ferencing in V to perform data flow analysis [2] on queries. This technique permits the modification or deletion of irrelevant expressions in the language, and has two basic applications. The first application is projection propagation , which is likely to be of significant use in nested-relational languages since expressions that manipulate nested data are likely to be nested. The second application is dead code elimination. Our technique is based on the signature of an expression rather than on the semantics (for exarriple, it does not distinguish between the tests A = B and A # I?), and we expect that it will scale up gracefully to more expressive data models and languages.
