There are many entity-attribute tables on the Web that can be utilized for enriching the entities of an RDF knowledge base. This requires the schema mapping (matching) between the Web tables and the RDF knowledge base. In this paper, we propose a feasible solution that is able to automatically search and rank entity-attribute tables from the Web, and effectively map the extracted tables with the RDF knowledge base with very few manual efforts.
