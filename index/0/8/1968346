The recently proposed masked logic style iMDPL seems to eradicate many of the latest points of criticism against masked logic styles in general. By means of a prototype chip containing different implementations we analyze the DPA resistance of iMDPL. Furthermore we compare the results with the logic styles' predecessor MDPL, which verifiably suffers from an effect called early propagation. We also investigate iMDPL regarding an advanced attack approach that claims to be able to almost completely remove the effect of masking in masked logic styles.
