Neither natural language processing nor information retrieval is any longer a young field, but the two areas have yet to achieve a graceful interaction. Mainly, the reason for this incompatibility is that information retrieval technology depends upon relatively simple but robust methods, while natural language processing involves complex knowledge-based systems that have never approached robustness. We provide an analysis of areas in which natural language and information retrieval come together, and describe a system that joins the two fields by combining technology, choice of application area, and knowledge acquisition techniques.
