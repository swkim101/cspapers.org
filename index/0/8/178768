In this paper, we study the metrics of <i>negative type</i>, which are metrics (<i>V</i>, d) such that âˆšd is an Euclidean metric; these metrics are thus also known as "<i>l</i><inf>2</inf>-squared" metrics.We show how to embed <i>n</i>-point negative-type metrics into Euclidean space <i>l</i><inf>2</inf> with distortion <i>D</i> = <i>O</i>(log<sup>3/4</sup> <i>n</i>). This embedding result, in turn, implies an <i>O</i>(log<sup>3/4</sup> <i>k</i>)-approximation algorithm for the Sparsest Cut problem with non-uniform demands. Another corollary we obtain is that <i>n</i>-point subsets of <i>l</i><inf>1</inf> embed into <i>l</i><inf>2</inf> with distortion <i>O</i>(log<sup>3/4</sup> <i>n</i>).
