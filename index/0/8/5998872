We describe the application of machine learning and 
state-of-the-art database management technology to 
the development of an automated tool for the 
reduction and analysis of a large astronomical data set. 
The 3 terabytes worth of images are expected to 
contain on the order of 5 x 10^7 galaxies and 5 x 10^8 
stars. For the primary scientific analysis of these 
data, it is necessary to detect, measure, and classify 
every sky object. The size of the complete data set 
precludes manual reduction, requiring an automated 
approach. SKICAT integrates techniques for image 
processing, data classification, and database 
management. Once sky objects are detected, a set of 
basic features for each object are computed. The 
learning algorithms are trained to classify the detected 
objects and can classify objects too faint for visual 
classification with an accuracy level of about 941Z0. 
This increases the number of classified objects in the 
final catalog three-fold relative to the best results from 
digitized photographic sky surveys to date. The tasks 
of managing and matching the resulting hundreds of 
plate catalogs is accomplished using custom software 
and the Sybase relational DBMS. A full array of 
scientific analysis tools are provided for filtering, 
manipulating, plotting, and listing the data in the sky 
object database. We are currently experimenting with 
the use of machine discovery tools, such as the 
AUTOCLASS unsupervised classification program, 
on the data. SKICAT represents a system in which 
machine learning played a powerful and enabling role, 
and solved a difficult, scientifically significant 
problem. The primary benefits of our overall approach 
are increased data reduction throughput consistency of 
classification; and the ability to easily access, analyze, 
and create new information from an otherwise 
unfathomable data set.
