Distributed word representations are able to capture syntactic and semantic regularities in text. In this paper, we present a word representation scheme that incorporates authorship information. While maintaining similarity among related words in the induced distributed space, our word vectors can be effectively used for some text classification tasks too. We build on a log-bilinear document model (lbDm), which extracts document features, and word vectors based on word co-occurrence counts. First, we propose a log-bilinear author model (lbAm), which contains an additional author matrix. We show that by directly learning author feature vectors, as opposed to document vectors, we can learn better word representations for the authorship attribution task. Furthermore, authorship information has been found to be useful for sentiment classification. We enrich the author model with a sentiment tensor, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this hybrid model (lbHm) through our experiments on a movie review-classification dataset.
