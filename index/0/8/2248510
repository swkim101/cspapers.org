Current approaches to cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) rely on standard retrieval models into which query translations by statistical machine translation (SMT) are integrated at varying degree. In this paper, we present an attempt to turn this situation on its head: Instead of the retrieval aspect, we emphasize the translation component in CLIR. We perform search by using an SMT decoder in forced decoding mode to produce a bag-ofwords representation of the target documents to be ranked. The SMT model is extended by retrieval-specific features that are optimized jointly with standard translation features for a ranking objective. We find significant gains over the state-of-the-art in a large-scale evaluation on cross-lingual search in the domains patents and Wikipedia.
