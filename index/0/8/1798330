We propose a hierarchical multi-module learning system based on self-interpretation of instructions given by a coach. The proposed method enables a robot: (i) to decompose a long term task that needs various kinds of information into a sequence of short term subtasks that need much less information through its self-interpretation process for the instructions given by the coach; (ii) to select sensory information needed for each subtask; and (iii) to integrate the learned behaviors to accomplish the given long term task. We show a preliminary result from a simple soccer situation in the context of RoboCup [M. Asada, et al., 1999].
