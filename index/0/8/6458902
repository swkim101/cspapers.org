This paper presents a robot control model consisting of a stable 2-D vision camera combined with an ultrasonic sensor mounted in the robot gripper. The calibration procedure for the robot-sensor system is presented. The sensor configuration is also used for object identification. The object models used for identification as well as some practical experiments are presented. The sensor configuration is judged an attractive alternative to the more complex and costly 3-D vision systems for industrial robots.
