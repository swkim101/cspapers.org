Web personalization is the process of customizing a Web site to the needs of each specific user or set of users, taking advantage of the knowledge acquired through the analysis of the user's navigational behavior. Integrating usage data with content, structure or user profile data enhances the results of the personalization process. In this paper, we present SEWeP, a system that makes use of both the usage logs and the semantics of a Web site's content in order to personalize it. Web content is semantically annotated using a conceptual hierarchy (taxonomy). We introduce C-logs, an extended form of Web usage logs that encapsulates knowledge derived from the link semantics. C-logs are used as input to the Web usage mining process, resulting in a broader yet semantically focused set of recommendations.
