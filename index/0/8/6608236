The explosion of social media services presents a great opportunity to understand the sentiment of the public via analyzing its large-scale and opinion-rich data. In social media, it is easy to amass vast quantities of unlabeled data, but very costly to obtain sentiment labels, which makes unsupervised sentiment analysis essential for various applications. It is challenging for traditional lexicon-based unsupervised methods due to the fact that expressions in social media are unstructured, informal, and fast-evolving. Emoticons and product ratings are examples of emotional signals that are associated with sentiments expressed in posts or words. Inspired by the wide availability of emotional signals in social media, we propose to study the problem of unsupervised sentiment analysis with emotional signals. In particular, we investigate whether the signals can potentially help sentiment analysis by providing a unified way to model two main categories of emotional signals, i.e., emotion indication and emotion correlation. We further incorporate the signals into an unsupervised learning framework for sentiment analysis. In the experiment, we compare the proposed framework with the state-of-the-art methods on two Twitter datasets and empirically evaluate our proposed framework to gain a deep understanding of the effects of emotional signals.
