We investigated a control method to realize the three types of free giant swing motions of a two-link horizontal bar robot. By evaluating eigenvalues of the transitional error matrix on the Poincare plane, it was found that the stable giant swing motions can be obtained by configuration control, in which the actuated joint torque is controlled such that the measured state variables follow the reference configuration with respect to the angular position of the passive joint. We also demonstrated that the stable giant swing motions of type B and C could be realized by the configuration method.
