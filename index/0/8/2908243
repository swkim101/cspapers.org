Multiagent learning is a key problem in AI. In the presence of multiple Nash equilibria, even agents with non-conflicting interests may not be able to learn an optimal coordination policy. The problem is exaccerbated if the agents do not know the game and independently receive noisy payoffs. So, multiagent reinforfcement learning involves two interrelated problems: identifying the game and learning to play. In this paper, we present optimal adaptive learning, the first algorithm that converges to an optimal Nash equilibrium with probability 1 in any team Markov game. We provide a convergence proof, and show that the algorithm's parameters are easy to set to meet the convergence conditions.
