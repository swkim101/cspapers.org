Over the last decade, addressing quality of service (QoS) in multi-core server platforms has been growing research topic. QoS techniques have been proposed to address the shared resource contention between co-running applications or virtual machines in servers and thereby provide better isolation, performance determinism and potentially improve overall throughput. One of the most important shared resources is cache space. Most proposals for addressing shared cache contention are based on simulations and analysis and no commercial platforms were available that integrated such techniques and provided a practical solution. In this paper, we will present the first set of shared cache QoS techniques designed and implemented in state-of-the-art commercial servers (the Intel® Xeon® processor E5-2600 v3 product family). We will describe two key technologies: (i) Cache Monitoring Technology (CMT) to enable monitoring of shared cache usage by different applications and (ii) Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) which enables redistribution of shared cache space between applications to address contention. This is the first paper to describing these techniques as they moved from concept to reality, starting from early research to product implementation. We will also present case studies highlighting the value of these techniques using example scenarios of multi-programmed workloads, virtualized platforms in datacenters and communications platforms. Finally, we will describe initial software infrastructure and enabling for industry practitioners and researchers to take advantage of these technologies for their QoS needs.
