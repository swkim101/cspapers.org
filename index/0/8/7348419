Proposes a classification of nonholonomic systems from a viewpoint of classical mechanics as well as nonlinear control theory. We clarify this connection by recalling our previous results (1998) that the asymptotic stabilizability of the target equilibrium holds only if the dimension of the equilibria set is equal to the number of control inputs. We summarize a lot of nonholonomic control problems by relating their equilibria set and the numbers of control inputs, their mechanical properties (nonintegrability of constraints) and the existing control strategies proposed in recent years.
