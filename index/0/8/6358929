This paper addresses the motion planning problem while considering Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) constraints. The proposed planner generates collision-free paths that are acceptable and legible to the human. The method extends our previous work on human-aware path planning to cluttered environments. A randomized cost-based exploration method provides an initial path that is relevant with respect to HRI and workspace constraints. The quality of the path is further improved with a local path-optimization method. Simulation results on mobile manipulators in the presence of humans demonstrate the overall efficacy of the approach.
