A method for creating a non-linear encoder-decoder for multidimensional data with compact representations is presented. The commonly used technique of autoassociation is extended to allow non-linear representations, and an objective function which penalizes activations of individual hidden units is shown to result in minimum dimensional encodings with respect to allowable error in reconstruction.
