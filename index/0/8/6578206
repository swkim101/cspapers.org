WC propose a new, knowledge-based methodology for deep knowledge discovery from natural language documents. Data mining, data interpretation, and data cleaning are all incorporated in a terminological reasoning process. We exploit qualitative knowledge about linguistic phenomena in naturaI languagetexts and structural configurations in text and domain knowledge bases to generate concept hypotheses, rank them according to plausibility, and select the most credible ones for knowledge assimilation.
