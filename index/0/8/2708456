In this paper we present a UML 2.0 profile for the SystemC language, which is a consistent set of modeling constructs designed to lift both structural and behavioral features (including events and time features) of the SystemC language to UML level. The main target of this profile is to provide a means for software and hardware engineers to improve the current industrial Systems-on-a-Chip (SoC) design methodology joining the capabilities of UML and SystemC to operate at system-level.
