Mathematics Information Retrieval (MIR) is a domain specific branch of Information Retrieval. MIR is a broad term for all the activities related to obtaining information from a collection of resources and answering an information need that involves mathematics in the form of math expressions and formulae. MIR is very important for Digital Mathematics Libraries (DMLs) which gather mathematically oriented documents in which users need to search and navigate effectively. A concrete implementation usually means a search engine that is able to answer a query composed of mathematical expressions as well as standard textual keywords searching through a collection with a substantial amount of mathematics. There are several research groups that aim at creating well performing and usable math search engine. Our group located at the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, develops Math Indexer and Searcher (MIaS) [2] â€“ a math-aware search engine, currently deployed in EuDML (European Digital Mathematics Library). To the best of my knowledge, it is the only deployment of a MIR system in such a scale. Other deployments, e.g. DML-CZ, are planned.
