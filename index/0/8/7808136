Nisan, Rudich, and Saks [25] a&cd whether one help bit can reduce the complexity of computing a boolean function on two inputs in the decision tree model. We prove that one help bit doesn’t help. In general, we prove that [log kJ help bits don’t help for computing k instances off. This result is the best possible, since we exhibit functions for which [log kJ + 1 help bits reduce complexity. This shows a gap between 0 and [log kJ + 1 help bits: either f can be evaluated in depth d (the complexity off) without any help bits, or else [log kJ + 1 help bits are required in order to evaluate k instances in depth d.
