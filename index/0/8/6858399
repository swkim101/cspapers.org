The presented microrobotic platform combines the advantages of self-folding NIR light sensitive polymer bilayers, magnetic alginate microbeads, and a 3D manipulation system and introduces a solution for targeted, on-demand drug and cell delivery. First feasibility studies are presented together with the potential of the full design.
