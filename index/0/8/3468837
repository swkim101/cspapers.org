"Logic for Computer Science" courses have traditionally emphasized algorithmic approaches: Resolution, Semantic Tableau, and Sequent Systems. The Athena System, described in a new book ("Fundamental Proof Methods in Computer Science" by Konstantine Arkoudas and David Musser, MIT Press, 2017), emphasizes Natural Deduction. Natural Deduction has the well-known advantage of matching human intuition. Athena is a language that combines computation and deduction, and is a system to aid the development of natural deduction proofs. The central insight realized in Athena is that the development of a proof is similar to the development of programs using stepwise refinement. Athena is not a theorem prover, but is integrated with theorem provers and SMT solvers. Athena users can make use of these integrated tools without having to learn details of the usage of these tools, as Athena provides seamless integration with these tools, and a convenient interface to these tools for Athena users. While Athena uses these tools to aid the development of natural deduction proofs, I have found that a combined use of Athena with theorem provers, SMT solvers and model builders can help impart to students a more well-rounded introduction to deduction.
