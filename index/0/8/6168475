This paper will describe the use of a syntax driver in writing a logic equation compiler (LOGCOM). By such a compiler or processor we mean a program which takes logic equations punched on cards and converts them into a tabular form which subsequently is used by other design automation programs. In the body of the paper it is assumed that the reader possesses a casual familiarity with syntax. This assumption is made mostly for organizational convenience and an appendix discussing syntax is included at the end of the paper. My terminology is summarized at the end of this appendix and the reader familiar with syntax can check there to see if his terminology and mine agree. Sample syntax applied to a specific problem is shown in figure 3 and is discussed in Section 2.
