However, for particular feature representations, e.g., histogram features like BOW and SPM, Mahalanobis metric could not model the correlations between these features well. In this work, we define a non-Mahalanobis distance for histogram features, via Expected Hitting Time (EHT) of Markov Chain, which implicitly considers the high-order feature relationships between different histogram features. The EHT based distance is parameterized by transition probabilities of Markov Chain, we consequently propose a novel type of distance learning approach (LED, Learning Expected hitting time Distance) to learn appropriate transition probabilities for EHT based distance. We validate the effectiveness of LED on a series of real-world datasets. Moreover, experiments show that the learned transition probabilities are with good comprehensibility.
