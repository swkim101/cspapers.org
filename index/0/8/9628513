We see teaching information security through hands-on, interactive exercises as a way to engage students. Some of the exercises that we have tried require significant preparation on the part of the instructor. Having a community makes it easier to share exercises, knowing what works and what problems students and instructors have encountered. The purpose of this BOF is to bring together instructors who have used hands-on exercises and those who would like to. We recognize that few CS programs can afford new required courses, so we would be discussing ways to integrate security-related exercises into existing ones. This could include networking, OS, computer architecture, programming languages, software engineering and algorithms. The questions we will ask are, "What exercises, if any, have you tried" What are your experiences? What are you looking for?
