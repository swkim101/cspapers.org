We consider the scheduling problem of minimizing a weighted sum of completion times under release dates. We present a simple randomized 2-approximation algorithm for the problem running in O(n log n) time. The algorithm applies to both the off-line and on-line settings with no difference in performance guarantees. In the off-line setting, the algorithm can be derandomized in two different ways, leading either to a deterministic 2-approximation algorithm running in O(n2) time, or to a 2+$approximation algorithm running in O(n log n+lcn) time. In the on-line setting, a specific random choice gives a deterministic 1 + a-competitive algorithm. These bounds improve upon a bound of 2.45 in the off-line settin or in the randomized on-line setting (Chakrabarti et al. 1996]), and upon a bound of 3 + e in p: the deterministic on-line setting (Hall, Schulz, Shmoys and Wein [1996]).
