Interactive visualization tools for models of computation provide a more compelling means of exploration and feedback than traditional paper and pencil methods in theory of computation courses. The Java Computability Toolkit (JCT) is introduced here as a new teaching aide and as an exploratory student's supplement to a course on theory of computation. JCT consists of two Java multiple-window, web-accessible, graphical environments, allowing the construction and simulation of finite automata and Turing machines. This paper discusses JCT's use, design, and applications in teaching.
