We present a tool for the annotation of XMLencoded multi-modal language corpora. Nonhierarchical data is supported by means of standoff annotation. We define base level and suprabase level elements and theory-independent markables for multi-modal annotation and apply them to a cospecification annotation scheme. We also describe how arbitrary annotation schemes can be represented in terms of these elements. Apart from theoretical considerations, however, the development of a fast, robust and highly usable annotation tool was a major objective of the work presented.
