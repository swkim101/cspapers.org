Reiter has proposed extended relational theory to formulate relational databases with null values and presented a query evaluation algorithm for such databases. However, due to indefinite information brought in by null values, Reiter's algorithm is sound but not complete. In this paper, we first propose an extended relation to represent indefinite information in relational databases. Then, we define an extended relational algebra for extended relations. Based on Reiter's extended relational theory, and our extended relations and the extended relational algebra, we present a sound and complete query evaluation algorithm for relational databases with null values
