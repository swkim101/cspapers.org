Linear Relational Embedding is a method of learning a distributed representation of concepts from data consisting of binary relations between concepts. Concepts are represented as vectors, binary relations as matrices, and the operation of applying a relation to a concept as a matrix-vector multiplication that produces an approximation to the related concept. A representation for concepts and relations is learned by maximizing an appropriate discriminative goodness function using gradient ascent. On a task involving family relationships, learning is fast and leads to good generalization.
