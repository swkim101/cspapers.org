Entity resolution (ER) is a problem that arises in many areas. In most of cases, it represents a task that multiple entities from different sources require to be identified if they refer to the same or different objects because there are not unique identifiers associated with them. In this paper, we propose a model using web pages identification to identify entities and merge those entities refer to one object together. We use a classical name disambiguation problem as case study and examine our model on a subset of digital library records as the first stage of our work. The favorable results indicated that our proposed approach is highly effective.
