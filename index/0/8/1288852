1. The research problem EC-CKN (Energy Consumed uniformly Connected K-Neighborhood) [1] is a sleep scheduling algorithm designed for duty-cycled wireless sensor networks (WSNs) based on Nath et al. proposed Connected KNeighborhood (CKN) sleep scheduling scheme [1]. It inherited the key feature of CKN: “allow only a portion of sensor nodes to be awake to save energy while the global network is still connected by those awake nodes”, and further focused on prolonging the network lifetime: “the residual energy owned by the awake nodes determined by the sleep scheduling scheme should be more than that of the asleep nodes determined by the algorithm”. However, we discovered an important Network Isolation Problem in EC-CKN based WSNs as described in Fig. 1.
