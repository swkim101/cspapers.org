It is commonly known that physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are hard to predict and hard to emulate. However, in this paper, we propose to use statistical models to adaptively characterize the delay-based PUFs, and use this as a starting point to emulate a delay-based PUF. The essential idea is that for any challenge CA of a delay-based PUF A, there is a high probability of finding a paired challenge CB. When apply CB to another delay-based PUF B, it can produce the same output as applying CA on PUF A. Our simulation results indicate more than 99% correctness for the PUF response prediction using characterization and 96% correctness using emulation. Finally, we implement and test the feasibility of our approach on the Xilinx Spartan-6 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).
