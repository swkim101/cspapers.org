In this paper we discuss required element testing strategies and present some experimental evaluations of their effectiveness. These strategies use data flow analysis as a basis for developing test cases. The basic strategy (required pairs) is compared with random and branch testing using mutation analysis as a measure of test set effectiveness. Extensions of the basic strategy are also studied.
