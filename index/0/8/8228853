Information retrieval systems rank documents, and shared-task evaluations yield results that can be used to rank information retrieval systems. Comparing rankings in ways that can yield useful insights is thus an important capability. When making such comparisons, it is often useful to give greater weight to comparisons near the head of a ranked list than to what happens further down. This is the focus of the widely used τAP measure. When scores are available, gap-sensitive measures give greater weight to larger differences than to smaller ones. This is the focus of the widely used Pearson correlation measure (ρ). This paper introduces a new measure, τGAP, which combines both features. System comparisons from the TREC 5 Ad Hoc track are used to illustrate the differences in emphasis achieved by τAP, ρ, and the proposed τGAP.
