A neural network approach to stereovision is presented based on aliasing effects of simple disparity estimators and a fast coherence-detection scheme. Within a single network structure, a dense disparity map with an associated validation map and, additionally, the fused cyclopean view of the scene are available. The network operations are based on simple, biological plausible circuitry; the algorithm is fully parallel and non-iterative.
