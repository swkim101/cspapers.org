Results at very light and very heavy loads are easy to obtain, but at intermediate loads performance modelling is necessary. Because of the considerable cost of simulation, we develope queueing network models which can be solved quickly by approximate analytic techniques. These models are validated by comparing with simulations at certain points, and then used to get a wide range of results quickly.
