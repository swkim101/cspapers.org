In this paper, we introduce and describe the notion of a robotic enzyme, and how it can use properties that are similar to biological enzymes to autonomously self-replicate. We test the idea of robotic enzymes using a virtual environment that simulates the currently existing modular robots in a physically accurate way. We describe the self-replicating features of robotic enzymes, and how they could be used to autonomously self-replicate for multiple generations, limited only by the amount of modules in the environment.
