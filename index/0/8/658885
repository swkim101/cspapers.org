With the development of low-cost microsensor equipment having the capability of wireless communications, sensor network technology has attracted the attention of many researchers and developers. By deploying a large number of sensors in a monitored region and composing a sensor network of them, one can remotely obtain information on behavior, condition, and position of elements in the region. In [1], we have proposed a novel and efficient scheme for data gathering in sensor networks where a large number of sensor nodes were deployed. In such networks, nodes are randomly introduced, occasionally die or get removed, and sometimes change their locations. We considered an application that periodically collected sensor information from distributed sensor nodes to a base station. In our scheme, sensor information periodically propagates without any centralized control from the edge of a sensor network to a base station as the propagation forms a concentric circle. By observing the radio signals emitted by sensor nodes in its vicinity, a sensor node independently determines the cycle
