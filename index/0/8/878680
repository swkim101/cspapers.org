A model of the neuronal structures of the auditory system is worked out to determine the direction upon the source of the sound signal with steep-sided front. The direction upon the sound source is determined on the basis of a generalized parameter which is the result of two measurements: (1) moments of arrival of the signals at each ear; (2) amplitudes of these signals. The result is the precision determination of the direction upon the sound source. 
 
The model represents a five-level neuronal structures, each level consisting of the elements of the same kind. The informations about the direction upon the source of sound is encoded in the location of the excited region at the output level of the model.
