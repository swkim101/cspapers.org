In a peer-to-peer video streaming environment, it is a tradeoff between two counter extremes; to tolerate low quality pictures but with uninterrupted presentation or to enjoy high quality pictures but with the possibility of freeze-up time. In this paper, we present a dynamic layer adjustment (DLA) scheme for SVC segments in P2P streaming networks. Without periodically measuring available bandwidth at a peer, adequate SVC layers can be determined by the number of video segments waiting in the decoder buffer. Simulation results show that the proposed DLA can maintain smooth video quality without sacrificing freeze-up time no matter how abruptly the bandwidth is changed.
