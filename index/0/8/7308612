We present the first truly sub-cubic algorithms for finding a maximum node-weighted triangle in directed and undirected graphs with arbitrary real weights. The first is an O(B • n<sup>3+ω/2</sup>) = O(B • n<sup>2.688</sup>) deterministic algorithm, where n is the number of nodes, ω is the matrix multiplication exponent, and B is the number of bits of precision. The second is a strongly polynomial randomized algorithm that runs in O(n<sup>3+ω/2</sup> log n) expected worst-case time. To achieve this, we show how to efficiently sample a weighted triangle uniformly at random, out of just those triangles whose total weight falls in some prescribed interval (W<sub>1</sub>,W<sub>2</sub>) for arbitrary weights W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub>. Previous approaches to the problem resulted in time bounds with either an <i>exponential</i> dependence on B, or a runtime of the form Ω(n<sup>3</sup>/(log n)<sup>c</sup>). The algorithms are easily extended to finding a maximum node-weighted induced subgraph on 3k nodes in Õ(n<sup>(3+ω)</sup>k/2) = O(n<sup>2.688 k</sup>) time.We give applications to a variety of problems, including a stable matching problem between buyers and sellers in computational economics, and discuss the possibility of extending our approach to a truly sub-cubic algorithm for computing all-pairs shortest paths on directed graphs with arbitrary weights.
