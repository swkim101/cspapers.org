We propose an approach for retrieving a sequence of natural sentences for an image stream. Since general users often take a series of pictures on their special moments, it would better take into consideration of the whole image stream to produce natural language descriptions. While almost all previous studies have dealt with the relation between a single image and a single natural sentence, our work extends both input and output dimension to a sequence of images and a sequence of sentences. To this end, we design a multimodal architecture called coherence recurrent convolutional network (CRCN), which consists of convolutional neural networks, bidirectional recurrent neural networks, and an entity-based local coherence model. Our approach directly learns from vast user-generated resource of blog posts as text-image parallel training data. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art candidate methods, using both quantitative measures (e.g. BLEU and top-K recall) and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
