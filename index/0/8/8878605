A Computer Science Department is no longer a novelty in our universities. On the other hand, the place of computer science in the university, the subject matter to be taught, and the way in which the teaching is done vary widely from one institution to another and with time at any single institution. My concern here is with an aspect of curriculum and of facilities which seems to have been inadequately appreciated. The subject matter is the massive array of programs constituting the software system through which the computer is used. My contention is that we have not understood the problem of teaching software systems and are not properly equipped to teach much more than “Some Aspects of How Our Supplier's System Works.”
