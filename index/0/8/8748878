Decision trees are surprisingly adaptive in three important respects: They automatically (1) adapt to favorable conditions near the Bayes decision boundary; (2) focus on data distributed on lower dimensional manifolds; (3) reject irrelevant features. In this paper we examine a decision tree based on dyadic splits that adapts to each of these conditions to achieve minimax optimal rates of convergence. The proposed classifier is the first known to achieve these optimal rates while being practical and implementable.
