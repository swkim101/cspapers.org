Distant supervision has been widely used in current systems of ﬁne-grained entity typing to automatically assign categories (entity types) to entity mentions. However, the types so obtained from knowledge bases are often incorrect for the entity mention’s local context. This paper proposes a novel embedding method to separately model “clean” and “noisy” mentions, and incorporates the given type hierarchy to induce loss functions. We formulate a joint optimization problem to learn embeddings for mentions and type-paths, and develop an iterative algorithm to solve the problem. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, with an average 15% improvement in accuracy over the next best compared method 1 .
