The following source coding problem was introduced by Birk and Kol: a sender holds a word x epsi {0,1}n, and wishes to broadcast a codeword to n receivers, R1,..., Rnmiddot. The receiver Ri is interested in x;, and has prior side information comprising some subset of the n bits. This corresponds to a directed graph G on n vertices, where ij is an edge iff Ri knows the bit xj . An index code for G is an encoding scheme which enables each Ri to always reconstruct Xj, given his side information. The minimal word length of an index code was studied by Bar-Yossef Birk, Jay ram and Kol. Thev introduced a graph parameter, minrk2(G), which completely characterizes the length of an optimal linear index code for G. The authors of (Z. Bar-Yossef, 2006) showed that in various cases linear codes attain the optimal word length, and conjectured that linear index coding is in fact always optimal. In this work, we disprove the main conjecture of (Z. Bar-Yossef, 2006) in the following strong sense: for any epsiv > 0 and sufficiently large n, there is an n-vertex graph G so that evety linear index code for G requires codewords of length at least n1-epsiv and yet a non-linear index code for G has a word length of nepsiv. This is achieved by an explicit construction, which extends Alon's variant of the celebrated Ramsey construction of Frankl and Wilson.
