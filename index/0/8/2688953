We have developed an application for the automatic generation of media galleries that visually and audibly summarize events based on media items like videos and photos from multiple social networks. Further, we have evaluated different media gallery styles with online surveys and examined their pros and cons. Besides the survey results, our contribution is also the application itself, where media galleries of different styles can be created on-the-fly. A demo is available at http://social-media-illustrator.herokuapp.com/.
