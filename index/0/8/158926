In this paper the authors introduce a smart module designed to provide, effortless, Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) capabilities to a host application processor on an embedded system. The underling idea is to combine digital processing and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) in a single module giving, not only sensors measurement, but especially a reliable orientation measure without any additional external computational power. In this way the target application should not face math operations and/or strict timing typical of this kind of algorithms.
