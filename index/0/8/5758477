We propose a new 3D model of the human body that is both realistic and part-based. The body is represented by a graphical model in which nodes of the graph correspond to body parts that can independently translate and rotate in 3D and deform to represent different body shapes and to capture pose-dependent shape variations. Pairwise potentials define a “stitching cost” for pulling the limbs apart, giving rise to the stitched puppet (SP) model. Unlike existing realistic 3D body models, the distributed representation facilitates inference by allowing the model to more effectively explore the space of poses, much like existing 2D pictorial structures models. We infer pose and body shape using a form of particle-based max-product belief propagation. This gives SP the realism of recent 3D body models with the computational advantages of part-based models. We apply SP to two challenging problems involving estimating human shape and pose from 3D data. The first is the FAUST mesh alignment challenge, where ours is the first method to successfully align all 3D meshes with no pose prior. The second involves estimating pose and shape from crude visual hull representations of complex body movements.
