We introduce an error mining technique for automatically detecting errors in resources that are used in parsing systems. We applied this technique on parsing results produced on several million words by two distinct parsing systems, which share the syntactic lexicon and the pre-parsing processing chain. We were thus able to identify missing and erroneous information in these resources.
