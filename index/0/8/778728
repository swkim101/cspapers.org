It has been observed by many practitioners that software applications frequently contain redundant code fragments. This redundancy is often caused by the common programming practice of replicating (or cloning) existing code and then customizing code fragments to handle new demands within an application. An IT organization consequently spends significant amounts of its budget maintaining such code (e.g., a bug in one code fragment is also a bug in all of its replicated clones). To address the challenges of clone detection and maintenance, this demo will introduce a new open source tool that can be used to visualize the results of CloneDRâ„¢, which is a commercial clone detection tool (a free version of the tool is available for Java). Several open source projects will be used as case studies to demonstrate the usage of the visualization tool
