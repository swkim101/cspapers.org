Nowadays searching for complicated information needs becomes more and more common. These complicated needs usually require the users to reform different queries and conduct multiple retrievals in a search session. There are a lot of technologies are developed to help session searches. Riccho, pseudo relevance feedback, and etc. can help finding relevant documents. xQuAD, RxQuAD, and etc. can help the user to explore. However none of these approaches alone works well in session searches, because they don't treat a search session as a whole. They can't answer questions like when to explore and when to exploit. In this work, we model session searches as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP). We model user's implicit feedbacks, such as query reformulation and user clickthrough data into the POMDP framework. Further we extend the forms of user feedbacks. We implement a new search interface which allows us to capture more explicit feedbacks from users, such as passage level relevance judgments, irrelevant judgments, duplicate judgment, and etc. We propose algorithms to effectively model these feedback signals into the POMDP framework and improve session search performance. Our algorithm is able to automatically balance users' needs of exploration and exploitation.
