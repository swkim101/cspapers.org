Application-specific safe message handlers (ASHs) are designed to provide applications with hardware-level network performance. ASHs are user-written code fragments that safely and efficiently execute in the kernel in response to message arrival. ASHs can direct message transfers (thereby eliminating copies) and send messages (thereby reducing send-response latency). In addition, the ASH system provides support for dynamic integrated layer processing (thereby eliminating duplicate message traversals) and dynamic protocol composition (thereby supporting modularity). ASHs provide this high degree of flexibility while still providing network performance as good as, or (if they exploit application-specific knowledge) even better than, hard-wired in-kernel implementations. A combination of user-level microbenchmarks and end-to-end system measurements using TCP demonstrate the benefits of the ASH system.
