The AT&T Display Construction Set User Interface Management System (UIMS) Joseph 1?Rotella, Amy L. Bowman, Catherine A. Wttman AT& TBell Laboratories The AT&T Display Construction Set UIMS is a software tool that can be used to build and provide interactive graphics displays. The user interface is separatedfrom the application, typically a large software systemthat performs data collection, data ,manipulation, or communicates with other external applications. Although the Display ConstructionSet usesthe X Whxiow System’”andOPEN LOOK’”*, the applicationdeveloperandthe displaybuilder do not needprogrammingknowledgeof either in order to build a system using graphical displays[l]. Before building displays, the format and types of data the application will present to the user interface are defined in the domain definition file, an ASCII representationof the data mo&l of the application. For example, the domain definition file can model a network hierarchy of switches and cities. Integer values for traffic at each switch can be aggregated together to determine the total traffic for each city. Although many applications already describe a data model in a database schema and this appears to be
