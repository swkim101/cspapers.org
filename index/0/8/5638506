We propose an architecture that allows code to execute in complete isolation from other software while trusting only a tiny software base that is orders of magnitude smaller than even minimalist virtual machine monitors. Our technique also enables more meaningful attestation than previous proposals, since only measurements of the security-sensitive portions of an application need to be included. We achieve these guarantees by leveraging hardware support provided by commodity processors from AMD and Intel that are shipping today.
