VERSANT is the industryâ€™s leading object database management system (ODBMS) for developing applications in multi-user, dstribtrted environments. VERSANT ODBMS has an objectbased client-server architecture which is particularly suitable for such complex applications as telecommunications, trartsportations, and utilities network management systems. Because these applications are usually mission-critical and do not allow my dtia. base down time, one major requirement of our customers is 24x7 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) high-availability of object databases, even in the presence of software, hardware, or network failures. While many VERSANT features, such as on-line backup and dynamic schema evohrtio~ have already supported part of this requiremen~ they do not address the failure cases. Traditional asynchronous replication (e.g., Sybase Replication Server, DEC Data Distributor, and Oracle Symmetric Replication) is not suitable for the following two reasons, Fhs~ data integrity maybe lost as a result of either delay during propagation or conflicting update requests from different replicates. Second, any failure in the local replica database or central primary database is not transparent to the applications. Special hardware (e.g., mirrored disks) can help but is expensive rmd it still needs fault-tolerant DBMS support to be transparent to applications. In VERSANT Replication, we take asynchronous database replication approach to support fauk-tolerant object databases transparently. As each database can be paired with a hot stand-by replica database located anywhere in the network, VERSANT Replication protects critical data horn geological/environtnent/physical disasters and provides for continuous operation of databases in a distributed environment even in the presence of various failure scenarios.
