Current domain-specific information extraction systems represent an important resource for biomedical researchers, who need to process vaster amounts of knowledge in short times. Automatic discourse causality recognition can further improve their workload by suggesting possible causal connections and aiding in the curation of pathway models. We here describe an approach to the automatic identification of discourse causality triggers in the biomedical domain using machine learning. We create several baselines and experiment with various parameter settings for three algorithms, i.e., Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF). Also, we evaluate the impact of lexical, syntactic and semantic features on each of the algorithms and look at errors. The best performance of 79.35% F-score is achieved by CRFs when using all three feature types.
