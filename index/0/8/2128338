This paper presents a methodology for automating the evaluation of partial designs using black-box testing techniques. This methodology generates black-box evaluation tests using a novel semantic graph data model to maintain the relationships between the related design and requirements data. We demonstrate the utility of this technique by using the relationship information to automatically generate and run functionality tests of partial designs against the related requirements.
