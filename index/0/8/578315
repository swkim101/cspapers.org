With Generation Y entering the workforce, for the first time IT tools at home are richer in interaction than tools at work. This study aims to demonstrate novel Generation Y interactions by mapping three interaction qualities identified in private and work contexts. In an interactive prototyping course three prototypes were built in which these qualities are demonstrated. From these prototypes, guidelines for supporting Generation Y interactions in future office contexts, were subsequently deducted.
