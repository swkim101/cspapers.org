In this paper, we propose a novel Gaussian process motion controller that can navigate through a crowded dynamic environment. The proposed motion controller predicts future trajectories of pedestrians using an autoregressive Gaussian process motion model (AR-GPMM) from the partially-observable egocentric view of a robot and controls a robot using an autoregressive Gaussian process motion controller (AR-GPMC) based on predicted pedestrian trajectories. The performance of the proposed method is extensively evaluated in simulation and validated experimentally using a Pioneer 3DX mobile robot with a Microsoft Kinect sensor. In particular, the proposed method shows over 68% improvement on the collision rate compared to a reactive planner and vector field histogram (VFH).
