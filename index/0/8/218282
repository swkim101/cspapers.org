We give the first example of a sharp threshold in proof complexity. More precisely, we show that for any sufficiently small <italic>ε>0</italic> and <italic>Δ>2.28</italic>, random formulas consisting of <italic>(1-ε)n</italic> 2-clauses and <italic>&Dgr n</italic> 3-clauses, which are known to be unsatisfiable almost certainly, almost certainly require resolution and Davis-Putnam proofs of unsatisfiability of exponential size, whereas it is easily seen that random formulas with <italic>(1+ε)n</italic> 2-clauses (and <italic>Δ n</italic> 3 clauses) have linear size proofs of unsatisfiability almost certainly.
A consequence of our result also yields the first proof that typical random 3-CNF formulas at ratios below the generally accepted range of the  satisfiability threshold (and thus expected to be satisfiable almost certainly) cause natural Davis-Putnam algorithms to take exponential time to find satisfying assignments.
