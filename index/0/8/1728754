After a considerable hiatus of interest and funding, machine translation has come in recent years to occupy a significant place in the discipline of natural language processing. It has also become one of the most visible representations of natural language processing to the outside world. Machine translation systems are relatively unique with respect to the extent of the coverage they at tempt , and, correspondingly, the size of the grammatical and lexicaI corpora involved. Adding to this the complexity introduced by multiple language directions into the same system design (and the enormous procedural problems imposed by simultaneous development in several sites) gives some clue as to the opt imism which presently exists for machine translation.
