Patterns represent in a compact and rich in semantics way huge quantity of heterogeneous data. Due to their characteristics, specific systems are required for pattern management, in order to model and manipulate patterns, with a possibly user-defined structure, in an efficient and effective way. In this demonstration we present PSYCHO, a pattern based management system prototype. PSYCHO allows the user to: (i) use standard pattern types or define new ones; (ii) generate or import patterns, represented according to existing standards; (iii) manipulate possibly heterogeneous patterns under an integrated environment.
