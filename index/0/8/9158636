In this paper, we present PVA, an adaptive personal view information agent system to track, learn and manage, user's interests in Internet documents. When user's interests change, PVA, in not only the contents, but also in the structure of user profile, is modified to adapt to the changes. Experimental results show that modulating the structure of user profile does increase the accuracy of personalization systems.
