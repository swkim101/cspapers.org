Our graduates are ill-prepared for entry positions in industry. This is the message from a 1994 NSF task force comprised of members from academia and industry. Among the specific deficiencies cited were problem-solving skills and the ability to work in groups. In a recent publication, the authors described a group problem-solving model, Group Zig Zag, based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. In this paper we show how the integration of a collaborative approach throughout the curriculum can be achieved by adopting the Group Zig Zag model.
