WC describe PRMS an animated simulation of process and resource management in a multi-programming operating system. PRMS was developed to illustrate important operating system concepts including process creation, process state transition, context switching, process scheduling, resource scheduling, interrupt handling, and deadlock detection and recovery. The users write their own, programs in a specified format, submit these to the system for execution, and monitor “behind the scenes” mechanisms and the behavior of the system on the screen. In addition to illustrating and reinforcing operating system concepts, PRMS can also be used for course projects by having the students change an algorithm such as the CPU scheduling algorithm or memory management scheme or add new features such as device interrupts to the system.
