Reordering is a difficult task in translating between widely different languages such as Japanese and English. We employ the post-ordering framework proposed by (Sudoh et al., 2011b) for Japanese to English translation and improve upon the reordering method. The existing post-ordering method reorders a sequence of target language words in a source language word order via SMT, while our method reorders the sequence by: 1) parsing the sequence to obtain syntax structures similar to a source language structure, and 2) transferring the obtained syntax structures into the syntax structures of the target language.
