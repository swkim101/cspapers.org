The typical operation for Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs) is to send out a pulse and receive the expected echoes before sending out the subsequent pulse. Space borne SARs normally have long working ranges, so they either need to extend the unambiguous range which significantly complicating the radar design and operation or operate with pulses â€˜in the air', that is, transmitting new pulses before the expected arrival of a previous pulse's echo, which is usually used to avoid range ambiguity. For a space borne SAR system, pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is an important parameter that affects and affected by other system parameters, analysis of this effect will be presented through the following paper in order to define the available PRF ranges with respect to chosen system parameters, the study will help system designer in determining the suitable SAR system parameters
