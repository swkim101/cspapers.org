Now in its 14th year, the TOP500 list of supercomputers serves as a "Who's Who" in the field of High Performance Computing (HPC). The TOP500 list was started in 1993 as a project to compile a list of the most powerful supercomputers in the world. It has evolved from a simple ranking system to a major source of information to analyze trends in HPC. The 28th TOP500 list will be published in November 2006 just in time for SC06.This BoF will present detailed analyses of the TOP500 and discuss the changes in the HPC marketplace during the past years. This includes the presentation of a new metric to track power consumption and updates on various benchmark initiatives such as the HPC Challenge benchmarks and the APEX-Map project. The BoF is meant as an open forum for discussion and feedback between the TOP500 authors and the user community.
