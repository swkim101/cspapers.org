Let f be a boolean function on n variables. Its associated XOR function is the two-party function F(x, y) = f(x xor y). We show that, up to polynomial factors, the deterministic communication complexity of F is equal to the parity decision tree complexity of f. This relies on a novel technique of entropy reduction for protocols, combined with existing techniques in Fourier analysis and additive combinatorics.
