PLAC is a multi-algorithm, 2-dimensional placement program which accommodates many of the “real world” constraints which occur in the layout of electrical circuits. PLAC was implemented as part of LTX [1], a general integrated circuit layout system, but is capable of handling circuit layout tasks from other technologies (e.g., PC boards, ceramic substrates).
 PLAC interlaces constructive initial placement with iterative pairwise exchange, using an approximation of total routing length as the primary figure-of-merit. The layout designer can influence the placement by providing a “seed” preplacement of key cells.
 PLAC results are given for a DIP board layout and two polycell integrated circuit layouts. Comparisons are made to other semi-automatic and manual placement procedures. Running time on an HP21MX minicomputer ranged from 4 minutes on a 34-cell problem to 1 hour on a 511-cell problem.
