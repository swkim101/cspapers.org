An inverse kinematics solution that utilizes the differential relationship between the joint space and Cartesian space of redundant manipulators is proposed. Until now, this solution could be obtained using the pseudo inverse of the Jacobian matrix. However the computation of the pseudo inverse is complex so that it is not easy to implement it on a digital computer for online motion planning of the robot. As an alternative to the pseudo inverse solution, an inverse kinematics solution using fuzzy logic is derived. We find the rough solution based on the gradient method, and then refine it by introducing the fuzzy logic through the extension principle. As a result, a simple and fast inverse kinematics solution is obtained. The simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed solution.
