Due to a significant mismatch between the objectives of wirelength and routing congestion, the routability issue is becoming more and more important in VLSI design. In this paper, we present a high quality placer Ripple 2.0 to solve the routability-driven placement problem. We will study how to make use of the routing path information in cell spreading and relieve congestion with tangled logic in detail. Several techniques are proposed, including (1) lookahead routing analysis with pin density consideration, (2) routing path-based cell inflation and spreading and (3) robust optimization on congested cluster. With the official evaluation protocol, Ripple 2.0 outperforms the top contestants on the ICCAD 2012 Contest benchmark suite.
