The maximisation of information transmission over noisy channels is a common, albeit generally computationally difficult problem. We approach the difficulty of computing the mutual information for noisy channels by using a variational approximation. We apply the method to several practical examples, including linear compression, population encoding and CDMA. We demonstrate that our approach enables one to calculate encoding and decoding schemes that can be optimised in a principled manner.
