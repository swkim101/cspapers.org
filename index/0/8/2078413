Always-on continuous sensing apps drain the battery quickly because they prevent the main processor from sleeping. Instead, sensor hub hardware, available in many smartphones today, can run continuous sensing at lower power while keeping the main processor idle. However, developers have to divide functionality between the main processor and the sensor hub. We implement MobileHub, a system that automatically rewrites applications to leverage the sensor hub without additional programming effort. MobileHub uses a combination of dynamic taint tracking and machine learning to learn when it is safe to leverage the sensor hub without affecting application semantics. We implement MobileHub in Android and prototype a sensor hub on a 8-bit AVR micro-controller. We experiment with 20 applications from Google Play. Our evaluation shows that MobileHub significantly reduces power consumption for continuous sensing apps.
