The subject matter of a typical undergraduate software engineering course, while providing necessary background, can be quite dry. Team-based programming projects often complement the more theoretical textbook and lecture content by giving students valuable hands-on practice, albeit on a small scale and within a traditional classroom setting. This paper describes a company-based framework used in two semesters of a software engineering course. This approach incorporates a novel, collaborative framework to simulate the real-world experience of working for a medium-sized software design company or research laboratory, while giving students a vested interest in the overall outcome.
