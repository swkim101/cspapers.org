This paper describes a new programming technology that is to syntax analysis as formal logic is to logic programming, and which we have accordingly named syntax programming. The table-driven nature of bottom-up parsers provides this approach with a number of attractive features, among which are compactness, portability, and introspective capability. Syntax programming has been successfully used for a number of applications, including expert system construction and robot control as well as non-AI problems.
