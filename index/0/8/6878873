Hidden units in multi-layer networks form a representation space in which each region can be identified with a class of equivalent outputs (Elman, 1989) or a logical state in a finite state machine (Cleeremans, Servan-Schreiber & McClelland, 1989; Giles, Sun, Chen, Lee, & Chen, 1990). We extend the analysis of the spatial structure of hidden unit space to a combinatorial task, based on binding features together in a visual scene. The logical structure requires a combinatorial number of states to represent all valid scenes. On analysing our networks, we find that the high dimensionality of hidden unit space is exploited by using the intersection of neighboring regions to represent conjunctions of features. These results show how combinatorial structure can be based on the spatial nature of networks, and not just on their emulation of logical structure.
