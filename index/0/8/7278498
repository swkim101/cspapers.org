Many introductory computer science courses include regular lab sessions that require students to develop short programs that relate to corresponding lecture material. Logistical tasks required for assignment completion, such as project setup and submission, impose certain burdens on students and instructors. Due to time constraints, instructors frequently provide starter files or skeleton projects for students to import into their workspace at the beginning of each lab so that they can feasibly complete the assignment in the required time. Setting up projects in Eclipse to include these files and dependencies still consumes significant time during these labs, however. To eliminate the time spent trying to fix project configuration issues, we have developed a plug-in for Eclipse that allows students directly from within the IDE to download and import multi-file projects corresponding to individual lab assignments. The projects will be automatically imported into the student's workspace and will be correctly configured and linked to any required dependencies. The plug-in can also be employed with large-scale programming assignments; as assignments increase in complexity, they may require a non-trivial amount of extra configuration before students can begin work on their solution. With this plug-in, students can now focus primarily on the problem-solving aspect of their work and accomplish all necessary tasks, from initial project configuration to final delivery, without leaving the Eclipse IDE and interrupting their workflow.
