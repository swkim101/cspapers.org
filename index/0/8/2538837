In this paper, we propose a novel system for translating organization names from Chinese to English with the assistance of web resources. Firstly, we adopt a chunking-based segmentation method to improve the segmentation of Chinese organization names which is plagued by the OOV problem. Then a heuristic query construction method is employed to construct an efficient query which can be used to search the bilingual Web pages containing translation equivalents. Finally, we align the Chinese organization name with English sentences using the asymmetric alignment method to find the best English fragment as the translation equivalent. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline statistical machine translation system by 30.42%.
