This workshop will provide participants with several small, fun classroom activities culminating in a useful web-based application that allows individuals to fully customize the page resulting from opening a new tab in Google Chrome. Attendees will participate in, and receive Canvas lessons introducing popular web-based techniques including HTML, JSON, Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript and Google Chrome extension creation and distribution. The workshop proceeds in six short lessons in which we will: (1) download and install all software required, (2) introduce basic concepts in HTML, (3) create and link cascading style sheets, (4) construct a JavaScript file implementing some basic, and fun logic constructs into our web page, (5) create a JSON manifest file that allows our application to run as a Google Chrome extension, and (6) make our extension available to the public in the chrome web store. With these lessons, participants will be able to create a universal "New Tab" page for their school with Google Chrome. This page can be re-customized and re-distributed by anyone taking these six lessons. Online lessons will be provided. A laptop is recommended.
