Generic, reusable ontology elements, such as a foundational ontology's categories and part-whole relations, are essential for good and interoperable knowledge representation. Ontology developers, which include domain experts and novices, face the challenge to figure out which category or relationship to choose for their ontology authoring task. To reduce this bottleneck, there is a need to have guidance to handle these Ontology-laden entities. We solve this with a generic approach and realize it with the Foundational Ontology and Reasoner-enhanced axiomatiZAtion (FORZA) method, containing DOLCE, a decision diagram for DOLCE categories, part-whole relations, and an automated reasoner that is used during the authoring process to propose feasible axioms. This fusion has been integrated in the MoKi ontology development tool to validate its implementability.
