This paper provides a decentralized data model and associated algorithms for peer data management systems (PDMS) based on the DL-LITER description logic. Our approach relies on reducing query reformulation and consistency checking for DL-LITER into reasoning in propositional logic. This enables a straightforward deployment of DL-LITER PDMSs on top of Some Where, a scalable propositional peer-to-peer inference system. We also show how to use the state-of-the-art Minicon algorithm for rewriting queries using views in DL-LITER in the centralized and decentralized cases.
