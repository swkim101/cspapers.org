The cognitive walkthrough is a new method for assessing the usability of a system and assigning causes to usability problems early in the design process. Early versions of the walkthrough suffered from tedious and repetitious paperwork. To address this problem we developed an automated prompting system, which reduces the method’s overhead and focuses the analyst’s attention on critical issues. The methodology can be introduced in about an hour, and the automated system allows a user action in a proposed interface to be analyzed in as little as 5 to 10 minutes.
