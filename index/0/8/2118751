State of the art system designs require larger, more densely populated, thermally stable, multilayer hybrid substrates. Increased logic densities dictate the need for narrower conductor line widths and better screening techniques. Increasing material and labor costs, as well as component shortages, are also major considerations in the efficient design of complex substrates. Presented herein are the materials, screening techniques, and process steps required to fabricate a densely populated hybrid using computer generated artwork. 
 The substrate discussed in this paper is being produced for the Naval Air Development Center; the prototype units have been completed and a production lot is currently being fabricated. The hybrid consists of one 32 screened layer berylium substrate housed in 2.8" x 2.5" x.165" metal package. The substrate utilizes 135 (54 H series) TTL chips, operates at a frequency of 10 megaHertz, and dissipates 18 watts.
