Minimizing the task completion time of manipulator systems is essential in order to achieve high productivity. In this paper, this problem is dealt with by utilizing the redundant degrees of freedom (DOF) of a given task and the tool attachment optimization. For example, in a vision-based inspection where a camera is held by a manipulator, the extra DOF can be brought about by allowing the camera to be translated along its approach axis or rotated about this axis when capturing images. Furthermore, the manipulator end-effector position and orientation is optimized by designing an additional linkage at the manipulator end-effector which is called a tool attachment. A 7-DOF manipulator system is used in the simulations to verify the proposed approach. Results showed that this approach can minimize the task completion time by about 17% compared to conducting only motion coordination.
