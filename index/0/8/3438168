In the set disjointess problem, we have k players, each with a private input X^i &#x2286; [n], and the goal is for the players to determine whether or not their sets have a global intersection. The players communicate over a shared blackboard, and we charge them for each bit that they write on the board.We study the trade-off between the number of interaction rounds we allow the players, and the total number of bits they must send to solve set disjointness. We show that if R rounds of interaction are allowed, the communication cost is &#x03A9;(nk^{1/R}/R^4), which is nearly tight. We also leverage our proof to show that wellfare maximization with unit demand bidders cannot be solved efficiently in a small number of rounds: here, we have k players bidding on n items, and the goal is to find a matching between items and player that bid on them which approximately maximizes the total number of items assigned. It was previously shown by Alon et. al. that &#x03A9;(log log k) rounds of interaction are required to find an assignment which achieves a constant approximation to the maximum-wellfare assignment, even if each player is allowed to write n^{&#x2265;(R)} bits on the board in each round, where &#x2265;(R) = exp(-R). We improve this lower bound to &#x03A9;log k / log log k), which is known to be tight up to a log log k factor.
