Nowadays many software applications are deployed over compute clouds using the three-tier architecture, where the persistent data for the application is stored in a backend datastore and is accessed and modified by the server-side code based on the user interactions at the client-side. The data model forms the foundation of these three tiers, and identifies the set of objects stored by the application and the relations (associations) among them. In this paper, we present techniques for automatically inferring properties about the data model by analyzing the relations among the object classes. We then check the inferred properties with respect to the semantics of the data model using automated verification techniques. For the properties that fail, we present techniques that generate fixes to the data model that establish the inferred properties. We implemented this approach for web applications built using the Ruby on Rails framework and applied it to five open source applications. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach is effective in automatically identifying and fixing errors in data models of real-world web applications.
