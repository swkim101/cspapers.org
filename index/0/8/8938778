Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of small sensing and computing devices that have limited power, storage, computation, and network bandwidth capabilities. Queries to the sensor nodes are injected into the network by a data sink node. The simplest way to respond to a query is for each sensor node to individually report back its reading to the sink, at which point all of the readings are processed. This unicast delivery requires that intermediate sensors route all such packets to the sink, which can lead to excessive energy consumption due to the large number of individual responses that need to be transmitted. In-network data aggregation improves the energy efficiency of this process by allowing each node along the routing path to aggregate all values received from its children into a single response value. This avoids the excessive communication required to route individual sensor readings to the data sink. In-network aggregation paths can typically be classified into one of two categories: tree-based or multipath-based. The tree-based approach provides the minimal communication overhead by constructing a spanning tree across all sensor nodes to facilitate routing. However, a single link failure in this model leads to the loss of all data from the subtree connected by that link. Given that WSNs are characterized by high rates of communication failures, this approach can lead to large errors in the average case. Multipath-based approaches add robustness to the traditional tree structure by taking advantage of the broadcast medium, but must be carried out carefully to avoid overcounting when computing the aggregate value. In addition to considering the robustness of the aggregation process, many applications (e.g., battlefield surveillance
