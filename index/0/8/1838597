This article introduces a novel family of decentralised caching policies for wireless networks, referred to as spatial multi-LRU. Based on these, cache inventories are updated in a way that provides content diversity to users that are covered by, and thus have access to, more than one station. Two variations are proposed, the multi-LRU-One and -All, which differ in the number of replicas inserted in the involved edge caches. Che-like approximations are proposed to accurately predict their hit probability under the Independent Reference Model (IRM). For IRM traffic multi-LRU-One outperforms multi-LRU-All, whereas when the traffic exhibits temporal locality the -All variation can perform better.
