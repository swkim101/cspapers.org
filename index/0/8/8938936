User Interface Development Systems (UIDS), as opposed to User Interface Management Systems or UI Toolkits focus on supporting the design and implementation of the user interface. This paper describes Ensemble, an experimental UIDS that begins to explore the electronic creation of interaction techniques as well as the corresponding design processes. Issues related to the impact on the components of the development system are discussed. Finally, problems with the current implementation and future directions are presented.
