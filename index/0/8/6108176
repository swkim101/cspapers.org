The moderator will first focus on the question: “Are enrollments actually declining in computer science programs across this country?” He will report the results of his surveys which indicate there has been a definite downturn in enrollment over the past two years. The panelists will then discuss what is being done at their schools to recruit students and to meet this new challenge of declining enrollments.
