We investigate tiebreaking strategies for A*, experimentally analyzing the performance of standard tiebreaking strategies that break ties according to the heuristic value of the nodes. We find that tiebreaking has a significant impact on search algorithm performance when there are zero-cost operators that induce large plateau regions in the search space. We develop a new framework for tiebreaking based on a depth metric which measures distance from the entrance to the plateau, and propose a new, randomized strategy which significantly outperforms standard strategies on domains with zero-cost actions.
