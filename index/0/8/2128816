This paper presents a novel word reordering model that employs a shift-reduce parser for inversion transduction grammars. Our model uses rich syntax parsing features for word reordering and runs in linear time. We apply it to postordering of phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) for Japanese-to-English patent tasks. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a significant improvement of +3.1 BLEU scores against 30.15 BLEU scores of the baseline PBMT system.
