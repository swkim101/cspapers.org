We seek insight into Latent Semantic Indexing by establishing a method to identify the optimal number of factors in the reduced matrix for representing a keyword. This method is demonstrated empirically by duplicating all documents containing a term t, and inserting new documents in the database that replace t with t'. By examining the number of times term t is identified for a search on term t' (precision) using differing ranges of dimensions, we find that lower ranked dimensions identify related terms and higher-ranked dimensions discriminate between the synonyms.
