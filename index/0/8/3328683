Currently there is a serious conceptual and technical gap between ideas emphasized in object-oriented programming and ideas as taught in algorithms courses. We suggest both a paradigm for "re-expressing" algorithms in terms of classes and objects, and a set of criteria relative to which the quality of such re-expressions can be evaluated. A detailed example is provided for re-expressing the algorithmic idea of sorting.
