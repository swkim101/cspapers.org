This paper explores what kind of user simulation model is suitable for developing a training corpus for using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to automatically learn dialog strategies. Our results suggest that with sparse training data, a model that aims to randomly explore more dialog state spaces with certain constraints actually performs at the same or better than a more complex model that simulates realistic user behaviors in a statistical way.
