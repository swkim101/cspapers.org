Search result diversification aims to return a list of diversified relevant documents in order to satisfy different user information needs. Most of the efforts focused on Web Search, and few studies have considered another important search domain, i.e., enterprise search. Unlike Web search, enterprise search deals with both unstructured and structured data. In this paper, we propose to integrate the structured and unstructured data to discover meaningful query subtopics in search result diversification. Experimental results show that integrating structured and unstructured information allows us to discover high quality query, which are effective in diversifying the retrieval results.
