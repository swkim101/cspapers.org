This demonstration involves two-way automatic speech-to-speech translation on a consumer off-the-shelf PDA. This work was done as part of the DARPA-funded Babylon project, investigating better speech-to-speech translation systems for communication in the field. The development of the Speechalator software-based translation system required addressing a number of hard issues, including a new language for the team (Egyptian Arabic), close integration on a small device, computational efficiency on a limited platform, and scalable coverage for the domain.
