This paper is a case study applying our story driven modelling approach to the Paderborn Shuttle system application. Story Driven Modeling(SDM) aims to provide a very systematic process for the development of object oriented software , cf.[KNNZ00, Zuen01]. A crucial step of SDM is the derivation of general behavior specifications from a number of analysis scenarios. Based on a large number of educational and research projects and based on some first trials in industrial projects, in[DGMZ02, DGZ02, DGZ03] we have developed a systematic guideline for this step. The case study of this paper applies these guidelines to the Paderborn Shuttle system and shows the feasibility of our approach. In the following sections we describe the central phases of SDM with an emphasis on the derivation of operational behavior specifications. Then we give conclusions and future work.
