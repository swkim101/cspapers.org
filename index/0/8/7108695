This paper describes datamanager and database facilities designed to support a computer-aided electronic design system. Datamanager facilities are those for managing files without regard to their contents; database facilities are those for managing the contents of files. Taken together, these facilities provide transparent and user-controlled services for managing the considerable amounts of information which can be generated in CAD environments.
