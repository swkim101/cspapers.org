This paper investigates a simple swimming mechanism, which comprises two concentric bodies and two passive flaps. The mechanism propels itself forward by oscillating its inner body in a symmetric fashion using a single actuator. The paper starts by using a simple model to investigate the dynamics of the robot and to simulate its motion. Next, we simulate various design parameters and conclude that some parameters can improve the performance of the swimming robot. We conclude with a proof-of-concept prototype that is capable of swimming similar to the predicted model. Moreover, by using an asymmetric input, the mechanism is able to rotate in various curvatures. The combination of these forward and rotational gaits can be used to stabilize the robot onto a desired trajectory.
