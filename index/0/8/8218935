Techniques for improving the imageability of an existing data visualisation are described. The aim is to make the visualisation more easily explored, navigated and remembered. Starting from a relatively sparse landscape‐ like representation of a set of objects, we selectively add to the visualisation static features such as clusters, and dynamic features such as view‐specific sampling of object detail. Information on past usage is used in this process, making manifest an aspect of interaction which is often neglected. Issues arising from the use of such features in a shared virtual environment are discussed.
