Rhode Island Hold'em is a poker card game that has been proposed as a testbed for AI research. This game, with a tree size larger than 3.1 billion nodes, features many characteristics present in full-scale poker (e.g., Texas Hold'em). Our research advances in equilibrium computation have enabled us to solve for the optimal (equilibrium) strategies for this game. Some features of the equilibrium include poker techniques such as bluffing, slow-playing, check-raising, and semi-bluffing. In this demonstration, participants will compete with our optimal opponent and will experience these strategies firsthand.
