The majority of existing behaviour recognition systems are based on supervised learning algorithms, which means that training them requires a preprocessed, annotated dataset. Unfortunately, annotating a dataset is a rather tedious process and one that is prone to error. In this paper we suggest a way to identify structure in the data based on text compression and the edit distance between words, without any prior labelling. We demonstrate that by using this method we can automatically identify patterns and segment the data into patterns that correspond to human behaviours. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we use a dataset from a smart home and compare the labels produced by our approach with the labels assigned by a human to the activities in the dataset. We find that the results are promising and show significant improvement in the recognition accuracy over Self-Organising Maps (SOMs).
