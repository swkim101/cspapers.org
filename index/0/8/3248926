Studies the dynamic behavior of a near-minimum time controller for planar flexible manipulators using three control schemes: rigid manipulator control, passive flexible manipulator control and active flexible manipulator control. The Lagrange-Euler equation is employed to formulate workable state variable models for both rigid and flexible manipulators. The link flexibility is incorporated by using the method of assumed mode. Simulation results indicated that effects of small link flexibility could not be ignored. In the worst case, vibrations may even disable the controllers. Higher torque inputs produce larger tip displacements, and reduce execution times. Simulation results also indicated that tip deflections could be suppressed in highly flexible links with small applied modal torques. However, applied modal torques would prolong the execution time if they are too small.
