The Semi-Automatic Digital Designer (SADD) is an experimental interactive knowledge-based design s stem, II whose domain of expertise is digital e ectronics. First, I want The SADD project has two goals. to provide an intermediate digital design problem solver for which a human expert can interactively provide the high-level functional descriptions-of-a circuit and which can take . high-level circuit descri;tion and refine it in?: ciycuit Second, schematic that performs the required task.
