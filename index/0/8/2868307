Rewriting techniques have been used to reason about a variety of topics related to programming languages, e.g., abstract data types, Petri Nets, FP programs, and data bases. They have also been used in the implementation and definition of a variety of programming languages.
At the 1980 POPL Conference, David Musser proposed a new method of proving inductive properties of abstract data types. Since that time, this method, which came to be called inductionless induction, has attracted considerable attention. Numerous applications and improvements have been proposed and several implementations described. However, little or no work has appeared that questions the basic utility of the idea.
The thesis of this paper is that while induction using equational term-rewriting holds great promise, inductionless induction does not. More specifically, we argue that for reasoning about abstract data types traditional inductive methods are usually superior.
