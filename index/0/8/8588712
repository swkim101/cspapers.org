In this paper we study the problem of constructing accurate decision tree models from data streams. Data streams are incremental tasks that require incremental, online, and any-time learning algorithms. One of the most successful algorithms for mining data streams is VFDT. In this paper we extend the VFDT system in two directions: the ability to deal with continuous data and the use of more powerful classification techniques at tree leaves. The proposed system, VFDTc, can incorporate and classify new information online, with a single scan of the data, in time constant per example. The most relevant property of our system is the ability to obtain a performance similar to a standard decision tree algorithm even for medium size datasets. This is relevant due to the any-time property. We study the behaviour of VFDTc in different problems and demonstrate its utility in large and medium data sets. Under a bias-variance analysis we observe that VFDTc in comparison to C4.5 is able to reduce the variance component.
