Road detection from the perspective of moving vehicles is a challenging issue in autonomous driving. Recently, many deep learning methods spring up for this task because they can extract high-level local features to find road regions from raw RGB data, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN). However, how to detect the boundary of road accurately is still an intractable problem. In this paper, we propose a siamesed fully convolutional network (named as “s-FCN-loc”) based on VGG-net architecture, which is able to consider RGB-channel, semantic contour and location prior simultaneously to segment road region elaborately. To be specific, the s-FCN-loc has two streams to process original RGB images and contour maps respectively. At the same time, the location prior is directly appended to the last feature map to promote the final detection performance. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed s-FCN-loc can learn more discriminative features of road boundaries and converge 30% faster than the original FCN during the training stage. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated on KITTI road detection benchmark, and achieves a competitive result.
