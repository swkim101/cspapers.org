In this presentation, we will describe a collection of new object-relational features that have been added to IBM's DB2 Universal Database (UDB) system. The features to be described include support for structured types, object references, and hierarchies of typed tables and views. These features will be covered from the perspective of a database designer or end user. In addition to presenting the features presently available in DB2 UDB V5.2, which became available in Fall 1998, we will discuss the expected evolution and impact of this technology over time.
