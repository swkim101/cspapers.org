In this paper we present an overview of techniques and approaches used for a load transportation system based on small size unmanned helicopters. The focus is on the control approach and on the movement of the rope connecting helicopters and load. The proposed approach is based on two control loops: an outer loop to control the translation of each helicopter in compound and an inner loop to control the orientation of helicopters. The challenge here is that in both loops the dynamics of the whole system - all helicopters and load - should be accounted for. It is shown, that for designing the outer loop controller a complex model of the helicopters and load can be replaced by a simplified model based on interconnected mass points. For designing the inner loop controller, the complete dynamics of the whole system are considered. The usage of force sensors in the ropes is proposed in order to simplify the inner loop controller and to make it robust against variations of system parameters. The presented inner loop controller is independent of the number of coupled helicopters. The outer loop controller depends on the number of helicopters. The problem of oscillations in the flexible ropes due to external disturbancies (e.g. wind gusts) is discussed and a solution based on load state observer is presented. The performance of the presented system was verified in simulations and in real flight experiments with one and three helicopters transporting the load. The worldwide first demonstration of a slung load transportation using three helicopters was performed in December 2007.
