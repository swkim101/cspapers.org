Nilsson and Nivre (2009) introduced a treebased model of personsâ€™ eye movements in reading. The individual variation between readers reportedly made application across readers impossible. While a tree-based model seems plausible for eye movements, we show that competitive results can be obtained with a linear CRF model. Increasing the inductive bias also makes learning across readers possible. In fact we observe next-to-no performance drop when evaluating models trained on gaze records of multiple readers on new readers.
