This paper focuses on computer augmentation of some simple design tasks found in every architectural office - the design and contract specification of arrangements of objects and equipment within a space. Examples of such tasks include stairwells, restrooms, mechanical rooms, and kitchens. This type of design is not considered creative, for it consists of a variation of a standard design within a particular context. Rather, it is an example of the “dogwork” involved in realizing initial design conceptions. A major portion of an architectural firm's time and effort is currently expended on the production aspects of design, of translating schematic design into construction documents1.
 General Space Planner* (GSP) is an automated design, drafting, and problem solving system recently implemented on Carnegie-Mellon University's IBM 360/67 time-shared computer that begins to explore how arrangement problems and other production aspects of design can be either automated or augmented by the computer. This paper describes the current user interface of the GSP system, its required inputs, modes of interaction, and its outputs, and describes how GSP solves several classes of drafting design problems.
