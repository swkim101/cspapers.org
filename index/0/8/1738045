The Lapidary interface design tool allows the graphics and run-time behaviors that go inside an application window, as well as the graphics and behaviors that go around the application window, such as menus and scroll bars, to be specified pictorially. In particular, Lapidary allows the designer to draw pictures of application-specific graphical objects that the end user will manipulate (such as boxes and arrows, or elements of a list), the feedback that shows which objects are selected (such as small boxes on the sides and corners of an object), and the dynamic feedback objects (such as hair-line boxes to show where an object is being dragged). The run-time behavior of all these objects can be specified in a straightforward way using constraints and dialog boxes that allow the designer to provide abstract descriptions of the interactive response to the input devices. Lapidary also generalizes from the specific example pictures to allow the graphics and behaviors to be specified by demonstration. Finally, Lapidary supports the construction and use of ‘‘widgets’’ (sometimes called interaction techniques or gadgets) such as menus, scroll bars, buttons and icons. Thus Lapidary allows all pictorial aspects of an application to be specified graphically. CR
