,Abstract: This paper touches upon the problems ansing in connection with indexing and retrieval for effective searching of digitized images. An empirical study, based on 13 newspaper archives, demonstrates that rules for indexing images can be formulated and that a user group typology can be established. An image user model is suggested based on word clusters. The empirical analysis demonstrates how the results of the word association tests can be used as the foundation for a semantic model.
