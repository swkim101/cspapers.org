Current state-of-the-art image-based scene reconstruction techniques are capable of generating high-fidelity 3D models when used under controlled capture conditions. However, they are often inadequate when used in more challenging outdoor environments with moving cameras. In this case, algorithms must be able to cope with relatively large calibration and segmentation errors as well as input images separated by a wide-baseline and possibly captured at different resolutions. In this paper, we propose a technique which, under these challenging conditions, is able to efficiently compute a high-quality scene representation via graph-cut optimisation of an energy function combining multiple image cues with strong priors. Robustness is achieved by jointly optimising scene segmentation and multiple view reconstruction in a view-dependent manner with respect to each input camera. Joint optimisation prevents propagation of errors from segmentation to reconstruction as is often the case with sequential approaches. View-dependent processing increases tolerance to errors in on-the-fly calibration compared to global approaches. We evaluate our technique in the case of challenging outdoor sports scenes captured with manually operated broadcast cameras and demonstrate its suitability for high-quality free-viewpoint video.
