We have achieved a sustained calculation speed of 281 Tflops for the optimization of the 3-D structures of proteins from the X-ray experimental data by the Genetic Algorithm - Direct Space (GA-DS) method. In this calculation we used MDGRAPE-3, special-purpose computer for molecular simulations, with the peak performance of 752 Tflops. In the GA-DS method, a set of selected parameters which define the crystal structures of proteins is optimized by the Genetic Algorithm. As a criterion to estimate the model parameters, we used the reliability factor R1 which indicates the statistical difference between the calculated and the measured diffraction data. To evaluate this factor it is necessary to reconstruct the diffraction patterns of the model structures every time the model is updated. Therefore, in this method the nonequispaced Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) used to calculate the diffraction patterns dominates most of the computation time. To accelerate DFT calculations, we used the special-purpose computer, MDGRAPE-3. A molecule, Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthetase was investigated. The final reliability factors were much smaller than the typical values obtained in other methods such as the Molecular Replacement (MR) method. Our results successfully demonstrate that high-performance computing with GA-DS method on special-purpose computers is effective for the structure determination of biological molecules and the method has a potential to be widely used in near future.
