All Netflix Prize algorithms proposed so far are prohibitively costly for large-scale production systems. In this paper, we describe an efficient dataflow implementation of a collaborative filtering (CF) solution to the Netflix Prize problem [1] based on weighted coclustering [5]. The dataflow library we use facilitates the development of sophisticated parallel programs designed to fully utilize commodity multicore hardware, while hiding traditional difficulties such as queuing, threading, memory management, and deadlocks.
 The dataflow CF implementation first compresses the large, sparse training dataset into co-clusters. Then it generates recommendations by combining the average ratings of the co-clusters with the biases of the users and movies. When configured to identify 20x20 co-clusters in the Netflix training dataset, the implementation predicted over 100 million ratings in 16.31 minutes and achieved an RMSE of 0.88846 without any fine-tuning or domain knowledge. This is an effective real-time prediction runtime of 9.7 us per rating which is far superior to previously reported results. Moreover, the implemented co-clustering framework supports a wide variety of other large-scale data mining applications and forms the basis for predictive modeling on large, dyadic datasets [4, 7].
