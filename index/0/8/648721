KinÊtre allows novice users to scan arbitrary physical objects and bring them to life in seconds. The fully interactive system allows diverse static meshes to be animated using the entire human body. Traditionally, the process of mesh animation is laborious and requires domain expertise, with rigging specified manually by an artist when designing the character. KinÊtre makes creating animations a more playful activity, conducted by novice users interactively "at runtime". This paper describes the KinÊtre system in full, highlighting key technical contributions and demonstrating many examples of users animating meshes of varying shapes and sizes. These include non-humanoid meshes and incomplete surfaces produced by 3D scanning - two challenging scenarios for existing mesh animation systems. Rather than targeting professional CG animators, KinÊtre is intended to bring mesh animation to a new audience of novice users. We demonstrate potential uses of our system for interactive storytelling and new forms of physical gaming.
