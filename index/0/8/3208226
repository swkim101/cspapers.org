This paper investigates novel methods for incorporating syntactic information in probabilistic latent variable models of lexical choice and contextual similarity. The resulting models capture the effects of context on the interpretation of a word and in particular its effect on the appropriateness of replacing that word with a potentially related one. Evaluating our techniques on two datasets, we report performance above the prior state of the art for estimating sentence similarity and ranking lexical substitutes.
