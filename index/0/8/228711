The Raspberry Pi is an affordable and powerful (for its size) credit-card sized computer that has become very popular since its launch two years ago. It functions as a desktop machine but with easy access to peripheral hardware, such as buttons, sensors and LEDs, via its GPIO pins. Using a Java IDE like Eclipse or NetBeans is out of the question as the Pi is not powerful enough to run those. However, the beginners' Java IDE BlueJ is ideal in this situation: lightweight enough to run on the Pi, but well-featured and designed for education. This demo will show how BlueJ's features such as the object bench allow easy exploration and manipulation of the Pi's GPIO pins, and how easy it can be to write some Java to interact with peripherals connected to the Pi.
