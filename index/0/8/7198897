We have developed a VLSI silicon neuron and a corresponding mathematical model that is a two state-variable system. We describe the circuit implementation and compare the behaviors observed in the silicon neuron and the mathematical model. We also perform bifurcation analysis of the mathematical model by varying the externally applied current and show that the behaviors exhibited by the silicon neuron under corresponding conditions are in good agreement to those predicted by the bifurcation analysis.
