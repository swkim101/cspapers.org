This paper presents core fusion, a reconfigurable chip multiprocessor(CMP) architecture where groups of fundamentally independent cores can dynamically morph into a larger CPU, or they can be used as distinct processing elements, as needed at run time by applications. Core fusion gracefully accommodates software diversity and incremental parallelization in CMPs. It provides a single execution model across all configurations, requires no additional programming effort or specialized compiler support, maintains ISA compatibility, and leverages mature micro-architecture technology.
