A technical infrastructure for storing, querying and managing RDFdata is a key element in the current semantic web development. Systems like Jena, Sesame or the ICS-FORTH RDF Suite are widelyused for building semantic web applications. Currently, none ofthese systems supports the integrated querying of distributed RDF repositories. We consider this a major shortcoming since the semanticweb is distributed by nature. In this paper we present an architecture for querying distributed RDF repositories by extending the existing Sesame system. We discuss the implications of our architectureand propose an index structure as well as algorithms forquery processing and optimization in such a distributed context.
