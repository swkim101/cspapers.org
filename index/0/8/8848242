A system for autonomous roads sweeping by applying formations of mobile robots is presented in this paper. The proposed approach based on Receding Horizon Control solves the formation navigation, planning and stabilization in real-word environments with static and dynamic obstacles. The formations employed for sweeping are built up ad-hoc, taking into account length of robots' effectors (e.g. shovels, sweepers) and width of the working area. Presented method enables to smoothly merge smaller teams with the view of sweeping the larger roads (e.g. runways, highways). The formations can operate in two modes: sweeping and moving. In the sweeping mode, the formations are guided with an aim to effectively cover the cleaning roads, while in the moving mode, the planning system emphasizes the effort to reach a desired target. Furthermore, the moving mode enables to autonomously design complex formation maneuvers, as is reverse driving or turning on spot.
