Bilingual models that capture the semantics of sentences are typically only evaluated on cross-lingual transfer tasks such as cross-lingual document categorization or machine translation. In this work, we evaluate the quality of the monolingual representations learned with a variant of the bilingual compositional model of Hermann and Blunsom (2014), when viewing translations in a second language as a semantic annotation as the original language text. We show that compositional objectives based on phrase translation pairs outperform compositional objectives based on bilingual sentences and on monolingual paraphrases.
