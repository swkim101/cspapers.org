Human Robot Interaction (HRI) is an active field of integrating and embedding different techniques in artificial intelligence. This paper describes my research topic on: Control of Robotic Systems for Safe Interaction with Human Operators. It consists of online motion generation for robotic manipulators interactingwith dynamic obstacles and humans using a moving horizon scheme, modeling and long term prediction of human motion using probabilistic models and reachability analysis, and development of an HRI demonstration platform.
