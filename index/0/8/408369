Sysp(Structured Symbol System Processer) is a base programming language for knowledge representation, and also a non-procedural and non-von Neumman style programming language to the next generation. Logic programming, functional programming, object oriented programming etc. are integrated into a simple and transparent mechanism based on the message passing computation(QA model of computation). An overview of Sysp's framework is presented using simple examples.
