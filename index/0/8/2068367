In this paper, we propose a fast and stable human detection based on “subtraction stereo” which can measure distance information of foreground regions. Scanning an input image by detection windows is controlled in their window sizes and number using the distance information obtained from subtraction stereo. This control can skip a large number of detection windows and leads to reduce the computational time and false detection for fast and stable human detection. Additionally, we propose two-step boosting as a new training way of classifier with whole and upper human body models. Experimental results show that the proposal is faster and less false detection than the method described in the reference [1].
