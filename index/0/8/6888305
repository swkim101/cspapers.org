We describe a system for automating call-center analysis and monitoring. Our system integrates transcription of incoming calls with analysis of their content; for the analysis, we introduce a novel method of estimating the domain-specific importance of conversation fragments, based on divergence of corpus statistics. Combining this method with Information Retrieval approaches, we provide knowledge-mining tools both for the call-center agents and for administrators of the center.
