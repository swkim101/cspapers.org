In recent years, haptics, robotic and networking technology advancements bas brought about networking of various systems. As a result, the spotlight was placed on humanitarian assistance using networks, for example, remote robotic manipulation, which allows for remote surgery and removal of hazardous materials such as landmines and explosives. Most of the research done on robotic manipulation had been carried out using a wired system. Although, there are few researches done with wireless systems, they are not developed for complicated systems such as a robot hand simulating human hand. Using a bilateral robot hand, we have simulated a wireless network through introduction of errors. The bilateral robot hand is compliance-controlled, in which position information is transmitted from the master robot hand to slave robot hand, while force information is transmitted back from the slave robot hand to the master robot hand. Errors were inserted into each of the transmitted information. By evaluating the position trace of simulation and experimental results, we have concluded the effect of errors on haptic information.
