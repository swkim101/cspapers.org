Close human-robot cooperation is a key enabler for new developments in advanced manufacturing and assistive applications. Close cooperation require robots that can predict human actions and intent, understanding human non-verbal cues. Recent approaches based on neural networks have led to encouraging results in the human action prediction problem both in continuous and discrete spaces. Our approach extends the research in this direction. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we validate the use of gaze and body pose cues as a means of predicting human action through a feature selection method. Next, we address two shortcomings of existing literature: predicting multiple and variable-length action sequences. This is achieved by applying an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network topology in the discrete action prediction problem. In addition, we theoretically demonstrate the importance of predicting multiple action sequences as a means of estimating the stochastic reward in a human robot cooperation scenario. Finally, we show the ability to effectively train the prediction model on an action prediction dataset, involving human motion data, and explore the influence of the model's parameters on its performance.
