In this paper we present a dense visual odometry system for RGB-D cameras performing both photometric and geometric error minimisation to estimate the camera motion between frames. Contrary to most works in the literature, we parametrise the geometric error by the inverse depth instead of the depth, which translates into a better fit of the distribution of the geometric error to the used robust cost functions. We also provide a unified evaluation under the same framework of different estimators and ways of computing the scale of the residuals which can be found spread along the related literature. For the comparison of our approach with state-of-the-art approaches we use the popular dataset from the TUM for RGB-D benchmarking. Our approach shows to be competitive with state-of-the-art methods in terms of drift in meters per second, even compared to methods performing loop closure too. When comparing to approaches performing pure odometry like ours, our method outperforms them in the majority of the tested datasets. Additionally we show that our approach is able to work in real time and we provide a qualitative evaluation on our own sequences showing a low drift in the 3D reconstructions.
