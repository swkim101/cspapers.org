In this paper we investigate the benefits of a heterogeneous architecture for wireless sensor networks composed of a few resource rich mobile nodes and a large number of simple static nodes. These mobile nodes can either act as mobile relays or mobile sinks. To investigate the performance of these two options and the trade-offs associated with these two options, we first consider a finite network. We then compute the lifetime for different routing algorithms for three cases (i) when the network is all static (ii) when there is one mobile sink and (iii) when there is one mobile relay. We find that using the mobile node as a sink results in the maximum improvement in lifetime. We contend however that in hostile terrains, it might not always be possible for the sink to be mobile. We then investigate the performance of a large dense network with one mobile relay and show that the improvement in network lifetime over an all static network is upper bounded by a factor of four. Also, the proof implies that the mobile relay needs to stay only within a two hop radius of the sink. We then construct a joint mobility and routing algorithm which comes close to the upper bound. However this algorithm requires all the nodes in the network to be aware of the location of the mobile node. We then proposed an alternative algorithm, which achieves the same performance, but requires only a limited number of nodes in the network to be aware of the location of the mobile. We finally compare the performance of the mobile relay and mobile sink and show that for a densely deployed sensor field of radius R hops, we require O(R) mobile relays to achieve the same performance as the mobile sink.
