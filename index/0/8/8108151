In this paper we consider an online planning problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations. Specifically, a UAV has the task of reaching a goal from a set of possible goals while minimizing the amount of energy required. Due to unforeseen disturbances, it is possible that initially attractive goals might end up being very expensive during the execution. Thus, two main problems are investigated here: i) how to predict and plan the motion of the UAV at run time to minimize its energy consumption and ii) when to schedule next replanning time to avoid unnecessary periodic re-evaluation executions. Our approach considers a nonlinear model of the system for which a model predictive controller is used to determine the desired control inputs for each possible goal. These control inputs are then used to estimate the energy required to reach the different goals. Finally, a self-triggered scheduling policy determines how long to wait before replanning the goal to aim for. The proposed framework is validated through simulations and experiments in which a quadrotor must choose and reach some goal while being subject to external disturbances.
