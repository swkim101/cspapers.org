In this paper we present our multi-vehicle testbed that was designed for verification and validation of cooperative control algorithms involving environmental sensing. Two cooperative control algorithms: prioritized multi-sensing behavior, and a distributed adaptive algorithm for nonholonomic sensor networks are qualitatively verified using our multi-vehicle testbed. The multi-vehicle testbed allows for a straightforward transition from simulation to experimenting on actual hardware and has the flexibility to interface various types of sensors, vehicles, as well as enable indoor and outdoor experiments.
