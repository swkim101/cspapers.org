This paper presents an ontology translation Web Service based on theO3F ontology representation framework that translates between ontologies expressed in OWL. In the O3F framework, ontology translation is based on a mapping from the basic concepts of the object ontology to basic or compound concepts of the target ontology. Using publicly available mappings, it is possible to recursively translate compound concepts of the object ontology into the target ontology. We describe the algorithms used by and the interface of the Ontology Translation Web Service. The FIPA Ontology Service specification[4] was used as a starting point for the definition of relationships between ontologies. Finally, the paper presents the definition of two ontologies in OWL, and the source of mappings from the object ontology into the target ontology. In an hypothetical scenario, two programs using different ontologies interact with the ontology translation web service in order to obtain interchangeability between information that is heterogeneously organised. The translation web service was implemented using Tomcat 1, which implements the Servlet 2.3 specification[13, v2.3].
