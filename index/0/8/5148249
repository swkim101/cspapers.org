Based on a review of the facts about human stereo vision, a case is made that the stereo processing mechanism is highly flexible. Stereopsis seems to provide only local additional depth information, rather than defining the overall 3D geometry of a perceived scene. New phenomenological and experimental evidence is presented to support this view. The first demonstration shows that kinetic depth information dominates stereopsis in a depth cue conflict. Experiment 1 shows that dynamic changes in effective eye separation are not noticed if they occur over a period of a few seconds. Experiment 2 shows that subjects who are given control over their effective eye separation, can comfortably work with larger than normal eye separations when viewing a low relief scene. Finally, an algorithm is presented for the generation of dynamic stereo images designed to reduce the normal eye strain that occurs due to the mis-coupling of focus and vergence cues.
