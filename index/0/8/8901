Photo tourism [5] is a platform that allows users to transform unstructured online digital photos into a 3D experience. Nowadays, image sensors are being extensively used to allow images to be taken automatically and remotely, which facilitates the opportunity for live update of photo mosaics. In this paper, we present a novel framework for live photo mosaic with a group of wireless image sensor nodes, where the image data aggregation is accomplished in an efficient and distributed way. Essentially, we propose to conduct clustering and data compression at wireless sensor network level while conserving the completeness of the feature point information [3] for reconstruction. Toward the realization of the whole system, we have built image sensor prototypes with commodity cameras. We have also conducted preliminary experiments with our wireless image sensor prototypes.
