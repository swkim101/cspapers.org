We introduce a new visualization framework for the intercomparison of more than one data set retrieved from Web services. In our framework, we use more than one visualization space simultaneously, each of which visualizes a single data set retrieved from the Web service. For this purpose, we provide a new 3D component for accessing Web services, and provide a 3D space component, in which data set retrieved from the Web service is visualized. Moreover, our framework provides users with various operations applicable to these space components, i.e., union, intersection, set-difference, cross-product, selection, projection, and joins.
