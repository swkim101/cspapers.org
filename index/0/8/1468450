The idea of a hierarchical design and integration of programming projects in the computer science undergraduate curriculum is proposed and discussed. Research results in software reuse and object-oriented design and development may be used in the design and the development of the set of integrated programming projects. By a hierarchical design and integration of programming projects, this approach aims to increase the effectiveness of the undergraduate learning experience. Using the approach, programming projects in computer science courses may be developed in such a way that programming projects in the lower level courses are used as components (parts) to implement programming projects in the higher level courses. In this way, a hierarchical structure of programming projects can be built and a student's programming projects in different courses can be integrated. Such an integration may lead to the development of complex software systems in the senior year.
