Recent research has indicated ways of using UPF specifications for extracting valid low-level control sequences to express the transitions between the power states of individual domains. Today there is a disconnect between the high-level architectural power management strategy which relates multiple power domains and these low-level assertions for controlling individual power domains. In this paper we attempt to bridge this disconnect by leveraging the low-level per-domain assertions for translating architectural power intent properties into global assertions over low-level signals. We show that the inter-domain properties created in this manner can be formally verified over the global power management logic.
