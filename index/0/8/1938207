The requirements description which is proved to be correct is the key to the successful development of a reliable system. Since the adaptability of the requirements description language is obtained with a simple and extensible language structure, most part of communication is maintained with proper use of labels. Many verification system can provide only restricted capability because of lack of the recognition of meaning of labels. This paper proposes the verification method with assertion description which gives another view of a target system. First, the formal model of the verification is given. Next, the verification method based on theorem proving and several views for verification are mentioned. Last, the verification system and examples are shown.
