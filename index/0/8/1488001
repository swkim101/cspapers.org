An important stage of wide-area systems and networking research is to prototype a system to understand its performance when deployed in the real Internet. A key requirement of prototyping is that results obtained from the prototype experiments be representative of the behavior if the system were deployed over nodes connected to commercial ISPs. Recently, distributed testbeds such as PlanetLab and RON have become increasingly popular for performing wide-area experimentation. However, such testbeds typically consist of a significant fraction of nodes with connectivity to research and education networks which potentially hinder their usability in prototyping systems.In this paper, we investigate the impact of testbeds with connectivity to research and education networks on the applications and network services so that such testbeds can be leveraged for evaluation and prototyping. Specifically, we investigate when the representativeness of wide-area experiments deployed on such testbeds is affected by studying the routing paths that applications use over such testbeds. We then investigate how the representativeness of wide-area experiments is affected by studying the performance properties of such paths. We further measure the impact of using such testbeds on application performance via application case studies. Finally, we propose a technique that uses the currently available testbeds but reduces their bias by exposing applications evaluated to network conditions more reflective of the conditions in the commercial Internet.
