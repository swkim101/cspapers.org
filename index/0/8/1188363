The rapidly evolving managed healthcare industry requires efficient coordination of human and automated tasks as well as information-flow across multiple enterprises. One of the most critical applications in managed care is state-wide immunization tracking, which if supported by appropriate workflow technology can achieve substantial near term impact. In this paper, we discuss a comprehensive and real-world application to support child immunization tracking for the state of Connecticut in close collaboration with CHREFl. The application system uses UGA-LSDIS’s2 multi-paradigm transactional workflow management system METEOR:!. It utilizes the World Wide Web either exclusively, or in conjunction with CORBA-based infrastructures.
