This paper presents a personal cognitive assistant, called Disciple-LTA, that can acquire expertise in intelligence analysis directly from intelligence analysts, can train new analysts, and can help analysts find solutions to complex problems through mixed-initiative reasoning, making possible the synergistic integration of a human's experience and creativity with an automated agent's knowledge and speed, and facilitating the collaboration with complementary experts and their agents.
