In this paper we present the design and first-stage analysis of a purposely built, smart, pop-up wine shop. Our shop learns from visitors' choices and recommends wine using collaborative filtering and ambient feedback displays integrated into its furniture. Our ambient recommender system was tested in a controlled laboratory environment. We report on the qualitative feedback and between subjects study, testing the influence the system had in wine choice behavior. Participants reported the system helpful, and results from our empirical analysis suggest it influenced buying behavior.
