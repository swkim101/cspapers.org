In this video demonstration, we present a remote interaction user interface prototype -- Pointer Wizard, to provide mixed reality experience with intuitive interaction afar. By identifying finger gestures and voice commands, it allows users to interact with appliances remotely, without the need of close proximity or even physical contact. It also brings information from the virtual world out into the real surrounding, thus creating the mixed reality experience. Due to the rapid improvement and development of smartphone and smart devices, we can now integrate the readily available hardware with micro-projection technology and quickly create prototypes that can be deployed rapidly. We designed image and speech recognition apps for smart devices in order to identify the figure gestures and target appliances, and through wireless transmission not only sending control signals to control relays for the appliances and receiving feedback information, but also gathering related information from the Internet,. The prompt control commands and related information are then projected out via portable light-weight projecting mechanism in real-time, hence users are seemingly able to operate and interact with the target from a distance. Through realizing this project, we hope to provide a more convenient way of life, and a more intuitive way of obtaining information or manipulating home appliances, like performing magic as wizards in a fantasy.
