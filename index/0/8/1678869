Image texture analysis has received a lot of attention in the past years. Researchers have developed many texture signatures based on texture measurements, for the purpose of uniquely characterizing the texture. Existing texture signatures, in general, are not invariant to 3D transforms such as view-point changes and non-rigid deformations of the texture surface, which is a serious limitation for many applications. In this paper, we introduce a new texture signature, called the multifractal spectrum (MFS). It provides an efficient framework combining global spatial invariance and local robust measurements. The MFS is invariant under the bi-Lipschitz map, which includes view-point changes and non-rigid deformations of the texture surface, as well as local affine illumination changes. Experiments demonstrate that the MFS captures the essential structure of textures with quite low dimension.
