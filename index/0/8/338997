Despite of the large number of algorithms developed for clustering, the study on comparing clustering results is limited. In this paper, we propose a measure for comparing clustering results to tackle two issues insufficiently addressed or even overlooked by existing methods: (a) taking into account the distance between cluster representatives when assessing the similarity of clustering results; (b) constructing a unified framework for defining a distance based on either hard or soft clustering and ensuring the triangle inequality under the definition. Our measure is derived from a complete and globally optimal matching between clusters in two clustering results. It is shown that the distance is an instance of the Mallows distance---a metric between probability distributions in statistics. As a result, the defined distance inherits desirable properties from the Mallows distance. Experiments show that our clustering distance measure successfully handles cases difficult for other measures.
