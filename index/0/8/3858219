The present discussion highlights the aspects of an ongoing doctoral thesis grounded on the analysis and tracking of emotions from English and Bengali texts. Development of lexical resources and corpora meets the preliminary urgencies. The research spectrum aims to identify the evaluative emotional expressions at word, phrase, sentence, and document level granularities along with their associated holders and topics. Tracking of emotions based on topic or event was carried out by employing sense based affect scoring techniques. The labeled emotion corpora are being prepared from unlabeled examples to cope with the scarcity of emotional resources, especially for the resource constraint language like Bengali. Different unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised strategies, adopted for coloring each outline of the research spectrum produce satisfactory outcomes
