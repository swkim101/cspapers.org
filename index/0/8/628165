We introduce a framework for training architectures composed of several modules. This framework, which uses a statistical formulation of learning systems, provides a unique formalism for describing many classical connectionist algorithms as well as complex systems where several algorithms interact. It allows to design hybrid systems which combine the advantages of connectionist algorithms as well as other learning algorithms.
