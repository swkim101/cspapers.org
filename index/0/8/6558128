Typically the evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) systems is focused upon two main system attributes: efficiency and effectiveness. However, it has been argued that it is also important to consider accessibility, i.e. the extent to which the IR system makes information easily accessible. But, it is unclear how accessibility relates to typical IR evaluation, and specifically whether there is a trade-off between accessibility and effectiveness. In this poster, we empirically explore the relationship between effectiveness and accessibility to determine whether the two objectives i.e. maximizing effectiveness and maximizing accessibility, are compatible, or not. To this aim, we empirically examine this relationship using two popular IR models and explore the trade-off between access and performance as these models are tuned.
