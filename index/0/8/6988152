Many branches of engineering and science rely on graphs for representing a wide variety of objects from electrical circuits to economic systems. It is therefore reasonable to have a framework for constructing this kind of applications that can manage a graph structure. Nebras Graph Management Framework (NGMF) is a layered client-server framework for rapid development of these applications. This framework allows developers to construct different applications that deal with a network of nodes and edges. For example a CASE tool that handles UML class diagrams, a subject manager (an application for business entity classification) or a system for managing hierarchal lists of all product components (Bill Of Materials or BOM) are some cases that can be designed through applying our proposed framework.
