We introduce a new file organization for the storage and manipulation of spatial (or multidimensional) data that is able to execute spatial join operations with great efficiency. The Filter Tree information structure is a hierarchical organization that tends to separate spatial entities by size, placing larger entities at the higher levels of the Filter Tree, and smaller entities at lower levels. Within each level, index entries for the entities are ordered by a space-filling curve (Hilbert curve). This allows the algorithms to use bulk I/O requests, exploiting the locality in the index information, and minimizing the number of I/O transfers from disk. We provide algorithms for constructing Filter Trees, for performing range queries on a Filter Tree, and for performing spatial joins between a pair of Filter Trees. Finally, we include results from experiments using a prototype implementation of Filter Trees to treat both synthetic and real sets of spatial entities. Our experimental results show that full spatial joins can always be done more efficiently with Filter Trees than with current competitive methods, and that in some cases the improvement in performance is very large.
