matrix to within a multiplicative factor of . To this end we develop the first strongly polynomial-time algorithm for matrix scaling –– an important nonlinear optimization problem with many applications. Our work suggests a simple new (slow) polynomial time decision algorithm for bipartite perfect matching, conceptually different from classical approaches.
