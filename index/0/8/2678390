The computer can be used to assist in mechanical layout as well as in analysis. An on-line man-machine system for computer-aided design of integrated circuits takes full advantage of human judgement, while relieving the man of most of the detailed work needed to implement his ideas. Mechanical layout or packaging design is required for all types of electronic circuitry. In the old vacuum tube chassis days, little more was needed than a structure to support the tubes and other components which could be arranged in almost any order and then wired together by insulated leads. Transistor circuitry on printed circuit boards required much greater attention to component arrangement and presents a severe topological problem in routing printed interconnections without metalization crossovers. Integrated circuitry, in which all circuit elements are diffused patterns within a single silicon chip, presents more complex design layout problems and offers great benefits from introduction of computer-aided design methods.
