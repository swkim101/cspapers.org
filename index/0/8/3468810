The objective of this session is to increase evaluator capacity to study CS education initiatives and to share knowledge and resources with the CS education research community. We plan to use the session to share our own experience as evaluators of the NYC CS4All initiative, and to brainstorm effective strategies and approaches to address the challenges inherent in evaluating such efforts. In the session, we will pay particular attention to identifying and developing reliable and valid measures of teacher, student and district outcomes.
