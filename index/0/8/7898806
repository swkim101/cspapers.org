Semantic relatedness is a special form of linguistic distance between words. Evaluating semantic relatedness measures is usually performed by comparison with human judgments. Previous test datasets had been created analytically and were limited in size. We propose a corpus-based system for automatically creating test datasets. Experiments with human subjects show that the resulting datasets cover all degrees of relatedness. As a result of the corpus-based approach, test datasets cover all types of lexical-semantic relations and contain domain-specific words naturally occurring in texts.
