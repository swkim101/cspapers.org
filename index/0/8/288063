Despite an intensive research on flapping flight and flapping wing MAVs in recent years, there are still no accurate models of flapping flight dynamics. This is partly due to lack of free flight data, in particular during manoeuvres. In this work, we present, for the first time, a comparison of free flight forces estimated using solely an on-board IMU with wind tunnel measurements. The IMU based estimation brings higher sampling rates and even lower variation among individual wingbeats, compared to what has been achieved with an external motion tracking system in the past. A good match was found in comparison to wind tunnel measurements; the slight differences observed are attributed to clamping effects. Further insight was gained from the on-board rpm sensor, which showed motor speed variation of Â± 15% due to load variation over a wingbeat cycle. The IMU based force estimation represents an attractive solution for future studies of flapping wing MAVs as, unlike wind tunnel measurements, it allows force estimation at high temporal resolutions also during manoeuvres.
