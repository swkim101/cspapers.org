We describe the design of several portable and efficient parallel implementations of adaptive N-body methods, including the adaptive Fast Multipole Method, the adaptive version of Andersonâ€™s Method, and the Barnes-Hut algorithm. Our codes are based on a communication and work partitioning scheme that allows an efficient implementation of adaptive multipole methods even on high-latency systems. Our test runs demonstrate high performance and speed-up on several parallel architectures, including traditional MPPs, shared-memory machines, and networks of workstations connected by Ethernet.
