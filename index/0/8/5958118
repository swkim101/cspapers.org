Recent research efforts to design better Internet transport protocols combined with scalable Active Queue Management (AQM) have led to significant advances in congestion control. One of the hottest topics in this area is the design of discrete congestion control algorithms that are asymptotically stable under heterogeneous feedback delay and whose control equations do not explicitly depend on the RTTs of end-flows. In this paper, we show that max-min fair congestion control methods with a stable symmetric Jacobian remain stable under arbitrary feedback delay (including heterogeneous directional delays) and that the stability condition of such methods does not involve any of the delays. To demonstrate the practicality of the obtained result, we change the original controller in Kelly's work [14] to become robust under random feedback delay and fixed constants of the control equation. We call the resulting framework Max-min Kelly Control (MKC) and show that it offers smooth sending rate, exponential convergence to efficiency, and fast convergence to fairness, all of which make it appealing for future high-speed networks.
