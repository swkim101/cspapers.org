The ability to securely delete sensitive data from electronic storage is becoming important. However, current per-file deletion solutions tend to be limited to a segment of the operating system's storage data path or specific to particular file systems or storage media.
 This paper introduces TrueErase, a holistic secure-deletion framework. Through its design, implementation, verification, and evaluation, TrueErase shows that it is possible to build a legacy-compatible full-storage-data-path framework that performs per-file secure deletion and works with common file systems and solid-state storage, while handling common system failures. In addition, this framework can serve as a building block for encryption- and tainting-based secure-deletion systems.
