We describe a biographical multi-document summarizer that summarizes information about people described in the news. The summarizer uses corpus statistics along with linguistic knowledge to select and merge descriptions of people from a document collection, removing redundant descriptions. The summarization components have been extensively evaluated for coherence, accuracy, and non-redundancy of the descriptions produced.
