Garment-Integrated body sensing is an alternative approach to sense body movements in wearable sensing. Textile-integrated sensors have the potential to equip everyday clothes with smart capabilities, making the detection of body movements accessible during normal life activities. The practicality of this solution preserves variables directly related to the wearer's needs such as Comfort, Perceptibility, and Awareness that must be prioritized equally with Accuracy and Precision of the sensor data. The central contribution of this approach is to improve the quality of the measured data while preserving user comfort.
