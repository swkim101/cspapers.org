Different types of program profiles (control flow, value, address, and dependence) have been collected and extensively studied by researchers to identify program characteristics that can then be exploited to develop more effective compilers and architectures. Due to the large amounts of profile data produced by realistic program runs, most work has focused on separately collecting and compressing different types of profiles. In this paper we present a unified representation of profiles called Whole Execution Trace (WET) which includes the complete information contained in each of the above types of traces. Thus WETs provide a basis for a next generation software tool that will enable mining of program profiles to identify program characteristics that require understanding of relationships among various types of profiles. The key features of our WET representation are: WET is constructed by labeling a static program representation with profile information such that relavent and related profile information can be directly accessed by analysis algorithms as they traverse the representation; a highly effective two tier strategy is used to significantly compress the WET; and compression techniques are designed such that they do not adversely affect the ability to rapidly traverse WET for extracting subsets of information corresponding to individual profile types as well as a combination of profile types (e.g., in form of dynamic slices of WETs). Our experimentation shows that on an average execution traces resulting from execution of 647 Million statements can be stored in 331 Megabytes of storage after compression. The compression factors range from 16 to 83. Moreover the rates at which different types of profiles can be individually or simultaneously extracted are high.
