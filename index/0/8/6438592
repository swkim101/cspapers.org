The increasing use of large open-domain document sources is exacerbating the problem of ambiguity in named entities. This paper explores the use of a range of syntactic and semantic features in unsupervised clustering of documents that result from ad hoc queries containing names. From these experiments, we find that the use of robust syntactic and semantic features can significantly improve the state of the art for disambiguation performance for personal names for both Chinese and English.
