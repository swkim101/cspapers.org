This paper presents a method for analyzing the performance of individual products in an online store in relation with the store’s merchandising efforts. For this analysis, we introduce a visualization tool which is based on a starfield display [1]. We also use a framework for understanding Web merchandising with a set of metrics referred to as micro-conversion rates which were defined in our previous work [12]. This analysis of Web merchandising effectiveness relies on clickstream data which is visitors’ paths through an online store. Clickstream data of an online store shows how the store is navigated and used by its customers, and provides useful information for understanding the effectiveness of its marketing and merchandising efforts. To demonstrate how the presented visualization system helps explore and understand the performance of individual products of an online store, we present a series of extended starfield visualizations which display clickstream data from an operating online retail store.
