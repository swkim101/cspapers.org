This paper reports the results of a study conducted to measure the effects of the introduction of a pre-eurrieular computer course for certain prospective Computer Technology students at IPFW. The paper discusses certain screening techniques used to allow admission to the regular computer curriculum. The paper also compares the grades in the first computer course prior to administering the selected placement criteria and after the placement criteria was established. Finally, the paper discusses the effect on prospective CIS majors who where placed into this pre-curricular course prior to beginning the regular CIS curriculum. The results show a significant increase in the average grades for students placing into the regular curriculum versus students who were placed into the pre-curricular computer course and who then enrolled in the regular computer curriculum. The results also show that a large number of students who declared Computer Technology as their major and who failed to place into the regular computer curriculum did not continue in the Computer Technology curriculum after completing the precurricular computer course.
