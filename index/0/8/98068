This paper deals with the problem of maintaining distributed directory server, that enables us to keep track of mobile users in a distributed network in the presence of concurrent requests. The paper uses the graph-theoretic concept of regional matching for implementing efficient tracking mechanisms. The communication overhead of our tracking mechanism is within a polylogarithmic factor of the lower bound.
