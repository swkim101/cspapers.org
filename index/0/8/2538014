Hardware transactional memory (HTM) is an attractive research topic in recent years. It has great potential to simplify parallel programming on the soon-to-be-ubiquitous multi-core systems. In this paper, a HTM design is proposed, and overall performance is evaluated. This HTM design distinguishes itself from others by its best effort philosophy. The hardware makes best effort to complete each transaction and software handles those transactions that cannot be completed by hardware. This design seeks a balance between application performance and hardware implementation complexity, and tries to answer the question: what should be done by hardware and what should be done by software. The overall performance of benchmarks is also evaluated by simulation.
