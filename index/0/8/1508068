How would you interactively browse a <italic>very</italic> large display space, for example, a street map of the entire United States?  The traditional solution is <italic>zoom</italic> and <italic>pan</italic>.  But each time a zoom-in operation takes place, the context from which it came is visually lost.  Sequential applications of the zoom-in and zoom-out operations may become tedious.  This paper proposes an alternative technique, the <italic>macroscope</italic>, based on zooming and planning in multiple translucent layers.  A macroscope display should comfortably permit browsing continuously on a single image, or set of images in multiple resolutions, on a scale of at least 1 to 10,000.
