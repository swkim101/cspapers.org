POGOL is a data processing lsnguage which is designed to facilitate problem solutions which involve very large files. Since a programmer can easily comprehend a finite though large file, the first mental solution to a problem usually permits skipping back and forth in the file searching for pertinent information and manipulating it. Unless the file is small enoup$ to fit into core, this approach to problem solving becomes much too cumbersome and expensive. An entire new concept of problem solution is needed to deal with extremely large files.
