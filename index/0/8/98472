A database system fostering the cooperative usage and modification of a common data pool should provide standard database functionality (e.g. application-independent correctness criteria and data modelling) plus means for a step-wise, cooperative refinement of data over a long period of time. Key ingredients are a hierarchical organization of work, a sound data model covering cooperative uncertainly, and support for long-living cooperative processes. Furthermore, mechanisms for data passing and hiding, negotiation means, and notification are of prominent importance. In the paper, the rationale behind such a functionality is described. Furthermore, a proposal is made for the software architecture of what is called a cooperative database system (CDBMS).
