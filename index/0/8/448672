In this paper, we present a new concept for generating magnetic field in Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches intended for safe robotic applications. The main rationale behind this concept is to divide the magnetic field generation into two parts using an electromagnetic coil and a permanent magnet. The permanent magnet generates a bias magnetic field density at the optimum working point of the MR clutch while the energized coil can add or negate the magnetic field to a desired value. The results will show clear advantages of this concept in reducing the total weight of the MR clutch, improving the torque-to-mass ratio, and reducing electrical power consumption. The proposed concept is validated using computer model of an MR clutch and Finite Element Method (FEM) is hired to compare the characteristics of the proposed MR clutch with those from conventional coil based clutch. Experimental results will be provided to further validate the advantages of the proposed new concept.
