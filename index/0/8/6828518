The authors argue for a generalisation of inference from the standard account in terms of truth preservation to one which countenances preservation of other desirable metalinguistic properties. The development is partly historical and partly analytic. A relational account of preservation is then presented and from this the two notions of inferential structure and inferential model are derived. To illustrate the generality of the relational conception of inference, we show how such structures and models can be realised in the development of a legal advisory system.
