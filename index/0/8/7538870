This paper presents a novel time and voltage based technique for successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to improve the conversion speed. By taking advantage of the fact that at low supply voltage there will be a significant difference in comparator decision time for different input voltages, the proposed technique creates multiple auxiliary voltage levels for comparison and hence eliminates the need of additional comparators for acceleration as compared with the existing methods. In addition, a digital self-learning module is also presented, which calculates the uncertainty window required for bound update in the proposed method and thus adjusts to different process corners. To validate these concepts, a 10-bit SAR ADC is designed in 130nm CMOS process with 0.5V power supply voltage. The circuit operates in both conventional and proposed modes. Simulations show that the largest number of conversion cycles is 7, hence resulting in an acceleration of 30% over the conventional scheme, while the average number of cycles is 5.58. Simulation results also demonstrate that the proposed method does not affect accuracy. Both ADC operation modes achieve SNDR (signal-to-noise distortion ratio) of 59dB, corresponding to an ENOB (effective number of bits) of 9.5-bits.
