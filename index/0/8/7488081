This paper presents a time invariant kinematic motion controller for wheeled mobile robots. A path manifold that considers curvature limitations is used to provide a desired path shape and convergence to the reference posture or trajectory. Lyapunov based techniques are then used to derive a control law that asymptotically converges the robot to thepath manifold. Posture regulation, path following, and trajectory tracking capability are provided. Allowable initial conditions are estimated based upon curvature constraints of the robot. Curvature boundaries and asymptotic convergence naturally limit allowable initial conditions and are resolved by driving the robot to intermediate goal points within regions of allowable initial conditions. The proposed controller is evaluated in simulation.
