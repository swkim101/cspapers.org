A versatile assembly system, using TV cameras and oomputer-controlled arm and moving table, is described. It makes almple assemblies such aa a peg and rings and a toy car. It separates parts from a heap, recognising them with an overhead camera, then assembles them by feel. It can be instructed to perform a new task with different parte by spending an hour showing it the parts and a day or two programming the assembly manipulations. A hierarchical description of parts, views, outlines etc. is used to construct models, and a structure matching algorithm is used in recognition.
