In this paper, we conducted a new method to assemble microstructures inside a droplet named “Lab in a Droplet (LiD)”. The method can realize the assembly of micro-nano structures inside a droplet size. The surface tension is used to assemble microstructures automatically. Micro-scale or nano-scale objects are ejected from an inkjet nozzle. They are gathered at the center of the droplet and assembled by the surface tension. We conducted preliminary experiments to check whether the self-assembly of microstructures can be achieved by LiD. The experimental results show that the self-assembly of microbeads is conducted inside a droplet. The nano-scale objects can be patterned on a substrate depend on their sizes. A microstructure made of photo-crosslinkable resin was prepared, and microbeads were assembled with the microstructure inside a droplet. The method can be used for autonomous assembly of micro-nano structures in high precision.
