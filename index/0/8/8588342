Virtual cities in a 3D GIS will not be complete without the details of roofs with chimneys, dormer windows, skylights. We contribute a method of extracting such details from digital large format aerial photography. The dense point clouds produced by a photogrammetric process produce major and minor plane surfaces of a roof and enter into a classification of its superstructures. In real city data with a total of 1312 superstructures the proposed automated process finds 1024, thus achieving success at a rate of 78%.
