This paper addresses the problem of acquiring lexical semantic relationships, applied to the lexical entailment relation. Our main contribution is a novel conceptual integration between the two distinct acquisition paradigms for lexical relations - the pattern-based and the distributional similarity approaches. The integrated method exploits mutual complementary information of the two approaches to obtain candidate relations and informative characterizing features. Then, a small size training set is used to construct a more accurate supervised classifier, showing significant increase in both recall and precision over the original approaches.
