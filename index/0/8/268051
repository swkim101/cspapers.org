This paper presents the experimental identification of the dynamic parameters of the Orthoglide, a 3-DOF parallel mechanism. The dynamic identification model is based on the inverse dynamic model, which is linear in the parameters. The model is computed in a closed form in terms of the Cartesian dynamic model elements of the legs and of the Newton-Euler equation of the platform. The base inertial parameters of the robot, which constitute the identifiable parameters, are given.
