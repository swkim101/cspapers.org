COMDES-II is a component-based software framework which formally specifies the modeling concepts and constraints for distributed embedded systems in different aspects, such as component structures, interaction, hierarchy, etc. The paper presents an overview of the design philosophies of COMDES-II in the related aspects and a generative programming approach developed to enable the engineering applicability of the framework. The dedicated generative programming approach involves the formal definition of COMDES-II modeling language by means of meta-models which are instrumented by a meta-modeling tool â€“ Generic Modeling Environment (GME), and the development of a specific code generation technique using CodeWorker tool to implement the automatic synthesis of system codes from system models.
