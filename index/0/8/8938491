This paper proposes the AN.P2P architecture to facilitate efficient peer-to-peer content delivery with heterogeneous presentation requirements. In general, the AN.P2P enables a peer to deliver the original content objects and an associated workflow to other peers. The workflow is composed of content adaptation tasks. Hence, the recipient can reuse the original object to generate appropriate presentations for other peers.
