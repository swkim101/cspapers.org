General knowledge about conceptual classes represented in a concept hierarchy can provide a basis for various types of inferences about an individual. However the various sources of inference may not lead to a consistent set of conclusions about the individual. This paper provides a brief glimpse at how we represent beliefs about specific individuals and conceptual knowledge, discusses some of the sources of inference we have defined, and describes procedures and structures that can be used to evaluate agreement among sources whose conclusions can be viewed as advocating various values in a tree partition of alternate values.
