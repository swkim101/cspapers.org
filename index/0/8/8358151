This paper proposes a throwing manipulation strategy for a robot with one revolute joint. The throwing manipulation enables the robot not only to manipulate the object to outside of the movable range of the robot, but also to control the position of the object arbitrarily in the vertical plane even though the robot has only one degree of freedom. In the throwing manipulation, the robot motion is dynamic and quick, and the contact state between the robot and the object changes. These make it difficult to obtain the exact model and solve its inverse problem. In addition, since the throwing manipulation requires more powerful actuators than the static manipulation, we should set the control input by taking consideration of the performance limits of the actuators. The present paper proposes the control strategy based on the iteration optimization learning to overcome the above problems and verifies its effectiveness experimentally.
