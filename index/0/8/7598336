Tunely and Pixly are web-based programming environments for media computation built using the Blockly visual programming editor library. These language environments were inspired by Georgia Tech's Media Computation approach and allow images (Pixly) and sounds (Tunely) to be transformed programmatically. Tunely and Pixly provided an approachable environment to students who have little to no experience in programming, and allow younger students to explore programming in a fun way without the challenges and frustration of learning syntax in a textual language. This SRC poster summarizes the design and implementation of these languages. We also briefly introduce initial work on integrating an accessibility tool to allow children with disabilities to explore these opportunities.
