To answer that question, this paper introduces the Bipartite Traveling Tournament Problem (BTTP), the inter-league extension of the well-studied Traveling Tournament Problem. We prove that the 2n-team BTTP is NP-complete, but for small values of n, a distance-optimal inter-league schedule can be generated from an algorithm based on minimum-weight 4-cycle-covers. We apply our algorithm to the 12-team Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league in Japan, creating an inter-league tournament that reduces total team travel by 16% compared to the actual schedule played by these teams during the 2010 NPB season. We also analyze the problem of inter-league scheduling for the 30-team National Basketball Association (NBA), and develop a tournament schedule whose total inter-league travel distance is just 3.8% higher than the trivial theoretical lower bound.Â
