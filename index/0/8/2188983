Gesture interaction has enjoyed increasing popularity in human-computer interactions and has applied to different contexts. At the same time, computing has become more mobile and ubiquitous. This study aims to connect the gestures in the 2 contexts by exploring the possibility of applying gestures in mobile context to three-dimensional natural context. To reveal the contextual effects to gesture interactions, the experiment was designed to elicit gestures in the 2 contexts from users. Different analysis methods were applied, foremost of which was the correlation analysis. The results indicate positive correlation exists between phone and free-form gestures, but significantly varies among tasks. The design of gestures can be applied in the different context, after considering the issues of origin, limitation, priority.
