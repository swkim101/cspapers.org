To resolve or not to resolve, that is the structural ambiguity dilemma. The tradit ional wisdom is to disambiguate only when it matters in terms of the meaning of the utterance, and to do so using the computationally least costly information. NLP work on PP-at tachment has followed this wisdom, and much effort has been focused on formulating structural and lexical strategies for resolving noun-phrase and verb-phrase (NP-PP vs. VP-PP) at tachment ambiguity (e.g. [8, 11]). In one study, statistical analysis of the distribution of lexical items in a very large text yielded 78% correct parses while two humans achieved just 85%[5]. The close performance of machine and human led the authors to pose two issues that will be addressed in this paper: is the predictive power of distributional da ta due to "a complementation relation, a modification relation, or something else", and what characterizes the at tachments that escape prediction?
