A kinematic redundancy resolution approach for the S-R-S manipulator is introduced which uses arm plane orientation as the redundancy resolution criterion. The approach can handle both kinematic and algorithmic singularities in a consistent way, without introducing motion instabilities, yielding thereby motions that can be predicted easily by a human operator. The method is verified by experiments with a seven-DOF Mitsubishi Heavy Industries PA10-7C arm and data from both simulations and experiments is presented.
