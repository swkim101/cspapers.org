In this work, we present a model-based estimation scheme for multi-rotor Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Although modeling approaches for MAVs have been presented in the past, these models have rarely been used for real-time state estimation onboard MAVs. Building on this work, we identify the most dominant effects and propose an easy-to-use calibration scheme for estimation of the model parameters. Given the calibration estimates for these parameters, we derive a state estimator where the state prediction of the indirect Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is driven by a MAV model. Solely using measurements from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a barometric pressure sensor - both available on almost every MAV - our model-based formulation keeps the estimated velocity of the MAV bounded in all directions, as opposed to state of the art IMU-model driven state estimators onboard MAVs. This is crucial for keeping MAVs airborne safely, for instance in the case of failures or re-initialization of vision based localization systems.
