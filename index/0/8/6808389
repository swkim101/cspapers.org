This paper introduces a high-speed vision system called IDP Express, which can execute real-time image processing and high frame rate video recording simultaneously. In IDP Express, a dedicated FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) board processes 512 Ã— 512 pixel images from two camera heads by implementing image processing algorithms as hardware logic; the input images and processed results are transferred to standard PC memory at a rate of 2000 fps or more. Owing to the simultaneous high-frame-rate video processing and recording, IDP Express can be used as an intelligent video logger for long-term high-speed phenomenon analysis even when the measured objects move quickly in a wide area. We applied IDP Express to a mechanical target tracking system to record a high-frame-rate video at high resolution for a crucial moment, which is magnified by tracking the measured objects with visual feedback control. Several experiments on moving objects that undergo sudden shape deformation were performed. The results of the experiments involving the explosion of a rotating balloon and the crash of falling custard pudding have been provided to verify the effectiveness of IDP Express.
