The special distribution, sampling strategy and responding mechanism of human photoreceptor cells are significant for visual system. Photoreceptor cells layer is the connection between the preceding and the following in visual system,in one hand, it could sample and represent the outside information, in other hand, it could process the data in its specific way and transfer processed data to following layers. Photoreceptor cells could, in some degree, decide the information data, accuracy, processing time, energy,and further the balance among these factors. With the development of high resolution CCD, the CCD could achieve the highest density of photoreceptor cells in fovea, which provides a solid basis for realistic emulation on retina photoreceptor layer. The paper precisely emulate the retina photoreceptor layer based on human real physical data and response mechanism of photoreceptor cells, which could aid in disclose the real mechanism in retina and whole visual system and also contributes to artificial retina design and implementation.
