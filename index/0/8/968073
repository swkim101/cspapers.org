We introduce alignment models for Machine Translation that take into account the context of a source word when determining its translation. Since the use of these contexts alone causes data sparsity problems, we develop a decision tree algorithm for clustering the contexts based on optimisation of the EM auxiliary function. We show that our context-dependent models lead to an improvement in alignment quality, and an increase in translation quality when the alignments are used in Arabic-English and Chinese-English translation.
