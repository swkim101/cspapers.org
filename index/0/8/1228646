Martin Marietta Data Systems is designing and implementing for Martin Marietta Orlando Aerospace, a major defense contractor, a system to computerize and integrate all unclassified CAD/CAM graphic outputs related to a large defense project. The system provides for the computerized generation of a Technical Data Package (TDP) containing all of the drawings, standards, and specifications generated during the research and development phase of product design. The heart of the system is a "vault" of computer-contained text and drawing data bases which replace present hardcopy vaults. The system also replaces the present manual search and reproduction of drawings with computer inquiry and on-line graphics viewing capabilities. It is expected that the time required to produce the TDP will be cut from several months to a few weeks.
