Hierarchical clustering is often used to cluster person-names referring to the same entities. Since the correct number of clusters for a given person-name is not known a priori, some way of deciding where to cut the resulting dendrogram to balance risks of over- or under-clustering is needed. This paper reports on experiments in which outcome-specific and result-set measures are used to learn a global similarity threshold. Results on the Web People Search (WePS)-2 task indicate that approximately 85% of the optimal F1 measure can be achieved on held-out data.
