Ever since Wood's "What's in a Link" paper, there has been a growing concern for formalization in the study of knowledge representation. Several arguments have been made that frame representation languages and semantic-network languages are syntactic variants of the first-order predicate calculus (FOPC). The typical argument proceeds by showing how any given frame or network representation can be mapped to a logically isomorphic FOPC representation. For the past two years we have been studying the formalization of knowledge retrievers as well as the representation languages that they operate on. This paper presents a representation language in the notation of FOPC whose form facilitates the design of a semantic-network-like retriever.
