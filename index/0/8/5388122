Telidon is a Videotex System which has the potential to make many types of data bases available to consumers in their homes and offices. A Telidon terminal in every home or office will mean a computer terminal available to the user with which he could access any electronic data base via any telecommunication line and receive information in text and colour graphics. 
 
Field trials of Telidon are beginning in Canada with specially prepared hierarchical or tree-structured data base search techniques, somewhat modified by the possibility of creating networks. Future applications made especially for Telidon will include data bases designed for key word access. The Telidon terminal will also be able to route the user to any data base available to him including many of those already on line. 
 
The design of data base search techniques will be an important factor in determining whether this technology will be acceptable to the general public and become as prevalent as its potential will permit. The human factors of data base design for videotex systems can be revolved into two broad questions: "Can the user learn and remember the necessary procedures?" and "Can the user find the information he seeks within an acceptable time frame?" Each of these questions is being addressed from several viewpoints in relation to Telidon's development.
