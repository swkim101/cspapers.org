Analysis grammar of Japanese in the Mu-project is presented. It is emphasized that rules expressing constraints on single linguistic structures and rules for selecting the most preferable readings are completely different in nature, and that rules for selecting preferale readings should be utilized in analysis grammars of practical MT systems. It is also claimed that procedural control is essential in integrating such rules into a unified grammar. Some sample rules are given to make the points of discussion clear and concrete.
