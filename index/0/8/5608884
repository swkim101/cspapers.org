We propose CL-PRE, a certificateless proxy re-encryption scheme for data sharing with cloud. In CL-PRE, a data owner encrypts shared data in cloud with an encryption key, which is further encrypted and transformed by cloud, and then distributed to legitimate recipients for access control. Uniquely, the cloud-based transformation leverages re-encryption keys derived from private key of data owner and public keys of receipts, and eliminates the key escrow problem with identity based cryptography and the need of certificate. While preserving data and key privacy from semi-trusted cloud, CL-PRE maximumly leverages cloud resources to reduce the computing and communication cost for data owner. We implement CL-PRE and evaluate its security and performance.
