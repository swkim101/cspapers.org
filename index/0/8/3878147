In this paper, we present an ecosystem for mobile application development by end-users. An advantage of this ecosystem is that the graphical user interface (GUI), as well as the application logic, can both be developed in a rapid and simple way. This ecosystem is mainly implemented through development and integration of two sub-systems, namely EasyApp and LSCE. EasyApp is responsible for developing the mobile app with the compatibility of multiple mobile platforms, while LSCE is in charge of creating the service process that can be invoked by mobile app directly. A case study is presented to illustrate the development process using this ecosystem.
