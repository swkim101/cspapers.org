Fisher and Orr (1988) described a geometric reasoning engine based on a value passing constraint network. This paper reports on more recent results from this research: several experiments on detecting inconsistency between constraints, how to blind degrees of freedom in a revolute joint, some results on propagation of error in the networks, and performance on a large three dimensional reasoning problem involving three revolute joints.
