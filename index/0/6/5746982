STT-MRAM (Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM) has recently emerged as one of the most promising memory technologies for constructing large capacity last level cache (LLC) of low power mobile processors. With fast technology scaling, STT-MRAM read operations will become destructive such that post-read restores are inevitable to ensure data reliability. However, frequent restores introduce large energy overheads. In this paper, we propose Selective Restore (SR), an energy efficient scheme to mitigate the restore overheads. Given a L2 cacheline disturbed from a read operation, SR postpones its restore till the cacheline being evicted from the upper level cache L1. Based on the status of the line at the eviction time, SR selectively restores the disturbed cells to achieve energy efficiency. Our experimental results show that SR improves system performance by 5% and reduces dynamic energy consumption by 62%.
