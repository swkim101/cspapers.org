Tom Leighton explained that Internet problems adversely affect current Web services. He pointed out that, for economic reasons, peering links often have limited capacity and that this can easily lead to poor performance, because Internet routing algorithms do not adapt to load. To make matters worse, routing protocols are subject to human errors, filtering, and intentional theft of routes. Tom discussed Internet security issues, working through an example of DNS hijacking. He made the point that virus and worm proliferation and DOS and botnet attacks are severe problems. In 2003, over 10% of PCs on the Internet were infected with viruses. These are not all home PCs: 83% of financial institutions were compromised, double the figure from 2002. Additionally, 17 out of 100 surveyed companies were the target of cyber extortion, and the number of botnet attacks against commercial sites is rising sharply. These problems are very hard to solve, because the Internet was designed around an assumption of trust that is no longer valid.
