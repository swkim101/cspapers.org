When engaged in dialogues, people perform communicative actions to pursue specific communicative goals. Speech acts recognition attracted computational linguistics since long time and could impact considerably a huge variety of application domains. We study the task of automatic labeling dialogues with the proper dialogue acts, relying on empirical methods and simply exploiting lexical semantics of the utterances. In particular, we present some experiments in supervised and unsupervised framework on both an English and an Italian corpus of dialogue transcriptions. The evaluation displays encouraging results in both languages, especially in the unsupervised version of the methodology.
