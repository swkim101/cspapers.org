The rapidly increasing RDF data in the Linked Open Data (LOD) community project is a valuable resource for obtaining domain knowledge. However, RDF data of specific topics also shows a trend of being more decentralized and fragmented, which makes it difficult and inefficient for the users to get an overview of a specific topic and retrieve the desired information. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel system called KFM, which can aggregate the distributed RDF data of a topic according to the facets of this topic. KFM provides a new way for users to obtain and explore domain knowledge in the LOD cloud.
