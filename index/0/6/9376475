Collaborative filtering has emerged as the de facto approach to personalized recommendation problems. However, a scenario that has proven difficult in practice is the one-class collaborative filtering case (OC-CF), where one has examples of items that a user prefers, but no examples of items they do not prefer. In such cases, it is desirable to have recommendation algorithms that are personalized, learning-based, and highly scalable. Existing linear recommenders for OC-CF achieve good performance in benchmarking tasks, but they involve solving a large number of a regression sub-problems, limiting their applicability to large-scale problems. We show that it is possible to scale up linear recommenders to big data by learning an OCCF model in a randomized low-dimensional embedding of the user-item interaction matrix. Our algorithm, Linear-FLow, achieves state-of-the-art performance in a comprehensive set of experiments on standard benchmarks as well as real data.
