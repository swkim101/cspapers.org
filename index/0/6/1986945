Colonoscopy is the gold standard screening test for colorectal cancer. However, it can miss up to 22% of lesions. One way to reduce this misrate is by guiding the endoscopist's attention towards suspicious areas (red-flagging). In this paper, we present the proof-of-concept of a novel endoscopic imaging device for the scanning of tubular organs such as the colon and the esophagus. The envisaged concept works as an accessory for any conventional flexible endoscope using it as a rail. It can generate a red-flagged map of the whole organ by orbiting and sliding a radial array of optical sensors around and along the endoscope. This concept paves the way for a semi-automated concurrent red-flagging technique for colonoscopy that enhances the endoscopist's situational awareness and reduces misrate.
