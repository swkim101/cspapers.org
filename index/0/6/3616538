We present the results of our implementation of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) over the field GF(p) on an 80-MHz, 32-bit ARM microprocessor. We have produced a practical software library which supports variable length implementation of the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA). We implemented the ECDSA and a recently proposed ECC-based wireless authentication protocol using the library. Our timing results show that the 160-bit ECDSA signature generation and verification operations take around 46 ms and 94 ms, respectively. With these timings, the execution of the ECC-based wireless authentication protocol takes around 140 ms on the ARM7TDMI processor, which is a widely, used, low-power core processor for wireless applications.
