EEL (Executable Editing Library) is a library for building tools to analyze and modify an executable (compiled) program. The systems and languages communities have built many tools for error detection, fault isolation, architecture translation, performance measurement, simulation, and optimization using this approach of modifying executables. Currently, however, tools of this sort are difficult and time-consuming to write and are usually closely tied to a particular machine and operating system. EEL supports a machine- and system-independent editing model that enables tool builders to modify an executable without being aware of the details of the underlying architecture or operating system or being concerned with the consequences of deleting instructions or adding foreign code.
