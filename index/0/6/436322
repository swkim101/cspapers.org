In most attempts to make precise the concept of a computable function, or decidable predicate, over a field F, it is considered necessary that the elements of F should be in some sense effectively describable, and hence that F itself should be countable. This is the attitude taken in the study of computable fields (see Rabin1). Our proposed definition of computability over arbitrary fields is based on the Shepherdson - Sturgis2 concept of an unlimited register machine.
