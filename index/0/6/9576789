To address the recommendation problems in the scenarios of multiple domains, in this paper, we propose a novel method, HMRec, which models both consistency and heterogeneity of users' multiple behaviors in a unified framework. Moreover, the decisive factors of each domain can also be captured by our approach successfully. Experiments on the real multi-domain dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.
