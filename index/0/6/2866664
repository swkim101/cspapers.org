Self localization is necessary for mobile robot navigation. The conventional method such as geometric reconstruction from landmark observations is generally time-consuming and prone to errors. This paper proposes a method which constructs a decision tree and prediction trees of the landmark appearance that enable a mobile robot with a limited visual angle to observe efficiently and make decisions without global positioning in the environment. By constructing these trees based on information criterion, the robot can accomplish the given task efficiently. The validity of the method is shown with a four legged robot.
