The latest WAN infrastructure and Grid-based Web Services will be used to demonstrate movement and analysis of TeraByte-scale event datasets for particle physics. Optimized transfers of data over 10Gbit/sec networks linking servers and disk systems will be shown using the latest processors, PCI-Express NICs, RAID arrays and firmware. All available lambdas arriving at the SC06 show floor will be saturated, in full duplex mode. The WAN performance will be monitored using the MonALISA distributed agent-based system. A suite of Grid-enabled Analysis tools developed at Caltech, University of Florida and Michigan will be used, as will. EGEE, OSG, ATLAS and CMS data management software such as SRM, dCache, FTS, and PhEdEx. Prototypes of the latest version of parallel NFS will demonstrate excellent utilization of 10Gbit/sec connections during execution of the analysis tasks.We intend to exceed the aggregate rate of 150Gbits/sec we achieved in our SC2005 Bandwidth Challenge winning entry.
