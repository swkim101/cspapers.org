Moving range query over RFID data streams is one of the most important spatio-temporal queries to support valuable information analysis. However, the location uncertainty challenges the query strategy. In this paper, we propose a probability evaluation model in the RFID-enabled monitoring environments and discuss the query optimization techniques under the scenarios of continuous moving range query, which can also be applied into more situations. The extensive experimental evaluation verifies the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model and methods.
