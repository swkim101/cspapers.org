Although SMART NoC, as an emerging dynamically reconfigurable NoC architecture, is able to improve the communication efficiency significantly when scheduling real-time flows, it introduces uncertainty due to the nondeterministic latency. In this regard, we first study the schedulability of a set of arbitrary-deadline flows with given priorities. Based on schedulability analysis, an efficient priority assignment algorithm is proposed to minimize deadline misses. To our best knowledge, this is the first work of arbitrary-deadline flow scheduling on SMART NoC, which involves sophisticated computation of the worst case traversal time.
