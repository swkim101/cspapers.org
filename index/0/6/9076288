Selecting an aerial platform for an application typically requires compromise. A choice must be made between the flight time and long-range capabilities of a fixed-wing aircraft or the maneuverability and stationary characteristics of a multi-rotor platform. Recent developments of small-scale solar-powered UAVs have leveraged the advances in solar cell, energy storage, and propulsion system technology to reach extended flight times capable of all-day and multi-day flight. This paper presents the concept of a small-scale hybrid unmanned aerial vehicle capable of augmenting the maneuverability of a quad-rotor with the energy collection and supply of a solar-powered fixed-wing aircraft. An investigation into the aircraft design, transforming mechanism, and energy management of the multi-state system is presented. A proof-of-concept prototype has been constructed to demonstrate the airframe operating in a quad-rotor configuration. Power electronics capable of simultaneous battery charging and power loading from a solar array have been validated. Additional work in optimization of the propulsion system and airframe needs to be completed to maximize the performance of the hybrid system.
