We propose a framework to quickly analyze track congestion inside each g-cell at the global routing stage. A distinguishing feature of our framework compared to prior work is estimating the locations of vias and partial track utilization by a global segment inside each g-cell for a given global routing solution. We integrate this model with a proposed track assignment algorithm which we show can more effectively reduce track overlaps compared to prior work. A strength of this work is to evaluate the accuracy with respect to an accurate congestion map generated by a commercial detailed router as reference. This work is a step towards bridging the gap between global and detailed routing which is an important obstacle facing modern IC design.
