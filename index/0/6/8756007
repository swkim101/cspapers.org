Most debris flow monitoring systems deployed today use indirect means to track information regarding debris flows. In this work, we introduce a novel debris flow monitoring system for in-situ and direct tracking of debris flows in real-time. The core idea is to throw wireless sensors into the debris flows and collect flow information as they move along. We will describe the design of the wireless sensors and present some preliminary performance results.
