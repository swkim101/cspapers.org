PADS is a declarative data description language that allows data analysts to describe both the physical layout of ad hoc data sources and semantic properties of that data. From such descriptions, the PADS compiler generates libraries and tools for manipulating the data, including parsing routines, statistical profiling tools, translation programs to produce well-behaved formats such as Xml or those required for loading relational databases, and tools for running XQueries over raw PADS data sources. The descriptions are concise enough to serve as "living" documentation while flexible enough to describe most of the ASCII, binary, and Cobol formats that we have seen in practice. The generated parsing library provides for robust, application-specific error handling.
