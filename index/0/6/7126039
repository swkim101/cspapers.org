Many omnidirectional vision sensors based on convex mirrors have been proposed for observing a 360 degrees field of view. Some have a single viewpoint using a hyperboloidal or parabolic mirror, others have a constant resolution property. Until now, there have not been any that have had both these properties. In this paper, we propose an omnidirectional vision sensor that has both properties; that is, a single viewpoint and a constant resolution. The proposed omnidirectional sensor uses two mirrors, which improves the degree of freedom of the design for satisfying each property. We discuss optimization of the design in terms of geometry and optics.
