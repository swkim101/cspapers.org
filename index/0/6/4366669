It is a tedious task to search and locate a specific book from massive number of books arbitrarily placed in a bookshelf. In this paper, we demonstrate iBookshelf, a system which allows users to quickly search and accurately locate books in the bookshelf, by leveraging a passive RFID system. By deploying a number of reference tags on the bookshelf, we are able to perform localization based on the similarities in received signal strength, and effectively offset the impact from the ambient noises and interferences. We deploy and evaluate our system in a real 3m x 2.5m bookshelf, and show that users are able to locate the book from our Android-based application with 85% accuracy.
