March 1, 1991 Many computer-supported applications are of long duration and consist of multiple steps that are executed over possibly heterogeneous servers. Such activities have weaker atomicity requirements than transactions. Previously, we illustrated how to organize the execution of such activities using trig­ gers and transactions. In this paper, we describe an execution model in which activities may consist recursively of steps that may be subactivities or transactions. The model defines precisely the semantics of activities: com­ munication between steps and the failure semantics of activities including compensation and exception handling. The model also supports querying the status of activities. We also propose an implementation of the model using recoverable queues for reliably chaining the steps according to the se­ mantics of the model.
