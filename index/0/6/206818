WirelessHART is the first open wireless standard for the process control industry. Previously we demonstrated a three-node prototype network based on an early release of the protocol stack. In this demonstration we build a fully operational WirelessHART sensor network of multiple nodes. We show the creation of the network and the execution of process monitoring applications on the network. This new demonstration network serves as a proof of concept for the revised WirelessHART standard and as a platform for our future research and experiments.
