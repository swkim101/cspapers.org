This work describes the design of a capacitive multi-axis force-torque sensor for the monitoring of forces in the sub-milli-Newton and sub-micro-Newtonmeter range. This force range makes it a valuable tool for microrobotic applications. The sensor is experimentally investigated and calibrated. This is the first microfabricated 6-axis force-torque sensor that has been successfully developed.
