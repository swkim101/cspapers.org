Sensor networks using mobile robots have recently been proposed to provide more flexible and efficient sensing. However, mobile robots in a practical world have many accidents with actuator or communication devices especially in their traveling to the destination. Moreover, in the practical world, there are many obstacles and bad conditioned area for both wireless and movement of mobile robots. In this paper, we introduce a practical scheme for delivering data with concerning a practical world issues.
