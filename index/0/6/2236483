We consider wireless broadcasting of data as a way of disseminating information to a massive number of users. Organizing and accessing information on wireless communication channels is different from the problem of organizing and accessing data on the disk. We describe two methods, (1,m) Indexing and Distributed Indexing, for organizing and accessing broadcast data. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithms lead to significant improvement of battery life, while retaining a low access time.
