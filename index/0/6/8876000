Previous studies on mining association rules find rules at single concept level, however, mining association rules at multiple concept levels may lead to the discovery of more specific and concrete knowledge from data. In this study, a top-down progressive deepening method is developed for mining multiplelevel association rules from large transaction databases by extension of some existing association rule mining techniques. A group of variant algorithms are proposed based on the ways of sharing intermediate results, with the relative performance tested on different kinds of data. Relaxation of the rule conditions for finding “level-crossing” association rules is also discussed in the paper.
