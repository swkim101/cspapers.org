We provide a novel hardware and software system for micro air vehicles (MAV) that allows high-speed, low-latency onboard image processing. It uses up to four cameras in parallel on a miniature rotary wing platform. The MAV navigates based on onboard processed computer vision in GPS-denied in- and outdoor environments. It can process in parallel images and inertial measurement information from multiple cameras for multiple purposes (localization, pattern recognition, obstacle avoidance) by distributing the images on a central, low-latency image hub. Furthermore the system can utilize low-bandwith radio links for communication and is designed and optimized to scale to swarm use. Experimental results show successful flight with a range of onboard computer vision algorithms, including localization, obstacle avoidance and pattern recognition.
