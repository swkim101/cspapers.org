This article presents a novel gaze control strategy for obstacle avoidance in the context of vision guided humanoid walking. The generic strategy is based on the maximization of the predicted visual information. For information/uncertainty management a new hybrid formulation of an extended Kalman filter is employed. The performance resulting from this view direction control scheme shows the dependence of the intelligent gazing behavior on the pre-planned local path.
