We propose a new specifically designed method for paraphrase generation based on Monte-Carlo sampling and show how this algorithm is suitable for its task. Moreover, the basic algorithm presented here leaves a lot of opportunities for future improvement. In particular, our algorithm does not constraint the scoring function in opposite to Viterbi based decoders. It is now possible to use some global features in paraphrase scoring functions. This algorithm opens new outlooks for paraphrase generation and other natural language processing applications like statistical machine translation.
