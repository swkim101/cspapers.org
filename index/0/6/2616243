GLR is a recently developed robust version of the Generalized LR Parser [Tomita, 1986], that can parse almost any input sentence by ignoring unrecognizable parts of the sentence. On a given input sentence, the parser returns a collection of parses that correspond to maximal, or close to maximal, parsable subjsets of the original input. This paper describes recent work on developing an integrated heuristic scheme for selecting the parse that is deemed "best" from such a collection. We describe the heuristic measures used and their combination scheme. Preliminary results from experiments conducted on parsing speech recognized spontaneous speech are also reported.
