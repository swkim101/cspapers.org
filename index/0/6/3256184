Near-term spoken language systems will likely be limited in their interactive capabilities. To design them, we shall need to model how the presence or absence of speaker interaction influences spoken discourse patterns in different types of tasks. In this research, a comprehensive examination is provided of the discourse structure and performance efficiency of both interactive and noninteractive spontaneous speech in a seriated assembly task. More specifically, telephone dialogues and audiotape monologues are compared, which represent opposites in terms of the opportunity for confirmation feedback and clarification subdialogues. Keyboard communication patterns, upon which most natural language heuristics and algorithms have been based, also are contrasted with patterns observed in the two speech modalities. Finally, implications are discussed for the design of near-term limited-interaction spoken language systems.
