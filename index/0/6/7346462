We present a new approach to extracting information from unstructured documents based on an application ontology that describes a domain of interest. Starting with such an ontology, we formulate rules to extract constants and context keywords from unstructured documents. For each unstructured document of interest, we extract its constants and keywords and apply a recognizer to organize extracted constants as attribute values of tuples in a generated database schema. To make our approach general, we fix all the processes and change only the ontological description for a different application domain. In experiments we conducted on two different types of unstructured documents taken from the Web, our approach attained recall ratios in the 80% and 90% range and precision ratios near 98%.
