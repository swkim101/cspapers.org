In this paper, the problem of robust control of robot manipulators which perform noncontact and contact tasks is considered. Using the hybrid control strategy, two variable structure control algorithms are developed in task space. One of the algorithms is developed for control of robot manipulators in constrained motion; the other is proposed for control of manipulators in unconstrained and constrained motion. Computer simulation results are presented for illustration.<<ETX>>
