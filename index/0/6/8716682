We derive results of the following flavor: If a combinatorial optimization problem can be formulated via a dynamic program of a certain structure and if the invoked cost and transition functions satisfy certain arithmetical conditions, then the optimization problem automatically possesses a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPT.4S). Our characterizations provide a natural and uniform approach to fully polynomial time approximation schemes. LVe illustrate their strength and generality by deducing from them the existence of FPTASs for a multitude of scheduling problems. Many known approximability results follow as corollaries from our main result.
