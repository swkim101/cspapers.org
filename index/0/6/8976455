Users prefer using multiple mobile devices interchangeably by switching between the devices. A solution to this requirement is the migration of applications between mobile devices at runtime. In our vision to move the application from a device A to a device B, instead of synchronizing just the application's data, a simple swiping gesture can be used. Afterwards the user is able to use the same application including its current state on device B. To achieve this, we plan to put the running application on the device A into a paused state, take a snapshot afterwards, move the application to the device B by using a middleware on both devices, extract the snapshot on device B and finally resume it on device B from its paused state. The outcome of the research will be a framework and either a kernel module or an API to migrate mobile applications.
