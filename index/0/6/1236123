An efficient solution to the wire sizing problem (WSP) using the Elmore delay model is proposed. Two formulations of the problem are put forth: in the first, the minimum interconnect delay is sought, while in the second, we minimize the net delay under delay constraints at the leaf nodes; previous approaches solve only the former problem. Theoretical results on these problems are proved, and a sensitivity-based algorithm is devised. It is shown experimentally that the second formulation provides significantly better engineering solutions.
