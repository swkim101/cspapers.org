We compare the effectiveness of four different syntactic CCG parsers for a semantic slot-filling task to explore how much syntactic supervision is required for downstream semantic analysis. This extrinsic, task-based evaluation provides a unique window to explore the strengths and weaknesses of semantics captured by unsupervised grammar induction systems. We release a new Freebase semantic parsing dataset called SPADES (Semantic PArsing of DEclarative Sentences) containing 93K cloze-style questions paired with answers. We evaluate all our models on this dataset. Our code and data are available at this https URL
