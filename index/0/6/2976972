We design an extension datalogHSn□ of datalog with hyperrectangle generalisations of Halpern-Shoham's modal operators on intervals and a corresponding query language. We prove that, over n-dimensional spaces comprised of Z and R, finding certain answers to datalogHSn□ queries can be reduced to standard datalog query answering. We present experimental results showing the expressivity and efficiency of datalogHSn□ on historical data.
