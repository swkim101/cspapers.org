Welcome to Austin for the 34th edition of the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design! ICCAD is the premier forum to explore emerging technology challenges, present cutting-edge R&D solutions, record theoretical and empirical advances, and identify future roadmaps for design automation. Continuing a long tradition, ICCAD continues to be the home for the ACM/SIGDA CADathlon and Student Research Competition, several CAD contests, including the IEEE CEDA CAD Contest, and a remarkable set of workshops on design automation for analog and mixed-signal circuits, EDA research on learning on a chip, design for dark silicon era, variability modeling and characterization, and formal verification.
