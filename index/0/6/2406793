Existing proofs demonstrating the computational limitations of Recurrent Cascade Correlation and similar networks (Fahlman, 1991; Bachrach, 1988; Mozer, 1988) explicitly limit their results to units having sigmoidal or hard-threshold transfer functions (Giles et al., 1995; and Kremer, 1996). The proof given here shows that for any finite, discrete transfer function used by the units of an RCC network, there are finite-state automata (FSA) that the network cannot model, no matter how many units are used. The proof also applies to continuous transfer functions with a finite number of fixed-points, such as sigmoid and radial-basis functions.
