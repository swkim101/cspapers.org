We consider the bin packing problem with d different item sizes and revisit the structure theorem given by Goemans and Rothvo√ü about solutions of the integer cone. We present new techniques on how solutions can be modified and give a new structure theorem that relies on the set of vertices of the underlying integer polytope. As a result of our new structure theorem, we obtain an algorithm for the bin packing problem with running time [Formula: see text], where V is the set of vertices of the integer knapsack polytope, and [Formula: see text] is the encoding length of the bin packing instance. The algorithm is fixed-parameter tractable, parameterized by the number of vertices of the integer knapsack polytope [Formula: see text]. This shows that the bin packing problem can be solved efficiently when the underlying integer knapsack polytope has an easy structure (i.e., has a small number of vertices). Furthermore, we show that the presented bounds of the structure theorem are asymptotically tight. We give a construction of bin packing instances using new structural insights and classical number theoretical theorems which yield the desired lower bound.
