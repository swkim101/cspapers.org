The features available in Twitter provide meaningful information that can be harvested to provide a ranked list of followees to each user. We hypothesize that retweet and mention features can be further enriched by incorporating both temporal and additional/indirect links from within user's community. Our empirical results provide insights into the effectiveness of each feature, and evaluate our proposed similarity measures in ranking the followees. Utilizing temporal information and indirect links improves the effectiveness of retweet and mention features in terms of nDCG.
