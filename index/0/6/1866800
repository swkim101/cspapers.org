Information about driver's driving skill can be used to adapt vehicle control parameters to facilitate the specific driver's needs in terms of vehicle performance and driving pleasure. This paper presents an approach to driving skill characterization from a pattern-recognition perspective. The basic idea is to extract patterns that reflect the driver's driving skill level from the measurements of the driver's behavior and the vehicle response. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using pattern recognition approach to characterize driver's handling skill. This paper concludes with the discussions of the challenges and future works to bring the proposed technique to practical use.
