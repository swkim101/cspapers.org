We have designed, fabricated, and tested an adaptive Winner-Take-All (WTA) circuit based upon the classic WTA of Lazzaro, et al [1]. We have added a time dimension (adaptation) to this circuit to make the input derivative an important factor in winner selection. To accomplish this, we have modified the classic WTA circuit by adding floating gate transistors which slowly null their inputs over time. We present a simplified analysis and experimental data of this adaptive WTA fabricated in a standard CMOS 2Âµm process.
