We propose novel data structures and fast algorithmic techniques to detect, on-line, the occurrences of an arbitrary pattern string P into a text T subject to incrementa insertions and deletions of strings. Our algorithms improve previous bounds, and are based upon combinatorial properties of chains of pattern occurrences in T. We exploit a geometric interpretation and introduce the Dynamic &fix Array, which is the first dynamic data structure (to our knowledge) that combines the flexibility of S&x â€˜Prees [l?, 211 with the lexicographic order of SU@~ Aways [IS].
