We present a method for allowing a humanoid robot to recognize its own motion in its visual field, thus enabling it to distinguish itself from other agents in the vicinity. Our approach consists of learning a characteristic time window between the initiation of motor movement and the perception of arm motions. The method has been implemented and evaluated on an infant humanoid platform. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of using the delayed temporal contingency in the action-perception loop as a basis for simple self-other discrimination. We conclude by suggesting potential applications in social robotics and in generating forward models of motion.
