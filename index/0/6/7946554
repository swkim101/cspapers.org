Energy consumption is increasingly more important in large-scale query processing. This problem requires revisiting traditional query processing in actual DBMSs to identify the potential of energy saving, and to study the trade-offs between energy consumption and performance. In this paper, we propose EnerQuery, a tool built on top of a traditional DBMS to capitalize the efforts invested in building energy-aware query optimizers, which have the lion's share in energy consumption. Energy consumption is estimated on all query plan steps and integrated into a mathematical linear cost model used to select the best query plans. To increase end users' energy awareness, EnerQuery features a diagnostic GUI to visualize energy consumption per step and its savings when tuning key parameters during query execution.
