Combinatory Categorial Grammars, CCGs, (Steedman 1985) have been shown by Weir and Joshi (1988) to generate the same class of languages as Tree-Adjoining Grammars (TAG), Head Grammars (HG), and Linear Indexed Grammars (LIG). In this paper, I will discuss the effect of using variables in lexical category assignments in CCGs. It will be shown that using variables in lexical categories can increase the weak generative capacity of CCGs beyond the class of grammars listed above.
