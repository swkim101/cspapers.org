We study the Maximum Budgeted Allocation problem, which is the problem of assigning indivisible items to players with budget constraints. In its most general form, an instance of the MBA problem might include many different prices for the same item among different players, and different budget constraints for every player. So far, the best approximation algorithms we know for the MBA problem achieve a 3/4-approximation ratio, and employ a natural LP relaxation, called the Assignment-LP. In this paper, we give an algorithm for MBA, and prove that it achieves a 3/4 + c-approximation ratio, for some constant c > 0. This algorithm works by rounding solutions to an LP called the Configuration-LP, therefore also showing that the Configuration-LP is strictly stronger than the Assignment-LP (for which we know that the integrality gap is 3/4) for the MBA problem.
