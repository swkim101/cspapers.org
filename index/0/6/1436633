This paper proposes a novel technique to extract training data from free space in a scene using a stereo camera. The proposed technique exploits the projection of planes in the v-disparity image paired with Bayesian linear regression to reliably identify training image pixels belonging to free space in a scene. Unlike other methods in the literature, the algorithm does not require any prior training, has only one free parameter, and is shown to provide consistent results over a variety of terrains without the need for any manual tuning. The proposed method is compared to two other data extraction methods from the literature. Results of Support Vector classifiers using training data extracted by the proposed technique are superior in terms of quality and consistency of free space estimation. Furthermore, the computation time required by the proposed technique is shown to be smaller and more consistent than that of other training data extraction methods.
