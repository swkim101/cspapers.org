An approach to timing analysis of cyclic concurrent programs is presented. GR/sub 0/ path-expressions are used to describe synchronization and concurrency of atomic operations in cyclic concurrent programs. The behavior of a cyclic concurrent program is represented as a partial order of atomic operations, and a technique to derive this partial order from a GR/sub 0/ program is developed. Given the execution times of the individual atomic operations of a GR/sub 0/ program and a set of timing constraints, our timing analysis technique uses the partial order to determine whether the concurrent program, when executed, will satisfy the set of timing constraints. The timing analysis technique can be completely automated.
