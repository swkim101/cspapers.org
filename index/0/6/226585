We consider the scenario that N sensors collaborate to observe a single event. The sensors are distributed and can only exchange messages through a network to reach a consensus about the observed event. In this paper, we propose a very robust and simple method using broadcast gossip algorithm to solve the distributed hypothesis testing problem. The simulation result shows that our method has good performance and is very energy efficient comparing to existing methods.
