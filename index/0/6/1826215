We present an efficient procedure for cost-based abduction, which is based on the idea of using chart parsers as proof procedures. We discuss in detail three features of our algorithm --- goal-driven bottom-up derivation, tabulation of the partial results, and agenda control mechanism --- and report the results of the preliminary experiments, which show how these features improve the computational efficiency of cost-based abduction.
