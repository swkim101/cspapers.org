Self-organizing Semantic Map for Information Retrieval Xia Lin Dagobert Soergel Gary Marchionini College of Library and Information Services University of Maryland College Park, A neural network’s unsupervised learning algorithm, Kohonen’s feature map, is applied to constructing a selforganizing semantic map for information retrieval. The semantic map visualizes semantic relationships between input documents, and has properties of economic representation of data with their interrelationships. The potentials of the semantic map include using the map as a retrieval interface for an online bibliographic system. A prototype system that demonstrates this potential is described.
