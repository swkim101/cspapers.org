At our institute, two generations of antropomorphic hands have been designed. In quite a few experiments and demonstrations we could show the abilities of our hands and gain a lot of experience in what artificial hands can do, what abilities they need and where their limitations lie. In this paper, we would like to give an overview over the experiments performed with the DLR hands, our hands abilities and the things that need to be done in the near future.
