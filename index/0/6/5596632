I recently had an opportunity to be a panelist at a session called “Marketing to Women”. During the session, one of the audience members asked a question that stumped the panel. The question was “Where do I find single women clients?” At the time, I flippantly suggested “the courthouse” – mainly because I couldn’t think of anything better. However, since then, I have had plenty of time to think about that question. It was truly a good question that deserved a better answer.
