Active vision systems are usually limited to either partial or static scene reconstructions. In this paper, we propose to acquire the entire 3D shape of a dynamic scene. This is performed using a multiple projectors and cameras system, that allows to recover the entire shape of the object within a single scan at each frame. Like previous approaches, a static and simple pattern is used to avoid interferences of multiple patterns projected on the same object. In this paper, we extend the technique to capture a dense entire shape of a moving object with accuracy and high video frame rate. To achieve this, we mainly propose two additional steps; one is checking the consistency between the multiple cameras and projectors, and the other is an algorithm for light sectioning based on a plane parameter optimization. In addition, we also propose efficient noise reduction and mesh generation algorithm which are necessary for practical applications. In the experiments, we show that we can successfully reconstruct dense entire shapes of moving objects. Results are illustrated on real data from a system composed of six projectors and six cameras that was actually built.
