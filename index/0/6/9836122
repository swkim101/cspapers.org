In this paper, we propose a general framework to incorporate semantic knowledge into the popular data-driven learning process of word embeddings to improve the quality of them. Under this framework, we represent semantic knowledge as many ordinal ranking inequalities and formulate the learning of semantic word embeddings (SWE) as a constrained optimization problem, where the data-derived objective function is optimized subject to all ordinal knowledge inequality constraints extracted from available knowledge resources such as Thesaurus and WordNet. We have demonstrated that this constrained optimization problem can be efficiently solved by the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, even for a large number of inequality constraints. Experimental results on four standard NLP tasks, including word similarity measure, sentence completion, name entity recognition, and the TOEFL synonym selection, have all demonstrated that the quality of learned word vectors can be significantly improved after semantic knowledge is incorporated as inequality constraints during the learning process of word embeddings.
