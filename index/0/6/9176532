We study the problem of selecting a subset of big data to train a classifier while incurring minimal performance loss. We show the connection of submodularity to the data likelihood functions for Naive Bayes (NB) and Nearest Neighbor (NN) classifiers, and formulate the data subset selection problems for these classifiers as constrained submodular maximization. Furthermore, we apply this framework to active learning and propose a novel scheme called filtered active submodular selection (FASS), where we combine the uncertainty sampling method with a submodular data subset selection framework. We extensively evaluate the proposed framework on text categorization and handwritten digit recognition tasks with four different classifiers, including deep neural network (DNN) based classifiers. Empirical results indicate that the proposed framework yields significant improvement over the state-of-the-art algorithms on all classifiers.
