We are currently developing an algorithm for knowledge-based corre­ spondence analysis in dynamic stereo images. In this paper we describe the feature selection algorithms and the relational data structure used for matching. We also present a clustering algorithm that is used to group the tokens into sets of similar tokens. The matching algorithm uses this classification information to plan a matching strategy. The least ambiguous image features are matched first and are used as a 'han­ dle' for constraint propagation. We present two algorithms for feature selection in colour images —a region grower and an interest opera­ tor, as well as experimental results for point classification and region classification.
