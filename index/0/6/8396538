In this paper we present research in which we apply (i) the kind of intrinsic evaluation metrics that are characteristic of current comparative HLT evaluation, and (ii) extrinsic, human task-performance evaluations more in keeping with NLG traditions, to 15 systems implementing a language generation task. We analyse the evaluation results and find that there are no significant correlations between intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation measures for this task.
