Our aim in this work is to generate an intelligent interface for profiling and evaluating each student remotely accessing a robot assisted lab setup. The interface provides the student with the "hands on" experience by necessary visual feedback, giving this user as much freedom as possible to control the experiment. Besides, the system evaluates the user's performance, adapts the context to the level of user's acquired knowledge and skill, and thus intelligently coaches the user to successfully do the experiment. The system's ability is demonstrated on an example and the behavior of each module in the proposed system is discussed. The major contribution of this paper is taking the student behavior into consideration while providing online robotics experimentation, evaluating the user's performance and coaching him/her towards the successful achievement of the tasks.
