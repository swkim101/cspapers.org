Error estimating coding (EEC) has recently been established as an important tool to estimate bit error rates in the transmission of packets over wireless links, with a number of potential applications in wireless networks. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of error estimating codes through the lens of Fisher information analysis and find that the original EEC estimator fails to exploit the information contained in its code to the fullest extent. Motivated by this discovery, we design a new estimator for the original EEC algorithm, which significantly improves the estimation accuracy, and is empirically very close to the Cramer-Rao bound. Following this path, we generalize the EEC algorithm to a new family of algorithms called gEEC generalized EEC. These algorithms can be tuned to hold 25-35% more information with the same overhead, and hence deliver even better estimation accuracy---close to optimal, as evidenced by the Cramer-Rao bound. Our theoretical analysis and assertions are supported by extensive experimental evaluation.
