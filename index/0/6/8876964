What is the best paging algorithm if one has partial information about the possible sequences of page requests? We give a partial answer to this question, by presenting the analysis of strongly competitive paging algorithms in the access graph model. This model restricts page requests so that they conform to a notion of locality of reference, given by an arbitrary access graph.
We first consider optimal algorithms for undirected access graphs. Borodin et al. [2] define an algorithm, called FAR, and proved that it is within a logarithmic factor of the optimal. We prove that FAR is in fact strongly competitive, i.e. within a constant factor of the optimum. For directed access graphs, we present an algorithm that is strongly competitive on all structured program graphsâ€”graphs modeling the request sequences of structured programs.
