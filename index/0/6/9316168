This study proposes a word alignment model based on a recurrent neural network (RNN), in which an unlimited alignment history is represented by recurrently connected hidden layers. We perform unsupervised learning using noise-contrastive estimation (Gutmann and Hyvarinen, 2010; Mnih and Teh, 2012), which utilizes artificially generated negative samples. Our alignment model is directional, similar to the generative IBM models (Brown et al., 1993). To overcome this limitation, we encourage agreement between the two directional models by introducing a penalty function that ensures word embedding consistency across two directional models during training. The RNN-based model outperforms the feed-forward neural network-based model (Yang et al., 2013) as well as the IBM Model 4 under Japanese-English and French-English word alignment tasks, and achieves comparable translation performance to those baselines for Japanese-English and Chinese-English translation tasks.
