The most important problems of our century require collaborative work. Therefore, as educators, we must be producing individuals who understand how to communicate and work with professionals from other fields. In this paper, we outline our ongoing efforts in addressing this need, without compromising discipline specific qualities or goals. Specifically, we present a number of programming projects that fulfill curricular requirements as well as making students aware of the Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) context of their work.
