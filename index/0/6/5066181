~hstt~ct A simple and efficient recovery method for nested transact.ions, called ARIES/NT (Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics for Nested ‘I’ransactions), that uses wrile-ahead logging and supports semantically-rich modes of locking and operation logging is presented. ‘I’his method applies to a very general model of nested transactions, which includes parlial rollbacks of subtransactions, upward and downward inheritance of locks, and concurrent execution of ancestor and descendent subtransactions. The adopted syslem nrchit.cclure encompasses aspects of distributed data base management also. ARIES/NT is an extension of the ARIES recovery and concurrency control method developed recently for the single-level transaction model by Mohan. et. al. in the IBM Research Report RJ6649.
