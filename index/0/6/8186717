There are many difficulties to remotely control a robot over Internet such as transmission time delay, limitation of bandwidth, and packet loss. In this paper, we propose a novel remote control architecture and a communication architecture for Internet-based robots, which is insensitive to the transmission time delay and packet loss. The proposed architecture guarantees enhanced remote control by providing the perfect copy of the status of remote robot at real-time. The communication protocol has a flexible packet format and various packet sizes at runtime for robust and reliable control mechanism. The architecture together with the protocol provides improved control performance. Experiments shows that the effectiveness and applicability of the internet-based robot with the proposed architecture.
