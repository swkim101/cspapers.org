We address the problem of learning structured unsupervised models with moment sparsity typical in many natural language induction tasks. For example, in unsupervised part-of-speech (POS) induction using hidden Markov models, we introduce a bias for words to be labeled by a small number of tags. In order to express this bias of posterior sparsity as opposed to parametric sparsity, we extend the posterior regularization framework [7]. We evaluate our methods on three languages — English, Bulgarian and Portuguese — showing consistent and significant accuracy improvement over EM-trained HMMs, and HMMs with sparsity-inducing Dirichlet priors trained by variational EM. We increase accuracy with respect to EM by 2.3%-6.5% in a purely unsupervised setting as well as in a weakly-supervised setting where the closed-class words are provided. Finally, we show improvements using our method when using the induced clusters as features of a discriminative model in a semi-supervised setting.
