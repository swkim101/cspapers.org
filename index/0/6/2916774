A course that surveys state-of-the-art microprocessors offers an excellent forum for students to see how computer architecture techniques are employed in practice and for them to gain a detailed knowledge of the state of the art in microprocessor design. The University of Virginia has developed such a course, organized around student presentations and a substantial research project. The course can accommodate a range of students, from advanced undergraduates to senior graduate students. The course can also be easily adapted to a survey of embedded processors or DSPs. This paper describes the course and lessons learned.
