Although NCE has shown promising performance in neural machine translation, its full potential has not been demonstrated in the language modelling literature. A sufficient investigation of the hyperparameters in the NCE-based neural language models was clearly missing. In this paper, we showed that NCE can be a very successful approach in neural language modelling when the hyperparameters of a neural network are tuned appropriately. We introduced the `search-then-converge' learning rate schedule for NCE and designed a heuristic that specifies how to use this schedule. The impact of the other important hyperparameters, such as the dropout rate and the weight initialisation range, was also demonstrated. Using a popular benchmark, we showed that appropriate tuning of NCE in neural language models outperforms the state-of-the-art single-model methods based on standard dropout and the standard LSTM recurrent neural networks.
