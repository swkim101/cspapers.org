A family of planar parallel manipulators is investigated and some novel members are proposed. The common feature of the studied manipulators is that the rotation axes of the actuated arms coincide. This feature makes it possible to rotate the whole arm system an infinite number of revolutions around the center of the manipulator. The result is a large workspace in relation to the footprint. Both 2- and 3-DOF variants are presented and the suitability of this family of manipulators for kinematic analysis is demonstrated. Thus, different methods to find optimal manipulability with respect to platform positioning and rotation have been analyzed.
