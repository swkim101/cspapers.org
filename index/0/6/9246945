Soft robots, primarily made out of intrinsically soft materials, have flourished greatly in the past decade due to their advantages such as flexibility and adaptability over rigid-bodied robots. A rich repertoire of soft robots designed from intuitive or biomimetic approaches have been developed to provide new solutions for robots. However, these design approaches are limited by the designers' experience and inspiration, and a systematic design methodology for soft robots is still missing. We tackle this issue by mathematically recasting the design problem under the framework of topology optimization problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, in this paper, we develop a pneumatically actuated soft gripper consisting of three fingers, each finger is able to undergo a free travel bending and deliver a grasping force. Hence, each gripper finger is designed as a continuum compliant mechanism to achieve its maximal bending deformation. The proposed soft gripper with complex shape is directly fabricated through 3D printing technology. Experimental results show that the deflected soft finger is able to achieve a 41Â° free travel bending and generate 0.68N blocked force upon 0.11MPa actuation pressure. This work represents an important step towards the goal of designing soft robots automatically.
