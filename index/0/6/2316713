Driven by planning problems with both disjunctive constraints and contingency, we define the Disjunctive Temporal Problem with Uncertainty (DTPU), an extension of the DTP that includes contingent events. Generalizing existing work on Simple Temporal Problems with Uncertainty, we divide the time-points into controllable and uncontrollable classes, and propose varying notions of controllability to replace the notion of consistency.
