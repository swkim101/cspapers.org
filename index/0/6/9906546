In this paper we examine different linguistic features for sentimental polarity classification, and perform a comparative study on this task between blog and review data. We found that results on blog are much worse than reviews and investigated two methods to improve the performance on blogs. First we explored information retrieval based topic analysis to extract relevant sentences to the given topics for polarity classification. Second, we adopted an adaptive method where we train classifiers from review data and incorporate their hypothesis as features. Both methods yielded performance gain for polarity classification on blog data.
