The problem of verification is the key issue for journalists who use social media. This paper argues for the importance of a user-centered approach in finding solutions to this problem. Because journalists have different needs for different types of stories, there is no one magic bullet that can verify social media. Any tool will need to have a multi-faceted approach to the problem, and will have to be adjustable to suit the particular needs of individual journalists and news organizations.
