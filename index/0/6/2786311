We propose a novel method for performing fine-grained recognition of human hand grasp types using a single monocular image to allow computational systems to better understand human hand use. In particular, we focus on recognizing challenging grasp categories which differ only by subtle variations in finger configurations. While much of the prior work on understanding human hand grasps has been based on manual detection of grasps in video, this is the first work to automate the analysis process for fine-grained grasp classification. Instead of attempting to utilize a parametric model of the hand, we propose a hand parsing framework which leverages a data-driven learning to generate a pixel-wise segmentation of a hand into finger and palm regions. The proposed approach makes use of appearance-based cues such as finger texture and hand shape to accurately determine hand parts. We then build on the hand parsing result to compute high-level grasp features to learn a supervised fine-grained grasp classifier. To validate our approach, we introduce a grasp dataset recorded with a wearable camera, where the hand and its parts have been manually segmented with pixel-wise accuracy. Our results show that our proposed automatic hand parsing technique can improve grasp classification accuracy by over 30 percentage points over a state-of-the-art grasp recognition technique.
