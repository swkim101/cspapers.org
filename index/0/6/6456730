In this paper, we propose an implementable characterization of genre suitable for automatic genre identification of web pages. This characterization is implemented as an inferential model based on a modified version of Bayes' theorem. Such a model can deal with genre hybridism and individualization, two important forces behind genre evolution. Results show that this approach is effective and is worth further research.
