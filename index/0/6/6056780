dLife is a free and open-source Java library that supports undergraduate education and research involving robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision. The design of dLife addresses many concerns raised by experience reports in the CS education literature including a shortened code/test/debug cycle, ready access to robot sensor information and close integration with a robotic simulation system. Full support is currently provided for the following robots: Finch, Hemisson (or Khepera Jr.), Sony Aibo, Khepera 2, Khepera 3, and Pioneer 3, with more in development. Easily extensible packages support classroom and research applications using neural networks, genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning and computer vision.
