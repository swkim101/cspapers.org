The complexity of the domains in which expert systems are expected to operate requires that they be capable of "reasoning" about their actions. It has been argued that expert systems must reason from evidential information i.e., uncertain, incomplete, and occasionally inaccurate information [LOW82a]. As a consequence, a model for reasoning about control must deal with several problems being able to organize "control-related" evidential information that is generically distinct and from disparate sources, to overcome minor errors in the evidential information needed to reach a decision, and to explain the actions taken by the system These are a few of some formidable control issues and problems that remain largely unsolved [BAR82] Thus, we report on an investigation into how these issues and problems can be addressed when the problem of reasoning about system control is viewed as an evidential process.
