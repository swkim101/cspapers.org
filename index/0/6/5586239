Computational models of analogical problem solving have traditionally described source and target domains in terms of their causal structure. But psychological research shows that visual reasoning plays a part for many kinds of analogies. This paper describes a model that transfers a solution from a source analog to a new target problem using only visual knowledge represented symbolically. The knowledge representation is based on a language of primitive visual elements and transformations. We found that visual knowledge is sufficient for transfer, but that causal knowledge is needed to determine if the transferred solution is appropriate.
