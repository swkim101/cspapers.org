Up-to-date information on urban air pollution, such as reliable pollution maps, is of great importance for health protection agencies to timely assess the air quality situation and provide advice to the general public. Ultrafine particles (UFPs) are widely spread in urban environments and believed to have severe impact on the human health. However, the lack of spatially resolved data hampers profound evaluation of these effects. In this work, we introduce one of the largest spatially resolved UFP data set available today, with over 25 million measurements to build high-resolution pollution maps for an urban area of 100 km2. The data is collected throughout more than one year using mobile sensor nodes, which are installed on top of public transport vehicles in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. We develop land-use regression models to create pollution maps with a high spatial resolution and study their temporal resolution limit.
