Finding models of logical formulas is a challenging problem. For first-order formulas, a finite model can be found by exhaustive search. For many structured problem instances, there is much isomorphism in the search space. This paper proposes general-purpose techniques for eliminating isomorphic subspaces, which can be helpful when the formulas have many predicates. The techniques are based on inherent symmetries in first-order clauses.
