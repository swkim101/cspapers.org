Selective query forwarding is a promising technique to help scale high-quality and cost-efficient query evaluation in distributed search systems. The basic idea is simple. After a local site receives a query, it determines non-local sites to forward the query to and returns an aggregation of local and non-local results. We introduce "RESQ", a hybrid rank-energy selective query forwarding model. The novel contribution of RESQ is to simultaneously consider both ranking quality and energy costs when making forwarding decisions. Using a large-scale query log and publicly-available energy price time series, we demonstrate the ability of RESQ forwarding to achieve favorable tradeoffs between the possibility of returning high ranking query results and savings in temporally- and spatially-varying energy prices.
