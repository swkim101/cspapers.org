Managing large-scale software projects involves a number of activities such as viewpoint extraction, feature detection, and requirements management, all of which require a human analyst to perform the arduous task of organizing requirements into meaningful topics and themes. Automating these tasks through the use of data mining techniques such as clustering could potentially increase both the efficiency of performing the tasks and the reliability of the results. Unfortunately, the unique characteristics of this domain, such as high dimensional, sparse, noisy data sets, resulting from short and ambiguous expressions of need, as well as the need for the interactive engagement of stakeholders at various stages of the process, present difficult challenges for standard clustering algorithms. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised clustering framework, based on a combination of consensus-based and constrained clustering techniques, which can effectively handle these challenges. Specifically, we provide a probabilistic analysis for informative constraint generation based on a co-association matrix, and utilize consensus clustering to combine multiple constrained partitions in order to generate high-quality, robust clusters. Our approach is validated through a series of experiments on six well-studied TREC data sets and on two sets of user requirements.
