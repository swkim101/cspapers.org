Creating summaries on lengthy Semantic Web documents for quick identification of the corresponding entity has been of great contemporary interest. In this paper, we explore automatic summarization techniques that characterize and enable identification of an entity and create summaries that are human friendly. Specifically, we highlight the importance of diversified (faceted) summaries by combining three dimensions: diversity, uniqueness, and popularity. Our novel diversity-aware entity summarization approach mimics human conceptual clustering techniques to group facts and picks representative facts from each group to form concise (i.e., short) and comprehensive (i.e., improved coverage through diversity) summaries. We evaluate our approach against the state-of-the-art techniques and show that our work improves both the quality and the efficiency of entity summarization.
