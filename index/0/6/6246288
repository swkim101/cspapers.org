In programming a computer to control a manipulator, the problem of avoiding obstacles present in the environment must be faced. This paper presents a simple world model containing the manipulator as well as obstacles, and describes an algorithm for guiding the manipulator to a specified destination point while avoiding collisions with obstacles. The algorithm combines a number of heuristics with a method for stepwise optimization based on a linear programming technique. A brief description of the computer program AVOID and a sample of computer simulated tasks solved by it are presented.
