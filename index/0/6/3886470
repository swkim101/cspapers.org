In this paper, we present the formulation of a dynamic model of a free-swimming multi-joint robotic fish with a pair of wing-like pectoral fins, in which the whole robot is regarded as a moving multilink rigid body in fluids. Considering that the thrust of fish mainly results from the force of trailing vortex, added lateral pressure, and leading-edge suction force, the dynamic equations of the swimming fish have been derived by summing up the longitudinal force, lateral force, and yaw moment on each propulsive component in the framework of Lagrangian mechanics. Furthermore, using the bio-inspired Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) as the swimming data generator, the overall dynamic propulsive characteristics of the swimming robot are estimated in a mathematical environment (i.e., Mathematica). As a case study, the created dynamic model offers a good guide to seeking pragmatic backward swimming patterns for a carangiform robotic fish, which exemplifies the validity of the CPG-coupled dynamic model.
