In many disciplines, the scientist uses the shape of an entity to infer processes that have acted upon the entity. We develop inference rules by which the curvature extrema of a shape can be used to infer the precise trajectories of processes that have created the shape. A formal grammar is also elaborated by which, given two views of the same entity at two developmental stages, the scientist can infer the processes that acted in between the two stages.
