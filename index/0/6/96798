The racetrack memory technology utilizes magnetic domains along a nanoscopic wire to obtain ultra-high data storage density. The recent success in the planar racetrack nanowire promised its fabrication feasibility and future scalability, bringing more design challenges and opportunities. In this paper, we initialize the optimization of racetrack memory embracing design considerations across multiple layers, including cell design, array structure, architecture organization, and data management. Our evaluation shows that racetrack memory based cache can achieve 6.4Ã— area reduction, 25% performance enhancement, and 62% energy saving, compared to STT-RAM cache design. The benefit over SRAM technology is even more significant.
