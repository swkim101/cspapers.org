This paper describes RacerX, a static tool that uses flow-sensitive, interprocedural analysis to detect both race conditions and deadlocks. It is explicitly designed to find errors in large, complex multithreaded systems. It aggressively infers checking information such as which locks protect which operations, which code contexts are multithreaded, and which shared accesses are dangerous. It tracks a set of code features which it uses to sort errors both from most to least severe. It uses novel techniques to counter the impact of analysis mistakes. The tool is fast, requiring between 2-14 minutes to analyze a 1.8 million line system. We have applied it to Linux, FreeBSD, and a large commercial code base, finding serious errors in all of them.
