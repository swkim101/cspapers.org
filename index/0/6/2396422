In this paper we prove several results concerning this complexity measure. First we establish (in a non-constructive manner) that there exist languages which cannot be recognized with less than <italic>n</italic> communication (obviously, communication <italic>n</italic> is always enough for recognizing any language). In fact, we show that for any function<italic>f(n)-&-lt; n,</italic> there are languages recognizable with communication<italic>f(n)</italic> but not with communication<italic>f (n)</italic>-&-minus;1. In other words, this complexity measure possesses a very dense hierarchy or complexity classes, as miniscule increments in communication add to the languages that can be recognized.
