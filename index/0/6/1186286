With the proliferation of digital educational resources comes the requirement to provide educators with tools for collaboration, customization, and reuse of these resources. We describe our repository software built upon the Drupal content management system that allows educators to form curriculum-based online communities to create, share, and adapt educational resources and curricula. Teachers can create curricula from scratch, add to existing curricula, or clone and customize curricula to fit their teaching environment. We also show how our system can help educators see the usage contexts of their materials. The software is demonstrated in the STEMRobotics middle and high school robotics curricula repository and the MSScience middle school standards-based curriculum collaboration site.
