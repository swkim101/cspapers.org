An autonomous ice cream serving robot is presented in this video. The video was filmed during the Automatica 2010 trade fair in Munich. Within four days, approximately 250 scoops of different kinds of ice cream have been served to visitors during the fair. Using the KUKA light-weighted robotic arms and the DLR/HIT robotic hands, two scientific aspects are shown in this video: stable grasping of fragile objects and manipulation of cream-like mass using a time-of-flight camera. Impedance control are intensively used both by grasping and manipulation. The video shows an autonomous service robot scenario beyond simple fetch-and-carry chores.
