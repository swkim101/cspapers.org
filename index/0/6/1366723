The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) is the most significant effort currently underway to enable web users to gain control over their private information. The designers of P3P simultaneously designed a preference language called APPEL to allow users to express their privacy preferences, thus enabling automatic matching of privacy preferences against P3P policies. Unfortunately subtle interactions between P3P and APPEL result in serious problems when using APPEL: Users can only directly specify what is unacceptable in a policy, not what is acceptable; simple preferences are hard to express; and writing APPEL preferences is error prone. We show that these problems follow from a fundamental design choice made by APPEL, and cannot be solved without completely redesigning the language. Therefore we explore alternatives to APPEL that can overcome these problems. In particular, we show that XPath serves quite nicely as a preference language and solves all the above problems. We identify the minimal subset of XPath that is needed, thus allowing matching programs to potentially use a smaller memory footprint. We also give an APPEL to XPath translator that shows that XPath is as expressive as APPEL.
