We present our findings on the state of the field of algorithm visualization, based on extensive search and analysis of links to hundreds of visualizations. We seek to answer questions such as how content is distributed among topics, who created algorithm visualizations and when, the overall quality of available visualizations, and how visualizations are disseminated. We have built a wiki that currently catalogs over 350 algorithm visualizations, contains the beginnings of an annotated bibliography on algorithm visualization literature, and provides information about researchers and projects. Unfortunately, we found that most existing algorithm visualizations are of low quality, and the content coverage is skewed heavily toward easier topics. There are no effective repositories or organized collections of algorithm visualizations currently available. Thus, the field appears in need of improvement in dissemination of materials, informing potential developers about what is needed, and propagating known best practices for creating new visualizations.
