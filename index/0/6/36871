Microblogging is a form of blogging where posts typically consist of short content such as quick comments, phrases, URLs, or media, like images and videos. Because of the fast and compact nature of microblogs, users have adopted them for novel purposes, including sharing personal updates, spreading breaking news, promoting political views, marketing and tracking real time events. Thus, finding relevant information sources out of the rapidly growing content is an essential task. In this paper, we study the problem of understanding and analysing microblogs. We present a novel 2-stage framework to find potentially relevant content by extracting topics from the tweets and by taking advantage of submodularity.
