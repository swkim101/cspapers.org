Two new theorem-proving procedures for equational Horn clauses are presented. The largest literal is selected for paramodulation in both strategies, except that one method treats positive literals as larger than negative ones and results in a unit strategy. Both use term orderings to restrict paramodulation to potentially maximal sides of equations and to increase the amount of allowable simplification (demodulation). Completeness is shown using proof orderings.
