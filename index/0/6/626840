In this paper, we introduce a connotation lexicon, a new type of lexicon that lists words with connotative polarity, i.e., words with positive connotation (e.g., award, promotion) and words with negative connotation (e.g., cancer, war). Connotation lexicons differ from much studied sentiment lexicons: the latter concerns words that express sentiment, while the former concerns words that evoke or associate with a specific polarity of sentiment. Understanding the connotation of words would seem to require common sense and world knowledge. However, we demonstrate that much of the connotative polarity of words can be inferred from natural language text in a nearly unsupervised manner. The key linguistic insight behind our approach is selectional preference of connotative predicates. We present graph-based algorithms using PageRank and HITS that collectively learn connotation lexicon together with connotative predicates. Our empirical study demonstrates that the resulting connotation lexicon is of great value for sentiment analysis complementing existing sentiment lexicons.
