Fish stocks around the world are in danger from illegal fishing. In collaboration with the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), we work to defend fisheries from illegal fisherman (henceforth called Lanchas) in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We have developed the COmPASS (Conservative Online Patrol ASSistant) system to design USCG patrols against the Lanchas. In this application, we face a population of Lanchas with heterogeneous behavior who fish frequently. We have some data about these Lanchas, but not enough to fit a statistical model. Previous security patrol assistants have focused on counterterrorism in one-shot games where adversaries are assumed to be perfectly rational, and much less data about their behavior is available. COmPASS is novel because: (i) it emphasizes environmental crime; (ii) it is based on a repeated Stackelberg game; (iii) it allows for bounded rationality of the Lanchas and it offers a robust approach against the heterogeneity of the Lancha population; and (iv) it can learn from sparse Lancha data. We report the effectiveness of COmPASS in the Gulf in our numerical experiments based on real fish data. The COmPASS system is to be tested by USCG.
