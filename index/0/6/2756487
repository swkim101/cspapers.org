DNA self-assembly has emerged as a rich and promising primitive for nano-technology. Experimental and analytical evidence indicates that such systems are prone to errors, and accordingly, several error-correction mechanisms have been proposed for the tile model of self-assembly. These error-correction mechanisms suffer either from high resolution loss or a large increase in the number of tile-types. In this paper, we propose dimension augmented proof-reading, a technique that uses the third dimension to do error-correction in two dimensional self-assembling systems. This involves no resolution loss in the two dimensions of interest, results in a smaller increase in the number of tile-types than previous techniques, and appears to have the same error-correction properties.
 Error-correcting systems need to be analyzed in the kinetic Tile Assembly Model; such analysis involves complicated Markov Chains and is cumbersome. In this paper, we also present a set of completely combinatorial criteria that can be used to prove properties of error-correcting self-assembling systems. We illustrate these criteria by applying them to two known proof-reading systems, one of which was not previously known to work. We then use these criteria to prove the correctness of dimension augmented proof-reading applied to a self-assembling system that computes the parity of a string.
