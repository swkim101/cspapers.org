Interactive computer graphics systems for visualization of realistic-looking, three-dimensional models are useful for evaluation, design and training in virtual environments, such as those found in architectural and mechanical CAD, ight simulation, and virtual reality. Interactive visualization systems display images of a threedimensional model on the screen of a computer workstation as seen from a simulated observer's viewpoint under control by a user. If images are rendered smoothly and quickly enough, an illusion of real-time exploration of a virtual environment can be achieved as the simulated observer moves through the model. Unfortunately, models of interesting virtual environments (e.g., buildings with furniture) comprise millions of polygons and contain more data (gigabytes) than can t into memory on most graphics workstations. In order to support real-time walkthroughs of such virtual environments, a visualization system must store only a subset of the model in memory at once (i.e., the working set) and swap di erent parts in and out of memory in real-time as the observer navigates through the environment interactively. In order to avoid delays to the perceptible frame rate due to page faults, an interactive walkthrough system must prefetch data asynchronously so that the data is resident in memory before it is displayed.
