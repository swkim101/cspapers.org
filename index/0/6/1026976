For many feature selection problems, a human de nes the features that are potentially useful, and then a subset is chosen from the original pool of features using an automated feature selection algorithm. In contrast to supervised learning, class information is not available to guide the feature search for unsupervised learning tasks. In this paper, we introduce Visual-FSSEM (Visual Feature Subset Selection using Expectation-Maximization Clustering), which incorporates visualization techniques, clustering, and user interaction to guide the feature subset search and to enable a deeper understanding of the data. Visual-FSSEM, serves both as an exploratory and multivariate-data visualization tool. We illustrate Visual-FSSEM on a high-resolution computed tomography lung image data set.
