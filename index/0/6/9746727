This paper demonstrates how a model for temporal context reasoning can be implemented. The approach is to detect temporally related events in natural language text and convert the events into an enriched logical representation. Reasoning is provided by a first order logic theorem prover adapted to text. Results show that temporal context reasoning boosts the performance of a Question Answering system.
