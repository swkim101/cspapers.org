Hypertext is a valuable means of representing and organizing information, for both instructors and students. Hypertext can be used to create a set of presentation materials that can be easily shared with both students and colleagues. More importantly, those materials can also be used to help students build on explicit representation of their knowledge that helps them to understand complex concepts and their relationships. In this paper, we discuss our experience in the active use of hypertext in the development and teaching of a breadth-first introductory course.
