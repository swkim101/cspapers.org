We normally expect features in a programming language to support the concepts and methodologies in the course. This article describes another role for features within a programming language, support of sound educational methodology. Specifically, this paper describes how the library module capability in Modula-2 may be used to formally separate the concept from the implementation of abstract data types. That is, by having generic support for various structures, the structures can be taught at a conceptual level and students are given assignments to use these structures long before the implementations of the structures are taught. The result is a clear separation of concept and implementation and a better understanding of the structures as ADTs.
