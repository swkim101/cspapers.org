Several hybrid disambiguation methods are described which combine the strength of hand-written disambiguation rules and statistical taggers. Three different statistical (HMM, Maximum-Entropy and Averaged Perceptron) taggers are used in a tagging experiment using Prague Dependency Tree-bank. The results of the hybrid systems are better than any other method tried for Czech tagging so far.
