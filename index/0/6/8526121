We present a general treatment of the comparative that is based on more basic linguistic elements so that the underlying system can be effectively utilized: in the syntactic analysis phase, the comparative is treated the same as similar structures; in the syntactic regularization phase, the comparative is transformed into a standard form so that subsequent processing is basically unaffected by it. The scope of quantifiers under the comparative is also integrated into the system in a general way.
