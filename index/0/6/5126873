The achromatic number problem is to legally color the vertices of an input graph with the maximum number of colors, denoted &psgr;*, so that every two color classes share at least one edge. This problem is known to be NP-hard.
For general graphs we give an algorithm that approximates the achromatic number within ratio of <i>&Ogr;</i>(<i>n</i> ·log log <i>n</i>/ log <i>n</i>). This improves over the previously known approximation ratio of <i>&Ogr;</i>(<i>n</i>/√log <i>n</i>), due to Chaudhary and Vishwanathan [4].
For graphs of girth at least 5 we give an algorithm with approximation ratio <i>&Ogr;</i>(min{<i>n</i><sup>1/3</sup>, √&psgr;*}). This improves over an approximation ratio <i>&Ogr;</i>(√&psgr;*) = <i>&Ogr;</i>(<i>n</i><sup>3/8</sup>) for the more restricted case of graphs with girth at least 6, due to Krista and Lorys [13].
We also give the first hardness result for approximating the achromatic number. We show that for every fixed ∈ > 0 there in no 2 - ∈ approximation algorithm, unless <i>P</i> = <i>NP</i>.
