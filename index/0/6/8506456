A new representation for inter-procedural analysis is presented. The representation only uses regular graph theory with guarded edges and variables for easy integration with model checkers but is limited to binary lattice inter-procedural analysis only. A simple inter-procedural problem is presented here with a description of the control flow graph associated. Construction of the graph automaton for model checking is described using graph rewriting rules applied on the control flow graph. Further research and possible extensions are reported.
