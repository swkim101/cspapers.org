This work extends the metaphor of a see-through interface embodied in Magic LensesTM to 3D environments. We present two new see-through visualization techniques: jlat lenses in 3D and volumetric lenses. We discuss implementation concerns for platforms that have programmer accessible hardware clipping planes and show several examples of each visualization technique. We also examine composition of multiple lenses in 3D environments, which strengthens the flat lens metaphor, but may have no meaningful semantics in the case of volumetric lenses.
