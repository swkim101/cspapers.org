A computer model of the hippocampal pyramidal cell (HPC) is described which integrates data from a variety of sources in order to develop a consistent description for this cell type. The model presently includes descriptions of eleven non-linear somatic currents of the HPC, and the electrotonic structure of the neuron is modelled with a soma/short-cable approximation. Model simulations qualitatively or quantitatively reproduce a wide range of somatic electrical behavior in HPCs, and demonstrate possible roles for the various currents in information processing.
