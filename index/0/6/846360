A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multi-modal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real-time. We propose a new computational model that is based on principles of high dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory. It can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry.
