XML is the predominant format for representing structured information inside documents, but it stops at the level of files. This makes it hard to use XML-oriented tools to process information which is scattered over multiple documents within a file system. File System XML (FSX) and its content integration provides a unified view of file system structure and content. FSX's adaptors map file contents to XML, which means that any file format can be integrated with an XML view in the integrated view of the file system.
