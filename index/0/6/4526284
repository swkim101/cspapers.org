Low rank representation (LRR) has shown promising performance for various computer vision applications such as face clustering. Existing algorithms for solving LRR usually depend on its two-variable formulation which contains the original data matrix. In this paper, we develop a fast LRR solver called FaLRR, by reformulating LRR as a new optimization problem with regard to factorized data (which is obtained by skinny SVD of the original data matrix). The new formulation benefits the corresponding optimization and theoretical analysis. Specifically, to solve the resultant optimization problem, we propose a new algorithm which is not only efficient but also theoretically guaranteed to obtain a globally optimal solution. Regarding the theoretical analysis, the new formulation is helpful for deriving some interesting properties of LRR. Last but not least, the proposed algorithm can be readily incorporated into an existing distributed framework of LRR for further acceleration. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our FaLRR achieves order-of-magnitude speedup over existing LRR solvers, and the efficiency can be further improved by incorporating our algorithm into the distributed framework of LRR.
