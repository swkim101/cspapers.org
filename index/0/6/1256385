To overcome the problem of not having enough manually labeled relation instances for supervised relation extraction methods, in this paper we propose a label propagation (LP) based semi-supervised learning algorithm for relation extraction task to learn from both labeled and unlabeled data. Evaluation on the ACE corpus showed when only a few labeled examples are available, our LP based relation extraction can achieve better performance than SVM and another bootstrapping method.
