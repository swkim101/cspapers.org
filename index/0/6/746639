This paper introduces xfst2fsa, a compiler which translates grammars expressed in the syntax of the XFST finite-state tool-box to grammars in the language of the FSA Utilities package. Compilation to FSA facilitates the use of grammars developed with the proprietary XFST tool-box on a publicly available platform. The paper describes the non-trivial issues of the compilation process, highlighting several shortcomings of some published algorithms, especially where replace rules are concerned. The compiler augments FSA with most of the operators supported by XFST. Furthermore, it provides a means for comparing the two systems on comparable grammars. The paper presents the results of such a comparison.
