Involving undergraduates in Computer Science research has many benefits. It's an exciting way for students to gain independent problem solving skills. It exposes them to interesting projects and the research process, thereby keeping them in computer science, even encouraging them to go to graduate school. And especially in primarily teaching institutions, it's a rewarding way for faculty to remain engaged in their own research. In this workshop we will (1) present best practices for mentoring undergraduate research, (2) equip participants with resources for mentoring their own students, and (3) further develop (1) and (2) through breakout sessions on concerns of interest to attendees.
