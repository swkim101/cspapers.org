Recent work in planning has focussed on the reuse of previous plans. In order to re-use a plan in a novel situation the plan has to be transformed into an applicable plan. We describe an approach to plan transformation which utilises reasoning experience as well as planning experience. Some of the additional information is generated by a series of self generated questions and answers, as well as appropriate experiments. Furthermore, we show how transformation strategies can be learned.
