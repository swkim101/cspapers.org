Most LCD screens exhibit color distortions when viewed at oblique angles. Engineers have invested significant time and resources to alleviate this effect. However, the massive manufacturing base, as well as millions of in-the-wild monitors, means this effect will be common for many years to come. We take an opposite stance, embracing these optical peculiarities, and consider how they can be used in productive ways. This paper discusses how a special palette of colors can yield visual elements that are invisible when viewed straight-on, but visible at oblique angles. In essence, this allows conventional, unmodified LCD screens to output two images simultaneously - a feature normally only available in far more complex setups. We enumerate several applications that could take advantage of this ability.
