This paper presents the design and implementation of a social networking website for classifieds, called Serefind. We designed search interfaces with focus on security, privacy, usability, design, ranking, and communications. We deployed this site at the Johns Hopkins University, and the results show it can be used as a self-sustaining classifieds site for public or private communities.
