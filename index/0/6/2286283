To deal with the problem of too many results returned from an E-commerce Web database in response to a user query, this paper proposes a novel approach to rank the query results. Based on the user query, we speculate how much the user cares about each attribute and assign a corresponding weight to it. Then, for each tuple in the query result, each attribute value is assigned a score according to its "desirableness" to the user. These attribute value scores are combined according to the attribute weights to get a final ranking score for each tuple. Tuples with the top ranking scores are presented to the user first. Our ranking method is domain independent and requires no user feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that this ranking method can effectively capture a user's preferences.
