This is an overview of the recent progress leading towards a full subject-centered paradigm in human-computer interaction. At this new phase in the evolution of computer technologies it will be possible to take into account not just characteristics of average human beings, but create systems sensitive to the actual states of attention and intentions of interacting persons. We discuss some of these methods concentrating on the eye-tracking and brain imaging. The development is based on the use of eye movement data for a control of output devices, for gaze-contingent image processing and for disambiguating verbal as well as nonverbal information.
