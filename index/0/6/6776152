The existing secret key generation schemes for body-worn devices using wireless channel characteristics, e.g., received signal strength indicator (RSSI) are dependent on the node mobility and have very low bit rate. In this work, we propose a novel mobility independent RSSI based secret key generation protocol - iARC, which induces artificial randomness in the channel by employing dual antennas and dynamic frequency hopping effectively.
