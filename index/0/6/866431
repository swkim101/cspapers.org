In this paper, we consider the staggering problem in the management of a Single Resource Multi-item Inventory System (SRMIS) studied in Anily (1991), Gallego, Shaw and Simchi-Levi (1992), Gallego, Queyranne and Simchi-Levi ( 1996), and Hariga and Jackson (1996). Each of the items in the inventory system has a constant demand (or depletion) rate, uses a certain amount of a limited resource, e.g., storage space, and is being replenished (instantaneously) according to a policy with Stationary Order Size and Interval. Such policies are called SOSI policies in Gallego et al. (1996). For SOS1 policies, the reorder points for each item are precisely when the inventory level is zero. Note that since demand and order quantity for each item are constant, orders of the same item arrive at equal time intervals. For convenience and concreteness, we shall refer to the resource as storage space. The SRMIS problem seeks to determine the optimal order quantity (or equivalently, order interval) for each item, so as to minimize average inventory and storage related cost given by
