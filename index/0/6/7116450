The CMAC storage scheme has been used as a basis for a software implementation of an associative memory system AMS, which itself is a major part of the learning control loop LERNAS. A major disadvantage of this CMAC-concept is that the degree of local generalization (area of interpolation) is fixed. This paper deals with an algorithm for self-organizing variable generalization for the AKS, based on ideas of T. Kohonen.
