Determining bounds for the random k-SAT threshold has been an active area of research in recent years [1, 3]. Yet, in spite of significant efforts, neither a tight analysis nor the structural properties of this threshold have been determined. In this paper we study random instances of two other canonical variations of satisfiability, 1-in-k SAT and Not-All-Equal 3-SAT. Like random k-SAT, each generative model has one parameter c = m / n , the ratio of clauses to variables. Also similarly to random k-SAT, we focus on "threshold phenomena" occurring in these models and how they might relate to computational hardness. For 1-in-k SAT, k ~ 3, we obtain the exact location of the threshold:
