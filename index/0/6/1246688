This paper describes Artkit - the Arizona Retargetable Toolkit - an extensible object-oriented user interface toolkit. Artkit provides an extensible input model which is designed to support a wider range of interaction techniques than conventional user interface toolkits. In particular the system supports the implementation of interaction objects using dragging, snapping (or gravity fields), and gesture (or handwriting) inputs. Because these techniques are supported directly by the toolkit it is also possible to create interactions that mix these techniques within a single interface or even a single interactor object.
