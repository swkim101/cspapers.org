We show that if a connected graph with n nodes has conductance &phis; then rumour spreading, also known as randomized broadcast, successfully broadcasts a message within O(log4 n/&phis;6) many steps, with high probability, using the PUSH-PULL strategy. An interesting feature of our approach is that it draws a connection between rumour spreading and the spectral sparsification procedure of Spielman and Teng [23].
