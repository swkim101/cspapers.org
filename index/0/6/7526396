The paper presents an algorithm, written in PROLOG, for processing English sentences which contain either Gapping, Right Node Raising (RNR) or Reduced Conjunction (RC). The DCG (Definite Clause Grammar) formalism (Pereira & Warren 80) is adopted. The algorithm is highly efficient and capable of processing a full range of coordinate constructions containing any number of coordinate conjunctions ('and', 'or', and 'but'). The algorithm is part of an English-Chinese machine translation system which is in the course of construction.
