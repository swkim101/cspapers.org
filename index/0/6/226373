This paper discusses the use of writing as a teaching approach for an upper level computer science course. In describing my experiences, I hope to encourage those schools/teachers who are considering incorporating writing into such a course. Many different kinds of writing are compared and contrasted. Attention is paid to practicalities of the writing process and of the demands made of faculty in these writing-based courses.
