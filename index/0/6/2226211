In this paper, on-chip particle loading and dispensing modules are presented with their results for the automation of a single particle retrieving from a microfluidic channel. Our proposed microfluidic chip has several modules. Each one of them has important functions as (a) loading micro-particles singly to main microfluidic flow by the aid of magnetically driven microtools (MMT); (b) finding particle position in a microfluidic channel by micro-capacitance sensors; (c) adjusting micro-channel height locally by pneumatic pressure valve; (d) dispensing particles out from the microfluidic chip to incubation environment. Novelty of this paper is summarized as follows: (1) Multi-photoresist combination technique for the pneumatic pressure valve; (2) Automatic on-chip particle dispensing with micro-capacitance sensors. We showed feasibility of automatic dispensing of a single polystyrene bead (about 100 µm) from the chip to atmosphere. The performances of each module (hybrid structure, sensor and dispensing parts) were evaluated individually. We succeeded in determination of the movement of micro-particles (about 50–100 µm) with the velocity of over 6 mm/sec. by the micro-capacitance sensors. The advantages of the proposed system are that composed of the reusable drive system such as xy motorized stage, pumps and a disposable microfluidic chip.
