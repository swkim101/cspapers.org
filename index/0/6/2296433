This paper investigates the use and extension
of text retrieval and clustering techniques for event
detection. The task is to automatically detect novel
events from a temporally-ordered stream of news stories,
either retrospectively or as the stories arrive. We applied
hierarchical and non-hierarchical document clustering algorithms
to a corpus of 15,836 stories, focusing on the
exploitation of both content and temporal information.
We found the resulting cluster hierarchies highly informative
for retrospective detection of previously unidentified
events, effectively supporting both query-free and
query-driven retrieval. We also found that temporal distribution
patterns of document clusters provide useful
information for improvement in both retrospective detection
and on-line detection of novel events. In an
evaluation using manually labelled events to judge the
system-detected events, we obtained a result of 82% in
the Fl measure for retrospective detection, and a Fl
value of 42% for on-line detection.
