An undergraduate course in data communications and networks has been offered at the University of Regina. We have developed a series of laboratory exercises to accompany this course [1, 2]. These labs originally focused on the Stallings text [3]. They have been expanded and redesigned to complement Tanenbaum's text [4] and to take advantage of the facilities at the University of Regina.
