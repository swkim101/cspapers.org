We present a detailed statistical analysis of a 2-hour long empirical sample of VBR video. The sample was obtained by applying a simple intraframe video compression code to an action movie. The main findings of our analysis are (1) the tail behavior of the marginal bandwidth distribution can be accurately described using “heavy-tailed” distributions (e.g., Pareto); (2) the autocorrelation of the VBR video sequence decays hyperbolically (equivalent to long-range dependence) and can be modeled using self-similar processes. We combine our findings in a new (non-Markovian) source model for VBR video and present an algorithm for generating synthetic traffic. Trace-driven simulations show that statistical multiplexing results in significant bandwidth efficiency even when long-range dependence is present. Simulations of our source model show long-range dependence and heavy-tailed marginals to be important components which are not accounted for in currently used VBR video traffic models.
