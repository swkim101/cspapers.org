ERNEST FERGUSON Shock waves still resonate after the widely cited 2002 Forrester Research report predicted at least 3.3 million white-collar jobs and $136 billion in wages are expected to shift overseas by 2015 [8]. The report predicts nearly 1 million IT-related jobs will move offshore over the course of the next 15 years [4].

IT unemployment has resulted in decreased computer science / information systems enrollments throughout the United States.
