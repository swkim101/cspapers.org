New techniques are constantly being developed in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Too often such techniques are overlooked as being “too far out” to be practical. Frequently they offer a solution to a problem that might be difficult to solve by more traditional methods.
 Some of the techniques used in the field of artificial intelligence can be successfully applied to the field of Design Automation. Those interested in developing techniques for automating design should be aware of this potential and be on the lookout for such applications.
