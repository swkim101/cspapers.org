We present JAWAA 2.0, a scripting language for creating animations easily over the web. JAWAA includes primitives, easy creation of data structures and operations on these structures, and an editor for easy creation of complex objects. We show how to use JAWAA in a range of computer science courses including CS 0, CS 1, CS 2 and advanced courses. Instructors can quickly build animations for demos in lecture, and students can enhance their programming projects with an animation.
