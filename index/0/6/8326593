We consider the bias and variance of value function estimation that are caused by using an empirical model instead of the true model. We analyze these bias and variance for Markov processes from a classical (frequentist) statistical point of view, and in a Bayesian setting. Using a second order approximation, we provide explicit expressions for the bias and variance in terms of the transition counts and the reward statistics. We present supporting experiments with artificial Markov chains and with a large transactional database provided by a mail-order catalog firm.
