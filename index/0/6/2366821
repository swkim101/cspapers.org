CLIC is a computer program that accepts conventional circuit schematic terms and produces the layout and set of masks required for the film processes of hybrid microcircuits. The circuit designer makes a schematic layout by placing the circuit elements and interconnecting lines on a modular grid. The input to the computer is the coordinate location of each module containing a circuit part and the part description - chip pad, resistor, conductor begin, conductor end, etc. The program takes this location and part name (which includes resistance value in ohms for resistors), designs the circuit part and then generates a set of masks to produce it. CLIC functions as a preprocessor for other Bell Laboratories programs which generate masks on a number of graphic devices.
