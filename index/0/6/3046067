The online travel services and resources are far from well organized and integrated. Trip planning is still a laborious job requiring interaction with a combination of services such as travel guides, personal travel blogs, map services and public transportation to piece together an itinerary. To facilitate this process, we have designed a cross-service travel engine for trip planners. Our system seamlessly and semantically integrates various types of travel services and resources based on a geographical ontology. We also built a user-friendly visualization tool for travellers to conveniently browse and design personal itineraries on Google Maps.
