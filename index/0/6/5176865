We propose a model for transfer in machine translation which uses a rewriting system for typed feature structures. The grammar definitions describe transfer relations which are applied on the input structure (a typed feature structure) by the interpreter to produce all possible transfer pairs. The formalism is based on the semantics of typed feature structures as described in [Ait-Kaci 84].
