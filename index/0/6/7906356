Today digitally-driven or additive manufacturing methodologies have become increasingly significant. The current market has grown to over $1 billion, and is projected to reach $2.3 billion in annual sales worldwide by 2012.The future promises competitive usage of these methodologies for prototyping, tooling, and end-use purposes. To address these changing needs, a researcher at Utah State University has developed a method of surface roughness reduction for improving bonding in ultrasonic consolidation (UC) rapid manufacturing. Advantages of reducing surface roughness include an increase in percentage and quality of the material contact between each layers, as well as improved bonding between the first and subsequent material layers, resulting in higher strength, and better performing endproducts. 570 Research Park Way, Suite 101 North Logan, Utah 84341 www.tco.usu.edu
