An interactive graphical linkage design system is here described in text and captioned photos. This design system, KINSYN, is highly dependent on graphics for its man-computer interaction. Dialogue with the computer has been carefully devised to take best advantage of both human decision making and machine computational abilities. No computer expertise is required to use the system. KINSYN has capabilities for closed-form synthesis of four-link mechanisms and for numerical synthesis of linkages of most other topologies. It can analyze and animate pin and slider-jointed planar devices of nearly any topology.
