How good are automatic content metrics for news summary evaluation? Here we provide a detailed answer to this question, with a particular focus on assessing the ability of automatic evaluations to identify statistically significant differences present in manual evaluation of content. Using four years of data from the Text Analysis Conference, we analyze the performance of eight ROUGE variants in terms of accuracy, precision and recall in finding significantly different systems. Our experiments show that some of the neglected variants of ROUGE, based on higher order n-grams and syntactic dependencies, are most accurate across the years; the commonly used ROUGE-1 scores find too many significant differences between systems which manual evaluation would deem comparable. We also test combinations of ROUGE variants and find that they considerably improve the accuracy of automatic prediction.
