Emotion lexicons play a crucial role in sentiment analysis and opinion mining. In this paper, we propose a novel Emotion-aware LDA (EaLDA) model to build a domainspecific lexicon for predefined emotions that include anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The model uses a minimal set of domain-independent seed words as prior knowledge to discover a domainspecific lexicon, learning a fine-grained emotion lexicon much richer and adaptive to a specific domain. By comprehensive experiments, we show that our model can generate a high-quality fine-grained domain-specific emotion lexicon.
