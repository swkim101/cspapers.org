We report our experiences using the Scrum agile software development method in an undergraduate user-centered web development project. Our chief contributions are to report on using Scrum in a summer research setting as distinct from academic-year coursework and to consider the integration of Scrum and user experience (UX) development methods in a learning environment. Our experience with combining Scrum and UX was positive: this methodology gave our project a clear structure, kept us motivated, and focused us on developing a usable final product. We discuss our adaptations of Scrum to UX development and to the summer research setting, along with challenges we faced and lessons learned, to inform students and faculty who wish to apply such methods in future projects.
