In this paper we propose several strategies for selecting such a step size according to the properties of each algorithm and a method for searching a valid initial point. By investigating the structure of the affine-scaling vector fields associated with the optimization problem, we give a detailed convergence analysis of these algorithms. Simulation and experimental results show the different performance of these algorithms from computation time and convergence rates.
