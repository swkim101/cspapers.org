The problem of generating tests for sequential logic networks has become severe with large-scale integration (LSI). Since the internal gates cannot be tested by direct measurements, it is imperative that a rigorous logic test be developed to ensure quality at the chip level. The sequential complexity of many LSI chips exceeds the practical limitations of the familiar technique of modeling sequential logic for the application of combinational logic test-generation algorithms. Although other approaches, such as pseudo-random pattern generation, have been tried with some success, the pattern count may be quite large. This paper describes a method of test pattern generation that was developed with three objectives: to generate long pattern sequences systematically when needed, to model the sequential logic accurately so that any test generated would be valid, and to focus on assumed faults such as stuck 1 and stuck 0. Also discussed are the strengths and limitations of this method and some comparative results.
