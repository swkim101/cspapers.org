Electromagnetically actuated microparticles can be widely applied in the field of biomedicine, for its advantages of minimally invasive feature and approachability to complex microenvironments. In this paper, we propose a robust feedback control approach for precise 3D manipulation of a microparticle actuated by a self-constructed electromagnetic coil system. Model uncertainties, environmental disturbances as well as actuator energy loss problem are all taken into account in the controller design. It is shown that this proposed control scheme can enable the entire system to maintain the input-to-state stability in presence of various perturbations. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed control approach. Success of the current study will benefit the precise motion control with high throughput in applications of the targeted material delivery.
