We present an algorithm for the 3-center problem in (ℝ<sup>d</sup>, L<sub>∞</sub>), i.e., for finding the smallest side length for 3 cubes that cover a given <i>n</i>-point set in ℝ<sup>d</sup>, that runs in <i>O(n log n)</i> time for any fixed dimension <i>d</i>. This shows that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized with <i>d</i>. On the other hand, using tools from parameterized complexity theory, we show that this is unlikely to be the case with the <i>k</i>-center problem in (ℝ<sup>d</sup>, L<sub>2</sub>), for any k ≥ 2. In particular, we prove that deciding whether a given <i>n</i>-point set in ℝ<sup>d</sup> can be covered by the union of 2 balls of given radius is W[1]-hard with respect to <i>d</i>, and thus not fixed-parameter tractable unless FPT=W[1]. Our reduction also shows that even an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup><i>o(d)</i></sup>)-time alorithm for the latter does not exist, unless SNP ⊆ DTIME(2<sup>o(n))</sup>.
