Classic cake cutting protocols are susceptible to manipulation. Do their strategic outcomes still guarantee fairness? To address this question we adopt a novel algorithmic approach, proposing a concrete computational model and reasoning about the game-theoretic properties of algorithms that operate in this model. Specifically, we show that each protocol in the class of generalized cut and choose (GCC) protocols --- which includes the most important discrete cake cutting protocols --- is guaranteed to have approximate subgame perfect Nash equilibria, or even exact equilibria if the protocol's tie-breaking rule is flexible. We further observe that the (approximate) equilibria of proportional protocols --- which guarantee each of the n agents a 1/n-fraction of the cake --- must be (approximately) proportional, thereby answering the above question in the positive (at least for one common notion of fairness).
