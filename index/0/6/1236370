We develop an aspect-based sentiment analysis system named ReviewMiner. It analyzes opinions expressed about an entity in an online review at the level of topical aspects to discover each individual reviewer's latent opinion on each aspect as well as his/her relative emphasis on different aspects when forming the overall judgment of the entity. The system personalizes the retrieved results according to users' input preferences over the identified aspects, recommends similar items based on the detailed aspect-level opinions, and summarizes aspect-level opinions in textual, temporal and spatial dimensions. The unique multi-modal opinion summarization and visualization mechanisms provide users with rich perspectives to digest information from user-generated opinionated content for making informed decisions.
