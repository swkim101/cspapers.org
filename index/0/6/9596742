This paper talks about the deciding practical sense boundary of homonymous words. The important problem in dictionaries or thesauri is the confusion of the sense boundary by each resource. This also becomes a bottleneck in the practical language processing systems. This paper proposes the method about discovering sense boundary using the collocation from the large corpora and the clustering methods. In the experiments, the proposed methods show the similar results with the sense boundary from a corpus-based dictionary and sense-tagged corpus.
