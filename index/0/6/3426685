This paper presents a set of algorithms for efficiently evaluating join queries over static data tables in sensor networks. We describe and evaluate three algorithms that take advantage of distributed join techniques. Our algorithms are capable of running in limited amounts of RAM, can distribute the storage burden over groups of nodes, and are tolerant to dropped packets and node failures. REED is thus suitable for a wide range of event-detection applications that traditional sensor network database and data collection systems cannot be used to implement.
