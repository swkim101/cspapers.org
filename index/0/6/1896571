Morphological tokenization has been used in machine translation for morphologically complex languages to reduce lexical sparsity. Unfortunately, when translating into a morphologically complex language, recombining segmented tokens to generate original word forms is not a trivial task, due to morphological, phonological and orthographic adjustments that occur during tokenization. We review a number of detokenization schemes for Arabic, such as rule-based and table-based approaches and show their limitations. We then propose a novel detokenization scheme that uses a character-level discriminative string transducer to predict the original form of a segmented word. In a comparison to a stateof-the-art approach, we demonstrate slightly better detokenization error rates, without the need for any hand-crafted rules. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in an English-to-Arabic translation task.
