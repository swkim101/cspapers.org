In this paper, we present a study on personalized emphasis framing which can be used to tailor the content of a message to enhance its appeal to different individuals. With this framework, we directly model content selection decisions based on a set of psychologically-motivated domain-independent personal traits including personality (e.g., extraversion and conscientiousness) and basic human values (e.g., self-transcendence and hedonism). We also demonstrate how the analysis results can be used in automated personalized content selection for persuasive message generation.
