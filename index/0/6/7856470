This paper offers a proposal for an algorithm of controlling a mobile robot that searches for and rearranges objects with unknown locations and shape. In this paper, we divide the task into two parts: exploration task and rearrangement task. The algorithms for each part of the task are presented with respect to the effectiveness of the path length and computational cost. Additionally integration algorithm that effectively combines exploration and rearrangement is presented. Experiments with a real robot are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
