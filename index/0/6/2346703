However, labeling samples is expensive and time consuming due to the significant human effort involved. In this paper, we present a novel semi- supervised dictionary learning method which utilizes the structural sparse relationships between the labeled and unlabeled samples. Specifically, by connecting the sparse reconstruction coefficients on both the original samples and dictionary, the unlabeled samples can be automatically grouped to the different labeled samples, and the grouped samples share a small number of atoms in the dictionary via mixed l2p- norm regularization. This makes the learned dictionary more representative and discriminative since the shared atoms are learned by using the labeled and unlabeled samples potentially from the same class. Minimizing the derived objective function is a challenging task because it is non-convex and highly non-smooth. We propose an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the problem based on the block coordinate descent method. Moreover, we have a rigorous proof of the convergence of the algorithm. Extensive experiments are presented to show the superior performance of our method in classification applications.
