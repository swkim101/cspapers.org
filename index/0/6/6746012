Hybrid peer-to-peer architectures use special nodes to provide directory services for regions of the network ("regional directory services"). Hybrid peer-to-peer architectures are a potentially powerful model for developing large-scale networks of complex digital libraries, but peer-to-peer networks have so far tended to use very simple methods of resource selection and document retrieval. In this paper, we study the application of content-based resource selection and document retrieval to hybrid peer-to-peer networks. The directory nodes that provide regional directory services construct and use the content models of neighboring nodes to determine how to route query messages through the network. The leaf nodes that provide information use content-based retrieval to decide which documents to retrieve for queries. The experimental results demonstrate that using content-based retrieval in hybrid peer-to-peer networks is both more accurate and more efficient for some digital library environments than more common alternatives such as Gnutella 0.6.
