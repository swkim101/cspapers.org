The main point of this paper is that stochastic neural networks have a mathematical structure that corresponds quite closely with that of quantum field theory. Neural network Liouvillians and Lagrangians can be derived, just as can spin Hamiltonians and Lagrangians in QFT. It remains to show the efficacy of such a description.
