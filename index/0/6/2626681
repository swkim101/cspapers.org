This paper describes MEXEC, an implemented micro executive that compiles a device model that can have feedback into a structure for subsequent evaluation. This system computes both the most likely current device mode from n sets of sensor measurements and the n-1 step reconfiguration plan that is most likely to result in reaching a target mode - if such a plan exists. A user tunes the system by increasing n to improve system capability at the cost of real-time performance.
