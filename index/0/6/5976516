We give the rst onstru tion of a pseudo-random generator with optimal seed length that uses (essentially) arbitrary hardness. It builds on the novel re ursive use of the NWgenerator in [8℄, whi h produ ed many optimal generators one of whi h was pseudo-random. This is a hieved in two stages rst signi antly redu ing the number of andidate generators, and then eAE iently ombining them into one. We also give the rst onstru tion of an extra tor with optimal seed length, that an handle sub-polynomial entropy levels. It builds on the fundamental onne tion between extra tors and pseudo-random generators dis overed by Trevisan [21℄, ombined with onstru tion above. Moreover, using Kolmogorov Complexity rather than ir uit size in the analysis gives super-polynomial savings for our onstru tion, and renders our extra tors better than known for all entropy levels.
