To enable common mobile terminals to interact with contents shown on large screens, we propose "C-Blink", a new light signal marker method that uses the color liquid-crystal display of a mobile terminal as a visible light source. We overcome the performance limitations of such displays by developing a hue-difference-blink technique. In combination with a screen-side sensor, we describe a system that detects and receives light signal markers sent by cell phone displays. Evaluations of a prototype system confirm that C-Blink performs well under common indoor lighting. The C-Blink program can be installed in any mobile terminal that has a color display, and the installation costs are small. C-Blink is a very useful way of enabling ubiquitous large screens to become interfaces for mobile terminals.
