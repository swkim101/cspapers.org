This paper describes development of an Display Measurement and Analysis System (DMAS). An object data model for DMAS has been specified, and a prototype database subsystem has been implemented using the ObjectStore ODBMS, accessed from a Windows graphical user interface. The DMAS database was designed to be fully object-oriented to support complex data modelling capabilities and easy extension. Research endeavors include exploring ODBMS in this unconventional engineering application domain and development of an object data model and a testbed for display measurement systems.
