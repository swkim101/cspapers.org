We analyze several heuristics for finding a maximum planar subgraph of a nonplanar graph. The problem is NPhard, although heuristics which perform well in practice have been reported. In particular, we compare the two principle methods, based on path addition and vertex addition, respectively, with an incremental method, a “cycle packing” approach, and a branch-and-cut algorithm. For the incremental method, the path addition method, and an edge addition method, we prove theoretical worst-case performance bounds of l/3. We also present an empirical analysis of some of the heuristics. Our results indicate that the branch-andcut method yields the best solutions.
