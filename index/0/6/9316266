Early prediction of an upcoming timing violation presents a tremendous opportunity to mask the performance overhead of tolerating these faults. In this paper, we explore several techniques for optimizing instruction scheduling in an Out-of-Order pipeline, exploiting this new perspective in robust system design. Compared to recently proposed stall based techniques for tolerating predictable timing violations, we demonstrate a massive reduction in performance overhead, while supporting correct execution in faulty environments (64-97% across different benchmarks).
