In this paper we present a sublinear time (1 + ε)-approximation randomized algorithm to estimate the <i>weight</i> of the minimum spanning tree of an <i>n</i>-point metric space. The running time of the algorithm is <i>Û</i>(<i>n</i>/ε<sup>O(1)</sup>). Since the full description of an <i>n</i>-point metric space is of size Θ(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>), the complexity of our algorithm is <i>sublinear</i> with respect to the input size. Our algorithm is almost optimal as it is not possible to approximate in <i>o</i>(<i>n</i>) time the weight of the minimum spanning tree to within any factor. Furthermore, it has been previously shown that no <i>o</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) algorithm exists that <i>returns a spanning tree</i> whose weight is within a constant times the optimum.
