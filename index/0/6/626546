Computer communication is now used in many endeavors in which security and privacy are important, both in government and in the private sector. To support the need for secure computer communication, Digital Technology Incorporated (DTI) has developed the Secure HUB** Executive (HUB), e verified secure operating system oriented toward supporting communications and other real-time applications. The Secure HUB Executive currently runs on Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 and VAX-11 hardware, but it is portable to a wide range of mini- and microcomputers.
