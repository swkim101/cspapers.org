A path-method is used as a mechanism in objectoriented databases (O ODBS) to retrieue or to update information relevant to one class that is stored with some other class. A path–method is a method which traverses from one class through a chain of connections between classes to access information at another class. It is a dificult task for a user to write path-methods, because it may require comprehensive knowledge of many classes of the conceptual schema, while a typical user has often incomplete or even inconsistent knowledge of the schema. In this paper we discuss the Path–Method Generator (PMG) system based on precomputed access relevance, which generates path– methods automatically according to a naive user’s requests. Our experiments show that the traversal algorithm of PMG is a very successful tool for aiding the user with the dificult task of querying and updating a large OODB.
