The multiroot k-outconnected subgraph problem is: given an undirected graph &7 with nonnegative costs on the edges, a vector of q root nodes d = (7-1,. . . , rg), and a vector i? = (kl, . . , k,) of connectivity requirements (with k = max ki), find a minimum-cost I?-outconnected from Râ€™ spanning subgraph (that is, for every i = 1,. . . , q there are ki internally vertex disjoint paths from ri to any other node). The best known algorithm for this problem has approximation ratio Zq,whereqcanbeaslargeask-1. FornovaIueofk>2a better approximation algorithm is known. We consider the case ki E { 1,2: 3) which may arise in practical networks. For this case we give a $ -approximation algorithm, improving the best previously known Capproximation. Our algorithm also implies an improvement for arbitrary k. In the case we have an initial graph which is 2-connected, our algorithm achieves approximation ratio 2.
