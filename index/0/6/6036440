We are developing special-purpose, low-power analog-to-digital converters for speech and music applications, that feature analog circuit models of biological audition to process the audio signal before conversion. This paper describes our most recent converter design, and a working system that uses several copies of the chip to compute multiple representations of sound from an analog input. This multi-representation system demonstrates the plausibility of inexpensively implementing an auditory scene analysis approach to sound processing.
