Many large-scale Web applications that require ranked top-k retrieval are implemented using inverted indices. An inverted index represents a sparse term-document matrix, where non-zero elements indicate the strength of term-document associations. In this work, we present an approach for lossless compression of inverted indices. Our approach maps terms in a document corpus to a new term space in order to reduce the number of non-zero elements in the term-document matrix, resulting in a more compact inverted index. We formulate the problem of selecting a new term space as a matrix factorization problem, and prove that finding the optimal solution is an NP-hard problem. We develop a greedy algorithm for finding an approximate solution. A side effect of our approach is increasing the number of terms in the index, which may negatively affect query evaluation performance. To eliminate such effect, we develop a methodology for modifying query evaluation algorithms by exploiting specific properties of our compression approach.
