When the wireless mesh networks are used in the embedded systems, the demand of enhancing the overall end to end network traffic and ensuring a stable connection is growing. We proposed a Dynamic Multi-channel Multi-path Routing Protocol (DMMR Protocol) to decompose contending traffics over different channel, different time and different paths to enhance the end to end network traffic. According to the channel usage around node, choosing channel dynamically can avoid inter-flow and intra-flow channel competition in the process of finding paths. We tend to choose paths with less intersection nodes to reduce the effects that multiple paths are broken at same time, when a single node cannot work. For creating multiple connections, multiple interfaces are used at one node. By this way, we can enhance end to end network traffic. We use NS2 to test DMMR Protocol, and analyzing the overall end to end traffic when multiple connections are setting up in the network. If the network can accept a new connection, the increment of end to end traffic is same as the traffic of the new connection. In connection robust test, a single path broken will not affect other flows in same connection and the end to end traffic in the connection will recovery immediately when the broken path is repaired.
