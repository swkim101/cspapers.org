In this paper, we discuss how our work on evaluating Semantic Web knowledge base systems (KBSs) contributes to address some broader AI problems. First, we show how our apprcach provides a benchmarking solution to the Semantic Web, a new application area of AI. Second, we discuss how the approach is also beneficial in a more traditional AI context. We focus on issues such as scalability, performance tradeoffs, and the comparison of different classes of systems.
