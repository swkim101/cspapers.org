Haptic learning of gesture shortcuts has never been explored. In this paper, we investigate haptic learning of a freehand semaphoric finger tap gesture shortcut set using haptic rings. We conduct a two-day study of 30 participants where we couple haptic stimuli with visual and audio stimuli, and compare their learning performance with wholly visual learning. The results indicate that with <30 minutes of learning, haptic learning of finger tap semaphoric gestures is comparable to visual learning and maintains its recall on the second day.
