We explore the robustness and usability of moving-image object recognition (video) captchas, designing and implementing automated attacks based on computer vision techniques. Our approach is suitable for broad classes of moving-image captchas involving rigid objects. We first present an attack that defeats instances of such a captcha (NuCaptcha) representing the state-of-the-art, involving dynamic text strings called codewords. We then consider design modifications to mitigate the attacks (e.g., overlapping characters more closely). We implement the modified captchas and test if designs modified for greater robustness maintain usability. Our lab-based studies show that the modified captchas fail to offer viable usability, even when the captcha strength is reduced below acceptable targets--signaling that the modified designs are not viable. We also implement and test another variant of moving text strings using the known emerging images idea. This variant is resilient to our attacks and also offers similar usability to commercially available approaches. We explain why fundamental elements of the emerging images concept resist our current attack where others fails.
