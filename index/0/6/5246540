Class cohesion refers to the extent to which the members of a class are related. Several class cohesion metrics are proposed in the literature to indicate class cohesion and a few of them are mathematically validated against the necessary properties of class cohesion. Metrics that violate class cohesion properties are not well defined, and their utility as indictors of the relatedness of class members is questionable. The purpose of this paper is to mathematically validate nine class cohesion metrics using class cohesion properties. Results show that the metrics differ considerably in satisfying the cohesion properties; some of them satisfy all properties and others satisfy none.
