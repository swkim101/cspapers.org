We have extended an existing HPF compiler with language features designed for the parallelization of unstructured computations on multicomputers. The language extensions include block-general distributions and dynamic data distributions specified through userdefined mapping arrays and finctions. A prototype compiler has been implemented which features dlfherent run-time preprocessing mechanisms and also allows clean integration of explicit messagepassing primitives. The compiler is developed as part of a complete multicomputer programming environment being used by a group of application developers in the framework of the Joint CSCSâ€“ ETH/NEC Collaboration in Parallel Processing. As such, it is supported by a high-level debugger andpe~oimance monitoc and the usability and efficiency of generated parallel programs is validated by the application developers. In this pape~ we summarize the programming paradigm implemented through HPF extensions, and detail the respective compiler directives. We describe the implemented run-time preprocessing mechanisms and evaluate the efjlciency of compiler-generated code on an NEC Cenju-3 multicomputez
