Lockheed has been working on techniques for navigation of an autonomous aerial vehicle using passively sensed images. One technique which shows promise is bootstrap stereo, in which the vehicle's position is determined from the perceived locations of known ground control points, then two known vehicle camera positions are used to locate corresponding image points on the ground, creating new control points. This paper describes the components of bootstrap stereo.
