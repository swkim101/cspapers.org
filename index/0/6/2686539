A (page or web) snippet is document excerpts allowing a user to understand if a document is indeed relevant without accessing it. This paper proposes an effective snippet generation method. The pseudo relevance feedback technique and text summarization techniques are applied to salient sentences extraction for generating good quality snippets. In the experimental results, the proposed method showed much better performance than other methods including Google and Naver.
