It is crucial to enable regular users to explore RDF-compliant data bases in an effective way, regardless their knowledge about the SPARQL or the underlying ontology. Natural language querying have been proposed to address this issue. However it has unavoidably lower accuracy, as compared to systems with graph-based querying interfaces, which, in turn, are usually still too difficult for regular users. This paper presents a search system of user interface that is more user-friendly than widely known graph-based solutions.
