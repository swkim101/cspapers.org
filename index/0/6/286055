A hierarchical gradient of an unstructured mesh MO is a sequence of meshes M{sub 1},...,M{sub {kappa}} such that {vert_bar}M{sub {kappa}}{vert_bar} is smaller than a given threshold mesh size b. The gradient is well-conditioned if for each i in the range 1 {le} i {le} {kappa}, (1) A is well-shaped, namely, elements of Mi have a bounded aspect ratio; and (2) M{sub i} is a coarsened approximation of M{sub i-1}. The gradient is node-nested if the set of the nodes of M{sub i} is a subset of that of M{sub i-1}. The problem of constructing well-conditioned coarsening gradients is a key step for hierarchical and multi-level numerical calculations. In this paper, we give an algorithm for finding a well-conditioned hierarchical gradient of a two dimensional unstructured mesh. Our algorithm can be used to generate both node-nested and non-nested gradients. The gradient M{sub 1},...,M{sub {kappa}} we generate is optimal in the following sense: there exists a constant c such that for any other well-conditioned hierarchical gradient M{prime}{sub 1},{hor_ellipsis}M{prime}{sub k}, {vert_bar}M{sub i}{vert_bar} {le} c {vert_bar}M{prime}{sub i}{vert_bar}, that is, the size of the mesh at each level is smaller up to a constant factor.
