This paper reflects the state of development of multilevel control algorithms for a six-legged mobile robot. The robot has a perceptive ability and can measure distances up to points in the terrain relief to be overcome. The measurement process is coordinated with the robot's motion. DC simulation results and the analysis of the robot's moving image on the display screen make it possible to check the algorithms and to search ways for their improvement.
