In existing control techniques for optical manipulation, the effect of the Brownian motion is usually disregarded for ease of analyzing the control systems. However, due to the prevalence of the Brownian motion and its effect on micro-manipulation of tiny objects, it is important for the Brownian effect to be properly taken into account so as to ensure the performance and stability of the control systems. This paper proposes a robotic control technique to achieve automated manipulation of multiple microscopic objects with the consideration of the Brownian perturbations. In this control technique, a desired dynamic region is first initiated to enclose all the trapped micro-objects. The trapped objects are then manipulated as a whole while being kept inside the desired region, and at the same time, avoiding collisions between each other during the course of manipulation. Rigorous mathematical formulation is developed to analyze the control system for automated manipulation of multiple micro-objects with stochastic perturbations. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed control technique.
