While commercial CASE tools have developed extensions to the Ftite State Machine that can model any computable ftmction snd/or any parallel system, there has been no simple hand method with equivalent capabilities suitable for student use. â€˜Ilk paper presents a simple object-oriented extension to Fhtite State Machines with the power of a Turing machine and the capability to model parallel processing.
