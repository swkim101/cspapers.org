Effective computer-aided design of engineering systems requires comprehensive computer applications software which conveniently adapts to the particular engineering design considered. This paper discusses initial experience with a program of this kind intended for computer-aided design of machine-like mechanical systems, and outlines the use of a time-shared graphic terminal for schematic display of program output. This paper is a successor to one presented at the 1969 Design Automation Workshop1 in which the motivation, definition, and essential methods were outlined.
