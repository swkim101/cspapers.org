In this paper, we present a novel approach to micromanipulation and assembly tasks using caging micro-manipulation motion primitives for 2D and 3D autonomous micromanipulation and assembly tasks. A flexible, multi-scale test-bed, developed for use in conjunction with these primitives, is described first. The approach and motion primitives are then discussed. An autonomous micromanipulation and assembly task is described and manipulation plans using the methodology are generated and experimentally executed. The autonomous task shows promising results with a success rate of 93% for 27 individual micro-assembly experiments.
