The design of interactive mobile robots is a multidisciplinary endeavor that profits from putting robots with people and studying their effects and impacts. To do so, two main issues must be addressed: giving robots capabilities in order to interact in meaningful and efficient ways with people, and the ability to move in human settings. This paper briefly describes four robotic platforms that are going to be demonstrated at the AAAI 2005 Robot Competition.
