Interfhce builders are popular tools for designing anddeveloping graphical user interfaces. These tools, however, areengineering-centered; they operate mainly on windows and widgets. Atypical interface builder does not offer any specific support foruser-centered interface design, a methodology recognized ascritical for effective user interface design. We present MOBILE(Model-Based Inter&xx Layout Editor) an interface building toolthat iidly supports user-centered design and that guides thehtafhce building process by using user-task models and a knowledgebase of interface design guidelines. The approach in MOBILE has theimportant added benefit of being useful in both top-down andbottom-up interface design strategies.
