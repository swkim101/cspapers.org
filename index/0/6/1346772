Performing general human behavior by experts' navigation is expected to be realized as wearable and ubiquitous technologies and computing develop. For simple, ordinary behavior, a person does not need the assistance of an expert. However, if one is standing next to an injured/ill person, one needs the instruction on performing first aid treatment from an expert. The wearer of the wearable behavior navigation system will be able to conduct first aid treatment as an expert would. We have developed the wearable behavior navigation systems using Augmented Reality technology, mainly for the navigation of the first aid treatment and for escape from dangerous areas, such as a building on fire. The effectiveness of the wearable navigation systems has been evaluated by a number of experiments. In this paper, the basic mechanism to realize general human behavior navigation is presented, along with the concrete configuration of the prototype of the navigation systems, and the experimental evaluation.
