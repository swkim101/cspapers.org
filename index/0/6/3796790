Delivering an excellent use experience to the customers is the top challenge faced by today's mobile device designers and producers. There have been multiple studies on achieving the good trade-offs between QoS and energy to enhance the user experience, however, they generally lack a comprehensive and accurate understanding of QoS, and ignore the fact that each individual user has his/her own preference between QoS and energy. In this study, we overcome these two drawbacks and propose a customized power management policy that dynamically configures the mobile platform to achieve the user-specific optimal QoS and energy trade-offs and hence, satisfy each individual mobile user. We first introduce a novel and comprehensive definition of QoS, and propose the accurate QoS measurement and management methodologies. We then observe that user's personality greatly determines his/her preferences between QoS and energy, and propose an online personality-guided user satisfaction prediction model based on the QoS and energy, guided by the user personality inferred from his/her device usage history. Our validation proves our model can achieve very high prediction accuracy. Finally, we propose our customized power management policy based on the prediction model for individual users. The experiment results show that our technique can improve the user experience by around 36% compared with the state-of-the-art power management policies.
