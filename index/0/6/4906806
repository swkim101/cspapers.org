Participatory Computing is a promising solution to fully utilize the wasted computation resources of mobile devices such as smartphones. In this demo abstract, we present our design and implementation of an participatory computing enhanced pervasive surveillance system. Our evaluation results show that the proposed system can effectively utilize the computation capability of mobile devices while guaranteeing the service reliability even with the intermittent nature of participatory computing.
