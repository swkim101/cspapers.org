Many of today's electro-mechanical devices exhibit both continuous and discrete behavior. Modeling these hybrid systems presents special challenges for automated modeling and simulation. We show how nonstandard analysis overcomes these challenges, provides a firm mathematical foundation, and satisfies our intuitions about the behavior of hybrid systems.
