Mobile ad hoc networks have multiple limitations in performing similarity-based nearest neighbor search - dynamic topology, frequent disconnections, limited power, and restricted bandwidth. Cooperative caching is an effective technique to reduce network traffic and increase accessibility. In this paper, we propose to solve the k-nearest-neighbor search problem in ad hoc networks using a semantic-based caching scheme which reflects the content distribution in the network. The proposed scheme describes the semantic similarity among data objects using constraints, and employs cooperative caching to estimate the content distribution in the network. The query resolution based on the cooperative caching scheme is non-flooding and hierarchy-free.
