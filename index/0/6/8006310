Do we really need 3D labels in order to learn how to predict 3D? In this paper, we show that one can learn a mapping from appearance to 3D properties without ever seeing a single explicit 3D label. Rather than use explicit supervision, we use the regularity of indoor scenes to learn the mapping in a completely unsupervised manner. We demonstrate this on both a standard 3D scene understanding dataset as well as Internet images for which 3D is unavailable, precluding supervised learning. Despite never seeing a 3D label, our method produces competitive results.
