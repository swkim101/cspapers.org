We propose Dungeons & Swimmers, an interactive audio- and motion-based exergame for swimming. As the first of its kind, we explore its design considerations and opportunities stemming from swimming. We gamify the four different stroke types with an auditory feedback. For minimal interference, we develop a single sensor-based wearable prototype detecting the strokes and stroke types in real time. We conduct a pilot deployment to study initial user experiences.
