This paper investigates force accuracy of a human finger in three types of support conditions of an exoskeleton. The exoskeleton augments pinching force of a wearer's index finger in proportion to it based on surface electromyography. Three supporting manners of the pinching force are evaluated by switching a fingertip part of the exoskeleton. One is that the assistive force is applied to the wearer's finger so that the force could be sensible by the wearer. Another case is that the assistive force is directly delivered to a grasping object without a wearer's fingertip. The other is that a part of the force directly affects the object and the rest affects the wearer's finger. Through pilot experiments, transitions of the accuracy through training in these cases are compared each other.
