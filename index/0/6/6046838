In this paper we discuss a heuristically controlled approach to combining reasoning with cases and reasoning with rules. Our task is interpretation of under-defined terms that occur in legal statutes (like the Internal Revenue Code) where certain terms must be applied to particular cases even though their meanings are not defined by the statute and the statutory rules are unclear as to scope and meaning. We describe this problem, known as statutory interpretation, provide examples of it, describe the need for melding case-based and rule-based reasoning, and discuss heuristics used in guiding reasoning on such problems. We conclude with a discussion of our on-going work to model this mode of expert reasoning.
