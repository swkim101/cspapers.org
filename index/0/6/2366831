With the advent of portable and high-density microelectronic devices, the power dissipation of integrated circuits has become a critical concern. Accurate and efficient power estimation during the design phase is required in order to meet the power specifications without a costly redesign process. As an introduction to the other papers in this session, this paper gives a tutorial presentation of the issues involved in power estimation.
