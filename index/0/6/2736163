The DAIDA project has made an attempt of formally defining and relating declarative and computational entities considered relevant to the process of database application development. Such entities range from objectoriented specifications to executable modules of database programs. To bridge the gap between semantics and computation, they also include abstract machine-based formal specifications and transformational theories. In an second contribution, selected characteristics of such entities and relationships are modeled uniformly in a software information system. Emphasis is placed on those properties that may become relevant when applications have to be modified or adjusted. Besides discussing the interaction of these aspects of the DAIDA methodology, the paper outlines an operational project prototype and reports first experiences.
