Relaxation in a conceptual hierarchy is proposed as a useful principle in the design of a visual recognition system. The domain of the implementation is Kanade's Origami world. The hierarchy is described along with the connection patterns that define the complete network. Advantages of this system are a uniform approach to intermediate and low level vision, inherent parallel approach and sharing of partial results to dynamically cut down the search for a correct match.
