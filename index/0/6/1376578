Wikipedia has become one of the most authoritative information sources on the Web. Each article in Wikipedia provides a portrait of a certain entity. However, such a portrait is far from complete. An informative portrait of an entity should also reveal the context the entity belongs to. For example, for a person, major historical, political and cultural events that coincide with her life are important and should be included in that person's portrait. Similarly, the person's interactions with other people are also important. All this information should be summarized and presented in an appealing and interactive visual interface that enables users to quickly scan the entity's portrait. We demonstrate CATE which is a system that utilizes Wikipedia to create a portrait of a given entity of interest. We provide a visualization tool that summarizes the important events related to the entity. The novelty of our approach lies in seeing the portrait of an entity in a broader context, synchronous with its time.
