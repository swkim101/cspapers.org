In this paper we present a framework of reasoning with inconsistent ontologies, in which pre-defined selection functions are used to deal with concept relevance. We examine how the notion of "concept relevance" can be used for reasoning with inconsistent ontologies. We have implemented a prototype called PION (Processing Inconsistent ONtologies), which is based on a syntactic relevance-based selection function. In this paper, we also report the experiments with PION.
