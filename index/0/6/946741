Semi-join is a relational operator that decreases the cost of processing queries involving binary operations. This is accomplished by initially selecting the data relevant to answer the queries and thereby reducing the size of the operand relations. This paper presents and analyzes algorithms for computing semi-joins in a multiprocessor database machine. First, an architecture model of a multiprocessor system is described. The model incorporates 1-0, CPU and messages transmission cost parameters to enable the evaluation of these algorithms in terms of their execution costs. Then two equi-semi-join algorithms are presented and compared and one inequi-semi-join algorithm is proposed. The execution cost of these algorithms are generally lineary proportional to the size of the operand and result relations and inversely proportional to the number of processors. Then, the method by joining two relations and the method by joining their semi-joins are compared. Finally it is shown that the method using semi-joins is generally better.
