Limitations of Plagiarism Detection Systems State-of-the-art plagiarism detection approaches capably identify copy & paste and to some extent slightly modified plagiarism. However, they cannot reliably identify strongly disguised plagiarism forms, including paraphrases, translated plagiarism, and idea plagiarism, which are forms of plagiarism more commonly found in scientific texts. This weakness of current systems results in a large fraction of todayâ€™s scientific plagiarism going undetected.
