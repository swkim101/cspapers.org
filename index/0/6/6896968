Both appt~oaches have their advantages and disadvantages; dictionary lookup fails for unknown words (e.g., proper nouns) and letter to sound rules fail for irregular words, which are all too common in English. Most speech synthesizers adopt a hybrid strategy, using the dictionary when possible and turning to letter to sound rules for the rest. I discussed letter to sound rules at the last meeting of the ACL [Church]; this paper will report on some new dictionary lookup approaches, with an emphasis on morphology.
