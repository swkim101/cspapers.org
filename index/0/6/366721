The pace of technology for use in computing education is staggering. In the last five years, the following technologies have completely transformed our teaching: Piazza, Google Docs, PandaGrader (now GradeScope), YouTube, Doodle, Skype, Google Hangout, Khan Academy, etc. Hardware has also played a part; we love our Zoom H2 digital voice recorder (for CD-quality lecture audio), Blue Yeti USB mike (for audio / videoconferences), and iClickers (for engaging students in class). This panel is an outgrowth of the Technology that Educators of Computing Hail (TECH) Birds-Of-a-Feather session that we've held at SIGCSE for seven years. It will provide a chance for seasoned high school and university educators to show you the technologies that have "bubbled to the top", what problems they solve, and why they are so valuable. Like concert musicians, presenters will give live demonstrations and reveal the particular configuration options required to make their technology "sing". We hope this forum will allow the chance to dive deeply into the common use cases of these technologies, and explain how others can adopt them at their institutions.
