We introduce Codestrates, a literate computing approach to developing interactive software. Codestrates blurs the distinction between the use and development of applications. It builds on the literate computing approach, commonly found in interactive notebooks such as Jupyter notebook. Literate computing weaves together prose and live computation in the same document. However, literate computing in interactive notebooks are limited to computation and it is challenging to extend their user interface, reprogram their functionality, or develop stand-alone applications. Codestrates builds literate computing capabilities on top of Webstrates and demonstrates how it can be used for (i) collaborative interactive notebooks, (ii) extending its functionality from within itself, and (iii) developing reprogrammable applications.
