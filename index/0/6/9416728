This work addresses the problem of motion planning among obstacles for quadrotor platforms under external disturbances and with model uncertainty. A novel Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) optimization technique is proposed which incorporates specified uncertainties into the planned trajectories. At the core of the procedure lies the propagation of model parameter uncertainty and initial state uncertainty as high-confidence ellipsoids in pose space. The quadrotor trajectories are then computed to avoid obstacles by a required safety margin, expressed as ellipsoid penetration while minimizing control effort and achieving a user-specified goal location. Combining this technique with online model identification results in robust obstacle avoidance behavior. Experiments in outdoor scenarios with virtual obstacles show that the quadrotor can avoid obstacles robustly, even under the influence of external disturbances.
