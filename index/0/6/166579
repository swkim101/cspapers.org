Test sequences are used for the conformance testing of communication protocols to standards. This paper discusses a new approach to generating test sequences. The approach is based on probabilistic concepts about protocol state transitions and communication channels. The novel feature of the test sequences generated by this technique is that the most probable states of a protocol will be tested more promptly.
