We present an active vision system for segmentation of visual scenes based on integration of several cues. The system serves as a visual front end for generation of object hypotheses for new, previously unseen objects in natural scenes. The system combines a set of foveal and peripheral cameras where, through a stereo based fixation process, object hypotheses are generated. In addition to considering the segmentation process in 3D, the main contribution of the paper is integration of different cues in a temporal framework and improvement of initial hypotheses over time.
