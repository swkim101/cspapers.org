In the context of wireless data collection, a common application class in wireless sensor networks, this paper presents a novel, non-intrusive algorithm for the precise reconstruction of the packet path, the per-hop arrival order and the per-hop arrival times of individual packets from partial in-band information at runtime. Information is reconstructed outside the network immediately after a packet is received at the sink. After establishing the correctness of our proposed algorithm, we evaluate its performance in testbed experiments using CTP and Dozer, two well-known data collection protocols. Foremost interested in obtaining a better understanding of the performance of long-term real-world deployments, Multi-hop Network Tomography (MNT) is applied to in total more than 140 million packets that have been obtained from three multi-year WSN deployments of the PermaSense project. The capabilities of the performance analysis of deployed systems using the proposed algorithm and methodology are demonstrated in a case study.
