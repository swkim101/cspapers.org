In this abstract, we present a novel method for exploring the visual behavior of multiple users engaged in a collaborative task around an interactive surface. The proposed method synchronizes input from multiple eye trackers, describes the visual behavior of individual users over time, and identifies joint attention across multiple users. We applied this method to analyze the visual behavior of four users collaborating using a large-scale multi-touch tabletop.
