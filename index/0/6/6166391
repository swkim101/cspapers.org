l Spreadsheet programs: In a spreadsheet program, the user wants to compute some formula, and he wants to know how the results differ subject to different constraints (e.g., market conditions, interest rates, etc.). Typically, the user enters some initial data, computes an initial result, and then repeatedly changes a few of the parameters and recomputes the results. Each time the program is invoked to compute the formula, it performs the same calculation on slightly different data.
