Anti-jack-knifing apparatus for articulated vehicles, wherein the anti-jack-knifing force is exerted independently of the operation of the vehicle braking system by the provision of a hydraulic pressure source including two working chambers communicating via a throttling bore in a piston, the moving part of the pressure source being connected to the trailer while the stationary part is fixedly connected to the tractor, and the working spaces of the pressure source are connected with the brake cylinder of the anti-jack-knifing brake construction to actuate the latter, via throttle valve units including by-pass ducts and non-return valves.
