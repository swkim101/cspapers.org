Robust velocity and position estimation at high update rates is crucial for mobile robot navigation. In recent years optical flow sensors based on computer mouse hardware chips have been shown to perform well on micro air vehicles. Since they require more light than present in typical indoor and outdoor low-light conditions, their practical use is limited. We present an open source and open hardware design 1 of an optical flow sensor based on a machine vision CMOS image sensor for indoor and outdoor applications with very high light sensitivity. Optical flow is estimated on an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller in real-time at 250 Hz update rate. Angular rate compensation with a gyroscope and distance scaling using a ultrasonic sensor are performed onboard. The system is designed for further extension and adaption and shown in-flight on a micro air vehicle.
