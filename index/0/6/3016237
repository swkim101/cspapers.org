Learning a craft like programming is efficient when novices learn from people who already master the craft. In this paper we define Extreme Apprenticeship, an extension to the cognitive apprenticeship model. Our model is based on a set of values and practices that emphasize learning by doing together with continuous feedback as the most efficient means for learning. We show how the method was applied to a CS I programming course. Application of the method resulted in a significant decrease in the dropout rates in comparison with the previous traditionally conducted course instances.
