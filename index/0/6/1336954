The Binary Search Tree serves as an important example when teaching data structures. We explore new approaches to understanding the implementation of a Binary Search Tree, using concepts from Object-Oriented Programming and C++. The Binary Search Tree illustrates how adopting a new approach and a new language can lead to a new way of thinking about a familiar problem.
