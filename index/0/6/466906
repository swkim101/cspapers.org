This paper describes an extension of FRL (Frame Representation Language) which supports the encoding of reasoning knowledge within a frame-based formalism. The extension is called HPRL (Heuristic Programming and Representation Language). The declarative representation of reasoning knowledge in the same formalism that is used to represent domain knowledge results in a powerful tool for the construction of expert systems. Reasoning knowledge is easy to describe, examine and modify. Rules can be reflexive, allowing the construction of powerful meta-rules. HPRL runs on a Vax 11/780, and on the HP-9836. It has been used for various exploratory projects at Hewlett-Packard, including a program to diagnose faults during IC manufacturing, a program for analyzing dual-channel ECG information to diagnose arrhythmias, and a program for analyzing spectra from infrared and mass spectrometers.
