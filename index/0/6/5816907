In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach for detecting profanity-related offensive content in Twitter. Our approach exploits linguistic regularities in profane language via statistical topic modeling on a huge Twitter corpus, and detects offensive tweets using automatically these generated features. Our approach performs competitively with a variety of machine learning (ML) algorithms. For instance, our approach achieves a true positive rate (TP) of 75.1% over 4029 testing tweets using Logistic Regression, significantly outperforming the popular keyword matching baseline, which has a TP of 69.7%, while keeping the false positive rate (FP) at the same level as the baseline at about 3.77%. Our approach provides an alternative to large scale hand annotation efforts required by fully supervised learning approaches.
