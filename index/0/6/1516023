1. MOTIVATION Within the WWW there are lots of different information retrieval services like search engines, news archives, product catalogs, or literature services. In order to support the user, meta search systems provide great benefits and synergies: For instance, a user query can be evaluated on a larger set of documents and by applying duplicate detection meta search systems can both improve the quality of the results and reveal different purchase options for the same document or product. Within the UniCats project [1] we develop a meta search system based on digital library services like bookstores, library OPACs, or archives of research papers.
