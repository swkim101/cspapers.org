We consider the problem of approximate set similarity search under Braun-Blanquet similarity B(x, y) = |x ∩ y| / max(|x|, |y|). The (b1, b2)-approximate Braun-Blanquet similarity search problem is to preprocess a collection of sets P such that, given a query set q, if there exists x Ε P with B(q, x) ≥ b1, then we can efficiently return x′ Ε P with B(q, x′) > b2. We present a simple data structure that solves this problem with space usage O(n1+ρlogn + ∑x ε P|x|) and query time O(|q|nρ logn) where n = |P| and ρ = log(1/b1)/log(1/b2). Making use of existing lower bounds for locality-sensitive hashing by O'Donnell et al. (TOCT 2014) we show that this value of ρ is tight across the parameter space, i.e., for every choice of constants 0 < b2 < b1 < 1. In the case where all sets have the same size our solution strictly improves upon the value of ρ that can be obtained through the use of state-of-the-art data-independent techniques in the Indyk-Motwani locality-sensitive hashing framework (STOC 1998) such as Broder's MinHash (CCS 1997) for Jaccard similarity and Andoni et al.'s cross-polytope LSH (NIPS 2015) for cosine similarity. Surprisingly, even though our solution is data-independent, for a large part of the parameter space we outperform the currently best data-dependent method by Andoni and Razenshteyn (STOC 2015).
