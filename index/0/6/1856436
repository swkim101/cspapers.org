This paper describes SLEUTH, a new metal-to-metal audit program recently developed by the author for an interactive CRT environment.
 Several techniques are described which permit SLEUTH to identify tolerance violations very quickly on a PDP/15.
 The major features of SLEUTH are: A global audit for finding all clearance violations on the circuit levels being audited, a screen audit for finding violations on the area of the board which is currently being displayed, and a distance check which returns the distance between any two items which the user selects.
