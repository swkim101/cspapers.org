We present the first randomized O(logn) time and O(m+n) work EREW PRAM algorithm for finding a spanning forest of an undirected graph G=(V,E) with n vertices and m edges. Our algorithm is optimal with respect to time, work, and space. As a consequence we get optimal randomized EREW PRAM algorithms for other basic connectivity problems such as finding a bipartite partition, finding bridges and biconnected components, finding Euler tours in Eulerian graphs, finding an ear decomposition, finding an open ear decomposition, finding a strong orientation, and finding an st-numbering.
