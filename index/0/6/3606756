Database management systems (DBMS) store and manage large sets of shared data whereas application programs perform the data processing tasks, e. g., to run the business of a company. Often, these programs are written in various programming languages (PLs) embodying different type systems. Thus, DBMSs should be “multi-lingual“ to serve the application requests. This is typically achieved by providing a DBMS and its database language (DBL), like SQL2, with an own type system. To access the database (DB), a DBL/PL-coupling called database API (DB-API or API for short) is required.
