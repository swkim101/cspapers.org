We present the design and execution of a Service Learning Practicum (SLP) course sequence intended to be year-long capstone for computer science seniors. Students are teamed into groups of six, and develop software for local nonprofit organizations. In addition to the structure of the course, we describe the challenges faced (legal, organizational, etc.), student perceptions via survey results, and provide a number of suggestions for other institutions who are looking to create a similar course sequence. At the end of the cap- stone experience, the customers are provided with working software that meet their current needs.
