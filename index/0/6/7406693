This paper presents a methodology and strategy used for hardware-software codesign and coverification of a large ATM switch whose functionality is largely embodied to new ASICs. A strategy based on software emulation is presented which supports the concurrent development and verification of the system software with the hardware being designed prior to lab samples being available. The goal is reduced system integration times, and design iterations due to system errors.
