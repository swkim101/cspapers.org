This work aims to show through a detailed case study that scaling up automated verification to larger non-trivial data structures is not only possible, but when combined with appropriate tool support, can be made more comprehensible and practicable to users in a variety of settings, including the undergraduate curriculum. The study involves an interplay of multiple components annotated with formal interface contracts and the components are all designed to be modular, reusable, and amenable to automated verification and analysis. The components are built using a formal integrated development environment (F-IDE). The plan is to evaluate the F-IDE in an upper-level undergraduate software engineering course in the Spring semester at Clemson University.
