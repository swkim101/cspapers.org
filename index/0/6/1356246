We present an LFG-DOP parser which uses fragments from LFG-annotated sentences to parse new sentences. Experiments with the Verbmobil and Homecentre corpora show that (1) Viterbi n best search performs about 100 times faster than Monte Carlo search while both achieve the same accuracy; (2) the DOP hypothesis which states that parse accuracy increases with increasing fragment size is confirmed for LFG-DOP; (3) LFG-DOP's relative frequency estimator performs worse than a discounted frequency estimator; and (4) LFG-DOP significantly outperforms Tree-DOP if evaluated on tree structures only.
