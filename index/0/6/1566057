We prove a new necessary and sufficient condition for 2D three-finger equilibrium grasps and implement a geometrical algorithm for computing force-closure grasps of polygonal objects in this article. The algorithm is quite simple and only needs some algebraic calculations. An easily computable measure of how far a grasp is from losing force-closure is provided as well. Finally, we implement the algorithm and demonstrate its usefulness by an example.
