The fifth ACM international workshop on cloud data management is held in San Francisco, California, USA on October 28, 2013 and co-located with the ACM 22nd Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). The main objective of the workshop is to address the challenges of large scale data management based on the cloud computing infrastructure. The workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from cloud computing, distributed storage, query processing, parallel algorithms, data mining, and system analysis, all attendees share common research interests in maximizing performance, reducing cost of cloud data management and enlarging the scale of their endeavors. We have constructed an exciting program of four refereed papers and an invited keynote talk that will give participants a full dose of emerging research.
