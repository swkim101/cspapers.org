We investigate a meta-model approach, called Meta-learning Using Document Feature characteristics (MUDOF), for the task of automatic textual document categorization. It employs a meta-learning phase using document feature characteristics. Document feature characteristics, derived from the training document set, capture some inherent category-specific properties of a particular category. Different from existing categorization methods, MUDOF can automatically recommend a suitable algorithm for each category based on the category-specific statistical characteristics. Hence, different algorithms may be employed for different categories. Experiments have been conducted on a real-world document collection demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The results confirm that our meta-model approach can exploit the advantage of its component algorithms, and demonstrate a better performance than existing algorithms.
