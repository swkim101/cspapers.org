We describe a multi-modal cargo routing (MMCR) domain for modelling military logistics planning problems. These are transport optimisation problems that feature timing constraints, concurrency, capacitated resources, and action costs. We have developed a PDDL domain model, and have released a collection of problem instances along with a software tool to aid in the design and generation of new problem instances. Small instances of this domain stretch the capabilities of existing automated planning procedures, and larger realistic instances are beyond the capabilities of existing automated planning systems. We anticipate that scalable solution procedures for this domain will follow in the footsteps of systems, such as OPTIC and TIMIPLAN, which combine heuristic search concepts with mathematical programming optimisation tools.
