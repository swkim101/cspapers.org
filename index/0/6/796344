The trifocal tensor, which describes the relation between projections of points and lines in three views, is a fundamental entity of geometric computer vision. In this work, we investigate a new parametrization of the trifocal tensor for calibrated cameras with non-colinear pinholes obtained from a quotient Riemannian manifold. We incorporate this formulation into state-of-the art methods for optimization on manifolds, and show, through experiments in pose averaging, that it produces a meaningful way to measure distances between trifocal tensors.
