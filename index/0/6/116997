Algorithms are an integral part of computer science literature. However, none of the current search engines offer specialized algorithm search facility. We describe a vertical search engine that identifies the algorithms present in documents and extracts and indexes the related metadata and textual description of the identified algorithms. This algorithm specific information is then utilized for algorithm ranking in response to user queries. Experimental results show the superiority of our system on other popular search engines.
