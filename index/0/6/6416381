The papers in this volume were presented at the Twenty-First Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, held January 17-19, 2010 in Austin, Texas. The Symposium was jointly sponsored by SIGACT (the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory) and by the SIAM Activity Group on Discrete Mathematics. 
 
The program committee accepted 135 submissions of the 445 that were submitted. Some accepted submissions were merged, resulting in 132 papers at the conference. Papers were chosen based on originality, technical contribution, and relevance. The committee was helped immensely in this process by input from over 550 reviewers. We are very grateful to them for their help.
