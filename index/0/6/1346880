We introduce a new model of Gaussian mixtures, motivated by the setting where the data points correspond to ratings on a set of items provided by users who have widely varying expertise, and each user can rate an item at most once. In this mixture model, each item i has a true quality μi, each user has a variance (lack of expertise) σj2, and the rating of a user j on an item i consists of a single sample independently drawn from the Normal distribution N(μi, σj2). The aim is to learn the unknown item qualities μi's as precisely as possible. We study the single item case and obtain efficient algorithms for the problem, complemented by near-matching lower bounds; we also obtain preliminary results for the multiple items case.!TEX root = paper.tex
