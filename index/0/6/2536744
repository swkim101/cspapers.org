Well designed multimedia-based modules can enhance a classroom presentation, provide enrichment activities beyond the classroom, and improve the effectiveness of laboratory activities. various research projects have shown that multimedia-based modules can improve a studentâ€™s comprehension and retention. These characteristics are prompting may educators to consider developing multimedia-based materials to augment their instruction. There are some major concerns associated with multimedia development, not the least of which is how to create a multimedia development environment at a reasonable cost. The purpose of this seminar is to discuss criteria for selecting compatible software and hardware components that can be used to create multimedia-based modules for use in computer science courses.
