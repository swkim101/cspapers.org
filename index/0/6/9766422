Crowd-Cache is a novel crowd-sourced content caching system which provides cheap and convenient content access for mobile users. Our system exploits both transient colocation of devices and the spatial temporal correlation of content popularity, where users in a particular location and at specific times would be likely interested in similar content. We demonstrate the feasibility of Crowd-Cache system through a prototype implementation on Android smartphones.
