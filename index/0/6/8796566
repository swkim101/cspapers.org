In system management applications, an overwhelming amount of data are generated and collected in the form of temporal events. While mining temporal event data to discover interesting and frequent patterns has obtained rapidly increasing research efforts, users of the applications are overwhelmed by the mining results. The extracted patterns are generally of large volume and hard to interpret, they may be of no emphasis, intricate and meaningless to non-experts, even to domain experts. While traditional research efforts focus on finding interesting patterns, in this paper, we take a novel approach called event summarization towards the understanding of the seemingly chaotic temporal data. Event summarization aims at providing a concise interpretation of the seemingly chaotic data, so that domain experts may take actions upon the summarized models. Event summarization decomposes the temporal information into many independent subsets and finds well fitted models to describe each subset.
