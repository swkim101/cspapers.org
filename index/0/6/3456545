We present SLASH, a learning tool currently under development in our graduate program. SLASH aims to help students review concepts in lectures slides using flash cards automatically generated from the slides. Many courses in our program have weekly quizzes and students can get stressed quite easily. So we hope that SLASH can make the process of reviewing lectures more fun and interesting to the students. Extracting concepts from lectures slides is itself an interesting but challenging problem, since the contents of the slides may be fragmented (e.g., point-based, with an incomplete sentence for each point) and noisy (e.g., containing formulas and codes). Past research on text mining has tried to "glue" together the points to construct a grammatically correct sentence, which is then used to extract concepts and relationships. In contrast, we focus on discovering popular concepts in the slides and generating flash cards with (just) sufficient contexts to help students recall the concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the automatic generation of concept-based flash cards from lecture slides. In the presentation, we will show our preliminary work, example flash cards, student feedback, and challenges in developing SLASH. We believe that SLASH may benefit all instructors who are using PowerPoint for lecture presentation, and may be used to largely stimulate students' interests in learning the subjects.
