We describe a preliminary analysis of queries created by 81 users for 4 topics from the TREC Robust Track. Our goal was to explore the potential benefits of using queries created by multiple users on retrieval performance for difficult topics. We first examine the overlap in users' queries and the overlap in results with respect to different queries for the same topic. We then explore the potential benefits of combining users' queries in various ways. Our results provide some evidence that having access to multiple users' queries can improve retrieval for individual searchers and for difficult topics.
