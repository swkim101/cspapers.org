The paper shows that movement or equivalent computational structure-changing operations of any kind at the level of logical form can be dispensed with entirely in capturing quantifier scope ambiguity. It offers a new semantics whereby the effects of quantifier scope alternation can be obtained by an entirely monotonic derivation, without type-changing rules. The paper follows Fodor (1982), Fodor and Sag (1982), and Park (1995, 1996) in viewing many apparent scope ambiguities as arising from referential categories rather than true generalized quantifiers.
