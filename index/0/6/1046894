This paper develops a technique for an autonomous robot endowed with a manipulator arm, a multi-fingered gripper, and a variety of sensors to manipulate a known, but poorly observable object. We present a novel grasp planning method which not only incorporates the potential collision between object and manipulator, but takes advantage of this interaction. The natural uncertainty and difficulties in observation in such tasks is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Recent advances in point-based methods as well as a novel state space representation specific to the grasping problem are leveraged to overcome state space growth issues. Simulation results are presented for the combined localization, manipulation, and grasping of a small nut on a table.
