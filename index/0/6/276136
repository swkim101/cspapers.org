In this paper we present a modular and extensible visualization framework for wireless sensor networks. These networks have typically no means of visualizing their state, measurements or computational results. Visualization is therefore a key issue to develop and operate these networks. Data emitted by individual sensor nodes is collected by the visualization software and passed to a flexible multi-layer plug-in mechanism that renders the information on a canvas. Developers can easily adapt existing or develop new custom tailored plug-ins for their specific application.
