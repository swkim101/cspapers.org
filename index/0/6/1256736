We study the approximability of two natural NP-hard problems. The first problem is congestion minimization in directed networks. We are given a directed capacitated graph and a set of source-sink pairs. The goal is to route all pairs with minimum congestion on the network edges. A special well-studied case of this problem is the edge-disjoint paths problem, where all edges have unit capacities. The second problem is discrete machine scheduling, where we are given a set of jobs, and for each job a list of intervals in which it can be scheduled. The goal is to find the smallest number of machines on which all jobs can be scheduled, such that no two jobs assigned to the same machine overlap. Both problems are known to be O(log n/log log n)-approximable via the randomized rounding technique of Raghavan and Thompson. However, until recently, only a Max SNP hardness was known for each problem. We make some progress in closing this gap by showing that both problem are Ω(log log n)-hard to approximate unless NP ⊆ DTIME(nO(log log log n)). Our hardness proof for congestion minimization holds even for the special case of the edge-disjoint paths problem.
