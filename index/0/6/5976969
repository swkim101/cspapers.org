This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach to disambiguate various relations between name entities by use of various lexical and syntactic features from the contexts. It works by calculating eigen-vectors of an adjacency graph's Laplacian to recover a submanifold of data from a high dimensionality space and then performing cluster number estimation on the eigenvectors. Experiment results on ACE corpora show that this spectral clustering based approach outperforms the other clustering methods.
