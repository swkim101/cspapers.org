Web users are increasingly looking for structured data, such as lyrics, job, or recipes, using unstructured queries on the web. However, retrieving relevant results from such data is a challenging problem due to the unstructured language of the web queries. In this paper, we propose a method to improve web search ranking by detecting Structured Annotation of queries based on top search results. In a structured annotation, the original query is split into different units that are associated with semantic attributes in the corresponding domain. We evaluate our techniques using real world queries and achieve significant improvement.
