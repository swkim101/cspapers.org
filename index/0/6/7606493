Systems for algorithm animation provide facilities for users to view and interact with an animation of an algorithm, and for programmers to develop such animations. For a user, there are ways to control the data given to an algorithm, the ensemble of active views, and the execution of the algorithm. For a programmer, producing an animation of an algorithm becomes almost as easy as producing a textual trace of it.
