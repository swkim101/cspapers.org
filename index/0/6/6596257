The Conference Paper Assignment Problem (CPAP) is the problem of assigning reviewers to conference paper submissions in a manner intended to minimize whingeing. It is assumed that papers are reviewed by members of a preset program committee (PC), each of whom has the opportunity to bid on papers prior to the assignment algorithm being run. In this survey, we show that CPAP is in P if the only information given is individual program committee membersâ€™ preferences for individual papers. However, if both preferences and expertise (based on, say, keywords) are given, the problem is potentially more complex.
