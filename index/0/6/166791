The telegram analysis problem posed by P. Henderson and R.A. Snowdon has been repeatedly taken into account. This paper adds yet another contribution to this problem. We propose rigorous specification methods, and describe how programs can be derived from those in two different ways. One is from BNF to Definite Clause Grammar in Prolog and the other is a functional programming by which procedural programs can be easily derived from a formal specification in the form of an abstract sequential machine, too. The first method is especially useful for prototyping, and has been applied to file manipulation. The second method has been applied to sorting, file handlers and High Level Data Link Control Procedures.
