This demo introduces V:ISSUE:LIZER, a tool for exploring online communication and analyzing clarification of requirements over time. V:Issue:lizer supports managers and developers to identify requirements with insufficient shared understanding, to analyze communication problems, and to identify developers that are knowledgeable about domain or project related issues through visualizations. Our preliminary evaluation shows that V:Issue:lizer offers managers valuable information for their decision making. (Demo video: http://youtu.be/Oy3xvzjy3BQ).
