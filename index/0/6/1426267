The curricula for Computer Science Education (CSE) of many countries comprise both Programming and Information and Communication Technology (ICT); however these two areas have substantial differences, inter alia the attitudes and beliefs of the students regarding the intended learning content. In this study, variables from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and Social Cognitive Theory were chosen as important factors in students' behavior and attitude towards CSE. This hybrid framework aims to measure the level of the selected key variables on CSE and identify potential differences among ICT and Programming courses. Responses from the total of 126 Greek students, (71 attending ICT courses and 55 attending Programming Courses) were used to measure the variables and to identify the differences between ICT and Programming students. The results revealed several differences in the measured variables. The overall outcomes are expected to contribute to the understanding of students' likelihood to pursue computing related careers and promote the acceptance of CSE.
