In this paper we present a formation synchronization and reconfiguration scheme based on distributed computation. In our previous work, we have introduced a formation abstraction by means of a virtual rectangular grid. The grid was used to ensure collision-free transitions between formations, coordinated by a centralized controller. This paper is an extension of that work, proposing control laws that are computed in a distributed way while still ensuring collision-free formation reconfigurations. Furthermore, we consider an extension of the group rendezvous problem. The agents are required to meet at the rendezvous point and establish consensus on formation state. Again, the grid abstraction is used to describe the formation state. Nonholonomic constraints of agent motion are taken into account explicitly. As our approach is communication-based, we also examine the effects of temporary communication loss.
