"... we note that undergraduate CS students need enough mathematical maturity to have the basis on which to then build CS-specific mathematics (for example, as specified in the Discrete Structures Knowledge Area), which, importantly, does not explicitly require any significant college-level coursework in calculus, differential equations, or linear algebra." [Computer Science Curricula 2013]. Is this true? Perhaps we are finally acknowledging what critics have claimed for many years; namely, that the math traditionally studied by other engineers is the wrong math for computer science. But perhaps the even longer history of organizing college-level math curricula around continuous mathematics recognizes some important source of "mathematical maturity." This session will debate Curricula 2013's claim in order to explore what topics in mathematics, and perhaps logic, statistics, and other related disciplines, a computer science program should include in order to develop appropriate "mathematical maturity" in its students.
