This paper discusses generating document structure from annotated media repositories in a domain-independent manner. This approaches the vision of a universal RDF browser. We start by applying the search-and-browse paradigm established for the WWW to RDF presentation. Furthermore, this paper adds to this paradigm the clustering-based derivation of document structure from search returns, providing simple but domain-independent hypermedia generation from RDF stores. While such generated presentations hardly meet the standards of those written by humans, they provide quick access to media repositories when the required document has not yet been written. The resulting system allows a user to specify a topic for which it generates a hypermedia document providing guided navigation through virtually any RDF repository. The impact for content providers is that as soon as one adds new media items and their annotations to a repository, they become immediately available for automatic integration into subsequently requested presentations.
