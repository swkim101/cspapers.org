However, there is currently no approach tointrospection that makes automatic adjustments at multiple levels inthe implemented agent system. We introduce our novel multi-levelintrospection framework that can be used to automatically adjustarchitectural configurations based on the introspection results at theagent, infrastructure and component level. We demonstrate the utilityof such adjustments in a concrete implementation on a robot where thehigh-level goal of the robot is used to automatically configure thevision system in a way that minimizes resource consumption whileimproving overall task performance.
