This paper addresses the problem of real-time, non-holonomic motion planning in environments with moving obstacles of unforeseen, arbitrary motion. An approach is introduced to smoothly switch trajectories by generating feasible non-holonomic trajectory segments on the fly as the robot moves in such an environment, extending the real-time adaptive motion planning (RAMP) approach that is used for holonomic motion. It allows efficient on-line simultaneous planning and execution of non-holonomic trajectories and enables a robot to adapt to changes in the environment while taking into account robot motion uncertainty. The effectiveness and efficiency of the method has been verified through real experiments with a mobile robot and several dynamic obstacles of unforeseen motion to the robot.
