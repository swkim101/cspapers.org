Physical location is an important attribute of a sensorâ€™s data stream in a large number of sensor network applications. In addition, geographic information, for instance in the form of node coordinates in some common coordinate system, is a useful primitive in routing protocols such as geographic routing, information dissemination protocols such as directed diffusion using location attributes, and sensor query processing systems. We present a method to facilitate large-scale deployment of location-aware sensor networks. We show that large networks of location-aware sensors can be made cooperatively self-configuring, that is, that each sensor can run an algorithm locally, interacting only with neighboring nodes, such that after a number of iterations all sensors will have reached a consensus about their coordinates in some coordinate system. By doing this in an automated manner, large-scale sensor networks can eliminate the cumbersome and unscalable process of manually configuring sensor nodes with their location. In non-urban outdoor settings, nodes may obtain location information using an existing infrastructure such as GPS. However, GPS receivers may be too expensive, too large, too power-intensive for the desired application, or simply unavailable. One solution to this problem is an alternative location infrastructure such as Cricket that works in places that GPS does not. Another solution to these problems is to equip sensors with hardware capable of estimating distances to nearby nodes, and to have the sensors themselves selfconfigure into a consistent coordinate system.
