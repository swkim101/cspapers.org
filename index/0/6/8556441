A two-dimensional trim-loss problem is considered in which the cutting is two-stage but there are constraints on the sequencing of the cutting of orders, A method is developed in which problem reduction is used to generate a set of possible cutting patterns at each step and an heuristic choice made of a pattern from that set. The sequences of patterns produced, although slightly sub-optimal as regards trimloss, fully satisfy the sequencing constraints.
