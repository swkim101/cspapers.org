Java is the programming language of choice for dynamic content on the hternet The language’s popularity has arisen from its portability, ease-ofaad integration with HThE.. Java is used to enable animation on Web pages, to dynamically select and format Web page content at IV& sxvers, and to provide clientside user input checking as a iiunt-end to tmnsaUion-orieuti applications. However, with a few exceptions, Java has not been used to develop applicatioas and servers that demand high performance or throughpnt In this paper, we desxii techniques for improving the performance of Java code and enabling the development of high-throughput appkations and servers. We show that Java code can be easiIy optimki to achieve performance that is comparable with that of tmditional languages such as C or C+i. We base these resuks on oar experience in developing the Inverse @n&active Universe) server in Java. Our resolts apply to Sun’s Java class library and virtual machine, but other implementations may exhibit other performance chamctedstics.
