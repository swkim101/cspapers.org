In this paper we describe an XML-based platform for dynamic active node policy updates. XML supports the definition of specific policy languages, their extension to satisfy new needs and the management of deployed policies on different active nodes. We show an example of the management of router packet forwarding policies where the XML policies that drive the packet routing are updated at run-time on the active nodes depending on the network status. The platform decouples policy management, which is handled through XML interpretation, from packet forwarding that, for performance reasons, has to be implemented in more efficient languages.
