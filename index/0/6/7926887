In the paper, channel auto-correlation and Doppler spectrum of MIMO systems using the circular array are considered based on measured data conducted at the 5.2 GHz frequency band in an indoor fading environment. The results show that these fading properties are much dependent not only on the direction of the RX motion, but also on the array orientation. In the NLOS environment, observed Doppler spectrum is quite different from the theoretical -shaped Jakes' one
