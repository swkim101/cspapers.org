Mapping evolving environments requires an update mechanism to efficiently deal with dynamic objects. In this context, we propose a new approach to update maps pertaining to large-scale dynamic environments with semantics. While previous works mainly rely on large amount of observations, the proposed framework is able to build a stable representation with only two observations of the environment. To do this, scene understanding is used to detect dynamic objects and to recover the labels of the occluded parts of the scene through an inference process which takes into account both spatial context and a class occlusion model. Our method was evaluated on a database acquired at two different times with an interval of three years in a large dynamic outdoor environment. The results point out the ability to retrieve the hidden classes with a precision score of 0.98. The performances in term of localisation are also improved.
