We study the question of identity testing for structured distributions. More precisely, given samples from a {\em structured} distribution $q$ over $[n]$ and an explicit distribution $p$ over $[n]$, we wish to distinguish whether $q=p$ versus $q$ is at least $\epsilon$-far from $p$, in $L_1$ distance. In this work, we present a unified approach that yields new, simple testers, with sample complexity that is information-theoretically optimal, for broad classes of structured distributions, including $t$-flat distributions, $t$-modal distributions, log-concave distributions, monotone hazard rate (MHR) distributions, and mixtures thereof.
