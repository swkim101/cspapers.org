For many machine learning solutions to complex applications, there are significant performance advantages to decomposing the overall task into several simpler sequential stages, commonly referred to as a pipeline model. Typically, such scenarios are also characterized by high sample complexity, motivating the study of active learning for these situations. While most active learning research examines single predictions, we extend such work to applications which utilize pipelined predictions. Specifically, we present an adaptive strategy for combining local active learning strategies into one that minimizes the annotation requirements for the overall task. Empirical results for a three-stage entity and relation extraction system demonstrate a significant reduction in supervised data requirements when using the proposed method.
