Smartphones are convenient, but their small screens make searching, clicking, and reading awkward. Thus, perusing product reviews on a smartphone is difficult. In response, we introduce RevMiner - a novel smartphone interface that utilizes Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze and navigate reviews. RevMiner was run over 300K Yelp restaurant reviews extracting attribute-value pairs, where attributes represent restaurant attributes such as sushi and service, and values represent opinions about the attributes such as fresh or fast. These pairs were aggregated and used to: 1) answer queries such as "cheap Indian food", 2) concisely present information about each restaurant, and 3) identify similar restaurants. Our user studies demonstrate that on a smartphone, participants preferred RevMiner's interface to tag clouds and color bars, and that they preferred RevMiner's results to Yelp's, particularly for conjunctive queries (e.g., "great food and huge portions"). Demonstrations of RevMiner are available at revminer.com.
