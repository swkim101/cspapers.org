This paper presents and evaluates two principles for wireless routing protocols. The first is datapath validation: data traffic quickly discovers and fixes routing inconsistencies. The second is adaptive beaconing: extending the Trickle algorithm to routing control traffic reduces route repair latency and sends fewer beacons.
 We evaluate datapath validation and adaptive beaconing in CTP Noe, a sensor network tree collection protocol. We use 12 different testbeds ranging in size from 20--310 nodes, comprising seven platforms, and six different link layers, on both interference-free and interference-prone channels. In all cases, CTP Noe delivers > 90% of packets. Many experiments achieve 99.9%. Compared to standard beaconing, CTP Noe sends 73% fewer beacons while reducing topology repair latency by 99.8%. Finally, when using low-power link layers, CTP Noe has duty cycles of 3% while supporting aggregate loads of 30 packets/minute.
