A hardware mechanism has been proposed to reconfigure an interleaved memory system. The reconfiguration scheme is such that, at any instant all fault-free memory banks in the memory system are utilized in interleaved manner. A performance metric is defined which takes into account the bandwidth and the page-fault rate in an interleaved memory system. The reconfiguration scheme proposed in this paper is analyzed for a number of distinct programs using the performance metric defined in the paper. It is shown that the system performance degrades slowly, as the number of faulty banks increase, in a memory system using the proposed reconfiguration scheme.
