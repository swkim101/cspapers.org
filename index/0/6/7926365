Our main result is a formulation and proof of the reverse hypercontractive inequality in the sum-of-squares (SOS) proof system. As a consequence we show that for any constant 0 3". Finally, we also give an SOS proof of (a generalization of) the sharp (2, q)-hypercontractive inequality for any even integer q.
