We consider the problem of finding a low discrepancy coloring for sparse set systems where each element lies in at most t sets. We give an efficient algorithm that finds a coloring with discrepancy O((t log n)1/2), matching the best known non-constructive bound for the problem due to Banaszczyk. The previous algorithms only achieved an O(t1/2 log n) bound. Our result also extends to the more general KomloÃÅs setting and gives an algorithmic O(log1/2 n) bound.
