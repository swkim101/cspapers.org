In this special session, members of the ACM Education Board will give information about two current projects in computer science curriculum developments: an update to the CS2001 volume, CS2008, and a new venture, a report on Masters degrees in Computing. Feedback is required on both reports as the CS2008 volume is an interim measure in advance of a more thorough review in due course. The Masters report will be a report on work-in-progress and feedback on the current progress and the project goals will be welcome.
