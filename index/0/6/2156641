We identify a new and important global (or nonbinary) constraint which ensures that the values taken by two vectors of variables, when viewed as multisets, are ordered. This constraint is useful for a number of different applications including breaking symmetry and fuzzy constraint satisfaction. We propose and implement a linear time algorithm for enforcing generalised arc-consistency on such a multiset ordering constraint. Experimental results show considerable promise.
