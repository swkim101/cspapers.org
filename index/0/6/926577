The authors propose a control/command scheme for the quadruped robot RALPHY (French acronym for legged robot with pneumatic actuators) which takes into account both dynamical and real time aspects as well as theoretical and practical approaches. They decompose the dynamic model for the whole robot into two parts in order to distribute hierarchically the tasks to be realized as much as possible. In this architecture, the lowest level (leg level) is assigned to command the leg movements through a leg inverse dynamic model computation. At an upper level (coordinator level), the control of the platform is handled by the leg-to-platform interaction model computation. The behavior of the robot is simulated.
