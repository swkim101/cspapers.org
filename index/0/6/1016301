Vectorless integrity verification is becoming increasingly critical to robust design of nanoscale power delivery networks (PDNs). To dramatically improve efficiency and capability of vectorless integrity verifications, this paper introduces a scalable multilevel integrity verification framework by leveraging a hierarchy of almost linear-sized spectral power grid sparsifiers that can well retain effective resistances between nodes, as well as a recent graph-theoretic algebraic multigrid (AMG) algorithmic framework. As a result, vectorless integrity verification solution obtained on coarse level problems can effectively help find the solution of the original problem. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed vectorless verification framework can always efficiently and accurately obtain worst-case scenarios in even very large power grid designs.
