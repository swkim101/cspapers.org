In this paper, we address issues related to sharing information in a distributed system consisting of autonomous entities, each of which holds a private database. Semi-honest behavior has been widely adopted as the model for adversarial threats. However, it substantially underestimates the capability of adversaries in reality. In this paper, we consider a threat space containing more powerful adversaries that includes not only semi-honest but also those malicious adversaries. In particular, we classify malicious adversaries into two widely existing subclasses, called weakly malicious and strongly malicious adversaries, respectively. We define a measure of privacy leakage for information sharing systems and propose protocols that can effectively and efficiently protect privacy against different kinds of malicious adversaries.
