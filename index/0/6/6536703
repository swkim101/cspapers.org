What determines the caliber of axonal branches? We pursue the hypothesis that the axonal caliber has evolved to minimize signal propagation delays, while keeping arbor volume to a minimum. We show that for a general cost function the optimal diameters of mother (d0) and daughter (d1, d2) branches at a bifurcation obey a branching law: d0v+2 + d2v+2. The derivation relies on the fact that the conduction speed scales with the axon diameter to the power v (v = 1 for myelinated axons and v = 0.5 for non-myelinated axons). We test the branching law on the available experimental data and find a reasonable agreement.
