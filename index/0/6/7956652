This paper presents a novel quadrotor UAV attitude control algorithm to realize complex acrobatic UAV maneuvers. A nonlinear dynamic model based on the exponential coordinates parametrization of rotation is proposed. By analysing the model using Lie Group and Lie Algebra theory, cascaded linear PID controllers are designed. To further improve the controller performance, PID controllers are augmented with smith predictor and rotational trajectory planner. The experiments conducted on a real quadrotor show that our control algorithm surpasses most known quadrotor controllers.
