This paper presents a novel Hidden Markov Model architecture to model the joint probability of pairs of asynchronous sequences describing the same event. It is based on two other Markovian models, namely Asynchronous Input/Output Hidden Markov Models and Pair Hidden Markov Models. An EM algorithm to train the model is presented, as well as a Viterbi decoder that can be used to obtain the optimal state sequence as well as the alignment between the two sequences. The model has been tested on an audio-visual speech recognition task using the M2VTS database and yielded robust performances under various noise conditions.
