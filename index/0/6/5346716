The Web has a long history of Web mapping, being originally described at the first WWW Conference in 1994. Web maps have evolved significantly since then, and patterns have developed. The patterns of modern Web mapping underlie mapping programs across economic sectors. Key issues which remain are that Web standards do not directly address the needs of mapping, and Web mapping standards do not rely on Web architecture. As a result of this lack of collaboration, Web mapping and Web standards continue to evolve independently, with little coordination based on a broader interest. This has led to a situation where newcomers to Web mapping are faced with the problem as to what technologies to use for creating and publishing Web maps, of which the unintended consequence is increasing centralization of Web mapping. This paper documents the results of design and development done by Natural Resources Canada within the scope of the Maps For HTML Community Group. A declarative Web map extension to the HTML standard is proposed, together with a new supporting hypermedia type. Taken together, the proposed standards will progressively support simple to advanced Web map applications, including considerations of layers, projections and feature styling. If widely implemented, the proposed Web standards could help realize the value of the substantial investments in spatial data across all sectors of society. The paper concludes with several propositions drawn from the discussion, and proposed actions to be undertaken by the Maps for HTML Community Group, in which the reader is invited to participate.
