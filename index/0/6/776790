We describe GalaTex, the first complete implementation of XQuery Full-Text, a W3C specification that extends XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 with full-text search. XQuery Full-Text provides composable full-text search primitives such as keyword search, Boolean queries, and keyword-distance predicates. GalaTex is intended to serve as a reference implementation for XQuery Full-Text and as a platform for addressing new research problems such as scoring full-text query results, optimizing XML queries over both structure and text, and evaluating top-k queries on scored results. GalaTex is an all-XQuery implementation initially focused on completeness and conformance rather than on efficiency. We describe its implementation on top of Galax, a complete XQuery implementation.
