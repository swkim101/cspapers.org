If we compare with "The Printing Revolution", and "Modern Science and Engineering in the Physical World", then we have to conclude that the computer versions of these haven't happened yet. The printing revolution was not the hardware technology that allowed the automation of hand written texts such as bibles, but a much longer learning curve that brought about new ways to think and argue, culminating in the 17th century with new ways to understand the physical and political universes in which humans live. This created our modern world. By contrast we are still generally "automating bibles" with computers and the "new ways to think and argue" are still being invented and haven't reached most computer users. Similarly, if we compare the state of software building against modern engineering - such as the building of the Empire State Building in New York City from scratch in less than one year with less than 3000 coordinated workers - then we can hardly claim "software engineering" to be much past ancient Egyptian pyramid building: millions of lines of code-bricks piled on top of each other with little coordination or discernable architecture.A science is generally about finding better models about structures in the universe. As Simon pointed out, ours is a "science of the artificial" like a "science of bridges". We first have to make structures and then study them to create better theories. We might claim that McCarthy's LISP-in-itself as a kind of "Maxwell's Equations", but we still lack the equivalent "Special Theory" that includes the handling of time in a reasonable and useful way. The immense commercialization of computing that happened in the 80s and 90s disrupted much of the progress in each of these areas, especially in the US. It's now time to ask again what these three ideas should mean, and then get back to the real work of advancing our field and making the real computer revolution happen.
