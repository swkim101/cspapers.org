Design by Contract (DBC) and runtime enforcement of program assertions enables the construction of more robust software. It also enables the assignment of blame in error reporting. As of yet, no AOP implementation for the provision of DBC exists. We present an aspect-oriented DBC tool for Java named <i>Cona</i>. We also extend the use of DBC and assertions to AOP. Aspects are used in the implementation of contracts, and contracts are used for enforcing assertions on aspects.
