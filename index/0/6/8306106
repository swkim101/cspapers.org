This paper concerns the stability analysis of image-based visual servoing methods with respect to uncertainties on the 3D parameters introduced in the central catadioptric interaction matrix. Motivated by the growing interest for omnidirectional sensors on robotic applications and particularly on vision-based control, we extend recent results obtained for conventional cameras to the entire class of central catadioptric systems. In this paper, it is shown that with such sensors extreme care must be taken when approximating 3D parameters to ensure stability of the image based control law.
