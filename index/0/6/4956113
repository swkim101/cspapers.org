As the capability of robots is getting improved, more various tasks are expected to be performed by the robots. Complex operation of the robots can be composed of many different tasks. These tasks are executed sequentially, simultaneously, or in a combined way of both. This paper discusses the transition issue among multiple tasks on how the transition can be effectively and smoothly achieved. The proposed approach is to compose intermediate desired values to smooth the transitions rather than to modify control laws. The approach can be practically used on robotic systems without modification on their specific control algorithms. In this paper, multi-points control and joint limit avoidance are performed as applications of the proposed approach.
