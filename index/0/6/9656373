A model for verification and testing in an object-oriented CS2 course is presented. The model has four stages—two for verification and two for testing—at which student progress is evaluated. Students thereby see verification and testing as integral parts of the programming process, rather than as addenda. The impact of this model on students' programming behavior is discussed.
