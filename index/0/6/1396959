We present two centralized algorithms that dynamically deform the topology of a multi-hop wireless network in response to changing traffic conditions, so as to reduce the end-to-end packet delay. These algorithms operate by reducing an easily calculable traffic-and-topology-dependent metric that has strong positive correlation to the mean end-to-end network delay. This makes it possible to change the network topology in real time. The first algorithm involves moving existing nodes to create new links, while the second involves adding a new node to the existing network. The new links are added judiciously between nodes with the most traffic fluctuations, in a way that often decreases the total number of network links. Multiple simulations on the original and the deformed networks using the \ns simulator demonstrate that the reductions in end-to-end delay are significantly higher than with the alternative approach of increasing the capacities of the most congested links.
