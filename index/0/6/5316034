We present a path planning method for autonomous underwater vehicles in order to maximize mutual information. We adapt a method previously used for surface vehicles, and extend it to deal with the unique characteristics of underwater vehicles. We show how to generate near-optimal paths while ensuring that the vehicle stays out of high-traffic areas during predesignated time intervals. In our objective function we explicitly account for the fact that underwater vehicles typically take measurements while moving, and that they do not have the ability to communicate until they resurface. We present field results from ocean trials on planning paths for a specific AUV, an underwater glider.
