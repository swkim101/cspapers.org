The goal of predicting query potential for personalization is to determine which queries can benefit from personalization. In this paper, we investigate which kind of strategy is better for this task: classification or regression. We quantify the potential benefits of personalizing search results using two implicit click-based measures: Click entropy and Potential@N. Meanwhile, queries are characterized by query features and history features. Then we build C-SVM classification model and epsilon-SVM regression model respectively according to these two measures. The experimental results show that the classification model is a better choice for predicting query potential for personalization.
