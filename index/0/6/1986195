Three-dimensional VLSI (in short, 3-D VLSI) is a new device technology that is expected to realize high performance systems. In this paper, we propose an image processing architecture based on 3-D VLSI consisting of optically-connected layers. Since the optical inter-layer connection seems to have some of useful functions due to isotropic radiation of the light, we algebraicly formulate them as the picture processing operators. Moreover, we show that the operators are available for applications such as template matching. The availability of a proposed template matching algorithm is verified by simulation.
