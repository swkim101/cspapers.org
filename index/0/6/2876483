In this paper, we present MO-SLAM, a novel visual SLAM system that is capable of detecting duplicate objects in the scene during run-time without requiring an offline training stage to pre-populate a database of objects. Instead, we propose a novel method to detect landmarks that belong to duplicate objects. Further, we show how landmarks belonging to duplicate objects can be converted to first-order entities which generate additional constraints for optimizing the map. We evaluate the performance of MO-SLAM with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data, where the experimental results verify the capabilities of MO-SLAM in detecting duplicate objects and using these constraints to improve the accuracy of the map.
