In the present study, we introduce a simple iterative procedure that allows to correct the outputs of a classifier with respect to the new a priori probabilities of a new data set to be scored, even when these new a priori probabilities are unknown in advance. We also show that a significant increase in classification accuracy can be observed when using this procedure properly. More specifically, by applying the correcting procedure to the outputs of a simple logistic regression model, we observe an increase of 5.8% of classification rate on a difficult real-world multi-class problem – the automatic labeling of geographical maps based on remote sensing information. Moreover, the resulting classifier – the logistic regression model whose outputs have been adjusted according to our procedure – outperformed by more that 4% all of our previous models in terms of classification accuracy, including Bagfs (a multiple classifier system based on C4.5 decision trees), the best obtained model up-to-now.
