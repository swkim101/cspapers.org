We describe a novel neural network architecture for the problem of semantic role labeling . Many current solutions are complicated, consist of several stages and hand-built features, and are too slow to be applied as part of real applications that require such semantic labels, partly because of their use of a syntactic parser (Pradhan et al., 2004; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). Our method instead learns a direct mapping from source sentence to semantic tags for a given predicate without the aid of a parser or a chun-ker. Our resulting system obtains accuracies comparable to the current state-of-the-art at a fraction of the computational cost.
