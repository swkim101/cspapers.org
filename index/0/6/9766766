Canetti's universal composition theorem and the joint state composition theorems by Canetti and Rabin are useful and widely employed tools for the modular design and analysis of cryptographic protocols. However, these theorems assume that parties participating in a protocol session have pre-established a unique session ID (SID). While the use of such SIDs is a good design principle, existing protocols, in particular real-world security protocols, typically do not use pre-established SIDs, at least not explicitly and not in the particular way stipulated by the theorems. As a result, the composition theorems cannot be applied for analyzing such protocols in a modular and faithful way. In this paper, we therefore present universal and joint state composition theorems which do not assume pre-established SIDs. In our joint state composition theorem, the joint state is an ideal functionality which supports several cryptographic operations, including public-key encryption, (authenticated and unauthenticated) symmetric encryption, MACs, digital signatures, and key derivation. This functionality has recently been proposed by KÃ¼sters and Tuengerthal and has been shown to be realizable under standard cryptographic assumptions and for a reasonable class of environments. We demonstrate the usefulness of our composition theorems by several case studies on real-world security protocols, including IEEE 802.11i, SSL/TLS, SSH, IPsec, and EAP-PSK. While our applications focus on real-world security protocols, our theorems, models, and techniques should be useful beyond this domain.
