The explosion of the World Wide Web has facilitated the proliferation of digital image repositories and has exponentially increased the access to collections of digitized images. As a result image management and retrieval has attracted increased attention. In addition, an increasing number of image collections are being digitized and made available for retrieval by end subjects. Early research pointed to the need for textual description in combination with visual resource browsing tools [1][9]. Today, much research is focused on the technical aspects of image indexing and retrieval, using a variety of approaches with algorithms, e.g., [3][7], and AI techniques, e.g., [11]. Some approaches are based on the images themselves (content-based retrieval) and others on the text in images or around images (concept-based retrieval).
