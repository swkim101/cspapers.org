Do continuous word embeddings encode any useful information for constituency parsing? We isolate three ways in which word embeddings might augment a stateof-the-art statistical parser: by connecting out-of-vocabulary words to known ones, by encouraging common behavior among related in-vocabulary words, and by directly providing features for the lexicon. We test each of these hypotheses with a targeted change to a state-of-the-art baseline. Despite small gains on extremely small supervised training sets, we find that extra information from embeddings appears to make little or no difference to a parser with adequate training data. Our results support an overall hypothesis that word embeddings import syntactic information that is ultimately redundant with distinctions learned from treebanks in other ways.
