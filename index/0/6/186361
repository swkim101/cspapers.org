A new type of continuum manipulator is presented, in which the body of the device is made up of identical, repeated interlocking fibers. A working prototype is demonstrated. Basic models describing the kinematics and mechanical properties of the device are developed, and their predictions are compared with the performance of the physical prototype. Advantages of the interlocking design include improved strength due to better load distribution, controllable stiffness, and a large open lumen.
