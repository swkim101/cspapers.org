This BOF is a venue for presentations and discussions of progress in the dual problems of evaluating the performance (including reliability) of petascale computing systems and of developing application codes that scale to run effectively on such systems. We therefore invite participation by representatives of large-system vendors, funding agencies, infrastructure operators, appplication-development groups, and others that have a stake in design, operation, and successful use of these systems.Technical topics to be addressed include: scaling properties of benchmark suites; scalable machine models; application modeling to predict scaling for future machines; the problem of preparing applications for petascale environments; and the role of all of these topics in petascale acquisitions.At this session we will start planning for a series of workshops on the subject.
