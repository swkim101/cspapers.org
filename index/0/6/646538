In order to perform activities of daily living (ADL), a person with an amputation(s) must use a greater than normal range of movement from other anatomical body joints to compensate for the loss of movement caused by the amputation, this is called compensatory motion. By studying the compensatory motion of prosthetic users the mechanics of how they adapt to the loss of range of motion in a given limb for can be analyzed for select tasks. The purpose of this study is to create a robotic based kinematic model that can simulate the compensatory motion of a given task using given subject data. This paper reviews the use of the model to simulate compensatory motion of a transradial amputee performing two bilateral tasks: turning a steering wheel, and lifting a box. The simulation operates by changing a set of prosthetic configurations that are represented by parameters that consist of the joint degrees of freedom (DoF) provided by each prosthesis in the set. The task information is inputted into the model by defining a trajectory which the hand or prosthesis must follow to perform the task. The inclusion of the ability to model bilateral tasks is accomplished by giving control of the proximal joints to the prosthetic side. Analysis of tasks is completed by running the simulation with prosthetic and anatomical constraints attached to the left arm of the model, the right arm maintains an anatomical configuration. By running the model through this simulation the compensatory motions can be determined. Results obtained from the model can be used to select the best prosthesis for a given user, design prostheses that are more effective at selected tasks, further analyze previous studies, or to determine areas of interest for further human study.
