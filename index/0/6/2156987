An important problem in computer vision, that of edge linking for contour or line drawing extraction, is approached from the point of view of a graph labeling problem. A Lagrange dual approach to an integer programming formulation of this problem will be presented. Although the inherent complexity of the problem will not be reduced, the techniques presented below will allow for a partial decomposition of the solution algorithm. Furthermore, the approach which will be presented appears to have certain advantages over existing line tracking and graph searching algorithms.
