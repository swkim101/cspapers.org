This paper presents the architecture and configuration of the Human Information Workspace (HI-Space) interaction environment. HI-Space is a projector-camera-microphone system that recognizes gesture, object and speech input. The system creates input stream events and uses HI-Space aware interface components allowing the creation of independent applications through an API. To help understand performance characteristics of HI-Space, a procedure is presented that was used to determine the total system lag of the HI-Space to be 71 ms with an 11 ms standard deviation. A study is also presented that directly compares HI-Space and a mouse in the task of acquiring stationary targets. The study shows that users can acquire targets faster and just as accurately on the HI-Space system. Finally, an example application to support analysis of 3D biological data sets is discussed. The application is an ongoing research effort to explore complex interface design using the HI-Space architecture.
