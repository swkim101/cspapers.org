The main goal of this paper is to give an O(nlog3 n) time deterministic algorithm for the the Subset Matching problem. This immediately yields an algorithm of the same efficiency for the Tree Pattern Matching problem. We also give an O(n log3 n/ log log n) time randomized algorithm for these problems. Finally, we give a O(nlog n(z + logn)) time deterministic algorithm for a useful specialization of the Subset Matching problem in which all sets are intervals of a given length Z.
