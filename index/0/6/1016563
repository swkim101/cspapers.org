We define semi-valid input coverage (SVCov), the first coverage criterion for fuzz testing. Our criterion is applicable whenever the valid inputs can be defined by a finite set of constraints. SVCov measures to what extent the tests cover the domain of semi-valid inputs, where an input is semi-valid if and only if it satisfies all the constraints but one. We demonstrate SVCov's practical value in a case study on fuzz testing the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE). Our study shows that it is feasible to precisely define and efficiently measure SVCov. Moreover, SVCov provides essential information for improving the effectiveness of fuzz testing and enhancing fuzz-testing tools and libraries. In particular, by increasing coverage under SVCov, we have discovered a previously unknown vulnerability in a mature IKE implementation.
