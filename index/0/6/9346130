High precision at the top ranks has become a new focus of research in information retrieval. This paper presents the multiple nested ranker approach that improves the accuracy at the top ranks by iteratively re-ranking the top scoring documents. At each iteration, this approach uses the RankNet learning algorithm to re-rank a subset of the results. This splits the problem into smaller and easier tasks and generates a new distribution of the results to be learned by the algorithm. We evaluate this approach using different settings on a data set labeled with several degrees of relevance. We use the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) to measure the performance because it depends not only on the position but also on the relevance score of the document in the ranked list. Our experiments show that making the learning algorithm concentrate on the top scoring results improves precision at the top ten documents in terms of the NDCG score.
