Change impact analysis (CIA) techniques have been applied successfully to determine the effects of modifications when evolving software systems. However, many software systems today use multiple programming languages and they are organized as software product lines (SPLs) to ease their customization to different customer and market needs. Due to the limitations of current CIA approaches regarding variability and cross-language support assessing the impact of changes becomes difficult and arduous. This work aims at developing a CIA approach for multi language SPLs. The approach is based on a multiple conditional system dependency graphs. We will evaluate the approach based on the software product lines of an industry partner in the domain of industrial automation.
