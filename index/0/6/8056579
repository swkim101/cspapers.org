We demonstrate the Search Computing framework for multi-domain queries upon ranked data collected from Web sources. Search Computing answers to queries like "Find a good Jazz concert close to a specified location, a good restaurant and a hotel at walking distance" and fills the gap between generic and domain-specific search engines, by proposing new methods, techniques, interfaces, and tools for building search-based applications spanning multiple data services. The main enabling technology is an execution engine supporting methods for rank-join execution upon ranked data sources, abstracted and wrapped by means of a unifying service model. The demo walks through the interface for formulating multi-domain queries and follows the steps of the query engine that builds the result, with the help of run-time monitors that clearly explain the system's behavior. Once results are extracted, the demonstration shows several approaches for visualizing results and exploring the information space.
