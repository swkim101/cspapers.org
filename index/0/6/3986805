Location-based Access Control (LBAC) techniques allow taking users' physical location into account when determining their access privileges. In this paper, we present an approach to LBAC aimed at integrating location-based conditions along with a generic access control model, so that a requestor can be granted or denied access by checking her location as well as her credentials. Our LBAC model includes a novel way of taking into account the limitations of the technology used to ascertain the location of the requester. Namely, we describe how location verification can be encapsulated as a service, representing location technologies underlying it in terms of two semantically uniform service level agreement (SLA) parameters called confidence and timeout. Based on these parameters, we present the formal definition of a number of location-based predicates, their management, evaluation, and enforcement. The challenges that such an extension to traditional access control policies inevitably carries are discussed also with reference to detailed examples of LBAC policies.
