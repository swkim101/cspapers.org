This paper presents the development of a new compact soft actuation unit intended to be used in multi degree of freedom and small scale robotic systems such as the child humanoid robot “iCub” [1]. Compared to the other existing series elastic linear or rotary implementations the proposed design shows high integration density and wider passive deflection. The miniaturization of the newly developed high performance unit was achieved with a use of a new rotary spring module based on a novel arrangement of linear springs.
