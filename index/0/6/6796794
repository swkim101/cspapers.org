Systematic large-scale modification of source code is tedious and error-prone, because developers use authoring and editing tools poorly suited to the program maintenance task. We combine the results from psychology of programming, software visualization, program analysis, and program transformation fields to create a novel environment that lets the programmers express operations on program source code at a level above text-oriented editing.
