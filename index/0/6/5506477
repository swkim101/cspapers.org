The Cedar project was officially started in 1984 following many years of research by our group in parallelizing compilers, parallel algorithms, and vector and multiprocessor architecture. At the time, multiprocessing was not universally accepted as a way to speed up the execution of a single program. The primary goal of the Cedar project was to “demonstrate that the supercomputers of the future can exhibit the general-purpose behavior and be easy to use” ‘. We felt that major advances in the state of hardware technology, architecture, compilers, and parallel algorithms made such a demonstration possible. A two-phase approach was advocated: the construction of a 32processor prototype followed by a production system with thousands of processors. We stated that “the prototype design must include the details of scaling the prototype up to a larger, faster production system”. Both “architectural and technological upward” scalability was required. Another goal was to have the prototype “achieve Cray-1 speeds for programs written in high-level languages and automatically restructured” by a compiler. Finally, “an integral part of the design... was to allow multiprogramming”.
