The class PTAS is defined to consist of all NP optimization problems that permit polynomial-time approximation schemes. This paper explores the possibility that a core of PTAS may be characterized through syntactic classes endowed with restrictions on the structure of the input instances. Recent work in approximability of NP-hard problems has led to the identification of a syntactic class called MAX SNP as the core of APX, the class of constant-factor approximable NP optimization problems. This has enhanced our understanding of these classes from both an algorithmic and a complexity-theoretic point of view. Our work is motivated by the hope that a similar understanding can be attained for PTAS. We argue that while the core of APX is the purely syntactic class MAX SNP, in the case of PTAS we must identify the core in terms of syntactic prescriptions for the problem definition augmented with structural restrictions on the input instances. Specifically, we propose such a unified framework based on syntactic classes restricted to instances exhibiting a planar structure. A variety of known and some new results follow directly from this framework, thereby lending credence to our hypothesis that there exists some common structural underpinnings for problems in PTAS.
