We present CellIQ, a real-time cellular network analytics system that supports rich and sophisticated analysis tasks. CellIQ is motivated by the lack of support for realtime analytics or advanced tasks such as spatio-temporal traffic hotspots and handoff sequences with performance problems in state-of-the-art systems, and the interest in such tasks by network operators. CellIQ represents cellular network data as a stream of domain specific graphs, each from a batch of data. Leveraging domain specific characteristics--the spatial and temporal locality of cellular network data--CellIQ presents a number of optimizations including geo-partitioning of input data, radius-based message broadcast, and incremental graph updates to support efficient analysis. Using data from a live cellular network and representative analytic tasks, we demonstrate that CellIQ enables fast and efficient cellular network analytics--compared to an implementation without cellular specific operators, CellIQ is 2× to 5× faster.
