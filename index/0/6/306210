We consider the problem of learning the preferences of a heterogeneous population by observing choices from an assortment of products, ads, or other offerings. Our observation model takes a form common in assortment planning applications: each arriving customer is offered an assortment consisting of a subset of all possible offerings; we observe only the assortment and the customer's single choice. In this paper we propose a mixture choice model with a natural underlying low-dimensional structure, and show how to estimate its parameters. In our model, the preferences of each customer or segment follow a separate parametric choice model, but the underlying structure of these parameters over all the models has low dimension. We show that a nuclear-norm regularized maximum likelihood estimator can learn the preferences of all customers using a number of observations much smaller than the number of item-customer combinations. This result shows the potential for structural assumptions to speed up learning and improve revenues in assortment planning and customization. We provide a specialized factored gradient descent algorithm and study the success of the approach empirically.
