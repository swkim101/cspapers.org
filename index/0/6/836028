Divide-and-conquer algorithms are suitable for modern parallel machines, tending to have large amounts of inherent parallelism and working well with caches and deep memory hierarchies. Among others, list homomorphisms are a class of recursive functions on lists, which match very well with the divide-and-conquer paradigm. However, direct programming with list homomorphisms is a challenge for many programmers. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel systemthat can automatically derive cost-optimal list homomorphisms from a pair of sequential programs, based on the third homomorphism theorem. Our idea is to reduce extraction of list homomorphisms to derivation of weak right inverses. We show that a weak right inverse always exists and can be automatically generated from a wide class of sequential programs. We demonstrate our system with several nontrivial examples, including the maximum prefix sum problem, the prefix sum computation, the maximum segment sum problem, and the line-of-sight problem. The experimental results show practical efficiency of our automatic parallelization algorithm and good speedups of the generated parallel programs.
