Smart phones provide a convenient platform for social applications with their rich set of sensors and communication interfaces, and have become an integral part of our daily lives. In Genius-on-the-Go, we hope to explore a new social sharing mechanism for mobile users based on proximity. Our key contribution is an efficient discovery layer, and enabling interactions with nearby devices using FM radio. But since current mobile phones do not export radio drivers that support transmit mode (even though most hardware chips are already capable of), we designed a custom accessory incorporating an FM chip and communicating with the phone via the headphone jack. Using this accessory, we demonstrate efficient discovery and communication between nearby smart phones, and show an mobile-DJ application built on top.
