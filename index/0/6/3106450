We propose a method for simultaneously translating from a single source language to multiple target languages T1, T2, etc. The motivation behind this method is that if we only have a weak language model for T1 and translations in T1 and T2 are associated, we can use the information from a strong language model over T2 to disambiguate the translations in T1, providing better translation results. As a specific framework to realize multi-target translation, we expand the formalism of synchronous context-free grammars to handle multiple targets, and describe methods for rule extraction, scoring, pruning, and search with these models. Experiments find that multi-target translation with a strong language model in a similar second target language can provide gains of up to 0.8-1.5 BLEU points. 1
