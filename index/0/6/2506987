IP network operators collect aggregate traffic statistics on network interfaces via the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). This is part of routine network operations for most ISPs; it involves a large infrastructure with multiple network management stations polling information from all the network elements and collating a real time data feed. This demo will present a tool that manages the live SNMP data feed on a fully operational large ISP at industry scale. The tool primarily serves to study correlations in the network traffic, by providing a rich mix of ad-hoc querying based on a user-friendly correlation interface and as well as canned queries, based on the expertise of the network operators with field experience. The tool is called IPSOFACTO for IP Stream-Oriented FAst Correlation TOol.
