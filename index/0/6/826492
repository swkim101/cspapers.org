One of the unique advantages brought by the Semantic Web is that semantic web languages, such as RDF and OWL, offer a small but expressive set of common ontological constructs for agents to share knowledge on the Web. Instead of hard coding knowledge inside intelligent agents, the semantic web enables agents to publish and consume knowledge explicitly stored in web documents. The utility of the Semantic Web can be evaluated from three equally important aspects: availability – is there enough useful data, accessibility – can users ﬁnd the data they need, and quality – can users evaluate data quality to select good information.
