Estimating the number of distinct values is a wellstudied problem, due to its frequent occurrence in queries and its importance in selecting good query plans. Previous work has shown powerful negative results on the quality of distinct-values estimates based on sampling (or other techniques that examine only part of the input data). We present an approach, called distinct sampling, that collects a specially tailored sample over the distinct values in the input, in a single scan of the data. In contrast to the previous negative results, our small Distinct Samples are guaranteed to accurately estimate the number of distinct values. The samples can be incrementally maintained up-to-date in the presence of data insertions and deletions, with minimal time and memory overheads, so that the full scan may be performed only once. Moreover, a stored Distinct Sample can be used to accurately estimate the number of distinct values within any range specified by the query, or within any other subset of the data satisfying a query predicate. We present an extensive experimental study of distinct sampling. Using synthetic and real-world data sets, we show that distinct sampling gives distinct-values estimates to within 0%‐10% relative error, whereas previous methods typically incur 50%‐250% relative error. Next, we show how distinct sampling can provide fast, highlyaccurate approximate answers for “report” queries in high-volume, session-based event recording environments, such as IP networks, customer service call centers, etc. For a commercial call center environment, we show that a 1% Distinct Sample
