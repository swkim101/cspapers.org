Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud platforms rent resources, in the form of virtual machines (VMs), under a variety of contract terms that offer different levels of risk and cost. For example, users may acquire VMs in the spot market that are often cheap but entail significant risk, since their price varies over time based on market supply and demand and they may terminate at any time if the price rises too high. Currently, users must manage all the risks associated with using spot servers. As a result, conventional wisdom holds that spot servers are only appropriate for delay-tolerant batch applications. In this paper, we propose a derivative cloud platform, called SpotCheck, that transparently manages the risks associated with using spot servers for users. SpotCheck provides the illusion of an IaaS platform that offers always-available VMs on demand for a cost near that of spot servers, and supports all types of applications, including interactive ones. SpotCheck's design combines the use of nested VMs with live bounded-time migration and novel server pool management policies to maximize availability, while balancing risk and cost. We implement SpotCheck on Amazon's EC2 and show that it i) provides nested VMs to users that are 99.9989% available, ii) achieves nearly 5x cost savings compared to using equivalent types of on-demand VMs, and iii) eliminates any risk of losing VM state.
