About forty years ago, Ford and Fulkerson studied maximum 'dynamic' s-t-flows in networks with fixed transit times on the edges and a fixed time horizon. They showed that there always exists an optimal solution which sends flow on certain s-t-paths at a constant rate as long as there is enough time left for the flow along a path to arrive at the sink.Although this result does not hold for the more general setting of flows over time with load-dependent transit times on the edges, we prove that there always exists a provably good solution of this structure. Moreover, such a solution can be determined very efficiently by only one minimum convex cost flow computation on the underlying 'static' network. Finally, we show that the time-dependent flow problem under consideration is NP-hard and even cannot be approximated with arbitrary precision in polynomial time, unless P=NP.
