We present RoSeS, a running system for large-scale content-based RSS feed filtering and aggregation. The implementation of RoSeS is based on standard database concepts like declarative query languages, views and multi-query optimization. Users create personalized feeds by defining and composing content-based filtering and aggregation queries on collections of RSS feeds. These queries are translated into continuous multi-query execution plans which are optimized using a new cost-based multi-query optimization strategy.
