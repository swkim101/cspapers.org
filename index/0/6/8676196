This paper describes a procedure for generating close-to-functional broadside tests for transition faults. Such tests avoid overtesting of transition faults and keep the power dissipation within its functional bounds. The procedure has the following features that are not addressed together by existing procedures. (1) The procedure takes into consideration functional constraints on primary input sequences of a circuit that is embedded in a larger design. (2) It generates close-to-functional broadside tests with a measurable proximity to functional operation conditions. (3) It generates tests with equal primary input vectors that are suitable for embedded circuits as well as low-cost testers. Several experimental observations help in addressing the challenge of generating close-to-functional broadside tests with equal primary input vectors under functional constraints on primary input sequences.
