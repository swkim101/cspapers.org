This paper presents a highly efficient and accurate link-quality measurement framework, called EAR (Efficient and Accurate link-quality monitoR), for multi-hop wireless mesh networks, that has several salient features. First, it exploits three complementary measurement schemes: passive, cooperative, and active monitoring. EAR maximizes the measurement accuracy by (i) dynamically and adaptively adopting one of these schemes and (ii) opportunistically exploiting the  nicast application traffic present in the network, while minimizing the measurement overhead. Second, EAR effectively identifies the existence of wireless link asymmetry by measuring the quality of each link in both directions of the link, thus improving the utilization of network capacity by up to 114%. Finally, its reliance on both the network layer and the IEEE 802.11-based device driver solutions makes EAR easily deployable in existing multi-hop wireless mesh networks without system recompilation or MAC firmware modification. EAR has been evaluated extensively via both ns-2-based simulation and experimentation on our Linux-based implementation. Both simulation and experimentation results have shown EAR to provide highly accurate link-quality measurements with minimum overhead.
