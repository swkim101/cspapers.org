This paper is about camera-only localisation in challenging outdoor environments, where changes in lighting, weather and season cause traditional localisation systems to fail. Conventional approaches to the localisation problem rely on point-features such as SIFT, SURF or BRIEF to associate landmark observations in the live image with landmarks stored in the map; however, these features are brittle to the severe appearance change routinely encountered in outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose an alternative to traditional point-features: we train place-specific linear SVM classifiers to recognise distinctive elements in the environment. The core contribution of this paper is an unsupervised mining algorithm which operates on a single mapping dataset to extract distinct elements from the environment for localisation. We evaluate our system on 205km of data collected from central Oxford over a period of six months in bright sun, night, rain, snow and at all times of the day. Our experiment consists of a comprehensive N-vs-N analysis on 22 laps of the approximately 10km route in central Oxford. With our proposed system, the portion of the route where localisation fails is reduced by a factor of 6, from 33.3% to 5.5%.
