Security and privacy in smartphones and mobile devices is an emerging area which has received significant attention from the research community during the past few years. The SPSM workshop was created to bring together these researchers and practitioners. Following the success of the two previous editions, we present this third edition of the workshop which has attracted significantly more submissions and benefited from the expertise of an expanded international program committee.
