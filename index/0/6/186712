Motivated by a question from [6], we investigate the number of queries required for testing that an input graph G is isomorphic to a graph H that is given in advance. Our main result is that the more "complex" H is, the more queries it takes to test an input graph G for the property of being isomorphic to H. This is provided in terms of an upper bound and a lower bound on the number of queries, giving a relation between this number and a natural measure of the complexity of H.
