Rapid pervasion of the web into users' daily lives has put much importance on capturing location-specific information on the web, due to the fact that most human activities occur locally around where a user is located. This is especially true in the increasingly popular mobile and local search environments. Thus, how to correctly and effectively detect locations from web resources has become a key challenge to location-based web applications. In this paper, we first explicitly distinguish the locations of web resources into three types to cater to different application needs: 1) provider location; 2) content location; and 3) serving location. Then we describe a unified system that computes each of the three locations, employing a set of algorithms and different geographic sources.
