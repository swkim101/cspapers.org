Given a graph <i>G</i> = (<i>V, E</i>), a set of terminals <i>T âŠ† V</i>, and a metric <i>D</i> on <i>T</i>, the <i>0-extension problem</i> is to assign vertices in <i>V</i> to terminals, so that the sum, over all edges <i>e</i>, of the distance (under D) between the terminals to which the end points of <i>e</i> are assigned, is minimized. This problem was first studied by Karzanov. Calinescu, Karloff and Rabani gave an <i>O</i>(log<i>k</i>) approximation algorithm based on a linear programming relaxation for the problem, where <i>k</i> is the number of terminals. We improve on this bound, and give an <i>O</i>(log <i>k</i>/log log <i>k</i>) approximation algorithm for the problem.
