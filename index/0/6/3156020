AZIMUT is a mobile robotic platform that combines wheels, legs and tracks to move in three-dimensional environments. The robot is symmetrical and is made of four independent leg-track-wheel articulations. It can move with its articulations up, down or straight, or to move sideways without changing the robot's orientation. To validate the concept, the first prototype developed measures 70.5 cm/spl times/70.5 cm with the articulations up. It has a body clearance of 8.4 cm to 40.6 cm depending on the position of the articulations. The design of the robot is highly modular, with distributed embedded systems to control the different components of the robot.
