Many applications in text processing require significant human effort for either labeling large document collections (when learning statistical models) or extrapolating rules from them (when using knowledge engineering). In this work, we describe away to reduce this effort, while retaining the methods' accuracy, by constructing a hybrid classifier that utilizes human reasoning over automatically discovered text patterns to complement machine learning. Using a standard sentiment-classification dataset and real customer feedback data, we demonstrate that the resulting technique results in significant reduction of the human effort required to obtain a given classification accuracy. Moreover, the hybrid text classifier also results in a significant boost in accuracy over machine-learning based classifiers when a comparable amount of labeled data is used.
