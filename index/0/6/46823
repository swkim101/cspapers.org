The preferred order of pre-nominal adjectives in English is determined primarily by semantics. Nevertheless, Adjective Ordering (AO) systems do not generally exploit semantic features. This paper describes a system that orders adjectives with significantly above-chance accuracy (73.0%) solely on the basis of semantic features pertaining to the cognitive-semantic dimension of subjectivity. The results indicate that combining such semantic approaches with current methods could result in more accurate and robust AO systems.
