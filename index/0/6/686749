In an out-of-order issue processor, instructions are dynamically reordered and issued to function units in their data-ready order rather than their original program order to achieve high performance. The logic that facilitates dynamic issue is one of the most power-hungry and time-critical components in a typical out-of-order issue processor.This paper develops a cooperative hardware/software technique to reduce complexity and energy consumption of the issue logic. The proposed scheme is based on the observation that not all instructions in a program require the same amount of dynamic reordering. Instructions that belong to basic blocks for which the compiler can perform near-optimal sche- duling do not need any intra-block instruction reordering but require only inter-block instruction overlap. In contrast, blocks where the compiler is limited by artificial dependences and memory misses require both intra-block and inter-block instruction reordering. The proposed Reorder-Sensitive Issue Scheme utilizes a novel compile-time analyzer to evaluate the quality of schedules generated by the static scheduler and to estimate the dynamic reordering requirement of instructions within each basic block. At the micro-architecture-level, we propose a novel issue queue that exploits the varying dynamic scheduling requirement of basic blocks to lower the power dissipation and complexity of the dynamic issue hardware.An evaluation of the technique on several SPEC integer benchmarks indicates that we can reduce the energy consumption in the issue queue on average by 72% with only 5% performance degradation Additionally, the proposed issue hardware is significantly less complex when compared to a conventional monolithic out-of-order issue queue, providing the potential for high clock speeds.
