This paper proposes how to automatically identify Korean comparative sentences from text documents. This paper first investigates many comparative sentences referring to previous studies and then defines a set of comparative keywords from them. A sentence which contains one or more elements of the keyword set is called a comparative-sentence candidate. Finally, we use machine learning techniques to eliminate non-comparative sentences from the candidates. As a result, we achieved significant performance, an F1-score of 88.54%, in our experiments using various web documents.
