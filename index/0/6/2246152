Maintaining a scalable high-performance virtual global address space using distributed memory hardware has proven to be challenging. In this paper we evaluate a new approach for such an active global address space that leverages the capabilities of the network fabric to manage addressing, rather than software at the endpoint hosts. We describe our overall approach, design alternatives, and present initial experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of existing network hardware.
