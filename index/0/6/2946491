Media façades in urban spaces offer great potential for new forms of collaborative multi-user interaction. Beyond interaction, they also allow for connecting people and for triggering social interaction between the different users. We report on our experiences of how simultaneous interaction with a media façade at-a-distance can engage social offline interaction between users. We built an application that allows for simultaneous painting on a façade, and gathered informal feedback during the ARS Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria.
