In this paper, we propose new graph-based data structure and indexing to organize and retrieve video data. Several researches have shown that a graph can be a better candidate for modeling semantically rich and complicated multimedia data. However, there are few methods that consider the temporal feature of video data, which is a distinguishable and representative characteristic when compared with other multimedia (i.e., images). In order to consider the temporal feature effectively and efficiently, we propose a new graph-based data structure called Spatio-Temporal Region Graph (STRG). Unlike existing graph-based data structures which provide only spatial features, the proposed STRG further provides temporal features, which represent temporal relationships among spatial objects. The STRG is decomposed into its subgraphs in which redundant subgraphs are eliminated to reduce the index size and search time, because the computational complexity of graph matching (subgraph isomorphism) is NP-complete. In addition, a new distance measure, called Extended Graph Edit Distance (EGED), is introduced in both non-metric and metric spaces for matching and indexing respectively. Based on STRG and EGED, we propose a new indexing method STRG-Index, which is faster and more accurate since it uses tree structure and clustering algorithm. We compare the STRG-Index with the M-tree, which is a popular tree-based indexing method for multimedia data. The STRG-Index outperforms the M-tree for various query loads in terms of cost and speed.
