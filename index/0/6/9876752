The complexity of medical terminology raises challenges when searching medical records. For example, 'cancer', 'tumour', and 'neoplasms', which are synonyms, may prevent a traditional search system from retrieving relevant records that contain only synonyms of the query terms. Prior works use bag-of-concepts approaches, to deal with this by representing medical terms sharing the same meanings using concepts from medical resources (e.g. MeSH). The relevance scores are then combined with a traditional bag-of-words representation, when inferring the relevance of medical records. Even though the existing approaches are effective, the predicted retrieval effectiveness of either the bag-of-words or bag-of-concepts representation, which may be used to effectively model the score combination and hence improve retrieval performance, is not taken into account. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework that models the importance of the bag-of-words and the bag-of-concepts representations, combining their scores on a per-query basis. Our proposed framework leverages retrieval performance predictors, such as the clarity score and AvIDF, calculated on both representations as learning features. We evaluate our proposed framework using the TREC Medical Records track's test collections. As our proposed framework can significantly outperform an existing approach that linearly merges the relevance scores, we conclude that retrieval performance predictors can be effectively leveraged when combining the relevance scores.
