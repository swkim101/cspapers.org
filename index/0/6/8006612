The key components of feedback control systems -- sensors, actuators, computation, power, and communication -- are continually becoming smaller, lighter, more robust, higher performance, and less expensive. By using appropriate algorithms and system architectures, it is thus becoming possible to "close the loop" on almost any machine, and to create new capabilities that fully exploit their dynamic potential. In this talk I will discuss various projects -- involving mobile robots, flying machines, an autonomous table, and actuated wingsuits -- where these new machine competencies are interfaced with the ultimate dynamic entities: human beings.
