We show that for any ε > 0, a maximum-weight triangle in an undirected graph with <i>n</i> vertices and real weights assigned to vertices can be found in time O(<i>n</i>ω + <i>n</i><sup>2+ε</sup>), where ω is the exponent of fastest matrix multiplication algorithm. By the currently best bound on ω, the running time of our algorithm is O(<i>n</i><sup>2.376</sup>). Our algorithm substantially improves the previous time-bounds for this problem recently established by Vassilevska et al. (STOC 2006, O(<i>n</i><sup>2.688</sup>)) and (ICALP 2006, O(<i>n</i><sup>2.575</sup>)). Its asymptotic time complexity matches that of the fastest known algorithm for finding <i>a</i> triangle (not necessarily a maximum-weight one) in a graph.
 By applying or extending our algorithm, we can also improve the upper bounds on finding a maximum-weight triangle in a sparse graph and on finding a maximum-weight subgraph isomorphic to a fixed graph established in the papers by Vassilevska et al. For example, we can find a maximum-weight triangle in a vertex-weighted graph with <i>m</i> edges in asymptotic time required by the fastest algorithm for finding <i>any</i> triangle in a graph with <i>m</i> edges, i.e., in time O(<i>m</i><sup>1.41</sup>).
