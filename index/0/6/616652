LabPal is a Java library designed to easily create and run experiments on a computer. It provides a user-friendly web console, support for automated plotting, a pause-resume facility, a mechanism for handling data traceability and linking, and the possibility of saving all experiment input and output data in an open format. These functionalities greatly reduce the amount of boilerplate scripting needed to run experiments on a computer, and simplify their re-execution by independent parties.
