The translation of English text into American Sign Language (ASL) animation tests the limits of traditional MT architectural designs. A new semantic representation is proposed that uses virtual reality 3D scene modeling software to produce spatially complex ASL phenomena called "classifier predicates." The model acts as an interlingua within a new multi-pathway MT architecture design that also incorporates transfer and direct approaches into a single system.
