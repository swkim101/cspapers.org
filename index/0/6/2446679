We present a natural language system which summarizes a series of news articles on the same event. It uses summarization operators, identified through empirical analysis of a corpus of news summaries, to group together templates from the output of the systems developed for ARPAâ€™s Message Understanding Conferences. Depending on the available resources (e.g., space), summaries of different length can be produced. Our research also provides a methodological framework for future work on the summarization task and on the evaluation of news summarization systems.
