This goal is attained by developing a representation of information preferences, based on an analysis of user actions while they browse the Info DB. With the help of this representation, the Assistant can filter information according to a particular userâ€™s needs, either by supporting the user while he/she searches the Info DB, or by automatically identifying other information objects that pertain to the user% area of interest.
