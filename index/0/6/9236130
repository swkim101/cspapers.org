We propose a resource allocation model that captures the interaction between legitimate users of a distributed service provisioning system with malicious intruders attempting to disrupt its operation. The system consists of a bank of servers providing service to incoming requests. Malicious intruders generate fake traffic to the servers attempting to degrade service provisioning. Legitimate traffic may be balanced using available mechanisms in order to mitigate the damage from the attack. We characterize the guaranteed region, i.e. the set of legitimate traffic intensities that are sustainable given specific intensities of the fake traffic, under the assumption that the fake traffic is routed using static policies. This assumption will be relaxed, allowing arbitrary routing policies, in the full version of this work.
