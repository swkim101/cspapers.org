A major limiting factor of such logics, however, is their Boolean satisfaction condition. To relax this limitation, we introduce a method for quantifying the satisfaction of co-safe linear temporal logic specifications, and propose a planner that uses this method to synthesize robot trajectories with the optimal satisfaction value. The method assigns costs to violations of specifications from user-defined proposition costs. These violation costs define a distance to satisfaction and can be computed algorithmically using a weighted automaton. The planner utilizes this automaton and an abstraction of the robotic system to construct a product graph that captures all possible robot trajectories and their distances to satisfaction. Then, a plan with the minimum distance to satisfaction is generated by employing this graph as the high-level planner in a synergistic planning framework. The efficacy of the method is illustrated on a robot with unsatisfiable specifications in an office environment.
