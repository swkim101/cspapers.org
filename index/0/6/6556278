In order to make humans feeling comfortable when working with robots, it is necessary for robots to be as much as possible “human-like” in both their appearance and movements. In redundant manipulators, it is possible to use the additional degrees of freedom in order to make the robot motion more human-like, thus increasing the quality of the human-robot interaction. In this work, a redundancy resolution method to address this issue is presented. Such a method considers the human musculoskeletal system and a biomechanical model of the human upper limbs in order to define a strategy to solve the redundancy for a dual-arm anthropomorphic manipulator as a human would do, then making the robot able to both perform the prescribed task and to assume human-like postures.
