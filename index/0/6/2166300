Different demographics, e.g., gender or age, can demonstrate substantial variation in their language use, particularly in informal contexts such as social media. In this paper we focus on learning gender differences in the use of subjective language in English, Spanish, and Russian Twitter data, and explore cross-cultural differences in emoticon and hashtag use for male and female users. We show that gender differences in subjective language can effectively be used to improve sentiment analysis, and in particular, polarity classification for Spanish and Russian. Our results show statistically significant relative F-measure improvement over the gender-independent baseline 1.5% and 1% for Russian, 2% and 0.5% for Spanish, and 2.5% and 5% for English for polarity and subjectivity classification.
