We show that unless NP = RP, it is hard to (even) weakly PAC-learn intersection of two halfspaces in Rn using a hypothesis which is a function of up to l linear threshold functions for any integer l. Specifically, we show that for every integer l and an arbitrarily small constant ε > 0, unless NP = RP, no polynomial time algorithm can distinguish whether there is an intersection of two halfspaces that correctly classifies a given set of labeled points in Rn, or whether any function of l linear threshold functions can correctly classify at most 1/2+ε fraction of the points.
