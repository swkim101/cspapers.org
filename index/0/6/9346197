Systems theory deals with classes of identifiable parts each interacting in such a way that a given class exists together to satisfy certain specific requirements; these parts can be thought of an components of the system, some of which are permanent and some not. In analyzing a given system (see (13)) one usually offers up an mtuple consisting of devices to be analyzed, primitives to represent any device, allowable compositions, concepts of simulation, and theorems that tell how the devices are to be analyzed. 
 
Category theory serves as an organizational tool for large systems.
