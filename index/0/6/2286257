The purpose of this work is to develop a lock-free hash table that allows a large number of threads to concurrently insert, modify, or retrieve information. Lock-free or non-blocking designs alleviate the problems traditionally associated with lock-based designs, such as bottlenecks and thread safety. Using standard atomic operations provided by the hardware, the design is portable and therefore, applicable to embedded systems and supercomputers such as the Cray XMT. Real-world applications range from search-indexing to computer vision. Having written and tested the core functionality of the hash table, we plan to perform a formal validation using model checkers.
