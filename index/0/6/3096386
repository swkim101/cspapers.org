This research adopts the point of view that much of software development is a process of editing complex structures, structures that represent a tightly coupled integration of textual and graphical material. In the context of text and table objects, this research explores a Smalltalk-like, object oriented architecture for editors of such complex structures. Based on this experience, we propose certain design and operation principles for such editors.
