All of these systems rely on an explicit model of history, which can be scanned to support search or “navigation” over a timeline, and all allow their timelines to be “traversed” to move the application’s state to other points in its history. However, as powerful as these applications are, their timeline representations are for the most part exceedingly simple. They typically support only linear, not branching timelines (GINA and Timewarp are exceptions, however); the “nodes” in a timeline must represent atomic operations with side effects that are well understood at the time the application is created; and, typically, the timeline of the entire application must be navigated or traversed as a whole—it is impossible to have a portion of the timeline exist in a “bubble” that can be manipulated separately.
