This paper presents an architecture for context-aware Ubiquitous Robotics applications, where mobile robots cooperate with intelligent environments to fulfill their tasks. Specifically, the work is focused on distributed knowledge representation issues and context assessment strategies, and introduces a technique for on-line context recognition in highly dynamic environments. Experimental validation, performed in a civillian hospital building, is described and discussed.
