This paper presents the basis of PDIL, a language designed for specifying protocols and services and allowing automatic implementation. The main objectives of the language are unambiguous description, simulation and automatic implementation. The first part presents the objects that PDIL allows to manipulate : machines, channels, contexts, automata, interactions. The second part gives an overview of a PDIL description unit in its language aspect. This paper also introduces general ideas about the description of simulation and automatic implementation of protocols or services.
 This work is largely based on the present result of subgroups A and B of ISO/SC16/WG1/FDT with significant extensions.
