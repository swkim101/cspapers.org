Integrating information in multiple natural languages is a challenging task that often requires manually created linguistic resources such as a bilingual dictionary or examples of direct translations of text. In this paper, we propose a general cross-lingual text mining method that does not rely on any of these resources, but can exploit comparable bilingual text corpora to discover mappings between words and documents in different languages. Comparable text corpora are collections of text documents in different languages that are about similar topics; such text corpora are often naturally available (e.g., news articles in different languages published in the same time period). The main idea of our method is to exploit frequency correlations of words in different languages in the comparable corpora and discover mappings between words in different languages. Such mappings can then be used to further discover mappings between documents in different languages, achieving cross-lingual information integration. Evaluation of the proposed method on a 120MB Chinese-English comparable news collection shows that the proposed method is effective for mapping words and documents in English and Chinese. Since our method only relies on naturally available comparable corpora, it is generally applicable to any language pairs as long as we have comparable corpora.
