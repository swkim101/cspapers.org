This workshop's goal is to help faculty who want to establish a course (or alternate vehicle) for mentoring undergraduates with some CS background to participate in K-12 teaching CS in local schools with engaging pedagogy. The workshop leverages the experiences and lessons learned from ten semesters of the organizers leading a course that meets once a week on campus for mentoring to support the undergraduates' field experience in local schools and libraries. The workshop will dive deep into logistics including how to establish and maintain strong teacher partnerships, establishing student-teacher matches and weekly field experience schedules, weekly in-class activities and assignments to support the field experience, weekly student reflective journal prompts, and surveys for formative evaluation. Participants will actively reflect on their own contexts with potential opportunities and challenges, and organizers will facilitate small group discussions of how to address the challenges, different models for different contexts, and how to get started. Participants should leave with a plan for next steps toward offering a mentored undergraduate field experience in teaching computer science and access to a community of faculty who are working to help to broaden participation in computer science in K-12 while providing opportunities for undergraduates to hone their communication and leadership skills, increase their self confidence, and participate in giving back to the community using their technical skills. The activities do not require a laptop, only pens and handouts provided by the organizers.
