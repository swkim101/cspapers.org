The FLEX/32 MultiComputer is a directly programmable general purpose, Multiple Instruction Stream/Multiple Data Stream (MIMD) computing environment. I t is a collection of computers that share high-speed memory and synchronization and messaging hardware. The FLEX/32 can expand in power with minimal software modification and i ts hardware can be configured and reconfigured easily. I t is a generic "multicomputing environment" for cooperating multiple processors. The FLEX/32 can support a number of different processor types by providing consistent storage and input/output fac i l i t ies to i ts differing processors accessable through standard VMEbus connections. The FLEX/32 supports the ful l UNIX* System V Operating System and languages associated with i t , C** plus the extended ConCurrent and ConCurrent FORTRAN** 77 languages that allow programming of concurrent software at a high level.
