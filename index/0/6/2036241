Studies multiple-robot manipulator cooperative manipulation of an unknown dynamic object. The authors show a simple approach for each robot to identify the object dynamics through cooperation. The authors decentralize the position/internal force hybrid controller such that each robot has its controller and determines its control torque from its own feedback information. Experiments show the effectiveness of the control strategy.<<ETX>>
