This paper introduces the Irregular Stream Buffer (ISB), a prefetcher that targets irregular sequences of temporally correlated memory references. The key idea is to use an extra level of indirection to translate arbitrary pairs of correlated physical addresses into consecutive addresses in a new structural which is visible only to the ISB. This structural address space allows the ISB to organize prefetching meta-data so that it is simultaneously temporally and spatially ordered, which produces technical benefits in terms of coverage, accuracy, and memory traffic overhead. We evaluate the ISB using the Marss full system simulator and the irregular memory-intensive programs of SPEC CPU 2006 for both single-core and multi-core systems. For example, on a single core, the ISB exhibits an average speedup of 23.1% with 93.7% accuracy, compared to 9.9% speedup and 64.2% accuracy for an idealized prefetcher that over-approximates the STMS prefetcher, the previous best temporal stream prefetcher; this ISB prefetcher uses 32 KB of on-chip storage and sees 8.4% memory traffic overhead due to meta-data accesses. We also show that a hybrid prefetcher that combines a stride-prefetcher and an ISB with just 8 KB of on-chip storage exhibits 40.8% speedup and 66.2% accuracy.
