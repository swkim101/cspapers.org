The important mass of textual documents is in perpetual growth and requires strong applications to automatically process information. Automatic titling is an essential task for several applications: 'No Subject' e-mails titling, text generation, summarization, and so forth. This study presents an original approach consisting in titling journalistic articles by nominalizing. In particular, morphological and semantic processing are employed to obtain a nominalized form which has to respect titles characteristics (in particular, relevance and catchiness). The evaluation of the approach, described in the paper, indicates that titles stemming from this method are informative and/or catchy.
