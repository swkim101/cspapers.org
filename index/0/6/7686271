Among several applications of robotics in medicine, robotic surgery represents one of the most promising scientific challenges for the research community. Its main expectations are to increase the quality of interventions, to decrease the intervention time and to reduce health care costs, by combining the analysis capabilities of imaging systems with the precision of robot manipulators. This paper introduces our surgical robotic system, describing in details the presurgical planning, surgeon-robot interface, matching between the virtual image and real robot workspace, safety considerations, knee implantation procedure, and experimental analysis about precision and errors.<<ETX>>
