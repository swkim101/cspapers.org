Computational models of the hippocampal-region provide an important method for understanding the functional role of this brain system in learning and memory. The presentations in this workshop focused on how modeling can lead to a unified understanding of the interplay among hippocampal physiology, anatomy, and behavior. Several approaches were presented. One approach can be characterized as "top-down" analyses of the neuropsychology of memory, drawing upon brain-lesion studies in animals and humans. Other models take a "bottom-up" approach, seeking to infer emergent computational and functional properties from detailed analyses of circuit connectivity and physiology (see Gluck & Granger, 1993, for a review). Among the issues discussed were: (1) integration of physiological and behavioral theories of hippocampal function, (2) similarities and differences between animal and human studies, (3) representational vs. temporal properties of hippocampal-dependent behaviors, (4) rapid vs. incremental learning, (5) mUltiple vs. unitary memory systems, (5) spatial navigation and memory, and (6) hippocampal interaction with other brain systems.
