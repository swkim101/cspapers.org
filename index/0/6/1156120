The creation of a pronunciation lexicon remains the most inefficient process in developing an Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR). In this paper, we propose an unsupervised alternative ‐ requiring no language-specific knowledge ‐ to the conventional manual approach for creating pronunciation dictionaries. We present a hierarchical Bayesian model, which jointly discovers the phonetic inventory and the Letter-to-Sound (L2S) mapping rules in a language using only transcribed data. When tested on a corpus of spontaneous queries, the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed joint learning scheme over its sequential counterpart, in which the latent phonetic inventory and L2S mappings are learned separately. Furthermore, the recognizers built with the automatically induced lexicon consistently outperform grapheme-based recognizers and even approach the performance of recognition systems trained using conventional supervised procedures.
