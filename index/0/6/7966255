FOLIO is an expert system to assist portfolio managers. It interviews a client and, on the basis of expert knowledge, determines the client's investment goals and the portfolio that best meets them. FOLIO is a test bed for a theory of heuristic reasoning about uncertainty (Cohen and Grinberg, 1983), and its task has many parallels to established Al paradigms such as diagnosis in medicine and construction of a student model in ICAI domains. FOLIO uses a goal programming algorithm (Hillier and Lieberman, 1980) as a relaxation method for resolving the client's multiple goals into a portfolio that fits them optimally. This paper discusses the motivations for building FOLIO; its task, design, and operation; and examples of its recommendations.
