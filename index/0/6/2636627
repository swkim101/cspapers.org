Many machine learning applications require a combination of probability and first-order logic. Markov logic networks (MLNs) accomplish this by attaching weights to first-order clauses, and viewing these as templates for features of Markov networks. Model parameters (i.e., clause weights) can be learned by maximizing the likelihood of a relational database, but this can be quite costly and lead to suboptimal results for any given prediction task. In this paper we propose a discriminative approach to training MLNs, one which optimizes the conditional likelihood of the query predicates given the evidence ones, rather than the joint likelihood of all predicates. We extend Collinsâ€™s (2002) voted perceptron algorithm for HMMs to MLNs by replacing the Viterbi algorithm with a weighted satisfiability solver. Experiments on entity resolution and link prediction tasks show the advantages of this approach compared to generative MLN training, as well as compared to purely probabilistic and purely logical approaches.
