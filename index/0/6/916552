This paper argues that it will become increasingly important to extend our concept of user interfaces for individual users of computers to include organizational interfaces for groups of users. A number of suggestions are given for how to develop a theoretical base for designing such interfaces. For instance, examples are used to illustrate how traditional cognitive points of view can be extended to include information processing by multiple agents in organizations. Examples of design implications from other perspectives such as motivational, economic, and political are also included.
