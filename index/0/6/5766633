This paper reports the results of a recent survey of user-centered design (UCD) practitioners. The survey involved over a hundred respondents who were CHI'2000 attendees or current UPA members. The paper identifies the most widely used methods and processes, the key factors that predict success, and the critical tradeoffs practitioners must make in applying UCD methods and processes. Results show that cost-benefit tradeoffs are a key consideration in the adoption of UCD methods. Measures of UCD effectiveness are lacking and rarely applied. There is also a major discrepancy between the commonly cited measures and the actually applied ones. These results have implications for the introduction, deployment, and execution of UCD projects
