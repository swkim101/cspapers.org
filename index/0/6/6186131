The paper describes the ARANEUS Wel-Base Management System [l, 5, 4, 61, a system developed at Universitb di Roma Tre, which represents a proposal towards the definition of a new kind of data-repository, designed to manage Web data in the database style. We call a WebBase a collection of data of heterogeneous nature, and more specifically: (i) highly structured data, such as the ones typically stored in relational or objectoriented database systems; (G) semistructured data, in the Web style. We can simplify by saying that it incorporates both databases and Web sites. A Web-Base Management System (WBMS) is a system for managing such Web-bases. More specifically, it should provide functionalities for both database and Web site management. It is natural to think of it as an evolution of ordinary DBMSs, in the sense that it will play in future generation Web-based Information Systems the same role as the one played by database systems today. Three natural requirements arise here:first, the system should be fully distributed: databases and Web sites may be either local or remote resources; second, it should be platform-independent, i.e., it should not be tied to a specific platform or software environment, coherently with the nature of the Internet; finally, all system functionalities should be accessible through a hypertextual user interface, based on HTML-like markup languages, i.e., the system should be a site itself. We can list three main classes of applications that a WBMS should support, in the database spirit: (1) queries: the system should allow to access data in a Web-base in a declarative, high-level fashion; this means that not only structured data can be accessed and queried, but also semistructured data in Web sites; (2) views: data coming from heterogeneous sources should be possibly reorganized and integrated in new Web-bases, in order to provide different views over the original data, to be navigated and queried by end-users; (3) updates: the process of maintaining Web sites is a delicate one which should be carefully supported;
