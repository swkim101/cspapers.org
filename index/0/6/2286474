Current multicomputer designs based on the k -ary d-cube topology present two main drawbacks when used as general purpose computers: They couple processing and communication capacities, and, when the dimension is kept fixed, the bisection bandwidth availability for each node decreases as the number of processing nodes grows. To overcome the above shortcomings, it is possible to apply a strategy we refer to as overrouting to k-ary d-cube networks. Two interconnection schemes resulting from such strategy are the k-ary d-cube n-spaces networks and the k-ary d-cube z-overrouted networks. The present paper compares the relative merits and demerits of those two schemes.
