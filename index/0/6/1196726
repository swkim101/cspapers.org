This paper describes an implementation of a system for fuzzy reasoning which facilitates the execution of approximate reasoning from the specified propositions and gives the result in both fuzzy-set and linguistic forms. The description of the Approximate Reasoning System contains the Universe of Discourse Block which defines several universes of discourse; the Primary Term Block which defines several primary terms; the Proposition Block which states propositions using primary terms, linguistic hedges and IF ... THEN ...; and the Approximate Reasoning Block which executes approximate reasoning and linguistic approximation. The Approximate Reasoning System is implemented using the FSTDS System for fuzzy-set manipulation and is running on a FACOM 230-458 computer.
