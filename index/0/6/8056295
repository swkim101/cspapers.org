This paper investigates both positional dependence in systems with friction and the influence an increase in temperature has on the friction behavior. The positional dependence is modeled with a Radial Basis Function network and the temperature dependence is modeled as a first order system with the power loss due to friction as input, eliminating the need for temperature sensing. The proposed methods are evaluated in both simulations and experiments on two industrial robots with strong positional and temperature friction dependence.
