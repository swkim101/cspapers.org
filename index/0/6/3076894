On the other hand, already much manual effort has gone into the construction of semantic lexicons such as the WordNetthat represent the meanings of words by defining the various relationships that exist among the words in a language.We consider the question, can we improve the word representations learnt using a corpora by integrating theknowledge from semantic lexicons?. For this purpose, we propose a joint word representation learning method that simultaneously predictsthe co-occurrences of two words in a sentence subject to the relational constrains given by the semantic lexicon.We use relations that exist between words in the lexicon to regularize the word representations learnt from the corpus.Our proposed method statistically significantly outperforms previously proposed methods for incorporating semantic lexicons into wordrepresentations on several benchmark datasets for semantic similarity and word analogy.
