Traditionally, users have discovered information on the Web by browsing or searching. Recently, word-of-mouth has emerged as a popular way of discovering the Web, particularly on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. On these sites, users discover Web content by following URLs posted by their friends. Such word-of-mouth based content discovery has become a major driver of traffic to many Web sites today. To better understand this popular phenomenon, in this paper we present a detailed analysis of word-of-mouth exchange of URLs among Twitter users. Among our key findings, we show that Twitter yields propagation trees that are wider than they are deep. Our analysis on the geolocation of users indicates that users who are geographically close together are more likely to share the same URL.
