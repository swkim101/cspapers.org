We present an algorithm for mining association rules from relational tables containing numeric and categorical attributes. The approach is to merge adjacent intervals of numeric values, in a bottom-up manner, on the basis of maximizing the interestingness of a set of association rules. A modification of the B-tree is adopted for performing this task efficiently. The algorithm takes O(kN) I/O time, where k is the number of attributes and N is the number of rows in the table. We evaluate the effectiveness of producing good intervals.
