A modification is described to the use of mean field approximations in the E step of EM algorithms for analysing data from latent structure models, as described by Ghahramani (1995), among others. The modification involves second-order Taylor approximations to expectations computed in the E step. The potential benefits of the method are illustrated using very simple latent profile models.
