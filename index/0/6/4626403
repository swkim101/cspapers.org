We investigate the differences -- in terms of bothquantitative performance and subjective preference -- between direct-touch and mouse input for unimanual andbimanual tasks on tabletop displays. The results of twoexperiments show that for bimanual tasks performed ontabletops, users benefit from direct-touch input. However,our results also indicate that mouse input may be moreappropriate for a single user working on tabletop tasksrequiring only single-point interaction.
