A number of optimizations have been proposed for Datalog programs involving a single intensional predicate (“single-IDB programs”). Examples include the detection of commutativity and separability ([Naug88],[RSUV89], [Ioan89a]) in linear logic programs, and the detection of ZYT-linearizability ([ZYT88], [RSUV89], [Sara89], [Sara90]) in nonlinear programs. We show that the natural generalizations of the commutativity and ZYT-linearizability problems (respectively, the sequencability and base-case linearizability problems) are undecidable. Our constructions involve the simulation of context-free grammars using single-IDB programs that have a bounded number of initialisation rules. The constructions may be used to show that containment (or equivalence) is undecidable for such programs, even if the programs are linear, or if each program contains a single recursive rule. These results tighten those of [Shmu87] and [Abit89].
