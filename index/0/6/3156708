A qualitative reasoning planner for determining robot control parameters to drive manipulation actions has been developed, integrated into a telerobot system, and demonstrated for a match striking task. The planner consists of a qualitative reasoner and a numerical execution history which interact to jointly direct and narrow the search for reliable numerical control parameter values. The planner algorithm, implementation, and an execution example are described. The relationship to previous qualitative reasoning work is also discussed.
