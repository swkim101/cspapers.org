Tree substitution grammars (TSGs) are a compelling alternative to context-free grammars for modelling syntax. However, many popular techniques for estimating weighted TSGs (under the moniker of Data Oriented Parsing) suffer from the problems of inconsistency and over-fitting. We present a theoretically principled model which solves these problems using a Bayesian non-parametric formulation. Our model learns compact and simple grammars, uncovering latent linguistic structures (e.g., verb subcategorisation), and in doing so far out-performs a standard PCFG.
