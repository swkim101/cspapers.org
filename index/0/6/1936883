In the communication problem UR (universal relation), Alice and Bob respectively receive x, y &#x220A;{0,1\}^n with the promise that x&#x2260; y. The last player to receive a message must output an index i such that x_i&#x2260; y_i. We prove that the randomized one-way communication complexity of this problem in the public coin model is exactly \Theta(\min\{n,\log(1/&#x03B4;)\log^2(\frac n{\log(1/&#x03B4;)})\}) for failure probability &#x03B4;. Our lower bound holds even if promised \mathop{support}(y)&#x2284; \mathop{support}(x). As a corollary, we obtain optimal lower bounds for &#x2113;_p-sampling in strict turnstile streams for 0\le p streams for 0 &#x2264; p
