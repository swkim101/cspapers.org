Search engines provide a small window to the vast repository of data they index and against which they search. They try their best to return the documents that are of relevance to the user but often a large number of results may be returned. Users struggle to manage this vast result set looking for the items of interest. Clustering search results is one way of alleviating this navigational pain. In this paper we describe a clustering system that enables clustering search results in an online marketplace search system.
