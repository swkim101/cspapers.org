The relationship between motives, emotions and learning in the design of intelligent systems has received relatively little consideration to date. Clarification of the relationship involves tackling fundamental questions such as the survival value or adaptive function of motives and emotions in intelligent systems, the nature of motivational and emotional processes which are features of 'innate' endowment, the learning of additional motives and emotions as a result of environmental interaction, and the results of the influence of motives and emotions on learning processes and, conversely, the effect of learning processes on the nature of motives and emotions.
