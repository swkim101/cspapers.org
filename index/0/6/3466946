iSnap is a block-based programming environment that supports struggling students with on-demand hints and error-checking feedback. iSnap is an extension of Snap!, a creative and novice-friendly programming environment, used in the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) AP CS Principles curriculum. iSnap is designed to support the open-ended, exploratory programming problems of BJC, while adapting to many possible student solutions. When students ask iSnap for help, it highlights possible errors in their code and suggests next steps they can make. Hints are presented visually, right alongside students/ code, making them easy to interpret and implement. iSnap/s hints are generated automatically from student data, so no teacher input is required to create them, making iSnap appropriate for both new and experienced instructors. The demonstration will showcase iSnap/s hints on a variety of assignments and explain how the algorithm is working behind the scenes to generate data-driven hints. It will also include an overview of the results from two years of research with iSnap on how students seek and use programming help. A key objective of this demonstration is to solicit feedback from SIGCSE attendees on the design of iSnap as we work to make the system ready for deployment in classrooms.
