This paper addresses the task of cross-domain social emotion classification of online documents. The cross-domain task is formulated as using abundant labeled documents from a source domain and a small amount of labeled documents from a target domain, to predict the emotion of unlabeled documents in the target domain. Although several cross-domain emotion classification algorithms have been proposed, they require that feature distributions of different domains share a sufficient overlapping, which is hard to meet in practical applications. This paper proposes a novel framework, which uses the emotion distribution of training documents at the cluster level, to alleviate the aforementioned issue. Experimental results on two datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed model on cross-domain social emotion classification.
