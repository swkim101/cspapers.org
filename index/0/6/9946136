For next generation information systems, concurrency control mechanisms are required to handle high level abstract operations and to meet high throughput demands. The currently available single level concurrency control mechanisms for reads and writes are inadequate for future complex information systems. In this paper, we will present a new multilevel concurrency protocol that uses a semantics-based notion of conflict, which is weaker than commutativity, called recoverability. Further, operations are scheduled according to relative conflict, a conflict notion based on the structure of operations.
Performance evaluation via extensive simulation studies show that with our multilevel concurrency control protocol, the performance improvement is significant when compared to that of a single level two-phase locking based concurrency control scheme or to that of a multilevel concurrency control scheme based on commutativity alone. Further, simulation studies show that our new multilevel concurrency control protocol performs better even with resource contention.
