This paper describes the first system for large-scale acquisition of subcategorization frames (SCFs) from English corpus data which can be used to acquire comprehensive lexicons for verbs, nouns and adjectives. The system incorporates an extensive rulebased classifier which identifies 168 verbal, 37 adjectival and 31 nominal frames from grammatical relations (GRs) output by a robust parser. The system achieves state-ofthe-art performance on all three sets.
