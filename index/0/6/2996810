This research found that some students conflate Python lists and dictionaries. This confusion could result from the visual similarity between the data-structures in Python print output. The goal of this research was to identify student's misconceptions about Python dictionaries. The data was collected in one-on-one, think-aloud interviews with two participants. When coding, one student treated her dictionary as if it were a literal list of two-element lists and could be accessed as such. Additionally, when asked to draw a visualization of dictionaries, she drew a representation that was identical to Python print output. It is likely that the output she is used to dealing with has shaped this visualization. This may be an example of negative transfer, where people transfer knowledge to a new setting and form an incorrect model. Based upon this research, educators should consider how print output can shape incorrect mental models, as well as emphasize the differences between lists and dictionaries.
