The algorithmic challenge of maximizing information diffusion through word-of-mouth processes in social networks has been heavily studied in the past decade. While there has been immense progress and an impressive arsenal of techniques has been developed, the algorithmic frameworks make idealized assumptions regarding access to the network that can often result in poor performance of state-of-the-art techniques. In this paper we introduce a new framework which we call Adaptive Seeding. The framework is a two-stage stochastic optimization model designed to leverage the potential that typically lies in neighboring nodes of arbitrary samples of social networks. Our main result is an algorithm which provides a constant factor approximation to the optimal adaptive policy for any influence function in the Triggering model.
