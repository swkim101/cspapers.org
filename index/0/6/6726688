The Visual Contract Workbench is a tool that supports model-driven development of software systems by lifting the Design by Contract idea, which is usually used at the code level, to the model level. It uses visual contracts for graphically specifying the pre- and post-conditions of an operation. Java classes with JML (Java modeling language) assertions are generated from visual contracts to facilitate automatic monitoring of the correctness of the programmers' implementation
