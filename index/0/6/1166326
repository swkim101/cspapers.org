This paper presents a representative Navy shipboard control system and discusses its distributed implementation. The real-time, fault tolerance and scalability aspects are discussed; the system configuration is described; and the computing infrastructure is summarized. The paper also presents challenges which are likely to be faced by the engineers of the next generation of Navy surface combatants.
