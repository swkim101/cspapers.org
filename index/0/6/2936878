This paper discusses a cognitive study of how interactive multimedia authoring (IMA) affects novice computer science students' conceptual understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP). In this study, interactive multimedia authoring refers to the construction of a role-playing game using a game template developed with Adobe Flash CS3 and ActionScript 2.0. Three cognitive processes of disequilibrium, exploration, and awareness were observed in this study, which aided the transformation of students' understanding of OOP through interactive multimedia authoring.
