This tutorial will introduce peer-reviewed research work on information quality on social systems. Specifically, we will address new threats such as social spam, campaigns, misinformation and crowdturfing, and overview modern techniques to improve information quality by revealing and detecting malicious participants (e.g., social spammers, content polluters and crowdturfers) and low quality contents.
