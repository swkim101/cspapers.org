This demonstration shows the Storyteller version control system. The tool aims to change the way software developers learn by opening up for examination how they do their work. The tool has traditional version control functionality (branching and merging) but in addition it records how development work is done, organizes it, and allows it to be played back for others. Most importantly, the tool allows developers to tell stories about what they did and why. It captures and organizes institutional knowledge that would otherwise be lost.
