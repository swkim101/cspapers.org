A two-dimensional channel routing program for hierarchical IC layout with orthogonal building blocks of variable size and shape is presented. A two dimensional channel model and a one layer channel router are used. A detailed description of the routing scheme which avoids the generation of "switch box" problems is given. The behavior of the two-dimensional routing algorithm to single and coupled channel intersections is demonstrated.
