This paper studies the problem of extracting real world event information from social media streams. Although existing work focuses on event signals of bursty mentions extracted from a single-source of textual streams, these signals are likely to be noisy due to ambiguous occurrences of individual mentions. To extract accurate event signals, we propose a framework capable of "grounding" mentions to unique event using multiple social networks with complementary strength. We show that our framework jointly using multiple sources outperforms state-of-the-arts using publicly available datasets.
