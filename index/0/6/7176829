This paper presents a formal account of the temporal interpretation of text. The distinct natural interpretations of texts with similar syntax are explained in terms of defeasible rules characterising causal laws and Gricean-style pragmatic maxims. Intuitively compelling patterns of defeasible entailment that are supported by the logic in which the theory is expressed are shown to underly temporal interpretation.
