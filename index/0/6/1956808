Relevant context inference (RCI) is a modular technique for flow- and context-sensitive data-flow analysis of statically typed object-oriented programming languages such as C++ and Java. RCI can be used to analyze complete programs as well as incomplete programs such as libraries; this approach does not require that the entire program be memory-resident during the analysis. RCI is presented in the context of points-to analysis for a realistic subset of C++. The empirical evidence obtained from a prototype implementation argues the effectiveness of RCI.
