We propose a method for recognizing rigid object instances in RGB-D point clouds by accumulating low-level information from keypoint correspondences over multiple observations. Compared to existing multi-view approaches, we make fewer assumptions on the recognition problem, dealing with cluttered and partially dynamic environments as well as covering a wide range of objects. Evaluation on the publicly available TUW and Willow datasets showed that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance for challenging sequences of static environments and a significant improvement for environments partially changing during the observation.
