We have been developing a mobile passenger guide system for public transports. Passengers can make their travel plans and purchase necessary electronic tickets using mobile terminals via Internet. During the travel, the mobile terminal, which also works as an electronic ticket, compares the stored travel plan with the passenger's actual activities and offers appropriate guide messages. To execute this task, the mobile terminal collects various kinds of information about the travel fields (routes, fares, area maps, station maps, operation schedule, timetables, facilities of stations and vehicles etc.) using multi-channel data communications. The mobile terminal contains a personal database for the passenger by selecting and integrating necessary data according to the user's situation and characteristics.
