A typical knowledge-based question answering (KB-QA) system faces two challenges: one is to transform natural language questions into their meaning representations (MRs); the other is to retrieve answers from knowledge bases (KBs) using generated MRs. Unlike previous methods which treat them in a cascaded manner, we present a translation-based approach to solve these two tasks in one unified framework. We translate questions to answers based on CYK parsing. Answers as translations of the span covered by each CYK cell are obtained by a question translation method, which first generates formal triple queries as MRs for the span based on question patterns and relation expressions, and then retrieves answers from a given KB based on triple queries generated. A linear model is defined over derivations, and minimum error rate training is used to tune feature weights based on a set of question-answer pairs. Compared to a KB-QA system using a state-of-the-art semantic parser, our method achieves better results.
