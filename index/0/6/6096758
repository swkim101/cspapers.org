This paper investigates the semantics of conditional term rewriting systems with negation, which may not satisfy desirable properties like termination. It is shown that the approach used by Fitting [5] for Prolog-style logic programs is applicable in this context. A monotone operator is developed, whose fixpoints describe the semantics of conditional rewriting. Several examples illustrate this semantics for non-terminating rewrite systems which could not be easily handled by previous approaches.
