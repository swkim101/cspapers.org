Autonomous navigation of a flying vehicle in a cluttered environment has been simulated to demonstrate novel yet simple techniques for avoiding obstacles using optic flow and image loom signals whilst successfully navigating a vehicle towards a goal. The simulation makes use of simulated flow fields calculated on cameras looking downwards, forwards, rearwards and sidewards. This computation could be carried out using a single processor networked with multiple remote cameras or using separate optic flow sensors oriented in each direction.
