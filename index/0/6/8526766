In 1998, Paturi, Pudlak, Saks, and Zane presented PPSZ, an elegant randomized algorithm for k-SAT. Fourteen years on, this algorithm is still the fastest known worst-case algorithm. They proved that its expected running time on k-CNF formulas with n variables is at most 2(1−ek)n, where ek e Ω(1/k). So far, no exponential lower bounds at all have been known. 
 
In this paper, we construct hard instances for PPSZ. That is, we construct satisfiable k-CNF formulas over n variables on which the expected running time is at least 2(1--ek)n, for ek e O(log2 k/k).
