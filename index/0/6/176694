Student participation in Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) projects offers great learning opportunities for students, including: designing, coding, testing, documentation, collaboration and other professional skills. Humanitarian projects also foster understanding of computing's potential social impact. However, working with any open source project -- including HFOSS projects - presents some challenges to instructors. Identifying appropriate assignments, creating meaningful rubrics, mapping the academic schedule to a project's release cycle, and eliciting engagement from the HFOSS project community are just a few of the potential hurdles to overcome. This BOF will be led by a diverse group of faculty who have encountered and overcome these challenges. The organizers and other attendees will share approaches to student involvement in HFOSS as well as the challenges they've encountered and how they've overcome them. Faculty who are interested in involving students in real-world projects will be able to ask about topics including use of HFOSS in a range of courses including introductory courses, project selection, structuring courses and assignments, and gaining university buy-in, while making connections with more experienced faculty in this area. Participation of an open source community member will add perspective from open source communities.
