In this paper, structure-borne vibrations in a one-dimensional structure are examined as a means of communication and sensing for networks of robots. The concept is inspired by the observation that insects may use structural vibrations to communicate and to detect features of their environment. A 12 × 5 × 6 cm mobile robot capable of traversing an acoustically favorable structure is presented. A technique for measuring distance between robots and communicating commands to robots using vibrations generated on a common one-dimensional substrate are presented, and demonstrated through preliminary experimental results. Design considerations for this type of system are also discussed.
