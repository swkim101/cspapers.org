This paper analyzes the effect of resource sharing and assignment on the clock period of the synthesized circuit. We focus on behavioral specifications with mutually exclusive paths, due to the presence of nested conditional branches and loops. It is shown that even when the set of available resources is fixed, different assignments may lead to circuits with significant differences in clock period. We provide a comprehensive analysis of how resource sharing and assignment introduces long paths in the circuit. Based on the analysis, we develop an assignment algorithm which uses a high-level delay estimator to assign operations to a fixed set of available resources so as to minimize the clock period of the resultant circuit. Experimental results on several conditionalintensive designs demonstrate the effectiveness of the assignment algorithm.
