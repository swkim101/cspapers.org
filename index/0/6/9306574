Smart mobile handheld devices (MHDs) such as smartphones have been used for a wide range of applications. Despite the recent flurry of research on various aspects of smart MHDs, little is known about their network performance in WiFi networks. In this paper, we measure the network performance of smart MHDs inside a university campus WiFi network, and identify the dominant factors that affect the network performance. Specifically, we analyze 2.9TB of data collected over three days by a monitor that is located at a gateway router of the network, and make the following findings: (1) Compared to non-handheld devices (NHDs), MHDs use well provisioned Akamai and Google servers more heavily, which boosts the overall network performance of MHDs. Furthermore, MHD flows, particularly short flows, benefit from the large initial congestion window that has been adopted by Akamai and Google servers. (2) MHDs tend to have larger local delays inside the WiFi network and are more adversely affected by the number of concurrent flows. (3) Earlier versions of Android OS (before 4.X) cannot take advantage of the large initial congestion window adopted by many servers. On the other hand, the large receive window adopted by iOS is not fully utilized by most flows, potentially leading to waste of resources. (4) Some application-level protocols cause inefficient use of network and operating system resources of MHDs in WiFi networks. Our observations provide valuable insights on content distribution, server provisioning, MHD system design, and application-level protocol design.
