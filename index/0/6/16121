This paper presents a hand-held microsurgical forceps design with force-feedback capabilities designed for micromanipulation tasks. The device uses a customized force sensor that measures grasping forces over a range of 0-300mN and uses an actuator to exert amplified forces back on to the operator's fingertip in a mechanically-ungrounded setup. This allows perception of low force levels that are otherwise imperceptible to human touch. A customized force sensor design for the forceps grasping measurement is presented and a calibration experiment was conducted to validate its linearity and repeatability. A bench test of the device was conducted to demonstrate its intrinsic force-amplifying capabilities, with amplification factors of up to Ã—50 reported. A user study was conducted to confirm that the device could significantly improve human perception of grasping forces compared to conventional microsurgical forceps with the results demonstrating an order-of-magnitude improvement in force perception.
