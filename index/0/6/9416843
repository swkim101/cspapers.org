A clear target for computer communication technology is to support a high-performance global internetwork. Current internetworking approaches use either concatenated virtual circuits, as in X.75, or a “universal” internetwork datagram, as in the DoD Internet IP protocol and the ISO connectionless network protocol (CLNP). Both approaches have significant disadvantages.
This paper describes Sirpent#8482; (Source Internetwork Routing Protocol with Extended Network Transfer)1, a new approach to an internetwork architecture that makes source routing the basis for interconnection, rather than an option as in IP. Its benefits include simple switching with low per-packet processing and delay, support for accounting and congestion control, and scalability to a global internetwork. It also supports flexible, user-controlled routing such as required for security, policy-based routing and realtime applications. We also propose a specific internetwork protocol, called VIPER#8482;2, as a realization of the Sirpent approach.
