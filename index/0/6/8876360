In this article we present an interactive automatic document indexing software together with various index tuning/optimization strategies. After stems are generated from the raw text, the initial index vocabulary is narrowed down and tuned with the use of indexing versus clustering theory relationships. The narrowed down vocabulary is further optimized with the inclusion of term phrases and virtual terms corresponding to high and low frequency terms respectively. The results of performance experimentation which proved significant improvements of index vocabulary optimization are presented. The exploitation of the term discrimination value concept in index and retrieval system tuning and optimization is discussed.
