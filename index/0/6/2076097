An RRAM-based computing system (RCS) is an attractive hardware platform for implementing neural computing algorithms. On-line training for RCS enables hardware-based learning for a given application and reduces the additional error caused by device parameter variations. However, a high occurrence rate of hard faults due to immature fabrication processes and limited write endurance restrict the applicability of on-line training for RCS. We propose a fault-tolerant on-line training method that alternates between a fault-detection phase and a fault-tolerant training phase. In the fault-detection phase, a quiescent-voltage comparison method is utilized. In the training phase, a threshold-training method and a re-mapping scheme is proposed. Our results show that, compared to neural computing without fault tolerance, the recognition accuracy for the Cifar-10 dataset improves from 37% to 83% when using low-endurance RRAM cells, and from 63% to 76% when using RRAM cells with high endurance but a high percentage of initial faults.
