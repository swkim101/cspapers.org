We present elastic cursor and elastic edge, new interaction techniques for seamless edge-scroll. Through the use of light-weight physical simulations of elastic behavior on interface elements, we can improve precision, usability, and cueing on the use of edge-scroll in scrollable windows or screens, and make experiences more playful and easier to learn.
