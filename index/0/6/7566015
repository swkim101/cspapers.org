This paper is devoted to a system for aerial manipulation, composed of a helicopter and an industrial manipulator. The usage of an industrial manipulator is motivated by practical applications which were identified in different cooperation projects with the industry. We address the coupling between manipulator and helicopter and show that even in case when we have an ideal controller for manipulator and a highperformance controller for helicopter, an unbounded energy flow can be generated by internal forces between helicopter and manipulator if both controllers are used independently. To solve this problem we propose a new kinematical coupling for control by introducing an additional manipulation DoF realized by helicopter rotation around its yaw axis. The new experimental setup and required modifications in the manipulator controller for this purpose are described. Further, we propose dynamical coupling which is implemented by modification of the helicopter controller feeding the interaction force/torque, measured between manipulator base and fuselage, directly to the actuators of the rotor blades. At the end, we present experimental results for aerial manipulation and their analysis.
