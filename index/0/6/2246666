Traditional centralized monitoring systems do not scale to present-day large, complex, network- computing systems. Based on recent SNMP standards for distributed management, this paper addresses the scalability problem through distribution of monitoring tasks, applicable for tools such as SI- MONE (SNMP-based monitoring prototype implemented by the authors). Distribution is achieved by introducing one or more levels of a dual entity called the Intermediate Level Manager (ILM) between a manager and the agents. The ILM accepts monitoring tasks described in the form of scripts and delegated by the next higher entity. The solution is flexible and integratable into a SNMP tool without altering other system components. A testbed of up to 1024 monitoring elements is used to assess scalability. Noticeable improvements in the round trip delay (from seconds to less than tenth of a second) were observed when more than 200 monitoring elements are present and as few as 2 ILM's are used.
