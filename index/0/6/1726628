Knowledge on word meanings and their relations across languages is vital for enabling semantic information technologies: in fact, the ever increasingly multilingual nature of the Web now calls for the development of methods that are both robust and widely applicable for processing textual information in a multitude of languages. In our research, we approach this ambitious task by means of BabelNet, a wide-coverage multilingual lexical knowledge base. In this paper we present an Application Programming Interface and a Graphical User Interface which, respectively, allow programmatic access and visual exploration of BabelNet. Our contribution is to provide the research community with easy-to-use tools for performing multilingual lexical semantic analysis, thereby fostering further research in this direction.
