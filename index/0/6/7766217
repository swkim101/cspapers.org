A new algorithm, SSAPRE, for performing partial redundancy elimination based entirely on SSA form is presented. It achieves optimal code motion similar to lazy code motion [KRS94a, DS93], but is formulated independently and does not involve iterative data flow analysis and bit vectors in its solution. It not only exhibits the characteristics common to other sparse approaches, but also inherits the advantages shared by other SSA-based optimization techniques. SSAPRE also maintains its output in the same SSA form as its input. In describing the algorithm, we state theorems with proofs giving our claims about SSAPRE. We also give additional description about our practical implementation of SSAPRE, and analyze and compare its performance with a bit-vector-based implementation of PRE. We conclude with some discussion of the implications of this work.
