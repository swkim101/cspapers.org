The purpose of this work is to design a piecewise human learning control strategy for the autonomous control of dynamically stable systems in the following two cases. One case is in a single control process, the learning model is built up by combining some local neural networks. The other is that a desirable control target consists of some small control tasks which can be realized by human learning controllers individually. By estimating the stability region, we can guarantee the successful switch between two connected control pieces.
