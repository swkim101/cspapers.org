With rapid development of micro-processors, off-chip memory access becomes a system bottleneck. DRAM, a main memory in most computers, has concentrated only on capacity and bandwidth for decades to achieve high performance computing. However, DRAM access latency should also be considered to keep the development trend in multi-core era. Therefore, we propose NUAT which is a new memory controller focusing on reducing memory access latency without any modification of the existing DRAM structure. We only exploit DRAM's intrinsic phenomenon: electric charge variation in DRAM cell capacitors. Given the cost-sensitive DRAM market, it is a big advantage in terms of actual implementation. NUAT gives a score to every memory access request and the request with the highest score obtains a priority. For scoring, we introduce two new concepts: Partitioned Bank Rotation (PBR) and PBR Page Mode (PPM). First, PBR is a mechanism that draws information of access speed from refresh timing and position; the request which has faster access speed gains higher score. Second, PPM selects a better page mode between open- and close-page modes based on the information from PBR. Evaluations show that NUAT decreases memory access latency significantly for various environments.
