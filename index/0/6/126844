In the past decades, we found ourselves spending more and more time on the Internet. As we surf the Internet longer, we are exposed to digital advertisement more. Some of us got used to it and even take it for granted. And some of us sought for a remedy and use ad-blocking software. This could be an end of story, especially if we were not computer scientists Who are making those advertisements and why? As we know that the television networks make money by broadcasting tv commercial to their viewers. They use the money to create contents and make profit. Therefore, it is obvious that we watch commercial to watch their shows. Of course, some ad-free television networks make funds from monthly subscription fee. But why do we feel that we see more ads online than before? Are we right about it? The answer is Yes. We are seeing more ads than before and it is not only because we spend more time online but also because more marketing money has shifted from offline to online marketing. The increase in digital marketing is due to several reasons; 1) increase of time spent online 2) descent of publishers' offline business 3) innovations in digital advertising technology and creatives. In this talk, I will talk about the history of digital advertising and the recent innovations in advertising technologies to make ads more relevant to individual viewer. Also I will explain why the advanced machine learning and massive user data are behind the innovations.
