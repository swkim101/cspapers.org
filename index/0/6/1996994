Given a desired function for an effector, what is its appropriate shape? This paper formulates mechanical function as a product of both effector's shape and motion, and, assuming a fixed motion model, explores the role of shape in satisfying it. We assume that the desired mechanical function is expressed as a set of constraints on the geometry of contact, and develop the tools for transforming these constraints into an effector shape. A previous paper [1] addressed the special case of revolute or prismatic fingers. This paper develops the more general case, including all smooth 1DOF planar mechanisms. The technique is illustrated with the design of finger shapes to improve the stability of a planar grasp of an object.
