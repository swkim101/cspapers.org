Focussed structured document retrieval employs the concept of best entry points (BEPs), which are intended to provide optimal starting-points from which users can browse to relevant document components. This paper describes two small-scale studies, using experimental data from the Shakespeare user study, which developed and evaluated different approaches to the problem of automatic identification of BEPs.
