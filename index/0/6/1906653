In this paper prototype versions of two word experts for text analysis are dealt with which demonstrate that word experts are a feasible tool for parsing texts on the level of text cohesion as well as text coherence. The analysis is based on two major knowledge sources: context information is modelled in terms of a frame knowledge base, while the co-text keeps record of the linear sequencing of text analysis. The result of text parsing consists of a text graph reflecting the thematic organization of topics in a text.
