Currently, 27 states and the District of Columbia have some form of teacher certification in computer science. This includes a variety of pathways such as endorsement, certification, licensure or other authorization that explicitly names CS. Many of these states, as well as those that have no CS teacher certification, are in the process of reviewing certification standards and pathways with the goal of increasing the number and quality of K-12 CS instructors and thus, access to high quality CS coursework in K-12. The Praxis exam is one of the few nationally recognized measures of CS teacher content knowledge but the current exam is out of date. A group of state leaders have been working with ETS to update the competencies measured by the Praxis. The objective of this BOF is to bring together stakeholders interested in contributing to the conversation around what a beginning CS teacher should know and be able to do to in CS, provide an overview of what has happened thus far to address these questions, share the recently revised Praxis draft framework, and give individuals an opportunity to provide input on the development of a national consensus related to new K-12 CS teacher competencies.
