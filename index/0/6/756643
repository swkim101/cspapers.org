Constructing and maintaining semantic mappings are necessary but troublesome in data sharing systems. While most current work focuses on seeking automated techniques to solve this problem, this paper proposes a combination model for constructing exten-sible mappings between XML schemas. In our model, complex global mappings are constructed by first defining simple atomic mappings for each target schema element, and then combining them using a few basic operators. At the same time, we provide automated support for constructing such combined mappings.
