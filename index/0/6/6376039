Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) based sensing systems are effective in structural health monitoring. However, the usable range and accuracy of these sensors are severely affected due to the non-linearity exhibited in their input-output characteristics. This work presents a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based non-linearity compensator of a LVDT sensor. Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (FLANN), an improved version of the conventional neural networks has been implemented for simplicity. The result obtained from the FPGA implementation is in good agreement with the simulation result in MATLAB.
