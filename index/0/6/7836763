Today’s electronic desktop is quite separate from the physical desk of the user. Electronic documents lack many useful properties of paper, and paper lacks useful properties of electronic documents. Instead of making the electronic desktop more like the physical desk, this work attempts the opposite: to give the physical desk electronic properties and merge the two desktops into one. This paper describes a desk with a computer-controlled camera and projector above it. The camera sees where the user is pointing, and it reads portions of documents that are placed on the desk. The projector displays feedback and electronic objects onto the desk surface. This DigitalDesk adds electronic features to physical paper, and it adds physical features to electronic documents. The system allows the user to interact with paper and electronic objects by touching them with a bare finger (digit). Instead of “direct” manipulation with a mouse, this is tactile manipulation with a finger. The Digi-talDesk Calculator is a prototype example of a simple application that can benefit from the interaction techniques enabled by this desktop. The paper begins by discussing the motivation behind this work, then describes the Digi-talDesk, tactile manipulation, and the calculator prototype. It then discusses implementation details and ends with ideas for the future of tactile manipulation.
