Temporal logics are widely used in specifying goals of agents. We noticed that when directing agents, humans often revise their requirements for the agent, especially as they gather more knowledge about the domain. However, all existing temporal logics, except one, do not focus on the revision of goals in an elaboration tolerant manner. Thus formal temporal logics that can allow elaboration tolerant revision of goals are needed. As non-monotonic languages are often used for elaboration tolerant specification, we propose to explore non-monotonic temporal logics for goal specification. Recently, a non-monotonic temporal logic, N-LTL, was proposed with similar aims. In N-LTL, goal specifications could be changed via strong and weak exceptions. However, in NLTL, one had to a-priori declare whether exceptions will be weak or strong exceptions. We propose a new nonmonotonic temporal logic, that not only overcomes this, but is also able to express exception to exceptions, strengthen and weaken preconditions, and revise and replace consequents; all in an elaboration tolerant manner.
