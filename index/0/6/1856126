A query topic can be subjective involving a variety of opinions, judgments, arguments, and many other debatable aspects. Typically, search engines process queries independently from the nature of their topics using a relevance-based retrieval strategy. Hence, search results about subjective topics are often biased towards a specific view point or version. In this demo, we shall present MOUNA, a novel approach for opinion diversification. Given a query on a subjective topic, MOUNA ranks search results based on three scores: (1) relevance of documents, (2) semantic diversity to avoid redundancy and capture the different arguments used to discuss the query topic, and (3) sentiment diversity to cover a balanced set of documents having positive, negative, and neutral sentiments about the query topic. Moreover, MOUNA enhances the representation of search results with a summary of the different arguments and sentiments related to the query topic. Thus, the user can navigate through the results and explore the links between them. We provide an example scenario in this demonstration to illustrate the inadequacy of relevance-based techniques for searching subjective topics and highlight the innovative aspects of MOUNA.
