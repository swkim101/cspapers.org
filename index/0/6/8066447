An architecture for a highly modular, recursively structured class of machines is presented. DDM1 is an instance of such a machine structure, and is capable of executing machine language programs which are data driven nets. These nets may represent arbitrary amounts of concurrency as well as arbitrary amounts of pipelining. DDM1 is a fully distributed multiprocessing system composed of completely asynchronous modules. The architecture allows for limitless physical extensibility without necessitating special programming or special hardware to support individual machines of widely varying sizes. DDM1 is capable of automatically and dynamically allocating concurrent tasks to the available physical resources. The essential characteristics of the highly parallel, pipelined machine language are also described along with its method for execution on DDM1.
