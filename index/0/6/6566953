This paper presents an experiment in nsing n fnrmnl techniqne for static prngrnm nnnlyais, hnsod an abstract intarpre t.ntion, in the context of persistent progrnmming Inngnngw. The nim of thn annlysis is to dntoct npportnnities for snfe parallelism fnr trnnsnetinn nperatinn sehadnling. Tmnsnctinn apcratinns cnn he snfely intarlanved when there is no nverlnpping among their rends& nnd writ-b. A non-atnndnrd interpreter perfnrmcl the nnnlysis. This interpreter, given the text of n trnns.actinn nnd n reprascntntinn nf the dntn stored in the dntnh.m, oufnmnfica//y derivea in n finite time n11 npprnxirnntinn of the randset and writ-t nf the nnnlysed lrnnsnclinn. lnfnrmntian ahtnined from the non-atnndnrd interpret,ntinn is provided to the schodnler hefnra haginning the cxrcntion of trnnsactinn operations. In this way, we ohtnin A schrdnler thnt renlism n cnnservntive two-phase lacking protocol fnr persistent programming Inngnaga trnnsactinncl. We npply the nnalysis to n Iangnage thnt is n signiticnnt snhset of Gnlilan. The gnnl of the nnnlyh i.s tn &.teet the nccems xnlely to shnrc\nhle nnd mnclitinhle persistent dntn.
