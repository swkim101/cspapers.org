While many uses of mined software engineering data are automatic in nature, some techniques and studies either require, or can be improved, by manual methods. Unfortunately, manually inspecting, analyzing, and annotating mined data can be difficult and tedious, especially when information from multiple sources must be integrated. Oddly, while there are numerous tools and frameworks for automatically mining and analyzing data, there is a dearth of tools which facilitate manual methods. To fill this void, we have developed LINKSTER, a tool which integrates data from bug databases, source code repositories, and mailing list archives to allow manual inspection and annotation. LINKSTER has already been used successfully by an OSS project lead to obtain data for one empirical study.
