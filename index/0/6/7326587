Future business applications will often have more than 2,000 forms and need to target several user interface (UI) technologies including: Web Browsers, Windows® Applications, PDA's, and cell phones. The applications will need state-of-the-art layout combined with excellent usability with specially built forms that handle specific tasks based on user roles. How can the trade-off between developer productivity and user experience be handled?The technologies being implemented in Microsoft® Business Framework include a model-driven business UI platform that exploits flexible maps and a layered form definition. The framework generates forms based on a model of the business logic, which is an integrated part of the business framework. The generation process uses declarative and changeable maps so that the process can be controlled and modified by the business developer.
