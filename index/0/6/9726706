In this paper, we describe a miniature flight platform weighing less than 700 grams and capable of waypoint navigation, trajectory tracking, precise hovering and automatic takeoff and landing. In an effort to make advanced autonomous behaviors available to mini and micro rotorcraft, a lightweight/portable and inexpensive Guidance, Navigation, and Control system (GN&C) was developed. To compensate for the weaknesses of the low-cost equipment, we put our efforts in obtaining a reliable model-based nonlinear controller. The GN&sC system was implemented on a small four rotor helicopter which has undergone an extensive program of flight tests, resulting in various flight behaviors under autonomous control from takeoff to landing. Flight test results that demonstrate the operation of the GN&C algorithms on a real MAV are presented.
