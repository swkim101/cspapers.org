It is well-known that BGP, the current inter-domain routing protocol, has many deficiencies. This paper describes a hybrid link-state and path-vector protocol called HLP as an alternative to BGP that has vastly better scalability, isolation and convergence properties. Using current BGP routing information, we show that HLP, in comparison to BGP, can reduce the churn-rate of route updates by a factor 400 as well as isolate the effect of routing events to a region 100 times smaller than that of BGP. For a majority of Internet routes, HLP guarantees worst-case linear-time convergence. We also describe a prototype implementation of HLP on top of the XORP router platform. HLP is not intended to be a finished and final proposal for a replacement for BGP, but is instead offered as a starting point for debates about the nature of the next-generation inter-domain routing protocol.
