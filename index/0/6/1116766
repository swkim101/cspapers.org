Thesauri and ontologies provide important value in facilitating access to digital archives by representing underlying principles of organization. Translation of such resources into multiple languages is an important component for providing multilingual access. However, the specificity of vocabulary terms in most ontologies precludes fully-automated machine translation using general-domain lexical resources. In this paper, we present an efficient process for leveraging human translations when constructing domain-specific lexical resources. We evaluate the effectiveness of this process by producing a probabilistic phrase dictionary and translating a thesaurus of 56,000 concepts used to catalogue a large archive of oral histories. Our experiments demonstrate a cost-effective technique for accurate machine translation of large ontologies.
