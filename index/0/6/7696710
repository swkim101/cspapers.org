In this paper we propose a complete system that is able to accurately localize a mobile agent wearing a camera inside a known environment. The work leverages on a precomputed 3D structure to obtain 2D-3D correspondences and then orients the camera. Experiments in a challenging environment with a handmade ground-truth demonstrate sufficient accuracy to support the target application on real scenarios.
