This workshop shows participants about a new way to teach non-computing majors about computing fundamentals. This involves teaching computing concepts (such as sources of error, algorithm analysis, data storage, and simulations) that students encounter when they use computers to do work in their own disciplines. While this new way of teaching can use any discipline, the workshop will use the sciences as the working example. It will focus on how scientists use computers in their work but will also introduce ways to expand this to other disciplines. The course that will be presented presents different modules of computer science interspersed with different science modules that apply the computing knowledge. More details can be found at http://cf4s.olivet.edu. Participants are highly encouraged to bring a laptop. Handouts associated with the entire course will be provided.
