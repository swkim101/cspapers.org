This paper examines NFS sensitivity to performance characteristics of emerging networks. We adopt an unusual method of inserting controlled delays into live systems to measure sensitivity to basic network parameters. We develop a simple queuing model of an NFS server and show that it reasonably characterizes our two live systems running the SPECsfs benchmark. Using the techniques in this work, we can infer the structure of servers from published SPEC results. Our results show that NFS servers are most sensitive to processor overhead; it can be the limiting factor with even a modest number of disks. Continued reductions in processor overhead will be necessary to realize performance gains from future multigigabit networks. NFS can tolerate network latency in the regime of newer LANs and IP switches. Due to NFSâ€™s historic high mix of small metadata operations, NFS is quite insensitive to network bandwidth. Finally, we find that the protocol enhancements in NFS version 3 tolerate high latencies better than version 2 of the protocol.
