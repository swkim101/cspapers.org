We propose a natural extension of algebraic decision trees to the external-memory setting, where the cost of disk operations overwhelms CPU time, and prove a tight lower bound of Ω(<i>n</i> log<inf><i>m</i></inf> <i>n</i>) on the complexity of both sorting and element uniqueness in this model of computation. We also prove a Ω(min{<i>n</i> log<i><inf>m</inf> n, N</i>}) lower bound for both problems in a less restrictive model, which requires only that the worst-case internal-memory computation time is finite. Standard reductions immediately generalize these lower bounds to a large number of fundamental computational geometry problems.
