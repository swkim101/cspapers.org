Image triage is a common task in digital photography. Determining which photos are worth processing for sharing with friends and family and which should be deleted to make room for new ones can be a challenge, especially on a device with a small screen like a mobile phone or camera. In this work we explore the importance of local structure changes?e.g. human pose, appearance changes, object orientation, etc.?to the photographic triage task. We perform a user study in which subjects are asked to mark regions of image pairs most useful in making triage decisions. From this data, we train a model for image saliency in the context of other images that we call cosaliency. This allows us to create collection-aware crops that can augment the information provided by existing thumbnailing techniques for the image triage task.
