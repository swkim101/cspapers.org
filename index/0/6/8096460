We demonstrate PosFree, a platform supporting posture-free motion-based mobile games. It allows the developers to support diverse postural gameplay contexts in the motion-based mobile games, without much knowledge on the specific characteristics of motion sensors with respect to posture changes. It detects orientation of mobile devices at runtime and automatically converts motion sensor data as if the devices are manipulated in the standard posture, as well as provides an intuitive user interface to help players understand their postural gameplay contexts. The platform prototype is currently implemented inside the Android Framework, and thereby off-the-shelf motion-based mobile games can utilize the feature of PosFree without modifying their original source codes.
