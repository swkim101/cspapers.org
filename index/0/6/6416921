We present a new method for matching line segments between two uncalibrated wide-baseline images. Most current techniques for wide-baseline matching are based on viewpoint invariant regions. Those methods work well with highly textured scenes, but fail with poorly textured ones. We show that such scenes can be successfully matched using line segments. Moreover, since line segments and regions provide complementary information, their combined matching allows to deal with a broader range of scenes. We generate an initial set of line segment correspondences, and then iteratively increase their number by adding matches consistent with the topological structure of the current ones. Finally, a coplanar grouping stage allows to estimate the fundamental matrix even from line segments only.
