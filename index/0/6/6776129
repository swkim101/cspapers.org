With the proliferation of heterogeneous devices (desktop computers, personal digital assistants, phones), multimedia documents must be played under various constraints (small screens, low bandwidth). Taking these constraints into account with current document models is impossible. Hence, generic source documents must be transformed into documents compatible with the target contexts. Currently, the design of transformations is left to programmers. We propose here a semantic framework, which accounts for multimedia document adaptation in very general terms. A model of a multimedia document is a potential execution of this document and a context defines a particular class of models. The adaptation should then retain the source document models that belong to the class defined by the context if such models exist. Otherwise, the adaptation should produce a document whose models belong to this class and are "close" to those of the source documents. We focus on the temporal dimension of multimedia documents and show how adaptation can take advantage of temporal reasoning techniques. Several metrics are given for assessing the proximity of models.
