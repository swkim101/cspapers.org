This paper extends earlier research on hash-join algorithms to a multiprocessor architecture. Implementations of a number of centralized join algorithms are described and measured. Evaluation of these algorithms served to verify earlier analylical results. In addition, they demonstrate that bit vector filtering provides dramatic improvement in the performance of all algorithms including the sort mergejoin algorithm. Multiprocessor configurations of the centralized Grace and Hybrid hash-join algorithms are also presented. Both algorithms arc shown to provide linear increases in throughput with corresponding increases in processor and disk resources.
