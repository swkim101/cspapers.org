A social network can become bases for information infrastructure in the future. It is important to extract social networks that are not biased. Providing a simple means for users to register their social relation is also important. We propose a method that combines various approaches to extract social networks. Especially, three kinds of networks are extracted; user-registered Know link network, Web-mined Web link network, and face-to-face Touch link network. In this paper, the combination of social network extraction for communities is described, and the analysis on the extracted social networks is shown.
