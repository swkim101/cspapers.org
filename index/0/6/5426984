We introduce a MetaGrammar, which allows us to automatically generate, from a single and compact MetaGrammar hierarchy, parallel Lexical Functional Grammars (LFG) and Tree-Adjoining Grammars (TAG) for French and for English: the grammar writer specifies in compact manner syntactic properties that are potentially framework-, and to some extent language-independent (such as subcategorization, valency alternations and realization of syntactic functions), from which grammars for several frameworks and languages are automatically generated offline.
