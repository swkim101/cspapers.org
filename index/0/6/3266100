Let c > 0 be a constant, and Φ be a random Horn formula with n variables and m = c · 2n clauses, chosen uniformly at random (with repetition) from the set of all nonempty Horn clauses in the given variables. By analyzing PUR, a natural implementation of positive unit resolution, we show that limn→∞ Pr(Φ is satisfiable) = 1 − F(e−c), where F(x) = (1 − x)(1 − x2)(1 − x4)(1 − x8) …. Our method also yields as a byproduct an average‐case analysis of this algorithm. Published 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct. Alg., 20: 483–506, 2002
