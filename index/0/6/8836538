The scheduler used in an operating system is an important factor in the performance of the system under heavy load. This paper describes the scheduling philosophy employed in the UNIX operating system and outlines the standard scheduling strategies. Modified strategies which address deficiencies in the standard strategies are described. The effectiveness of these modified strategies is assessed by means of performance experiments.
