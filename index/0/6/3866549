Generally speaking, digital libraries have multiple granularities of semantic units: book, chapter, page, paragraph and word. However, there are two limitations of current eBook retrieval systems: (1) the granularity of retrievable units is either too big or too small, scales such as chapters, paragraphs are ignored; (2) the retrieval results should be grouped by facets to facilitate user's browsing and exploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-granularity multi-facet eBook retrieval approach.
