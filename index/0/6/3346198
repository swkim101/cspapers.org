Many combinatorial problems in LSI design can be described with cube set expressions. We discuss unate cube set algebra based on zero-suppressed BDDs, a new type of BDDs adapted for cube set manipulation. We propose efficient algorithms for computing unate cube set operations including multiplication and division, followed by some practical applications of unate cube set calculation.
