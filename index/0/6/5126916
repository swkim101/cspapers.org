Most work on extracting parallel text from comparable corpora depends on linguistic resources such as seed parallel documents or translation dictionaries. This paper presents a simple baseline approach for bootstrapping a parallel collection. It starts by observing documents published on similar dates and the cooccurrence of a small number of identical tokens across languages. It then uses fast, online inference for a latent variable model to represent multilingual documents in a shared topic space where it can do efficient nearestneighbor search. Starting from the Gigaword collections in English and Spanish, we train a translation system that outperforms one trained on the WMTâ€™11 parallel training set.
