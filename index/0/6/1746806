While traditional information extraction systems have been built to answer questions about facts, subjective information extraction systems will answer questions about feelings and opinions. A crucial step towards this goal is identifying the words and phrases that express opinions in text. Indeed, although much previous work has relied on the identification of opinion expressions for a variety of sentiment-based NLP tasks, none has focused directly on this important supporting task. Moreover, none of the proposed methods for identification of opinion expressions has been evaluated at the task that they were designed to perform. We present an approach for identifying opinion expressions that uses conditional random fields and we evaluate the approach at the expression-level using a standard sentiment corpus. Our approach achieves expression-level performance within 5% of the human interannotator agreement.
