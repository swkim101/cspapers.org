Networks on Chip (NoC) come along with increased complexity from the implementation and management perspective. This leads to higher energy consumption and programming complexity of NoC architectures. This work introduces communication aware programming to address communication resource management and efficient programming of NoC architectures. A programming interface is introduced to express communication requirements at the language level. These requirements are evaluated by an operating system component, which configures the communication hardware accordingly. The proposed concept enables an intuitive use of NoC features like end-to-end connections and Direct Memory Access (DMA). The presented results show that communication aware programming can improve performance and energy consumption.
