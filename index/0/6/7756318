Multilayer architectures such as those used in Bayesian belief networks and Helmholtz machines provide a powerful framework for representing and learning higher order statistical relations among inputs. Because exact probability calculations with these models are often intractable, there is much interest in finding approximate algorithms. We present an algorithm that efficiently discovers higher order structure using EM and Gibbs sampling. The model can be interpreted as a stochastic recurrent network in which ambiguity in lower-level states is resolved through feedback from higher levels. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on benchmark problems.
