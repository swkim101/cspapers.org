The notion of the graphical representation of a “canonical derivation” is extended to semi-thue systems; the graphs are called “derivation structures.” Derivation structures are distinguished from phrase structures and generative grammars are distinguished from phrase structure grammars. The distinctions disappear only in the context free case. This paper considers generative grammars and derivation structures. (A subsequent paper will consider phrase-structure grammars and phrase structures.) The notion of generalized finite automaton (tree automaton) is extended to systems which process arbitrary labeled directed ordered acyclic graphs. We study a restriction of these automata which process derivation structures. Analogous to the hierarchy of generative grammars, it is shown that there is a hierarchy of generalized finite automata which recognize the same languages. Their structure-defining relationship is a generalization of the context free case, i.e., the structures recognized by the automata are projections of the structures defined by the grammars. The proofs give algorithms for constructing the automata from the grammars and the grammars from the automata.
