Prepositional phrases (PPs) express crucial information that knowledge base construction methods need to extract. However, PPs are a major source of syntactic ambiguity and still pose problems in parsing. We present a method for resolving ambiguities arising from PPs, making extensive use of semantic knowledge from various resources. As training data, we use both labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing an expectation maximization algorithm for parameter estimation. Experiments show that our method yields improvements over existing methods including a state of the art dependency parser.
