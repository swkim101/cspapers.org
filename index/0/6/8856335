Phishing websites, fraudulent sites that impersonate a trusted third party to gain access to private data, continue to cost Internet users over a billion dollars each year. In this paper, we describe the design and performance characteristics of a scalable machine learning classifier we developed to detect phishing websites. We use this classifier to maintain Googleâ€™s phishing blacklist automatically. Our classifier analyzes millions of pages a day, examining the URL and the contents of a page to determine whether or not a page is phishing. Unlike previous work in this field, we train the classifier on a noisy dataset consisting of millions of samples from previously collected live classification data. Despite the noise in the training data, our classifier learns a robust model for identifying phishing pages which correctly classifies more than 90% of phishing pages several weeks after training concludes.
