Cryptographic filesystems are widely used to protect private files. It is, however, impossible to hide the existence of private information by such filesystems. Steganographic filesystems attempt to address this problem by embedding files imperceptibly into containers. In most steganographic filesystems ever proposed, files are embedded into containers those apparently randomized. Their existence would, however, imply that they include hidden files. This paper presents a new steganographic filesystem manager called Crocus. When a filesystem is to be hidden, it is embedded separately into a set of innocent-looking containers piece by piece. When the filesystem is to be used later, it is reconstructed from the pieces. We can resize or destruct the filesystem if required. Since more than one containers can be used for one filesystem, we can build filesystems those large enough. A prototype system of Crocus has been developed for Linux and a preliminary experiment was performed. The result indicates the effectiveness of the framework of Crocus.
