Increasing complexity of large-scale applications and continuous increases in data set sizes of such applications combined with slow improvements in disk access latencies has resulted in I/O becoming a performance bottleneck. While there are several ways of improving I/O access latencies of dataintensive applications, one of the promising approaches has been using different layers of the I/O subsystem to cache recently and/or frequently used data so that the number of I/O requests accessing the disk is reduced. These different layers of caches across the storage hierarchy introduce the need for efficient cache management schemes to derive maximum performance benefits. Several state-of-the-art multi-level storage cache management schemes focus on optimizing aggregate hit rate or overall I/O latency, while being agnostic to Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Also, most of the existing works focus on different cache replacement algorithms for managing storage caches and discuss different exclusive caching techniques in the context of multilevel cache hierarchy. However, the orthogonal problem of storage cache space allocation to multiple, simultaneously-running applications in a multi-level hierarchy of storage caches with multiple storage servers has remained an open research problem. In this work, using a combination of per-application latency model and a linear programming model, we proportion storage caches dynamically among multiple concurrently-executing applications across the different levels of the storage hierarchy and across multiple servers to provide isolation to applications while satisfying the application level SLOs. Further, our algorithm improves the overall system performance significantly.
