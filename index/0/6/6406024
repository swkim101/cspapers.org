Multimedia contents, especially videos, are being exponentially generated today. Due to the limited local storage, people are willing to store the videos at the remote cloud media center for its low cost and scalable storage. However, videos may have to be encrypted before outsourcing for privacy concerns. For practical purposes, the cloud media center should also provide the deduplication functionality to eliminate the storage and bandwidth redundancy, and adaptively disseminate videos to heterogeneous networks and different devices to ensure the quality of service. In light of the observations, we present a secure architecture enabling the encrypted cloud media center. It builds on top of latest advancements on secure deduplication and video coding techniques, with fully functional system implementations on encrypted video deduplication and adaptive video dissemination services. Specifically, to support efficient adaptive dissemination, we utilize the scalable video coding (SVC) techniques and propose a tailored layer-level secure deduplication strategy to be compatible with the internal structure of SVC. Accordingly, we adopt a structure-compatible encryption mechanism and optimize the way how encrypted SVC videos are stored for fast retrieval and efficient dissemination. We thoroughly analyze the security strength of our system design with strong video protection. Furthermore, we give a prototype implementation with encrypted end-to-end deployment on Amazon cloud platform. Extensive experiments demonstrate the practicality of our system.
