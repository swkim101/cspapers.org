Our developing gait training system is the training device that tries to obtain the effect similar to the walk training in the warm water swimming pool. A train patient hangs and is supported to the slinging system and walks the force plate top. Slinging it up power is controlled on the basis of the information from the force plates. This system can give the most effective load to a training person, by adjusting to the real time while slings in accordance with the recovery degree of a train patient. It becomes possible to evaluate the training effect on the basis of the data that was obtained from force plate, etc. This system is tested by handicapped person, to inspect the function and efficacy. The problem of walking posture is found from this test. We show the device that an walking posture in gait training system is improved.
