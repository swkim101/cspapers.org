Inclusion-based program analyses are implemented by adding new edges to directed graphs. In most analyses, there are many different ways to add a transitive edge between two nodes, namely through each different path connecting the nodes. This path redundancy limits the scalability of these analyses. We present projection merging, a technique to reduce path redundancy. Combined with cycle elimination [7], projection merging achieves orders of magnitude speedup of analysis time on programs over that of using cycle elimination alone.
