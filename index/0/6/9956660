From RoboCup-99, the legged robot league was promoted as one of the 4 official leagues (small size, middle size, simulation, and legged robot league). We provided a quadruped robot platform and basic software to the 9 teams in the world that were evaluated and selected by the RoboCup Legged Robot Committee. In this paper we describe the robot platform, some middleware and sample application program, that allow the robot to find a ball, to get close to the ball, and to kick it, with a stand up action when the robot falls down. In addition, we report the results of RoboCup Legged Robot League-99.
