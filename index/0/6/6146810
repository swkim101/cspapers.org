In recent technology nodes, wide guardbands are needed to overcome reliability degradations due to aging. Such guardbands manifest as reduced efficiency and performance. Existing approaches to reduce guardbands trade off aging impact for increased circuit overhead. By contrast, the goal of this work is to completely remove guardbands through exploring, for the first time, application of approximate computing principles in the context of aging. As a result of naively narrowing or removing guardbands, timing errors start to appear as transistors age. We demonstrate that even in circuits that may tolerate errors, aging can be catastrophic due to unacceptable quality loss. Furthermore, quantifying such aging-induced quality loss necessitates expensive (often infeasible) gate-level simulations of the complete design. We show how nondeterministic aginginduced timing errors can be converted into deterministic and controlled approximations instead. We first translate the required guardband over time into an equivalent reduction in precision for individual RTL components. We then demonstrate how, based on pre-characterization of RTL components, we can quantify aging-induced approximation at the whole microarchitecture level without the need for further gate-level simulations. Results show that a 3 bit reduction in precision is sufficient to sustain 10 years of operation under worst-case aging in the context of an image processing circuit. This corresponds to an acceptable PSNR reduction of merely 8 dB, while at the same time increasing area and energy efficiency by 13%.
