The result set from a search engine for any user's query may exhibit an inherent perspective due to issues with the search engine or issues with the underlying collection. This demonstration paper presents a system that allows users to specify at query time a perspective together with their query. The system then presents results from well-known search engines with a visualization of the results which allows the users to quickly surmise the presence of the perspective in the returned set.
