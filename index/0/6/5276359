This paper illustrates the manner in which UML can be used to study mappings to different types of database systems. After introducing UML through a comparison to the EER model, UML diagrams are used to teach different approaches for mapping conceptual designs to the relational model. As we cover object-oriented and object-relational database systems, different features of UML are used over the same enterprise example to help students understand mapping alternatives for each model. Students are required to compare and contrast the mappings in each model as part of the learning process. For object-oriented and object-relational database systems, we address mappings to the ODMG and SQL99 standards in addition to specific commercial implementations.
