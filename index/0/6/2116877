Given the importance of credibility in computing products, theresearch on computer credibility is relatively small. To enhanceknowledge about computers and credibility, we define key termsrelating to computer credibility, synthesize the literature in thisdomain, and propose three new conceptual frameworks for betterunderstanding the elements of computer credibility. To promotefurther research, we then offer two perspectives on what computerusers evaluate when assessing credibility. We conclude bypresenting a set of credibility-related terms that can serve infuture research and evaluation endeavors.
