This paper presents an examination of ball lifting task using a mobile robot. We have proposed a trajectory control method for tracking and catching a ball flying in 3D space based on GAG (gaining angle of gaze) strategy. The strategy allows single camera configuration and it is robust against camera motion errors. This simple method was implemented to a mobile robot and we demonstrated the quick motion to catch balls. We consider the extension of this method for the ball lifting task and demonstrate the robot can track and rebound a ball repeatedly as a basic examination of the task.
