The primary goal of Web usage mining is the discovery of patterns in the navigational behavior of Web users. Standard approaches, such as clustering of user sessions and discovering association rules or frequent navigational paths, do not generally provide the ability to automatically characterize or quantify the unobservable factors that lead to common navigational patterns. It is, therefore, necessary to develop techniques that can automatically discover hidden semantic relationships among users as well as between users and Web objects. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) is particularly useful in this context, since it can uncover latent semantic associations among users and pages based on the co-occurrence patterns of these pages in user sessions. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for the discovery and analysis of Web navigational patterns based on PLSA. We show the flexibility of this framework in characterizing various relationships among users and Web objects. Since these relationships are measured in terms of probabilities, we are able to use probabilistic inference to perform a variety of analysis tasks such as user segmentation, page classification, as well as predictive tasks such as collaborative recommendations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments performed on real-world data sets.
