In this paper, we introduce a novel control scheme based on the social force model for robots navigating in human environments. Social proxemics potential field is constructed based on the theory of proxemics and used to generate social interaction force for design of robot motion control. A combined kinematic/dynamic control is proposed to make the robot follow the target social force model, in the presence of kinematic velocity constraints. Under the proposed framework, given a specific social convention, robot is able to generate and modify its path smoothly without violating the proxemics constraints. The validity of the proposed method is verified through experimental studies using the V-rep platform.
