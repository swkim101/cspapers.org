360&#xb0; Video requires human viewers to actively control where to look while watching the video. Although it provides a more immersive experience of the visual content, it also introduces additional burden for viewers, awkward interfaces to navigate the video lead to suboptimal viewing experiences. Virtual cinematography is an appealing direction to remedy these problems, but conventional methods are limited to virtual environments or rely on hand-crafted heuristics. We propose a new algorithm for virtual cinematography that automatically controls a virtual camera within a 360&#xb0; video. Compared to the state of the art, our algorithm allows more general camera control, avoids redundant outputs, and extracts its output videos substantially more efficiently. Experimental results on over 7 hours of real in the wild video show that our generalized camera control is crucial for viewing 360&#xb0; video, while the proposed efficient algorithm is essential for making the generalized control computationally tractable.
