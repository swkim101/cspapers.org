The Heuristic Programming System is a language, designed but not yet implemented, for research in artificial intelligence It will provide facilities for creating, modifying, and destroying complex hierarchically structured objects and descriptions of objects A search operation will be provided to retrieve objects which are specified by arbitrarily complex descriptions Another search operation will construct the desired objects according to the specifications of previously created doscriptlve objects, this will be rather like a syntax-directed compiler for a continuously changing ambiguous language 
 
A program for playing Go-Moku has been written using the System, the program features a highly efficient data structure, evaluation of feasible moves by alpha-beta minimax, and improvement of the move generation mechanism whenever the opponent makes a valuable but unexpected move.
