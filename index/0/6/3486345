With the increasing breadth and sophistication of open-source languages, libraries, frameworks, standards, tools and resources, Mobile Web App development is possible for a broad audience. The barriers to participation in app development have been reduced; learners can quickly begin creating simple apps and can use online resources to expand their knowledge and skill. In this workshop, participants will learn how to build simple (and not-so-simple) data-driven, mobile apps using the Mobile Web App model, and they'll learn how to scaffold projects to focus students' efforts on specific lesson, unit or assignment goals. The workshop is intended for post-secondary, secondary and even middle school educators who want to increase student engagement by including app projects in their courses. The material may also be of interest to those who provide CS education in other, less-structured environments. Participants will create several apps and will leave with sample projects. All languages, libraries, frameworks, standards, tools and resources are open-source and run in the browser. Because participants will be developing apps during the workshop, they will need a laptop or will need to work with a colleague.
