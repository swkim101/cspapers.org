In this work we propose methods to label probabilistic synchronous context-free grammar (PSCFG) rules using only word tags, generated by either part-of-speech analysis or unsupervised word class induction. The proposals range from simple tag-combination schemes to a phrase clustering model that can incorporate an arbitrary number of features. 
 
Our models improve translation quality over the single generic label approach of Chiang (2005) and perform on par with the syntactically motivated approach from Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) on the NIST large Chinese-to-English translation task. These results persist when using automatically learned word tags, suggesting broad applicability of our technique across diverse language pairs for which syntactic resources are not available.
