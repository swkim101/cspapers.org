We address the problem of segmenting 3D scan data into objects or object classes. Our segmentation framework is based on a subclass of Markov random fields (MRFs) which support efficient graph-cut inference. The MRF models incorporate a large set of diverse features and enforce the preference that adjacent scan points have the same classification label. We use a recently proposed maximum-margin framework to discriminatively train the model from a set of labeled scans; as a result we automatically learn the relative importance of the features for the segmentation task. Performing graph-cut inference in the trained MRF can then be used to segment new scenes very efficiently. We test our approach on three large-scale datasets produced by different kinds of 3D sensors, showing its applicability to both outdoor and indoor environments containing diverse objects.
