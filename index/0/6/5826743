Digital image registration is very important in many applications such as medical imagery, robotics, and remote sensing. Image registration determines the relative orientation between two or more images. NASA's Mission To Planet Earth (MTPE) program will soon produce enormous Earth data, reaching hundreds of Gbytes per day. Analysis of such data requires accurate and fast registration. We describe a fast algorithm for parallel image registration. Performance of the algorithm is analyzed and experimentally evaluated. It will be shown that the algorithm provides substantial computational savings and the measurements reveal many important characteristics of contemporary high performance computers.
