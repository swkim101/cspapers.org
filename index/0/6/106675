In this paper, we argue for embodied corrversational charactersas the logical extension of the metaphor of human - computerinteraction as a conversation. We argue that the only way to fullymodel the richness of human I&+ to-face communication is torely on conversational analysis that describes sets ofconversational behaviors as fi~lfilling conversational functions,both interactional and propositional. We demonstrate how toimplement this approach in Rea, an embodied conversational agentthat is capable of both multimodal input understanding and outputgeneration in a limited application domain. Rea supports bothsocial and task-oriented dialogue. We discuss issues that need tobe addressed in creating embodied conversational agents, anddescribe the architecture of the Rea interface.
