Input shaping techniques for vibration control of flexible structures received many interest due to its simplicity and efficiency proven in various practical cases. This paper proposes an adaptation of those techniques by addressing two main specificities of robot manipulators. As a first contribution, the design of input shapers for multiple-input and multiple-modes complex robot is studied. Design indicators based on elastic-dynamic model are proposed in order to choose one input shaper design among thousands of possible combinations. As a second contribution, the vibration mode frequency evolution of robot manipulators over their workspace is compensated by an adaptive control scheme. It is proposed to interpolate the modal variations over the workspace and tune the input shaper parameters dynamically. This contribution is implemented on a large scale flexible robot and shows promising results.
