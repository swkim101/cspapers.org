De novo Sequencing of peptides is a challenging task in proteome research. While there exist reliable DNA-sequencing methods, the high-throughput de novo sequencing of proteins by mass spectrometry is still an open problem. Current approaches suffer from a lack in precision to detect mass peaks in the spectrograms. In this paper we present a novel method for de novo peptide sequencing based on a hidden Markov model. Experiments effectively demonstrate that this new method significantly outperforms standard approaches in matching quality.
