We explore a variety of interaction and visualization techniques for fluid navigation, segmentation, linking, and annotation of digital videos. These techniques are developed within a concept prototype called LEAN that is designed for use with pressure-sensitive digitizer tablets. These techniques include a transient position+velocity widget that allows users not only to move around a point of interest on a video, but also to rewind or fast forward at a controlled variable speed. We also present a new variation of fish-eye views called twist-lens, and incorporate this into a position control slider designed for the effective navigation and viewing of large sequences of video frames. We also explore a new style of widgets that exploit the use of the pen's pressure-sensing capability, increasing the input vocabulary available to the user. Finally, we elaborate on how annotations referring to objects that are temporal in nature, such as video, may be thought of as links, and fluidly constructed, visualized and navigated.
