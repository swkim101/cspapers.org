lle main goal of this paper is to give an efficient algorithm for the Tree Pattern Matching problem. We also introduce and give an efficient algorithm for the Subset Matching problem. The Subset Matching problem is to find all occurrences of a pattern string p of length m in a text string t of length n, where each pattern and text location is a set of characters drawn from some alphabet. The pattern is said to occur at text position i if the set p~] is a subset of the set t[i + j â€“ 1], for allj, 1< j < m. Wegivean O((s+ n)log2 mlog(s + n)) randomized algorithm for this problem, wheres denotes the sum of the sizes of all the sets. Then we reduce the Tree Pattern Matching problem to a number of instances of the Subset Matching problem. This reduction takes linear time and the sum of the sizes of the Subset Matching problems obtained is also linear. Coupled with our first result, this implies an O(n logz m log n) time randomized algorithm for the Tree Pattern Matching problem.
