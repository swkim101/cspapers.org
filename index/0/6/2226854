In this paper we tackle a challenging name tagging problem in an emergent setting the tagger needs to be complete within a few hours for a new incident language (IL) using very few resources. Inspired by observing how human annotators attack this challenge, we propose a new expectation-driven learning framework. In this framework we rapidly acquire, categorize, structure and zoom in on ILspecific expectations (rules, features, patterns, gazetteers, etc.) from various non-traditional sources: consulting and encoding linguistic knowledge from native speakers, mining and projecting patterns from both mono-lingual and cross-lingual corpora, and typing based on cross-lingual entity linking. We also propose a cost-aware combination approach to compose expectations. Experiments on seven low-resource languages demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of this framework: we are able to setup a name tagger for a new IL within two hours, and achieve 33.8%-65.1% F-score 1.
