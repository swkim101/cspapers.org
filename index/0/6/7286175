As the artificial intelligence (AI) systems in military simulations and computer games become more complex, their actions become increasingly difficult for users to understand. Expert systems for medical diagnosis have addressed this challenge though the addition of explanation generation systems that explain a system's internal processes. This paper describes the AI architecture and associated explanation capability used by Full Spectrum Command, a training system developed for the U.S. Army by commercial game developers and academic researchers.
