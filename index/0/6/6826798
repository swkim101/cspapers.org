In recent years, the rapid development of smartphone subscribers has played an important role in the trend of moving applications from computers to mobile devices. There are thousands of new mobile applications uploaded in the online stores daily in many fields like education, entertainment, healthcare, etc. This paper describes the design and implementation of multilanguage name card reader on Android platform which is the most popular mobile operating system. We use the built-in camera of smartphone to capture name card image or load available image from memory. This image will be rectified by using several image processing techniques before converted to characters by using Tesseract OCR engine. We define the templates of information for pattern matching and use Google application programming interface (API) to extract full name, mobile number, and email address to fill in the new contact importing form.
