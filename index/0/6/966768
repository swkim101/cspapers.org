A new intensity-based approach to the classification of edges was developed and implemented. Using basic continuity and independence properties of scenes and images, signatures were deduced for each of several edge types expressed in terms of correlational properties of the image intensities in the neighborhood of the edge. This procedure's ability to discriminate occluding contours from cast shadow boundaries was demonstrated for cases where line junction cues are absent from the image.
