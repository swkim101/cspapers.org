Host mobility complicates the standard networking model in unexpected ways. It increases network heterogeneity, causing difficulty within applications that expect a high or constant amount of network bandwidth. Mobility increases cost when a user switches from a relatively inexpensive high bandwidth network to a low bandwidth pay‐by‐call or pay‐by‐byte network. Mobility may also reduce security when a user moves from a “safe” network onto a foreign one. This situation can be improved by introducing a proxy between the mobile client and its peer. The purpose of this intermediary is to process data moving between the client and peer. The type of processing performed depends on the desired result: the proxy can hide network heterogeneity via data filtering, reduce cost by using compression, and increase security through the use of secure protocols between the client and proxy. This paper presents a general purpose proxy system and how it has been applied to the mobile environment. The overall architecture is described, examples of its use given, and a study on its feasibility and performance is presented.
