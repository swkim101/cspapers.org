Courses in Relational Databases largely use a domain-specific design approach different from that used in the rest of the curriculum. Use of the Unified Process, UML, and Design Patterns as a pedagogical approach for Databases can leverage previous student experience with design, make knowledge from Database courses more immediately relevant elsewhere, and create greater continuity across the curriculum. This approach allows issues in logical design and in implementation to be more easily connected with similar concerns in other courses (for example, Software Engineering), and supports greater and easier transfer of design between Relational and Object-Oriented Databases, and between databases and embedding applications.
