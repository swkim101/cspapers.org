Recently, approximation analysis has been extensively used to study algorithms for routing weighted packets in various network settings. Although different techniques were applied in the analysis of diverse models, one common property was evident: the analysis of input sequences composed solely of two different values is always substantially easier, and many results are known only for restricted value sequences. Motivated by this, we introduce our zero-one principle for switching networks which characterizes a wide range of algorithms for which achieving c-approximation (as well as c-competitiveness) with respect to sequences composed of 0's and 1's implies achieving c-approximation. The zero-one principle proves to be very efficient in the design of switching algorithms, and substantially facilitates their analysis. We present three applications. First, we consider the Multi-Queue QoS Switching model and design a 3-competitive algorithm, improving the result from [6]. Second, we study the Weighted Dynamic Routing problem on a line topology of length k and present a (k+1)-competitive algorithm, which improves and generalizes the results from [1,12]. As a third application, we consider the work of [11], that compares the performance of local algorithms to the global optimum in various network topologies, and generalize their results from 2-value sequences to arbitrary value sequences.
