We investigate profile diversity, a novel idea in searching scientic documents. Combining keyword relevance with popularity in a scoring function has been the subject of different forms of social relevance [2, 6, 9]. Content diversity has been thoroughly studied in search and advertising [4, 11], database queries [16, 5, 8], and recommendations [17, 10, 18]. We believe our work is the first to investigate profile diversity to address the problem of returning highly popular but too-focused documents. We show how to adapt Fagin's threshold-based algorithms to return the most relevant and most popular documents that satisfy content and profile diversities and run preliminary experiments on two benchmarks to validate our scoring function.
