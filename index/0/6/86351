In the present study, we applied the principles of passive dynamic walking onto the three dimensional motion of a simplified quadrupedal model. We extended the simulation framework of a planar system to include a rolling degree of freedom and searched for limit cycles that represent periodic gaits. Among the eight different gaits that we identified, were three kinds of trots and paces, as well as a lateral and diagonal single foot sequence. We could show that a distinct relation exists between the lateral spacing of the legs and the relative phase of the front and the back legs, and a certain trade-off between efficiency and dynamic stability. In agreement with established bipedal models, our results showed that the lateral rolling motion is invariably unstable.
