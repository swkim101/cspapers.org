As cloud applications proliferate and data-processing demands increase, server resources must grow to unleash the performance of emerging workloads that scale well with large number of compute nodes. Nevertheless, power has become a crucial bottleneck that restricts horizontal scaling (scale out) of server systems, especially in datacenters that employ power over-subscription. When a data-center hits the maximum capacity of its power provisioning equipment, the owner has to either build another facility or upgrade existing utility power infrastructure — both approaches add huge capital expenditure, require significant construction lead time, and can further increase the owner's carbon footprint. This paper proposes Oasis, a power provisioning scheme for enabling power-/carbon-constrained datacenter servers to scale out economically and sustainably. Oasis naturally supports incremental power capacity expansion with near-zero environmental impact as it takes advantages of modular renewable energy system and emerging distributed battery architecture. It allows scale-out data-center to double its capacity using 100% green energy with up to 25% less overhead cost. This paper also describes our implementation of Oasis prototype and introduces our multi-source driven power management scheme Ozone. Ozone allows Oasis to identify the most suitable power supply control strategies and adjust server load cooperatively to maximize overall system efficiency and reli­ability. Our results show that Ozone could reduce the performance degradation of Oasis to 1%, extend Oasis battery lifetime by over 50%, and almost triple the average battery backup capacity which is crucial for mission-critical systems.
