AI-STARS is a lexicon-assisted full-text Information Retrieval system, designed for use in a dynamic corporate environment. In this paper, we explore how the requirements of such an environment have influenced many key aspects of the design and implementation of the AI-STARS system. We promote the use of “views” to create logical partitions in large, heterogeneous databases, and argue that storing not only article instances, but also class defhitions, stored queries, display templates and linguistic data in a single object repository has consequences that can be exploited for schema and lexicon evolution, security and subject filtering, information navigation, and data distribution.
