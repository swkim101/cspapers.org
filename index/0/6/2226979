This paper presents the project LEBONED that focuses on the integration of digital libraries and their contents into web-based learning environments. After discussing the several important aspects that have to be considered for this task, we describe in general how the architecture of a standard Learning Management System has to be modified to enable the integration of digital libraries. The LEBONED Metadata Architecture is an important part of this modification: it describes the handling of metadata and documents imported from digital libraries. Apart from a general description of this architecture, the contribution focuses on two selected aspects. On the one hand we present the metadata format lxSCORM, a downwards compatible extension of standard SCORM that has been developed to enable the appropriate description and use of imported documents. On the other hand, the fragmentation of imported documents of different types and file formats is a special problem that is not considered by standard Learning Management Systems so far. This paper presents our approach for the extraction of single components (like images) from monolithic documents that enables the appropriate reuse of existing learning materials.
