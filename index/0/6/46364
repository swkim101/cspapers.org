Query segmentation is essential to query processing. It aims to tokenize query words into several semantic segments and help the search engine to improve the precision of retrieval. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised learning approach to query segmentation based on principal eigenspace similarity of query-word-frequency matrix derived from web statistics. Experimental results show that our approach could achieve superior performance of 35.8% and 17.7% in F-measure over the two baselines respectively, i.e. MI (Mutual Information) approach and EM optimization approach.
