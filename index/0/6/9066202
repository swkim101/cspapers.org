We study a bichromatic version of the well-known <i>k-set problem</i>: given two sets <i>R</i> and <i>B</i> of points of total size <i>n</i> and an integer <i>k</i>, how many subsets of the form (R∩h)∪(B\ h) can have size exactly <i>k</i> over all halfspaces h? In the dual, the problem is asymptotically equivalent to determining the worst-case combinatorial complexity of the <i>k-level</i> in an arrangement of <i>n halfspaces.</i>
 Disproving an earlier conjecture by Linhart (1993), we present the first nontrivial upper bound for all <i>k</i> ≪ n in two dimensions: O(<i>nk</i><sup>1/3</sup> + n<sup>5/6--∈</sup><i>k</i><sup>2/3+2∈</sup> + <i>k</i><sup>2</sup>) for any fixed ∈ > 0. In three dimensions, we obtain the bound O(<i>nk</i><sup>3/2</sup> +n<sup>0.5034</sup><i>k</i><sup>2.4932</sup> + <i>k</i><sup>3</sup>). Incidentally, this also implies a new upper bound for the original k-set problem in four dimensions: O(n<sup>2</sup>k<sup>3/2</sup>+n<sup>1.5034</sup><i>k</i><sup>2.4932</sup>+nk<sup>3</sup>), which improves the best previous result for all <i>k</i> ≪ n<sup>0.923</sup>. Extensions to other cases, such as arrangements of disks, are also discussed.
