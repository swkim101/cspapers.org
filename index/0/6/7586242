We describe a method for learning dexterous manipulation skills with a pneumatically-actuated tendon-driven 24-DoF hand. The method combines iteratively refitted time-varying linear models with trajectory optimization, and can be seen as an instance of model-based reinforcement learning or as adaptive optimal control. Its appeal lies in the ability to handle challenging problems with surprisingly little data. We show that we can achieve sample-efficient learning of tasks that involve intermittent contact dynamics and under-actuation. Furthermore, we can control the hand directly at the level of the pneumatic valves, without the use of a prior model that describes the relationship between valve commands and joint torques. We compare results from learning in simulation and on the physical system. Even though the learned policies are local, they are able to control the system in the face of substantial variability in initial state.
