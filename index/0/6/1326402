For XML-based applications in general and B2B applications in particular, mapping between differently structured XML documents, to enable exchange of data, is a basic problem. A generic solution to the problem is of interest and desirable both in an academic and practical sense. We present a case study of the problem that arises in an XML based project, which involves mapping of different XML schemas to each other. We describe our approach to solving the problem, its advantages and limitations. We also compare and contrast our approach with previously known approaches and commercially available software solutions.
