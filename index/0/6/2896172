Estimating 3D human pose from 2D joint locations is central to the analysis of people in images and video. To address the fact that the problem is inherently ill posed, many methods impose a prior over human poses. Unfortunately these priors admit invalid poses because they do not model how joint-limits vary with pose. Here we make two key contributions. First, we collect a motion capture dataset that explores a wide range of human poses. From this we learn a pose-dependent model of joint limits that forms our prior. Both dataset and prior are available for research purposes. Second, we define a general parametrization of body pose and a new, multi-stage, method to estimate 3D pose from 2D joint locations using an over-complete dictionary of poses. Our method shows good generalization while avoiding impossible poses. We quantitatively compare our method with recent work and show state-of-the-art results on 2D to 3D pose estimation using the CMU mocap dataset. We also show superior results using manual annotations on real images and automatic detections on the Leeds sports pose dataset.
