In this paper, we describe the performance characteristics of GRAPE-6, the sixth-generation special-purpose computer for gravitational many-body problems. GRAPE-6 consists of 2048 custom pipeline chips, each of which integrates six pipeline processors specialized for the calculation of gravitational interaction between particles. The GRAPE hardware performs the evaluation of the interaction. The frontend processors perform all other operations, such as the time integration of the orbits of particles, I/O, on-the-fly analysis etc. The theoretical peak speed of GRAPE-6 is 63.4 Tflops. We present the result of benchmark runs, and discuss the performance characteristics. We also present the measured performance for a few real scientific applications. The best performance so far achieved with real applications is 35.3 Tflops.
