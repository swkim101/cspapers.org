Transcripts of meetings are a document genre characterized by a complex narrative structure. The essence is not only what is said, but also by who and to whom. This paper investigates whether we can use semantic annotations like the speaker in order to capture this debate structure, as well as the related content of the debate. The structure is visualized in a graph, while the content is condensed into word clouds, that are created using a parsimonious language model. Evaluation shows that both tools adequately capture the structure and content of the debate at an aggregated level.
