In this paper, we propose the method that reduces the power consumption by decreasing the network traffic on the ZED having the power saving feature. By using the proposed method, in order to recognize the ON-point time period of the ZEDpsilas RF receiver, the parent node does not receive a data request periodically from the ZED. Therefore, the network traffic between the ZED and the parent node is reduced. This method is used to transmit the data efficiently and reliably. Based on the current ZigBee stack application support sub-layer (APS), we present the ZigBee end device data transmission (ZEDDT) method. The simulation results by Network Simulator-2 (NS2) are included in order to demonstrate the validity and the usefulness of the proposed method.
