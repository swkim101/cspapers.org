This work proposes an innovative app 
navigation path-planning problem 
exploration rovers by including terrain characteristics. 
The objective is to enhance the typical 2D arithmetical 
cost function by adding 3D information computed from 
the laser-scanned terrain such as terrain height, slopes, 
shadows, orientation and terrain roughness. 
This paper describes the algorithm developed by UPM 
and GMV and the tests made at the GMV outdoor test 
facilities using the Moon-Hound rover. This rover is a 
50 Kg rover including a Sick laser mounted on a 
pan&tilt unit for generation of 3D Digital Elevation 
Models (DEMâ€™s). Experimental results have shown the 
effectiveness of the proposed approach.
