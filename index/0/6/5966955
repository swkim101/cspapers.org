We consider the Markov Reference Model (MRM) of pro grant behavior. MRM generates sequences of page requests according to a discrete-time homogeneous Markov chain. We invalidate MRM for instruction traces by means of a cost independent test that is a speci&ation of the x2 test used in non-parametric statistics. We also find that observed traces have less entropy than MRM traces, which suggests that MRM does not capture the locality and structure of observed traces. Finally, we verify our results in terms of LRU
