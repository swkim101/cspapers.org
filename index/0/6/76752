Starting with the release of Denning et al’s “Computing as a Discipline” report, there has been a growing recognition that computing curricula need to expose students early to the breadth of the field. “Breadth” is generally taken to mean exposure to a variety of the sub-areas in which computing professionals work, the issues with which they concern themselves, or the methods of inquiry that they practice. Beyond this basic outline, however, there is a startling diversity of ideas about what form breadth should take in the introductory curriculum. Approaches to breadth range from labs that introduce certain sub-areas in otherwise traditional courses, to single courses that survey multiple sub-areas and issues, to course sequences that explore sub-areas and issues in relative depth. A faculty workshop at Bowdoin College in the summer of 1992 examined several early implementations of breadth in introductory computing curricula. Subsequent workshops in 1993 and ’94 monitored the evolution of these implementations and the development of new ones created by workshop participants.1 This panel is based on results from these workshops. The panelists, all workshop participants, will describe their visions of breadth and the ways in which they have translated those visions into courses and course materials. Each panelist will briefly (10 to 12 minutes) describe their work, after which the audience will ask questions and describe their own 1 The workshopswere organiz~ by Allen Tucker of Bowdoin College,A.
