Mining of transliterations from comparable or parallel text can enhance natural language processing applications such as machine translation and cross language information retrieval. This paper presents an enhanced transliteration mining technique that uses a generative graph reinforcement model to infer mappings between source and target character sequences. An initial set of mappings are learned through automatic alignment of transliteration pairs at character sequence level. Then, these mappings are modeled using a bipartite graph. A graph reinforcement algorithm is then used to enrich the graph by inferring additional mappings. During graph reinforcement, appropriate link reweighting is used to promote good mappings and to demote bad ones. The enhanced transliteration mining technique is tested in the context of mining transliterations from parallel Wikipedia titles in 4 alphabet-based languages pairs, namely English-Arabic, English-Russian, English-Hindi, and English-Tamil. The improvements in F1-measure over the baseline system were 18.7, 1.0, 4.5, and 32.5 basis points for the four language pairs respectively. The results herein outperform the best reported results in the literature by 2.6, 4.8, 0.8, and 4.1 basis points for the four language pairs respectively.
