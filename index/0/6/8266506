Video entity linking, which connects online videos to the related entities in a semantic knowledge base, can enable a wide variety of video based applications including video retrieval and video recommendation. Most existing systems for video entity linking rely on video metadata. In this paper, we propose to exploit video visual content to improve video entity linking. In the proposed framework, videos are first linked to entity candidates using a text-based method. Next, the entity candidates are verified and reranked according to visual content. In order to properly handle large variations in visual content matching, we propose to use Multiple Instance Metric Learning to learn a "set to sequence" metric for this specific matching problem. To evaluate the proposed framework, we collect and annotate 1912 videos crawled from the YouTube open API. Experiment results have shown consistent gains by the proposed framework over several strong baselines.
