We present a flow-sensitive interprocedural constant propagation algorithm, which supports recursion while only performing one flow-sensitive analysis of each procedure. We present experimental results which show that this method finds substantially more constants than previous methods and is efficient in practice. We introduce new metrics for evaluating interprocedural constant propagation algorithms which measure the number of interprocedural constant values that are propagated. We use these metrics to provide further experimental results for our algorithm.
