INTRODUCTION: ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY Echocardiogmphy is a noninvasive ultrasound technique that allows two-dimensional real-time imaging of cardiac function. By aligning an external “probe” at a limited number of sites, it is possible to generate different “views” of cardiac function which can be used for diagnosis. Despite the importance of this technique, diagnostic training is usually restricted to a small group of residents because of the demands of individualized training by a specialist in radiology or cardiology. In order to overcome this obstacle, we are evaluating a hypermedia system as a means to provide such individualized training. Our implementation includes: echocardiograms from actual patient cases stored on videodisc; schematic images focusing on the essential elements in those displays; anatomical characterizations of the heart; textual descriptions of structure, function, and disease; organizational charts providing a means to associate various types of information; and cardiac sound as normally heard through a stethoscope.
