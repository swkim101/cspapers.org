Given a graph G and k pairs of vertices (s<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>1</sub>), ..., (s<sub>k</sub>, t<sub>k</sub>), the k-Vertex-Disjoint Paths problem asks for pair wise vertex-disjoint paths P<sub>1</sub>, ..., Pk such that Pi goes from si to ti. Schrijver [SICOMP'94] proved that the k-Vertex-Disjoint Paths problem on planar directed graphs can be solved in time <sup>nO(k)</sup>. We give an algorithm with running time 2<sup>2O(k2)</sup> * n<sup>O(1)</sup> for the problem, that is, we show the fixed-parameter tractability of the problem.
