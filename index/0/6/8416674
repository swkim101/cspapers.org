“Deep-syntactic” dependency structures bridge the gap between the surface-syntactic structures as produced by state-of-the-art dependency parsers and semantic logical forms in that they abstract away from surfacesyntactic idiosyncrasies, but still keep the linguistic structure of a sentence. They have thus a great potential for such downstream applications as machine translation and summarization. In this demo paper, we propose an online version of a deep-syntactic parser that outputs deep-syntactic structures from plain sentences and visualizes them using the Brat tool. Along with the deep-syntactic structures, the user can also inspect the visual presentation of the surface-syntactic structures that serve as input to the deep-syntactic parser and that are produced by the joint tagger and syntactic transition-based parser ran in the pipeline before deep-syntactic parsing takes place.
