In this paper, we describe the implementation of a novel system which enables a user to “carve” a simple free-standing electronic holographic image using a force-feedback device. The force-feedback (or haptic) device has a stylus which is held by the hand like an ordinary cutting tool. The 3D position of the stylus tip is reported by the device, and appropriate forces can be displayed to the hand as it interacts with 3D objects in the haptic workspace. The haptic workspace is spatially overlapped and registered with the holographic video display volume. Within the resulting coincident visuo-haptic workspace, a 3D synthetic cylinder is presented, spinning about its long axis, which a person can see, feel, and lathe with the stylus. This paper introduces the concept of coincident visuo-haptic display and describes the implementation of the lathe simulation. After situating the work in a research context, we present the details of system design and implementation, including the haptic and holographic modeling. Finally, we discuss the performance of this prototype system and future work.
