The human visual system can be characterized as a variable-resolution system: foveal information is processed at very high spatial resolution whereas peripheral information is processed at low spatial resolution. Various transforms have been proposed to model spatially varying resolution. Unfortunately, special sensors need to be designed to acquire images according to existing transforms. In this work, two models of fish-eye transform are presented. The validity of the transformations is demonstrated by fitting the alternative models to a real fish-eye lens.
