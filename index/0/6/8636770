We present a new retraction algorithm for high DOF articulated models and use our algorithm to improve the performance of RRT planners in narrow passages. The retraction step is formulated as a constrained optimization problem and performs iterative refinement on the boundary of C-Obstacle space. We also combine the retraction algorithm with decomposition planners to handle very high DOF articulated models. The performance of our approach is analyzed using Voronoi diagrams and we show that our retraction algorithm provides a good approximation to the ideal RRT-extension in constrained environments. We have implemented our algorithm and tested its performance on robots with more than 40 DOFs in complex environments. In practice, we observe significant performance (2â€“80X) improvement over prior RRT planners on challenging scenarios with narrow passages.
