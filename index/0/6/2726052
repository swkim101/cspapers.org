In this paper, we present the GAMMA system, which facilitates remote monitoring of deployed software using a new approach that exploits the opportunities presented by a software product being used by many users connected through a network. GAMMA splits monitoring tasks across different instances of the software, so that partial information can be collected from different users by means of light-weight instrumentation, and integrated to gather the overall monitoring information. This system enables software producers (1) to perform continuous, minimally intrusive analyses of their software's behavior, and (2) to use the information thus gathered to improve and evolve their software.
