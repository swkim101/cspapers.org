An interactive method of analog computer circuit diagram generation is described which utilizes symmetric list processing techniques as a basis for its data structure. The resultant program, known as DISPLAY, permits generation, maintenance, and modification of analog circuit diagrams from a graphics terminal, with the added capability of directly generating a set of differential equations which can link to an analysis program known as Equation Verification (EV), to obtain static and dynamic solutions of the time response of the analog circuit elements. The program was developed to aid simulation engineers to maintain up-to-date documentation, storage, and retrieval of schematic information in a list processing formulation which simplifies the programming effort considerably. Examples of the input and graphical output are given, along with typical state equations used as input to the analysis program. DISPLAY is written in Fortran IV, and currently interfaces with a 4012 Tektronix Graphics Display Storage Terminal.
