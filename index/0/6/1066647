We investigate language models for informational and navigational web search. Retrieval on the web is a task that differs substantially from ordinary ad hoc retrieval. We perform an analysis of prior probability of relevance for a wide range of non-content features, shedding further light on the importance of non-content features for web retrieval. This directly explains the success or failure of various techniques, e.g., why the link topology is particularly helpful to single out important sites. Language models can naturally incorporate multiple document representations, as well as non-content information. For the former, we employ mixture language models based on document full-text, incoming anchor-text, and document titles. For the latter, we study a range of priors based on document length, URL structure, and link topology. We look at three types of topics--distillation, home page, and named page--as well as for a mixed query set. We find that the mixture models lead to considerable improvement of retrieval effectiveness for all topic types. The web-centric priors generally lead to further improvement of retrieval effectiveness.
