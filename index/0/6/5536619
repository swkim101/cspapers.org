Realityflythrough is a telepresence/tele-reality system that works in the dynamic, uncalibrated environments typically associated with ubiquitous computing. By harnessing networked mobile video cameras, it allows a user to remotely and immersively explore a physical space. RealityFlythrough creates the illusion of complete live camera coverage in a physical environment. This paper describes the architecture of RealityFlythrough, and evaluates it along three dimensions: (1) its support of the abstractions for infinite camera coverage, (2) its scalability, and (3) its robustness to changing user requirements.
