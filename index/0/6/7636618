Structured peer-to-peer overlay networks are widely exploited to build large-scale decentralized applications. Robustness to malicious nodes is an important and fundamental objective of designing an overlay network. The presence of even a small percentage of malicious nodes can present a serious threat to the stability of an overlay network. Existing approaches mainly utilize multiple paths to increase the probability of delivery. In this paper, we propose Fence that allows a source to diagnose possible forwarding faults injected by malicious nodes. Based on the feedback information, the source is able to identify malicious nodes and to achieve very robust message forwarding.
