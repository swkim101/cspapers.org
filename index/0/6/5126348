The robot finger force sensor needs tobe designed small in order to fit it in the top part of the robot finger. However, because the finger force sensor of small size has little possibility to be designed as complex structure, it is difficult to produce non-interacting signals from the sensor. In this paper, a trial production of the simple structure of a robot finger force sensor using a capacitance detector is described. Besides, a neural nework was used for processing interacting signals. Then, though there are a series interactions between each signal of output voltages and nonlinearity in this sensor, it is shown that the sensor acted effectivety as a robot finger force sensor. In addition, as compared with a conventional method using as inverse matrix, this new method is more accurate.
