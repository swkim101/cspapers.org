In this paper, we propose an efficient code overlay technique that automatically generates an overlay structure for a given memory size for multicores with explicitly-managed memory hierarchies. We observe that finding an efficient overlay structure with minimum memory copying overhead is similar to the problem that finds a code placement with minimum conflict misses in the instruction cache. Our algorithm exploits the temporal-ordering information between functions during program execution. Experimental results on the Cell BE processor indicate that our approach is effective and promising.
