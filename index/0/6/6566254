We study approximation algorithms for <i>k</i>-median clustering. We obtain small coresets for <i>k</i>-median clustering in metric spaces as well as in Euclidean spaces. Specifically, in R<sup>d</sup>, those coresets are of size with only <i>polynomial</i> dependency on <i>d</i>. This leads to a (1 + ε)-approximation algorithm for <i>k</i>-median clustering in R<sup>d</sup>, with running time <i>O</i>(<i>ndk</i> +2<sup>(k/ε)<sup><i>o</i>(1)</sup></sup><i>d</i><sup>2</sup><i>n</i>σ), for any σ > 0. This is an improvement over previous results [5, 20, 21]. We also provide fast constant factor approximation algorithms for <i>k</i>-median clustering in finite metric spaces.We use those coresets to compute (1 + ε)-approximation <i>k</i>-median clustering in the streaming model of computation, using only <i>O</i>(<i>k</i><sup>2</sup><i>de</i><sup>-2</sup>log<sup>8</sup> <i>n</i>) space, where the points are taken from R<sup>d</sup>. This is the first streaming algorithm, for this problem, that has space complexity with only <i>polynomial</i> dependency on the dimension.
