We describe the results of visualizing object oriented programs errors, and utilizing these results in the design of a set of visual queries on the runtime execution history of a program. We bring together under one coherent framework different approaches such as error classification, bug patterns in object oriented programs, and visual queries. Our work is founded on a novel interactive visualization system for Java called JIVE, developed at Buffalo.
