Back-end Data base machines receive considerable attention owing to their facility for improving performance of installations with heavy data base activity. 
 
Many prototype systems have been described in the litterature but few systems are commercially available. 
 
This paper presents a commercial back-end data base management machine called MIX (design code), which is developped by our company. 
 
The global architecture of this data base machine is described, and the principal issue, discussed here in, applies to its software.
