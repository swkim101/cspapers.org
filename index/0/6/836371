Driving is an integral part of our everyday lives, but it is also a time when people are uniquely vulnerable. Poor road condition, traffic congestion and long driving time may bring negative emotion to drivers and increase the chance of traffic accidents. We propose SAfeDJ, a situation-aware in-car music delivery application, which turns people's trips into pleasant journeys and driving into a safe and enjoyable activity. SAfeDJ aims at helping drivers to diminish fatigue and negative emotion. It is built on a vehicular healthcare platform that enables communications among drivers and integrates with multiple types of sensors to promote safe driving. Prototype implementation and initial results of SAfeDJ have demonstrated its desired functionality in drivers' daily lives and feasibility for real-world deployment.
