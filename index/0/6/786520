In this paper a model and a nonlinear control scheme for an atomic force microscope are developed. For this reason a backstepping control algorithm is developed to achieve asymptotic cantilever tip tracking for bounded tip trajectories. In addition, the micro cantilever is modeled by the interaction between sample and cantilever with the Van der waals attraction/repulsion force (i.e., the interaction forces). Simulation results obtained confirm the effectiveness and validity of the proposed controller.
