We consider for graphs of maximum degree Δ, the problem of determining whether &khgr;G) > Δ-<italic>k</italic> for various values of <italic>k</italic>. We obtain sharp theorems characterizing when the barrier to Δ-<italic>k</italic> colourability must be a local condition, i.e. a small subgraph, and when it can be global. We also show that for large fixed Δ, this problem is either NP-complete or can be solved in linear time, and we determine precisely which values of  <italic>k</italic> correspond to each case
 prove that Hitting Set with sets of size <italic>B</italic> is hard to approximate to within a factor $<italic>B</italic>^{1/19}$. The problem can be approximated to within a factor <italic>B</italic> [19], and it is the Vertex Cover problem for <italic>B</italic>=2. The relationship between hardness of approximation and set size seems to have not been explored before.
