This paper presents a new pairing protocol that allows twoCPU-constrained wireless devices Alice and Bob to establish ashared secret at a very low cost. To our knowledge, this is thefirst software pairing scheme that does not rely on expensivepublic-key cryptography, out-of-band channels (such as a keyboardor a display) or specific hardware, making it inexpensive andsuitable for CPU-constrained devices such as sensors.
In the described protocol, Alice can send the secret bit 1 toBob by broadcasting an (empty) packet with the source field set toAlice. Similarly, Alice can send the secret bit 0 to Bob bybroadcasting an (empty) packet with the source field set to Bob.Only Bob can identify the real source of the packet (since it didnot send it, the source is Alice), and can recover the secret bit(1 if the source is set to Alice or 0 otherwise). An eavesdroppercannot retrieve the secret bit since it cannot figure out whetherthe packet was actually sent by Alice or Bob. By randomlygenerating n such packets Alice and Bob can agree on ann-bit secret key.
Our scheme requires that the devices being paired, Alice andBob, are shaken during the key exchange protocol. This is toguarantee that an eavesdropper cannot identify the packets sent byAlice from those sent by Bob using data from the RSSI (ReceivedSignal Strength Indicator) registers available in commercialwireless cards. The proposed protocol works with off-the-shelf802.11 wireless cards and is secure against eavesdropping attacksthat use power analysis. It requires, however, some firmwarechanges to protect against attacks that attempt to identify thesource of packets from their transmission frequency.
