In this paper, we compare four distributed connection admission cent rol schemes in cellular networks \vherethe first two schemes are to keep the hand-off dropping probablht.y below a target vahte, the third scheme is to guarantee no hand-off drops through a per-connection bandwidth reservation, and the fourth scheme uses another type of percon nection bandwidth reservation. The first scheme predicts the bandwidth required to handle hand-offs by estimat ing possible hand-offs from adjacent cek, then performs the admission control for each newly-requested connection. On the other hand, the second scheme predicts the total required bandwidth in the current ce~ by =tirnating both incoming and outgoing hand-offs at each ce~. The third scheme requires the set of ce~s which the mobde with a newly-request ed connection WN traverse. and reserves bandwidth for each connection in each of those ce~s. The fourth scheme reserves bandwidth for each connection in the predicted next ce~ of a mobde. JVeadopt the history-based m~ bfity estimation for the first two schemes. Using extensive simulations, the four schemes are compared quantitatively in terms of (I) important performance measures such as the hand-off dropping probabtity, connection-blocking probabtity, and bandwidth utfization, (2) dependency on the design parameters, (3) dependency on the mob~lty estimation accuracy, and (4) complexity. The simulation results indlcate that the first scheme is the most. desirable in the sense that it achieves re~~onably good performance while requiring much less memory and computation than the other three schemes.
