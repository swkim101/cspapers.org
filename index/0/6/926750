A new architecture for identifying and interpreting temporal expressions is introduced, in which the large set of complex hand-crafted rules standard in systems for this task is replaced by a series of machine learned classifiers and a much smaller set of context-independent semantic composition rules. Experiments with the TERN 2004 data set demonstrate that overall system performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art, and that normalization performance is particularly good.
