The future success of application layer video multicast depends on the availability of video stream distribution methods that can scale in the number of stream senders and receivers. Previous work on the problem of application layer video streaming has not effectively addressed scalability in the number of receivers and senders. Therefore, new solutions that are amenable to analysis and can achieve scalable P2P video streaming are needed. In this work we propose the use of automated negotiation algorithms to construct video streaming trees at the application layer. We show that automated negotiation can effectively solve the problem of distributing a video stream to a large number of receivers.
