We present DiTaBBu, Digital Talking Books Builder, a framework for automatic production of time-based hypermedia for the Web, focusing on the Digital Talking Books domain. Delivering Digital Talking Books collections to a wide range of users is an expensive task, as it must take into account each user profile's different needs, therefore authoring should be dismissed in favour of automation. With DiTaBBu, we enable automated content delivery in several playback platforms, targeted to specific user needs, featuring powerful navigation capabilities over the content. DiTaBBu can also be used as testbed for prototyping novel capabilities, through its flexible extension mechanisms.
