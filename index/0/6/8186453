This keynote will highlight work from the Affective Computing group at the MIT Media Laboratory bringing new skills of emotional intelligence to mobile technology. Here are some of the things I plan to discuss and/or to demonstrate live: (1) New comfortable wearable technology for measuring physiological components of emotion, for example, I will show measurement of sympathetic nervous system activity using a new wrist-worn stretchy washable sensor and cardiovascular changes using regular earbuds plugged into your mobile phone; (2) Technology that reads facial expressions using a mobile device, which we are using to help people on the autism spectrum better learn about nonverbal communication; (3) Collection of affective information from mobile devices without being annoying, even when interrupting people over a dozen times a day; (4) Applications of these technologies to help people with sensory disorders, stress disorders, sleep disorders, and substance abuse. As time permits, I will also discuss a growing vision of how these new technologies can enable more research "by the people for the people.
