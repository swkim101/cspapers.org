We introduce a new sequential Monte Carlo algorithm we call the particle cascade. The particle cascade is an asynchronous, anytime alternative to traditional sequential Monte Carlo algorithms that is amenable to parallel and distributed implementations. It uses no barrier synchronizations which leads to improved particle throughput and memory efficiency. It is an anytime algorithm in the sense that it can be run forever to emit an unbounded number of particles while keeping within a fixed memory budget. We prove that the particle cascade provides an unbiased marginal likelihood estimator which can be straightforwardly plugged into existing pseudo-marginal methods.
