We give an overview of the main challenges in the specification, design, and verification of human cyber-physical systems, with a special focus on semi-autonomous vehicles. We identify unique characteristics of formal modeling, specification, verification and synthesis in this domain. Some initial results and design principles are presented along with directions for future work.
