We present the design and development of a Visual Learning Engine, a tool that can form the basis for interactive development of visually rich teaching and learning modules across multiple disciplines. The engine has three key features that makes it powerful and cross-disciplinary, (1) it is based on a finite state machine model, that supports concepts presented in any defined sequence, (2) instructional modules are designed and generated interactively using graphical interface widgets, facilitating non-programmers to use the system, and (3) ability to simultaneously present concepts and their visual representation that allows for a more intuitive and exploratory learning experience. We demonstrate a prototype of the learning engine by testing it on examples from Computer Science(sorting)algorithms, recursion) and Electrical Engineering (signal manipulations).
