We describe in this paper an effective data collection method for evaluating software development methodologies, from definition of the objectives of the data collection to analysis of the results. We show how the data analysis can answer questions with respect to how successfully the goals of the development methodology are met. The A-7 requirements document is used as an example. We provide the results of data analyses conducted partway through the A-7 flight software development cycle, and discuss the utility of information obtained by such partial analyses. Results from the study show that data collection is feasible and useful when performed as part of configuration control, that data distributions based on partial data provide useful feedback to the developers, and that the A-7 Requirements Document is easily maintained and changed.
