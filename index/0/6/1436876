An ultimate goal of traditional textual criticism is the reconstruction of the archetype of a given work. By comparing differences and similarities among multiple versions of the work, the interrelations among existing and hypothetical ancestral versions can be naturally presented as a tree, in which a branch represents derivation of a new version. We will present our investigation into the generation of phylogenetic trees with extant manuscripts at both leaves and internal nodes of the tree, and discuss algorithms for promoting leaf nodes to ancestral positions while optimizing the tree construction objective, based on the maximum parsimony criterion.
