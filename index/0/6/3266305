We employ concepts and tools from the theory of finite permutation groups in order to analyse the Hidden Subgroup Problem via Quantum Fourier Sampling (QFS) for the symmetric group. We show that under very general conditions both the weak and the random-strong form (strong form with random choices of basis) of QFS fail to provide any advantage over classical exhaustive search. In particular we give a complete characterisation of polynomial size subgroups, and of primitive subgroups, that can be distinguished from the identity subgroup with the above methods. Furthermore, assuming a plausible group theoretic conjecture for which we give supporting evidence, we show that weak and random-strong QFS for the symmetric group have no advantage whatsoever over classical search.
