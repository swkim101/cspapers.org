This paper presents an adaptive {\em migratory} scheme for software Distributed Shared Memory (DSM). On a migratory sharing, a message for sending a copy of a page to a remote node, on which a page fault occurs, is directly followed by an invalidation request from the remote node. Our adaptive migratory scheme eliminates an overhead for invalidation by {\em self-invalidation} on sending a copy of a page. Each node can independently detect {\em migratory} memory access pattern and {\em self-invalidate} local copy of a page by using the local information only. Experimental results show that the performance is improved by dynamically selecting the {\em migratory} protocol.
