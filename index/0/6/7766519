The need to represent mappings between different ontologies has been recognized as a result of the fact that different ontologies may partially overlap, or even represent the same domain from different points of view. Unlike ontology languages, work on languages to represent ontology mappings has not yet reached a state where a common understanding of the basic principles exists. In this paper we propose a formal comparison of existing mapping languages by translating them into distributed first order logic. This allows us to analyze underlying assumptions and differences in the interpretation of ontology mappings.
