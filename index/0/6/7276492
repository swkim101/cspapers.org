This paper presents a case study of the 10-Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) adapter from Intel R . Specifically, with appropriate optimizations to the configurations of the 10GbE adapter and TCP, we demonstrate that the 10GbE adapter can perform well in local-area, storage-area, system-area, and wide-area networks. For local-area, storage-area, and system-area networks in support of networks of workstations, network-attached storage, and clusters, respectively, we can achieve over 7-Gb/s end-to-end throughput and 12-Âµs end-to-end latency between applications running on Linux-based PCs. For the wide-area network in support of grids, we broke the recently-set Internet2 Land Speed Record by 2.5 times by sustaining an end-to-end TCP/IP throughput of 2.38 Gb/s between Sunnyvale, California and Geneva, Switzerland (i.e., 10,037 kilometers) to move over a terabyte of data in less than an hour. Thus, the above results indicate that 10GbE may be a cost-effective solution across a multitude of computing environments.
