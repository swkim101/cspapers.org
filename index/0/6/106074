This paper presents a preambleless communication system to realize industrial wireless control networks (WCN) which are characterized by short payloads and strict real-time requirements. The reduction of the preamble is greatly beneficial for the real-time operation because the transmission time of preambles is longer than that of the short payloads. Our system is implemented on a software defined radio (SDR) platform using GNU Radio toolkit. Experiments show the packet error rate (PER) performance is close to that of the theoretical value in an AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) environment. Demonstrations show the real-time remote control of inverted pendulums on this system.
