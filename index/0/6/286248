Question classification has become a crucial step in modern question answering systems. Previous work has demonstrated the effectiveness of statistical machine learning approaches to this problem. This paper presents a new approach to building a question classifier using log-linear models. Evidence from a rich and diverse set of syntactic and semantic features is evaluated, as well as approaches which exploit the hierarchical structure of the question classes.
