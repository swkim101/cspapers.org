This paper introduces a novel framework for homographic pun location identification. Two observations, the existence of the support term and the preferred positions of the pun in context, are considered as crucial hints for pun identification. We first nominate the pun candidates, and then select the most probable one based on various strategies. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.
