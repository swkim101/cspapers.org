This paper deals with translation ambiguity and target polysemy problems together. Two monolingual balanced corpora are employed to learn word co-occurrence for translation ambiguity resolution, and augmented translation restrictions for target polysemy resolution. Experiments show that the model achieves 62.92% of monolingual information retrieval, and is 40.80% addition to the select-all model. Combining the target polysemy resolution, the retrieval performance is about 10.11% increase to the model resolving translation ambiguity only.
