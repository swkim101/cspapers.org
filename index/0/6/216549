Unidirectional error protecting codes for VLSI memories are described. After developing the theory of unidirectional error detection and correction, optimal systematic codes capable of detecting unidirectional errors are presented. Efficient single error correcting and d(dâ‰¥2)-unidirectional error detecting codes are also discussed.
