Helping visually impaired people navigating and feeling the surrounding environment is a very important and useful task. In this paper, we propose working on visual analysis of environment surrounding the blind person. The analysis is based on GIST features extraction and k-NN method for classification. The analysis results will help blind person to understand where he is and what is happening. We have tested in real field with a pseudo blind person walking in the campus of Gent University with 6 changing scenes. The scene recognition rate is about 85% which make us a confidence to build description systems for blind people in reality.
