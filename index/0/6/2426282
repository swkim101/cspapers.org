We study properties of programs with monotone and convex constraints. We extend to these formalisms concepts and results from normal logic programming. They include tight programs and Fages Lemma, program completion and loop formulas, and the notions of strong and uniform equivalence with their characterizations. Our results form an abstract account of properties of some recent extensions of logic programming with aggregates, especially the formalism of smodels.
