This paper investigates an application of the ranked region algebra to information retrieval from large scale but unannotated documents. We automatically annotated documents with document structure and semantic tags by using taggers, and retrieve information by specifying structure represented by tags and words using ranked region algebra. We report in detail what kind of data can be retrieved in the experiments by this approach.
