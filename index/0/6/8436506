Previous approaches on 3D shape segmentation mostly rely on heuristic processing and hand-tuned geometric descriptors. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D shape representation learning approach, Directionally Convolutional Network (DCN), to solve the shape segmentation problem. DCN extends convolution operations from images to the surface mesh of 3D shapes. With DCN, we learn effective shape representations from raw geometric features, i.e., face normals and distances, to achieve robust segmentation. More specifically, a two-stream segmentation framework is proposed: one stream is made up by the proposed DCN with the face normals as the input, and the other stream is implemented by a neural network with the face distance histogram as the input. The learned shape representations from the two streams are fused by an element-wise product. Finally, Conditional Random Field (CRF) is applied to optimize the segmentation. Through extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-arts (both classic and deep learning-based) on a large variety of 3D shapes.
