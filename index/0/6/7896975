Operating system wrappers technology provides a means for providing fine grained controls on the operation of applications software. Application proxy firewalls can gain from this technology by wrapping the proxies, thus preventing bugs (or malicious software) in the proxy from subverting the intent of the firewall. We describe several experiments we performed with wrappers and firewalls, using several different firewalls and types of wrappers.
