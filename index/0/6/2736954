Computer Science Education Week activities, featuring online? programming tools embedded with tutorials, report large participation numbers. However, to truly broaden participation, activities need to be made accessible in international contexts. In 2014, Tecnológico de Monterrey and Instituto de Innovación y Transferencia de Tecnología de Nuevo León, modified the Scalable Game Design CS Ed Week activity to include a Mexican feasibility pilot study. The goal of the pilot was to broaden participation in Computer Science in Mexico by creating interest and demand in further activities, including launching of 2015 Mexico CS Ed Week. This paper reviews the initial results of this 2014 pilot, including the discussion of the unique challenges faced in this context, and examines efforts to make this activity more accessible and successful. In addition to pilot data highlighting future activity improvements, initial retention results show that despite challenges, Mexican students were able to effectively use the modified activity to create games on par with U.S. students.
