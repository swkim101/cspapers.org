We present a robust method for detecting and recognizing topological features in underground mines. Our method involves performing Delaunay triangulations on range scans to extract points of interest, such as intersecting corridors. By combining these interest points into a topological map, we have a valuable tool for navigation and localization in large scale, highly cyclic environments. We present results from a research coal mine near Pittsburgh, PA.
