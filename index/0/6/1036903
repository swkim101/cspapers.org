A parallel algorithm is work-optimal if it uses the srrlall-est possible work; a work-optimal algorithm is work-tirne-optimal if it also uses the smallest possible time. We design worl{-time-optirnal algorithm for a number of string processing problems on the EREW-PRAM and the hypercuhe, They include string matching and two dimensional pattern matching. No such algorithms have been known before for any of these probl~ms.
