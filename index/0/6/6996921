This thesis presents {\em SodaBot}, a general-purpose software agent user- environment and construction system. Its primary component is the {\em basic software agent} --- a computational framework for building agents which is essentially an {\em agent operating system}. We also present a new language for programming the basic software agent whose primitives are designed around human-level descriptions of agent activity. Via this programming language, {\em users can easily implement a wide-range of typical software agent applications}, e.g. personal on-line assistants and meeting scheduling agents. The SodaBot system has been implemented and tested, and its description comprises the bulk of this thesis.
