Abutruct : We addrcss the problem of planning robot motions i n a two-dimensional configuration space in the presence of uncertainty i n both con(.rol and sensing. We consider the preimage h i r k d m n i r t q ; i p p r o d i to this prol)letn, which was first proposed by Lozano-I’Crw, Mason a n d rPdylor (1984). Wc describe two practic;rl tccli tiiqilcs for computing prcimages. One technique, wliicli WL‘ ( : d l Oackprojcc/ion from slicking cdgcs, was originated I)y I ) o i i ; i 1 ~ 1 (1988). ‘l’lic other, wliicli we call backprojection j rom qoo[ kcrtiel , W ~ L R origin;rtctl by Latombe (1988). Both techniques
