The development of a new test collection is described in which the task is to search naturally occurring spoken content using naturally occurring spoken queries. To support research on speech retrieval for low-resource settings, the collection includes terms learned by zero-resource term discovery techniques. Use of a new tool designed for exploration of spoken collections provides some additional insight into characteristics of the collection.
