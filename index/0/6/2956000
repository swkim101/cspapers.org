The focus of this demonstration is the performance of streaming video over the mobile wireless channel. We compare two schemes: the standard approach to video which transmits H.264/AVC-encoded stream over 802.11-like PHY, and SoftCast -- a clean-slate design for wireless video where the source transmits one video stream that each receiver decodes to a video quality commensurate with its specific instantaneous channel quality.
