Despite the many replacement algorithms proposed throughout the years, approximations of Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement are predominant in actual virtual memory management systems because of their simplicity and efficiency. LRU, however, exhibits well-known performance problems for regular access patterns of size larger than the main memory. In this paper we present Early Eviction LRU (EELRU): an adaptive replacement algorithm based on the principle of detecting when the LRU algorithm underperforms (i.e., when the fetched memory pages are often the ones evicted lately). In simulations, EELRU proves to be quite effective for many memory sizes and several applications, often decreasing paging by over 30% for programs with large-scale reference patterns and by over lOSo for programs with small-scale patterns. Additionally, the algorithm is very robust, rarely underperforming LRU. Our experiments are mostly with traces from the recent research literature to allow for easy comparison with previous results.
