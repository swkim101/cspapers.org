This paper describes a security model for mobile agent based systems. The model defines the notion of a security-enhanced agent and outlines security management components in agent platform bases and considers secure migration of agents from one base to another. The security enhanced agent carries a passport that contains its security credentials and some related security code. Then we describe how authentication, integrity and confidentiality, and access control are achieved using the agentâ€™s passport and the security infrastructure in the agent bases. We also consider the types of access control policies that can be specified using the security enhanced agents and the policy base in the agent platforms. We discuss the application of the security model in roaming mobile agents and consider a simple scenario involving security auditing in networks.
