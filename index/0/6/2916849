ThingLab is a system that provides an environment fo r bui ld ing simulations. Wi th in this environment, a simulation is organized as a collection of objects that interact wi th one another by sending and receiving messages. Each object has a table of named properties, which describe both the internal state of the object and its protocol fo r sending and receiving messages. An object may have one or more parents, thus providing for inheritance of properties. The interactions of the objects in a simulation are specified in terms of constraints. The operation of merging is used to specify connectivity and to combine properties inherited f rom several parents.
