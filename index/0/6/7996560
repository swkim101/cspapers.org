Existing human action recognition systems for 3D sequences obtained from the depth camera are designed to cope with only one action category, either single-person action or two-person interaction, and are difficult to be extended to scenarios where both action categories co-exist. In this paper, we propose the category-blind human recognition method (CHARM) which can recognize a human action without making assumptions of the action category. In our CHARM approach, we represent a human action (either a single-person action or a two-person interaction) class using a co-occurrence of motion primitives. Subsequently, we classify an action instance based on matching its motion primitive co-occurrence patterns to each class representation. The matching task is formulated as maximum clique problems. We conduct extensive evaluations of CHARM using three datasets for single-person actions, two-person interactions, and their mixtures. Experimental results show that CHARM performs favorably when compared with several state-of-the-art single-person action and two-person interaction based methods without making explicit assumptions of action category.
