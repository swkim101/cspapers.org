We present GFL-Web, a web-based interface for syntactic dependency annotation with the lightweight FUDG/GFL formalism. Syntactic attachments are specified in GFL notation and visualized as a graph.

The open-source tool is easily installed and configured; it is available at: https://github.com/ Mordeaux/gfl _ web
