In this work we provide an initial analysis of service categorization, the process of associating services with ontologies. Service categorization is an important pre-processing step to tasks such as service composition. The absence of semantic understanding of services may yield erroneous compositions and therefore, service categorization can assist in determining the correctness of a composition. We analyze two common methods for text processing, TF/IDF and context analysis. We also test two types of service description, textual and WSDL. Our initial results indicate that context analysis is more useful than TF/IDF and that WSDL description provides better categorization than textual description.
