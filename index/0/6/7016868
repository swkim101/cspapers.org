We present a theorem-prover for quantified Boolean formulae and evaluate it on random quantified formulae and formulae that represent problems from automated planning. Even though the notion of quantified Boolean formula is theoretically important, automated reasoning with QBF has not been thoroughly investigated. Universal quantifiers are needed in representing many computational problems that cannot be easily translated to the propositional logic and solved by satisfiability algorithms. Therefore efficient reasoning with QBF is important. The Davis-Putnam procedure can be extended to evaluate quantified Boolean formulae. A straightforward algorithm of this kind is not very efficient. We identify universal quantifiers as the main area where improvements to the basic algorithm can be made. We present a number of techniques for reducing the amount of search that is needed, and evaluate their effectiveness by running the algorithm on a collection of formulae obtained from planning and generated randomly. For the structured problems we consider, the techniques lead to a dramatic speed-up.
