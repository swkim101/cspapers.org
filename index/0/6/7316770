The computing landscape is shifting towards mobile devices. To learn about operating systems, it is increasingly important for students to gain hands-on kernel programming experience in these environments, which are quite different from traditional desktops and servers. We present our work at Columbia University to teach operating systems using Android, an open, commercially supported software platform increasingly used on mobile and embedded devices. We introduce a series of five Android kernel programming projects suitable for a one semester introductory operating systems course. Each project teaches a core operating system concept infused with Android or mobile device specific context, such as Android specific process relationships, use of sensors, and design considerations for resource constrained mobile devices. We also introduce an Android virtual laboratory based on virtual appliances, distributed version control, and live demonstrations which gives students hands-on Android experience, with minimal computing infrastructure. We have used these Android kernel programming projects and the Android virtual lab to teach an introductory operating systems course. Although this was our first time teaching the course using Android, over 80% of students surveyed enjoyed using Android and the majority of students preferred Android to traditional desktop development.
