Grid computing is now mature enough and important enough to be studied as a full course at the undergraduate level for upper-level computer science majors. We have developed such a course, including a set of lecture slides, assignments, and assignment handouts specifically targeted for this audience. The sequence of assignments is a key part of the course. Some of the assignments are modifications of pre-existing work and others are completely new. We describe the key decisions we made about the course organization and content and describe the assignments. An important feature of the course is that it was geographically distributed with copies of the grid software installed at three campuses. Those campuses plus three others were receiving sites and included students and faculty associated with nine universities.
