The paper presents an approach to detection of service interaction. Service interaction manifests itself as a function of services which is neither exactly the sum of every service nor behaves as expected. In Customized Application for Mobile network Enhanced Logic (CAMEL), services may interact both in call-related and call-unrelated context. Description logic is used to formally define the CAMEL basic call state models and mobility management model each of which may trigger services. The service behavior is considered as satisfiability problem which may be solved automatically using tableau calculus.
