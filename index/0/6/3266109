We present an algorithm for maintaining the width of a planar point set dynamically, as points are inserted or deleted. Our algorithm takes time O(kn^epsilon) per update, where k is the amount of change the update causes in the convex hull, n is the number of points in the set, and epsilon is any arbitrarily small constant. For incremental or decremental update sequences, the amortized time per update is O(n^epsilon).
