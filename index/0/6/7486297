This paper describes a new program for attracting non-traditional students into computer science and retaining them through sustained peer and faculty mentoring. The program is centered on socially-inspired learning, - learning in and for a community. It consists of a STEM Incubator course, hands-on projects with real-world applications, a sandbox lab, and a mentoring system that begins in the STEM Incubator course and continues with students who choose to remain involved in projects and courses. Our program is in its second year. Data collected on enrollment and retention and results of student questionnaires show promise for the success and sustainability of the program.
