Requirements incompleteness is often the result of unanticipated adverse conditions which prevent the software and its environment from behaving as expected. These conditions represent risks that can cause severe software failures. The identification and resolution of such risks is therefore a crucial step towards requirements completeness. Obstacle analysis is a goal-driven form of risk analysis that aims at detecting missing conditions that can obstruct goals from being satisfied in a given domain, and resolving them. This paper proposes an approach for automatically revising goals that may be under-specified or (partially) wrong to resolve obstructions in a given domain. The approach deploys a learning-based revision methodology in which obstructed goals in a goal model are iteratively revised from traces exemplifying obstruction and non-obstruction occurrences. Our revision methodology computes domain-consistent, obstruction-free revisions that are automatically propagated to other goals in the model in order to preserve the correctness of goal models whilst guaranteeing minimal change to the original model. We present the formal foundations of our learning-based approach, and show that it preserves the properties of our formal framework. We validate it against the benchmarking case study of the London Ambulance Service.
