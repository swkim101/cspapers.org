A low-distortion embedding between two metric spaces is a mapping which preserves the distances between each pair of points, up to a small factor called distortion. Low-distortion embeddings have recently found numerous applications in computer science.Most of the known embedding results are "absolute",that is, of the form: any metric <i>Y</i> from a given class of metrics <i>C</i> can be embedded into a metric <i>X</i> with low distortion <i>c</i>. This is beneficial if one can guarantee low distortion for all metrics <i>Y</i> in <i>C</i>. However, in any situations, the worst-case distortion is too large to be meaningful. For example, if <i>X</i> is a line metric, then even very simple metrics (an <i>n</i> - point star or an <i>n</i> -point cycle) are embeddable into <i>X</i> only with distortion linear in <i>n</i>. Nevertheless, embeddings into the line (or into low-dimensional spaces) are important for many applications.A solution to this issue is to consider "relative" (or "approximation") embedding problems, where the goal is to design an (a-approxiation) algorithm which, given any metric <i>X</i> from <i>C</i> as an input, finds an embedding of <i>X</i> into <i>Y</i> which has distortion <i>a</i> *<i>c</i><inf><i>Y</i></inf> (<i>X</i>), where <i>c</i><inf><i>Y</i></inf> (<i>X</i>)is the best possible distortion of an embedding of <i>X</i> into <i>Y</i>.In this paper we show algorithms and hardness results for relative embedding problems.In particular we give: •an algorith that, given a general metric <i>M</i>, finds an embedding with distortion <i>O</i> (Δ<sup>3⁄4</sup> poly(<i>c</i> <i><inf>line</inf></i> (<i>M</i>))), where Δ is the spread of <i>M</i>•an algorithm that,given a weighted tree etric <i>M</i>, finds an embedding with distortion poly(<i>c</i> <inf><i>line</i></inf> (<i>M</i>)) •a hardness result, showing that computing minimum line distortion is hard to approximate up to a factor polynomial in <i>n</i>,even for weighted tree metrics with spread Δ=<i>n</i> <i><sup>O</sup></i> (1).
