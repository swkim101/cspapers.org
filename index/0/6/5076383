We have been proposing a new planetary rover system named “SMC Rover”. This system consists of one main body and detachable units, which can work as child rovers, and also become driving units of the main body. Each detachable unit named “Uni-Rover” consists of a single manipulator mounted on a wheel. Prototype models of the Uni-Rover and the SMC Rover have been already developed. This paper describes a new method of trajectory modeling for the Uni-Rover using the relation between arm posture and turning radius. At first, an intuitively recognizable model which uses zero slip angle is introduced. However, because this intuitive model has some problems, a new solution which considers the loss of friction on the wheel and on the caster is also discussed. The validity of the presented method is verified by experiments with an actual mechanical model. Moreover, an effective steering method which considers the margin of the energy stability is introduced.
