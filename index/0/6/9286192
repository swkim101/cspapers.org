A string of recent attacks against the global public 
key infrastructure (PKI) has brought to light weaknesses in the 
certification authority (CA) system. In response, the CA/Browser 
Forum, a consortium of certification authorities and browser 
vendors, published in 2011 a set of requirements applicable to all 
certificates intended for use on the Web and issued after July 1st, 
2012, following the successful adoption of the extended validation 
guidelines in 2007. We evaluate the actual level of adherence to 
the CA/Browser Forum guidelines over time, as well as the impact 
of each violation, by inspecting a large collection of certificates 
gathered from Web crawls. We further refine our analysis by 
automatically deriving profile templates that characterize the 
makeup of certificates per issuer. By integrating these templates 
with violation statistics, we are able to depict the practices of 
certification authorities worldwide, and thus to monitor the PKI 
and proactively detect major violations. Our method also provides 
new means of assessing the trustworthiness of SSL certificates 
used on the Web.
