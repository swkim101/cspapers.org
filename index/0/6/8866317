Recently mobile base stations are getting increased, which is considered harmful for the Wi-Fi positioning methods. In this paper, three approaches for detecting Wi-Fi base station behaviors inappropriate for Wi-Fi signature sampling are introduced and their performance evaluations are presented. First approach is for outdoor environment using GPS or Wi-Fi, second for indoor environment using Wi-Fi and accelerometers and last for the first contact stations using the Bayesian estimation method. Bayesian estimation is fine for stationary stations but much severe for mobile stations.
