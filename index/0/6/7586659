This paper considers how gaming has been infused into the computing curriculum of institutions in the United States. To increase motivation of students and improve retention, many programs have begun using gaming in their introductory courses, as upper level electives, or as separate degree programs. The authors review the current use of gaming within curricula and analyze the content of game development degree programs. Finally, the authors describe plans at their institution to incorporate gaming throughout the computing curriculum and present initial results.
