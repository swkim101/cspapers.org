We describe a technique called imagining which uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative simulation techniques to solve a problem where neither alone would suffice. We illustrate the imagining technique using the domain of geologic interpretation and argue for why the two types of simulation are necessary for problems of this sort. We also discuss the strengths of each simulation technique and how they support each other in the problem solving process.
