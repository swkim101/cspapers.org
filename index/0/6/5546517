The component oriented language COMODEL for the description of technical systems is presented. It represents technical knowledge by means of functions and geometric properties of components in a uniform way based on a small number of elementary concepts. Components together with interactions between components can be composed to aggregates, and a whole technical system is viewed as a big aggregate consisting of a hierarchy of subaggregates. Functions and geometric properties of aggregates can be derived from those of the subaggregates. Thus, a technical system can be modelled by a set of COMODEL expressions, and diagnosis and prognosis in the system may be performed by means of these expressions.
