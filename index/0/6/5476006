The paper discusses the general purpose of analysis and evaluates OOA with respect to this, arguing that OOA does not deliver what it claims to do. The two major problems are that OOA often does not meet the full needs of the analysis phase, and that the transition to design is not always as easy as promised. The last point is illustrated by a solution to the OOPSLA conference registration problem. Due to the mentioned shortcomings, OOA/OOD was not found sufficient for forming the basis of a common development methodology for three Norwegian software producers in a technology transfer project with our university. The suggestion made is that OOA should become problem-oriented rather than target-oriented.
