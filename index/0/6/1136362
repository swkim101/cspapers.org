Research in student retention and progression to completion is traditionally survey-based, where researchers collect data through questionnaires and interviewing students. The major issues with survey-based study are the potentially low response rates and cost. Nevertheless, a large number of datasets that could inform the questions that students are explicitly asked in surveys is commonly available in the external open datasets. This paper describes a new student predictive model for student progression that relies on the data available in institutional internal databases and external open data, without the need for surveys. The results of empirical study for undergraduate students in their first year of study shows that this model can perform as well as or even out-perform traditional survey-based ones.
