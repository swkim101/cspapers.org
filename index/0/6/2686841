This paper presents a motion planning method for mobile manipulators for which the base locomotion is less precise than the manipulator control. In such a case, it is advisable to move the base to discrete poses from which the manipulator can be deployed to cover a prescribed trajectory. The proposed method finds base poses that not only cover the trajectory but also meet constraints on a measure of manipulability. We propose a variant of the conventional manipulability measure that is suited to the trajectory control of the end effector of the mobile manipulator along an arbitrary curve in three space. Results with implementation on a mobile manipulator are discussed.
