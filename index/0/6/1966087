Image fusion is and will be an integral part of many existing and future surveillance systems. However, little or no systematic attempt has been made up to now on studying the relative merits of various fusion techniques and their effectiveness on real multi-sensor imagery. In this paper we provide a method for evaluating the performance of image fusion algorithms. We define a set of measures of effectiveness for comparative performance analysis and then use them on the output of a number of fusion algorithms that have been applied to a set of real passive infrared (IR) and visible band imagery.
