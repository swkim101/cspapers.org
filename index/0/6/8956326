This paper describes research on the ARK (Autonomous Mobile Robot in a Known Environment) project. The technical objective of the project is to build a robot that can navigate and carry out survey/inspection tasks in a complex but known industrial environment. Rather than altering the robots environment by adding easily identifiable beacons the robot relies on naturally occurring objects to use as visual landmarks for navigation. The robot is equipped with various sensors that are used to detect unmapped obstacles, landmarks and objects. This paper describes the robot's industrial environment, it's control architecture, and some results in processing the robot's range and vision sensor data for navigation.<<ETX>>
