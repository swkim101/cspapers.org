This paper discusses the feasibility of extension of expressive style with multiple 3D sketches drawn by a sketching tool that enables its users to draw and paint on 3D structured surfaces. Users of our proposed system take a picture of target objects and sketch with reference to the taken picture. They can not only sketch on the pictures but can also change their viewpoint of the sketched environment, since the system captures 3D structure by using a depth sensor as well as RGB data. Trial usage of the system shows that our users can rapidly extract their target objects/space and extend their ideas by taking pictures and drawing/painting on them. This paper presents examples of system usage, and discusses the feasibility of extension of sketches.
