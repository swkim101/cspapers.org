We will present the area-efficient fault-detection synthesis component of SYNCERE, an integrated system for synthesizing area-efficient self-recovering microarchitectures. In the SYNCERE model for self-recovery, transient fault detection is based on duplication and comparison, while recovery from transient faults is accomplished via checkpointing and rollback. SYNCERE minimizes the overhead of duplication using two complementary area-optimization techniques. Whereas imposing inter-copy hardware disjointness at a sub-computation level instead of at the overall computation level ameliorates the dedicated hardware required for the original and duplicate computations, restructuring the pliable input representation of the duplicate computation further moderates the overall hardware.
