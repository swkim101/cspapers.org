Historically, we have watched Computer Science Departments arise from a variety of environments. In fact, many departments have not yet gained an identity for themselves. This is obvious from the department names we seeâ€”Computer and Information Science, Computer Science and Information Systems, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, and Statistics and Computer Science. In most of these situations, Computer Science is not the main emphasis of the department as can be evidenced by the requirements of the department.
