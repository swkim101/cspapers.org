We prove that the Traveling Salesperson Problem (MIN TSP) and the Minimum Steiner Tree Problem (MIN ST) are Max SNP-hard (and thus NP-hard to approximate within some constant r > 1) even if all cities (respectively, points) lie in the geometric space Rn (n is the number of cities/points) and distances are computed with respect to the l1 (rectilinear) metric. The TSP hardness results also hold for any lp metric, including the Euclidean metric, and in Rlogn. The running time of Arora’s approximation scheme for geometric MIN TSP inRd is doubly exponential in d. Our results imply that this dependance is necessary unless NP has sub-exponential algorithms. We also prove, as an intermediate step, the hardness of approximating MIN TSP and MIN ST in Hamming spaces. The reduction for MIN TSP uses errorcorrecting codes and random sampling; the reduction for MIN ST uses the integrality property of MINCUT. The only previous non-approximability results for MIN TSP and MIN ST involved metrics where all distances are 1 or 2.
