MrSpidey is a user-friendly, interactive static debugger for Scheme. A static debugger supplements the standard debugger by analyzing the program and pinpointing those program operations that may cause run-time errors such as dereferencing the null pointer or applying non-functions. The program analysis of MrSpidey computes value set descriptions for each term in the program and constructs a value flow graph connecting the set descriptions. Using the set descriptions, MrSpidey can identify and highlight potentially erroneous program operations, whose cause the programmer can then explore by selectively exposing portions of the value flow graph.
