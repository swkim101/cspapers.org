A deductive database system prototype, LogicBase, has been developed, with an emphasis on efficient compilation and query evaluation of application-oriented recursions in deductive databases. The system identifies different classes of recursions and compiles recursions into chain or psuedo-chain forms when appropriate. Queries posed to the compiled recursions are analyzed systematically with efficient evaluation plans generated and executed, mainly based on a chained-based query evaluation method. The system has been tested using sophisticated recursions and queries with satisfactory performance. This paper introduces the general design principles and implementation techniques of the system and discusses its strength and limitations.
