Visual location recognition is the task of determining the place depicted in a query image from a given database of geo-tagged images. Location recognition is often cast as an image retrieval problem and recent research has almost exclusively focused on improving the chance that a relevant database image is ranked high enough after retrieval. The implicit assumption is that the number of inliers found by spatial verification can be used to distinguish between a related and an unrelated database photo with high precision. In this paper, we show that this assumption does not hold for large datasets due to the appearance of geometric bursts, i.e., sets of visual elements appearing in similar geometric configurations in unrelated database photos. We propose algorithms for detecting and handling geometric bursts. Although conceptually simple, using the proposed weighting schemes dramatically improves the recall that can be achieved when high precision is required compared to the standard re-ranking based on the inlier count. Our approach is easy to implement and can easily be integrated into existing location recognition systems.
