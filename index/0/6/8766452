We present the sHype hypervisor security architecture and examine in detail its mandatory access control facilities. While existing hypervisor security approaches aiming at high assurance have been proven useful for high-security environments that prioritize security over performance and code reuse, our approach aims at commercial security where near-zero performance overhead, non-intrusive implementation, and usability are of paramount importance. sHype enforces strong isolation at the granularity of a virtual machine, thus providing a robust foundation on which higher software layers can enact finer-grained controls. We provide the rationale behind the sHype design and describe and evaluate our implementation for the Xen open-source hypervisor
