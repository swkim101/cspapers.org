In this paper, we present a formal definition of the integration of the requirements modeling language Behavior Trees (BTs). We first provide the semantic integration of two interrelated BTs using an extended version of Communicating Sequential Processes. We then use a Semantic Network Model to capture a set of interrelated BTs, and develop algorithm to integrate them all into one BT. This formalisation facilitates developing (semi-)automated tools for modeling the requirements of large-scale software intensive systems.
