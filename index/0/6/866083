Previous work has introduced the planning coordinator, a logical extension to the coordination level of the intelligent machine model that provides a platform for error recovery and online planning by autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic systems. This paper refines the design architecture of the planning coordinator focusing on the primitive structure database and node/link weighting mechanism. This architecture facilitates the role of the planning coordinator as the mechanism by which an existing robotic system can be made more autonomous.
