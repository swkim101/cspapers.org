A number of path selection testing criteria have been proposed throughout the years. Unfortunately, little work has been done on comparing these criteria. To determine what would be an effective path selection criterion for revealing errors in programs, we have undertaken an evaluation of these criteria. This paper reports on the results of our evaluation for those path selection criteria based on data flow relationships. We show how these criteria relate to each other, thereby demonstrating some of their strengths and weaknesses.
