In this paper, we describe an approach of using a PC based robot (PCRob) for teaching advanced topic course in pattern recognition and computer vision. Unlike most of the robots where only the microprocessors are used, the robot we design and build uses mini PC and off-the-shelf peripherals to provide the computing power in order to process some functionalities such as image processing and pattern recognition.
