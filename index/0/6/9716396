In this paper, we describe research which could lead to a novel approach to gathering an overview of a document in a foreign language. The research explores how much of the meaning of a document could be represented using images by researching the ability of subjects to derive the search term that might have been used to return a set of images from an image library. The Google image search engine was used to retrieve the images for this experiment, which uses English throughout. The results were analysed with respect to a previous paper [1] exploring ability to recognise concrete objects in hierarchies. It was found that there is a tendency to use one particular level of categorization.
