User interface components such as buttons, scrollbars, menus, as well as various types of containers and separators, normally need to be resizable so that they can conform to the needs of the contents within them, or the environment in which they are placed. Unfortunately, in the past, providing dynamically resizable component appearances has required writing code to draw the component. As a result, visual designers have often been cut off from the ability to create these appearances. Even when visual designers can be involved, drawing programmatically is comparatively very difficult. Hence, components created this way have not typically contained artistically rich appearances. Because of this need to write drawing code, component appearances have traditionally been quite plain, and have been controlled primarily by a few toolkit writers. This paper presents a suite of very simple techniques, along with a few composition mechanisms, that are designed to overcome this problem. These techniques allow visually rich, dynamically resizable, images to be provided using primarily conventional drawing tools (and with no programming or programming-like activities at all).
