Ubiquity of internet-connected media-and sensor-equipped portable devices has emerged a range of opportunities for direct involvement of citizens into public decision making, leading to a new participatory format of public administration functioning. Intersecting the power of the crowdsourcing problem-solving paradigm by directly relying on human intelligence, with instantaneity and situation-awareness of mobile technologies, one gets a context-aware crowdsourcing approach for problem-solving in the right circumstances with the right people. In this paper, we present a prototype implementation of a context-aware mobile crowdsourcing system that enables the deployment and execution of crowdsourcing campaigns with users carrying mobile devices. The system is designed to maximize conditions for user participation, while minimizing the usage of energy. The paper describes the system architecture, defines an optimized sampling algorithm, and outlines a preliminary experimentation study carried out.
