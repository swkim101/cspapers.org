This paper proposes a new approach of neural network based photometric stereo in which all the directions of i l lumination are close to and is rotationally moved around the viewing direction. Adjacent light sources cause a numerically ill-conditioned problem. Il l-conditioning is overcome in two ways. First, many more than three images are acquired. Second, principal components analysis is used as a l inear preprocessing technique to determine a reduced dimensionality subspace for use as input. The approach is empirical and uses the radial basis function (RBF) neural network to do non-parametric functional approximation. One neural network maps image irradiance to surface normal. A second network maps surface normal to image irradiance. The two networks are trained using samples from a calibration sphere. Comparison between the actual input and the inversely predicted input is used as a confidence estimate. Further, we introduce the i l lumination planning, which disposes the information of the cast shadow region from the ill-effected light sources for each point on the object using the confidence estimate. Then, the best combination of NN units wi th well-effected light sources for each point are used to get the relevant results. The results on real data are also evaluated.
