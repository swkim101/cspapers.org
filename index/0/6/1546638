An adversarial version of the problem of cooperative path-finding (CPF) in graphs is addressed. Two or more teams of agents compete in finding paths in the graph to given destination vertices. The task is to control agents of a selected team so that its agents reach their destinations before agents of adversaries. Tactics such a blocking agents of the adversary or protecting own agents are allowed by the suggested formal definition of the problem.
