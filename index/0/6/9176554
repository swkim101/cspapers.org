In this paper, we address the issue of automatic extending lexical resources by exploiting existing knowledge repositories. In particular, we deal with the new task of linking FrameNet and Wikipedia using a word sense disambiguation system that, for a given pair frame -- lexical unit (F, l), finds the Wikipage that best expresses the the meaning of l. The mapping can be exploited to straightforwardly acquire new example sentences and new lexical units, both for English and for all languages available in Wikipedia. In this way, it is possible to easily acquire good-quality data as a starting point for the creation of FrameNet in new languages. The evaluation reported both for the monolingual and the multilingual expansion of FrameNet shows that the approach is promising.
