Companies often receive thousands of resumes for each job posting and employ dedicated screeners to short list qualified applicants. In this paper, we present PROSPECT, a decision support tool to help these screeners shortlist resumes efficiently. Prospect mines resumes to extract salient aspects of candidate profiles like skills, experience in each skill, education details and past experience. Extracted information is presented in the form of facets to aid recruiters in the task of screening. We also employ Information Retrieval techniques to rank all applicants for a given job opening. In our experiments we show that extracted information improves our ranking by 30% there by making screening task simpler and more efficient.
