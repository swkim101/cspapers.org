In this paper we explore two quantitative approaches to the modelling of counterfactual reasoning – a linear and a noisy-OR model – based on information contained in conceptual dependency networks. Empirical data is acquired in a study and the fit of the models compared to it. We conclude by considering the appropriateness of non-parametric approaches to counterfactual reasoning, and examining the prospects for other parametric approaches in the future.
