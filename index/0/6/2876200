In this paper, we simulate the three routing protocols Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV), Optimized Link state Routing (OLSR), DYnamic MANET On Demand (DYMO) in NS-2 to evaluate and compare their performance using two Mac-layer protocols 802.11 and 802.lip. Comprehensive stimulation work is done for each routing protocol and the performance metrics Throughput, End to End Delay (E2ED), Normalized Routing load (NRL) is analyze in the scenarios of varying the mobilities and scalabilities. After extensive simulations, we observe that DSDV outperforms with 802.1 lp while DYMO gives best performance with 802.11.
