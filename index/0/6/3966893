Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a core element of every autonomous mobile robot. The underlying engine of a SLAM system is its back-end, which aims at optimally estimating the trajectory and map of the environment based on sensor data abstractions. Over the past decade, SLAM solutions based on graph optimization approaches prevailed over the filtering based solutions, since they dominated in performance over a wider range of applications. In this paper we propose a novel filtering based SLAM back-end based on the exactly sparse delayed state filter (ESDSF) derived on Lie groups (LG-ESDSF). The proposed filter retains all the good characteristics of the classic ESDSF, but also respects the state space geometry by employing filtering equations directly on Lie groups. We have compared our SLAM system with two current state-of-the-art SLAM solutions, namely ORB-SLAM and LSD-SLAM, on the KITTI vision benchmark suite. Test results show that the proposed SLAM based on the LG-ESDSF back-end can achieve same level of accuracy as the methods based on the graph optimization techniques, while maintaining lower computation times.
