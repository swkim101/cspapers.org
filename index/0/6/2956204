What is a basic automata-theoretic model of computation with names and fresh-name generation? We introduce Fresh-Register Automata (FRA), a new class of automata which operate on an infinite alphabet of names and use a finite number of registers to store fresh names, and to compare incoming names with previously stored ones. These finite machines extend Kaminski and Francez's Finite-Memory Automata by being able to recognise globally fresh inputs, that is, names fresh in the whole current run. We examine the expressivity of FRA's both from the aspect of accepted languages and of bisimulation equivalence. We establish primary properties and connections between automata of this kind, and answer key decidability questions. As a demonstrating example, we express the theory of the pi-calculus in FRA's and characterise bisimulation equivalence by an appropriate, and decidable in the finitary case, notion in these automata.
