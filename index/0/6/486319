WC obtain an exponential separation between consecutive levels in the hierarchy of classes of functions computable by syntactic read-k-times branching programs of polynomial size, for all k > 0, as conjectured by various authors [24, 22, 161, For every k, we exhibit two explicit functions that can be computed by linear-sized read-(k+l)-times branching programs but require size to be computed by any read-k-times branching program. The result actually gives the strongest possible separation the exponential lower bound applies to both nondeterministic read-k-times branching programs and randomized read-k-times branching programs with Zsided error E, for some E > 0. The only previously known results are the separation between k = 1 and k = 2 [6] and a aopnration of non-deterministic read-k from deterministic road-(kink/ In2 + C), where C is some appropriate constant, for each k [IS]. A simple corollary of our results is that randomization is not more powerful than non-determinism for read-k-times branching programs, A combinatorial result that we prove along the way is a “hash-mixing lemma” [12] for fnmilics of hash functions that are almost universal, which may be of independent interest.
