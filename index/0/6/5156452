This paper deals with the online path planning of mobile robots. We first suggest a systematic method to incrementally construct the Medial Axis of the workspace. This is done by using sensor information for land-marking the nodes of medial axis, which will guide the robot to explore the unknown environment thoroughly. Next, this approach is implemented in an online motion planning algorithm. This method can be generalized to higher spaces, and uses only the line of sight information of sonar sensors. It is much simpler than HGVG method, and is complete. The simulations showed good results for different environments.
