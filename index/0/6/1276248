Various control approaches have been developed for micro/nanomanipulations using optical tweezers. Most existing methods assume that the micro/nanoparticles stay trapped during manipulations, and stochastic perturbations (Brownian motion) are usually ignored for the simplification of model dynamics. However, the trapped particles could escape from the optical traps especially in motion due to several possible reasons: small trapping stiffness, stochastic perturbations, and kinetic energy gained during manipulation. This paper investigates the conditions under which micro/nanoparticles will stay trapped while in motion. The dynamics of the trapped particles subject to stochastic perturbations is analyzed. Dynamic trapping is considered and the maximum manipulation velocity is determined from a probabilistic perspective. A controller with certain velocity bound is proposed, the stability of the system is analysed in presence of stochastic perturbation. Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.
