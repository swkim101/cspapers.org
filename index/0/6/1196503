Object-Relational database systems allow users to define new user-defined types and functions. This presents new optimizer and run-time challenges to the database system on shared-nothing architectures. In this paper, we describe a new strategy we are exploring for the NCR Teradata Multimedia Database System; our focus is directing research for real applications we are seeing. In doing so, we will briefly describe optimizer challenges particularly related to predicate use of large multimedia objects, such as video/audio clips, images, and text documents. The motivation for this work is based on database tuning [SD961 for diverse queries related to multimedia objects. Most notably, expensive and/or high variant user defined functions [He198]. Our approach is referred to as plan-per-tuple. The
