The advent of XML as a universal exchange format, and of Web services as a basis for distributed computing, has fostered the apparition of a new class of documents: dynamic XML documents. These are XML documents where some data is given explicitly while other parts are given only intensionally by means of embedded calls to web services that can be called to generate the required information. By the sole presence of Web services, dynamic documents already include inherently some form of distributed computation. A higher level of distribution that also allows (fragments of) dynamic documents to be distributed and/or replicated over several sites is highly desirable in today's Web architecture, and in fact is also relevant for regular (non dynamic) documents.The goal of this paper is to study new issues raised by the distribution and replication of dynamic XML data. Our study has originated in the context of the Active XML system [1, 3, 22] but the results are applicable to many other systems supporting dynamic XML data. Starting from a data model and a query language, we describe a complete framework for distributed and replicated dynamic XML documents. We provide a comprehensive cost model for query evaluation and show how it applies to user queries and service calls. Finally, we describe an algorithm that, for a given peer, chooses data and services that the peer should replicate to improve the efficiency of maintaining and querying its dynamic data.
