The ACM Computer Science Curricula 2013 (CS2013) guidance for undergraduate degrees was released in December 2013. This BOF will provide a platform for two-year and four-year computer science faculty and academic administrators to discuss CS2013 and its influence on associate-degree computer science curricula. The session will include a brief overview of the Core Tier-1 and Core Tier-2 CS2013 topics and attendees will primarily engage in an open dialog about which CS2013 topics and learning outcomes are most relevant to be included in a transfer curriculum. This CS2013 discussion will help inform the forthcoming update to Computing Curricular 2009: Guidelines for Associate-Degree Transfer Curriculum in Computer Science (www.capspace.org).
