The programming environment described in this paper is an adaptation of Donald Knuth's concept of literate programming, applied to Smalltalk programs. The environment provides a multi-media document production system including media for Smalltalk class and method definitions.
There are two outputs from the system. The first output is a document which contains general descriptions and discussions intermixed with precise definitions of program fragments, test inputs and test results. The second output consists of compiled Smalltalk programs installed and ready for execution.
The main idea was to produce program documentation that was just as interesting and fascinating to read as ordinary literature. Our experience showed an added benefit, namely that the literate programming environment was an active aid in the problem solving process. The simultaneous programming and documentation lead to significantly improved quality of both programs and documentation.
