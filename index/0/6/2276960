Increasing the playback speed of lecture videos is a common technique to shorten watching time. This creates challenges when part of the lecture becomes too fast to be discernible, even if the overall playback speed is acceptable. In this paper, we present a speed-up system that preserves lecture clearness in high playback rate. A user test was conducted to evaluate the system. The result indicates that our system significantly improves user's comprehension level.
