Intelligent non-player characters that exhibit realistic ambient behaviors produce more captivating and immersive stories for the player. However, the creation of nonrepetitive and entertaining behaviors is challenging, since it involves writing complex custom scripting code for thousands of characters in a common game adventure. This demonstration describes the generation of motivational behavior scripts using generative behavior patterns with ScriptEase. We demonstrate interruptible and resumable motivational ambient and latent behaviors for a tavern scene in a custom Neverwinter Nights game module.
