In this paper we address the problem of source locating in social networks from a topic modeling perspective. From the observation that the topic factor can help infer the propagation paths, we propose a topic-aware source locating method based on topic analysis of propagation items and participants. We evaluate our algorithm on both generated and real-world datasets. The experimental results show significant improvement over existing popular methods.
