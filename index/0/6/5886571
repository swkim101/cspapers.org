A very simple model of two reciprocally connected attractor neural networks is studied analytically in situations similar to those encountered in delay match-to-sample tasks with intervening stimuli and in tasks of memory guided attention. The model qualitatively reproduces many of the experimental data on these types of tasks and provides a framework for the understanding of the experimental observations in the context of the attractor neural network scenario.
