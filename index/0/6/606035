Following Shrager and Johnson (1995) we study growth of logical function complexity in a network swept by two overlapping waves: one of pruning, and the other of Hebbian reinforcement of connections. Results indicate a significant spatial gradient in the appearance of both linearly separable and non linearly separable functions of the two inputs of the network; the n.l.s. cells are much sparser and their slope of appearance is sensitive to parameters in a highly non-linear way.
