In this paper, we investigate the Web snippet hierarchical clustering problem in its full extent by devising an algorithmic solution, and a software prototype called SnakeT (accessible at http://roquefort.di.unipi.it/), that: (1) draws the snippets from 16 Web search engines, the Amazon collection of books a9.com, the news of Google News and the blogs of Blogline; (2) builds the clusters on-the-fly (ephemeral clustering (Maarek et al., 2000)) in response to a user query without adopting any predefined organization in categories; (3) labels the clusters with sentences of variable length, drawn from the snippets and possibly missing some terms, provided they are not too many; (4) uses some ranking functions which exploit two knowledge bases properly built by our engine at preprocessing time for the sentences selection and cluster-assignment process; (5) organizes the clusters into a hierarchy, and assigns to the nodes intelligible sentences in order to allow post-navigation for query refinement. Our clustering algorithm possibly let the clusters overlap at different levels of the hierarchy.
