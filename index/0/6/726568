The bipedal spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model captures characteristic properties of human locomotion, and it is therefore often used to study human-like walking. The extended variable spring-loaded inverted pendulum (V-SLIP) model provides a control input for gait stabilization and shows robust and energy-efficient walking patterns. This work presents a control strategy that maps the conceptual V-SLIP model on a realistic model of a bipedal robot. This walker implements the variable leg compliance by means of variable stiffness actuators in the knees. The proposed controller consists of multiple levels, each level controlling the robot at a different level of abstraction. This allows the controller to control a simple dynamic structure at the top level and control the specific degrees of freedom of the robot at a lower level. The proposed controller is validated by both numeric simulations and preliminary experimental tests.
