As the mobile applications become increasing popular, people are installing more and more Apps on their smart phones. In this paper, we answer the question whether it is feasible to predict which App the user will open. The ability for such prediction can help pre-loading the right Apps to the memory for faster execution or help floating the desired Apps to the home screen for quicker launch. We explored a variety of contextual information, such as last used App, time, location, and the user profile, to predict the user's App usage using the MDC dataset. We present three findings from our studies. First, the contextual information can be used to learn the pattern of user's App usage and to predict App usage effectively. Second, for the MDC dataset, the correlation between sequentially used Apps has a strong contribution to the prediction accuracy. Lastly, the linear model is more effective than the Bayesian model to combine all contextual information and for such predictions.
