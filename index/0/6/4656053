There is often more than one way to trigger a fault. Standard static and dynamic approaches focus on exhibiting a single witness for a failing execution. In this paper, we study the problem of computing a comprehensive characterization which safely bounds all failing program behavior while exhibiting a diversity of witnesses for those failures. This information can be used to facilitate software engineering tasks ranging from fault localization and repair to quantitative program analysis for reliability. Our approach combines the results of overapproximating and underapproximating static analyses in an alternating iterative framework to produce upper and lower bounds on the failing input space of a program, which we call a comprehensive failure characterization (CFC). We evaluated a prototype implementation of this alternating framework on a set of 168 C programs from the SV-COMP benchmarks, and the data indicate that it is possible to efficiently, accurately, and safely characterize failure spaces.
