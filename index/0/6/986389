In the physical human-robot interaction system, improving transparency performance which allows humans to move as if there is no robot is a challenging topic. In general physical human-robot interaction, the multiaxial force sensor is used to control the robot. However the signal measured from the force sensor involves not only the force applied to the robot by the human motion intention but also the influence of the natural force feedback between the robot and the human hand due to the motion of the robot. Therefore, in order to improve the transparency performance, it is necessary to consider the dynamics of the human hand as well as the dynamics of the robot. In this paper, an novel algorithm to improve transparency performance is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses only the multiaxial force sensor and compensates the natural force feedback by using the human hand impedance and further improves the transparency performance which has a limitation adjusting admittance parameters. The validity of the proposed algorithm is described through the system model analysis and the experiment using the hydraulic upper limb exoskeleton.
