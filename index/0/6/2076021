User-Centered Programming by Demonstration is an approach that places the needs of people above algorithmic constraints and requirements. In this paper we present a user-centered programming by demonstration project for authoring interactive robotic locomotion style. The style in which a robot moves about a space, expressed through its motions, can be used for communication. For example, a robot could move aggressively in reaction to a person's actions, or alternatively react using careful, submissive movements. We present a new demonstration interface, algorithm, and evaluation results.
