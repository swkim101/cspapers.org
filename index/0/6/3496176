Research shows the benefit of using active learning in computer science education; however, only limited resources (such as, prior publications) exist for systems courses (including architecture, networking, operating systems). This BoF brings together practitioners of various levels of experience to discuss ways to augment or replace traditional lecturing. We will discuss different techniques, possible materials available, and results measured. This BoF should benefit both instructors considering adopting techniques and instructors looking to discuss issues with their usage.
