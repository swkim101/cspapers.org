This special session is based around key findings of a Barbara Cail STEM Fellowship that aims to inform key stakeholders about international best practices for broadening participation and diversity in computer science. This special session provides opportunities for the audience to contribute to this research discussion and to analyse and develop strategies for their own unique contexts, in a facilitated approach using the benchmark framework and key findings.
