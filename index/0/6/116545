Web Observatories must address fundamental societal challenges using enormous volumes of data being created due to the significant progress in technology. The proliferation of heterogeneous data streams generated by social media, sensor networks, internet of things, and digitalization of transactions in all aspect of humans? life presents an opportunity to establish a new era of networks called Social Life Networks (SLN). The main goal of SLN is to connect People to Resources effectively, efficiently, and promptly in given Situations. Towards this goal, we present a computing framework, called EventShop, to recognize evolving situations from massive web streams in real-time. These web streams can be fundamentally considered as spatio-temporal-thematic streams and can be combined using a set of generic spatio-temporal analysis operators to recognize evolving situations. Based on the detected situations, the relevant information and alerts can be provided to both individuals and organizations. Several examples from the real world problems have been developed to test the efficacy of EventShop framework.
