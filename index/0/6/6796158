This work presents a model for learning inference procedures for story comprehension through inductive generalization and reinforcement learning, based on classified examples. The learned inference procedures (or strategies) are represented as of sequences of transformation rules. The approach is compared to three prior systems, and experimental results are presented demonstrating the efficacy of the model.
