In this paper, we discuss the position of multi-agent systems (MASs) in the software development process. Basically, MASs provide an approach for solving software problems by decomposing a system into a number of autonomous entities, embedded in an environment, which cooperate in order to achieve the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. As such, MASs are in essence a family of software architectures and hence enter the software development picture in the design phase. Coverage and abstraction are identified as two important dimensions of the architectural design space for MASs. Based on this, we outline a good practice for architectural design with MAS. Given this perspective, we conclude with a critical reflection on state-of-the-art agent-oriented methodologies.
