Structural indices play a significant role in improving the efficiency of XML query evaluation. Being able to compare various structural indexing techniques is critical for a DBMS to select which indices to support, for the query optimizer to choose an index to use in query evaluation, and for DBAs to configure a database application. We present ASIC, an Algebra-based Structural Index Comparison framework that aids users in understanding the ability of different types of structural indices in answering XPath queries which have been characterized using the XPath algebra. ASIC allows users to select, configure and construct structural indices for comparison, guides users to compare the selected indices by evaluating queries of a particular XPath sub-algebra, and visually displays the index structures, query evaluation plans, and performance results for analysis and comparison.
