In practice, these algorithms do not scale well as the number of states grows because the algorithms spend too much effort exploring. We introduce an RL algorithm State TArgeted R-MAX (STAR-MAX) that explores a subset of the state space, called the exploration envelope ξ. When ξ equals the total state space, STAR-MAX behaves identically to R-MAX. When ξ is a subset of the state space, to keep exploration within ξ, a recovery rule β is needed. We compared existing algorithms with our algorithm employing various exploration envelopes. With an appropriate choice of ξ, STAR-MAX scales far better than existing RL algorithms as the number of states increases. A possible drawback of our algorithm is its dependence on a good choice of ξ and β. However, we show that an effective recovery rule β can be learned on-line and ξ can be learned from demonstrations. We also find that even randomly sampled exploration envelopes can improve cumulative rewards compared to R-MAX. We expect these results to lead to more efficient methods for RL in large-scale problems.
