The need to meaningfully combine sets of rankings often comes up when one deals with ranked data. Although a number of heuristic and supervised learning approaches to rank aggregation exist, they require domain knowledge or supervised ranked data, both of which are expensive to acquire. In order to address these limitations, we propose a mathematical and algorithmic framework for learning to aggregate (partial) rankings without supervision. We instantiate the framework for the cases of combining permutations and combining top-k lists, and propose a novel metric for the latter. Experiments in both scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formalism.
