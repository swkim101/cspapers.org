A new message-passing scheme for MRF optimization is proposed in this paper. This scheme inherits better theoretical properties than all other state-of-the-art message passing methods and in practice performs equally well/outperforms them. It is based on the very powerful technique of Dual Decomposition [1] and leads to an elegant and general framework for understanding/designing message-passing algorithms that can provide new insights into existing techniques. Promising experimental results and comparisons with the state of the art demonstrate the extreme theoretical and practical potentials of our approach.
