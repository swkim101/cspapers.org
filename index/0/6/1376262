We present novel experiments in modeling the rise and fall of story characteristics within narrative, leading up to the Most Reportable Event (MRE), the compelling event that is the nucleus of the story. We construct a corpus of personal narratives from the bulletin board website Reddit, using the organization of Reddit content into topic-specific communities to automatically identify narratives. Leveraging the structure of Reddit comment threads, we automatically label a large dataset of narratives. We present a change-based model of narrative that tracks changes in formality, affect, and other characteristics over the course of a story, and we use this model in distant supervision and selftraining experiments that achieve significant improvements over the baselines at the task of identifying MREs.
