High Level Synthesis (HLS) has many productivity advantages over traditional RTL design, but routing congestion is difficult to resolve due to the lack of physical information in HLS. In this paper we propose a novel design flow by integrating a HLS tool with physically aware logic synthesis technology. Using this approach, one can discover congestion problems early and trace their sources to specific parts of the input SystemC models. This allows designers to resolve the congestion problems before going to the layout design phase. We applied this flow to a large-scale HLS production design with results showing that this flow can significantly improve not only routing congestion but design area and timing as well.
