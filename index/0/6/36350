We present a practical, measurement-based model that captures the effect of interference in 802.11-based wireless LAN or mesh networks. The goal is to model capacity of any given link in the presence of any given number of interferers in a deployed network, carrying any specified amount of offered load. Central to our modeling approach is a MAC-layer model for 802.11 that is fed by PHY-layer models for deferral and packet capture behaviors, which in turn are profiled based on measurements. The target network to be evaluated needs only O(N) measurement steps to gather metrics for individual links that seed the models. We provide two solution approaches - one based on direct simulation (slow, but accurate) and the other based on analytical methods (faster, but approximate). We present elaborate validation results for a 12 node 802.11b mesh network using upto 5 interfering transmissions. We demonstrate, using as comparison points three simpler modeling approaches, that the accuracy of our approach is much better, predicting link capacities with errors within 10% of the base channel datarate for about 90% of the cases.
