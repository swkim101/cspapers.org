Without inspirations, writing may be a frustrating task for most people. In this study, we designed and implemented WINGS, a Chinese input method extended on IBus-Pinyin with intelligent writing assistance. In addition to supporting common Chinese input, WINGS mainly attempts to spark usersâ€™ inspirations by recommending both word level and sentence level writing suggestions. The main strategies used by WINGS, including providing syntactically and semantically related words based on word vector representation and recommending contextually related sentences based on LDA, are discussed and described. Experimental results suggest that WINGS can facilitate Chinese writing in an effective and creative manner.
