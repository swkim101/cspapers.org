An important question in the context of software product line development is how to improve the modularization and composition of crosscutting features. However, little attention has been paid to the closely related issue of testing the crosscutting features. There is still a lack of techniques to help developers test such features. Usually, developers test the crosscutting features in combination with the affected feature, which impairs the fault diagnosis. This work proposes a verification approach for crosscutting features implemented by means of aspects and crosscutting interfaces (XPIs).
