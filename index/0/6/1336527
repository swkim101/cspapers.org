A set of 2<italic>n</italic> points on the plane induces a complete weighted undirected graph as follows: The points are the vertices of the graph and the weight of an edge between any two points is the distance between the points under some metric. We study the problem of finding a minimum weight complete matching (MWCM) in such a graph. We give an <italic>&Ogr;</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>23</supscrpt> (log<italic>n</italic>)<supscrpt>4</supscrpt>) algorithm for finding an MWCM in such a graph, for the <italic>L</italic><subscrpt>1</subscrpt> (<italic>manhattan</italic>), the <italic>L</italic><subscrpt>2</subscrpt> (<italic>euclidean</italic>), and the <italic>L</italic><subscrpt>∞</subscrpt> metrics. We also study the bipartite version of the problem, where half the points are painted with one color and the other half are painted with another color, and the restriction is that a point of one color may be matched only to a point of another color. We present an <italic>&Ogr;</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>2.5</supscrpt> log<italic>n</italic>) algorithm for the bipartite version, for the <italic>L</italic><subscrpt>1</subscrpt>, <italic>L</italic><subscrpt>2</subscrpt>, and <italic>L</italic><subscrpt>∞</subscrpt>, metrics. The running time for the bipartite version can be further improved to <italic>&Ogr;</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>2</supscrpt> (log<italic>n</italic>)<supscrpt>3</supscrpt>) for the <italic>L</italic><subscrpt>1</subscrpt> and <italic>L</italic><subscrpt>∞</subscrpt> metrics.
