This paper describes an extractive summarizer for educational science content called COGENT. COGENT extends MEAD based on strategies elicited from an empirical study with domain and instructional experts. COGENT implements a hybrid approach integrating both domain independent sentence scoring features and domain-aware features. Initial evaluation results indicate that COGENT outperforms existing summarizers and generates summaries that closely resemble those generated by human experts.
