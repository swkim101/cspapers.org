This work presents a real-time system for multiple objects tracking in dynamic scenes. A unique characteristic of the system is its ability to cope with long-duration and complete occlusion without a prior knowledge about the shape or motion of objects. The system produces good segment and tracking results at a frame rate of 15-20 fps for image size of 320 /spl times/ 240, as demonstrated by extensive experiments performed using video sequences under different conditions indoor and outdoor with long-duration and complete occlusions in changing background.
