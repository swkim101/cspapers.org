A new global wiring algorithm designed for implementation on special purpose physical design machines is described. This algorithm computes more accurate estimates of wiring channel demand and supply than other known algorithms. It also makes better use of this information in determining wire routes. By exploiting the parallel processing capability of an interconnected array of microcomputers, the global wiring is completed effectively and quickly even for large chips.
