Heterogeneous domain adaptation needs supplementary information to link up domains. However, this supplementary information is unavailable in many real cases. In this paper, a new problem setting called hybrid domain adaptation is investigated. It is a special case of heterogeneous domain adaptation in which different domains share some common features, but also have their own domain specific features. In this case, it can be efficiently solved without any supplementary information by using the common features to link up the domains in adaptation. We propose a domain specific feature transfer (DSFT) method, which can link up different domains using the common features and simultaneously reduce domain divergences. Specifically, we first learn the translations between the common features and the domain specific features. Then we cross-use the learned translations to transfer the domain specific features of one domain to another domain. Finally, we compose a homogeneous space in which the domain divergences are minimized. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.
