We have discovered that the representation humans use is significantly more complex than what is needed to describe the spatial situation. Strategy and spatial representations are tightly intertwined with spatial representations forgoing objective, atomically-defined spatial features for context-sensitive, goal-oriented spatial affordances. Spatial relationships exist not only between objects but between an objectâ€™s properties, second-order properties, joint spatial properties and temporal properties.
