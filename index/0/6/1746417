Computer science education in high school is fundamental for increasing the diversity in computing majors at a university level. However, computer science is not often taught in America before university, and usually, the professionals who teach it are not trained experts in computer science concepts and terminology. In this paper, we introduce a new style of coding rubric, which allows teachers to better understand the fundamentals of the course being taught. In the scope of this research, we focus solely on the Beauty and Joy of Computing, an AP Computer Science Principles course. Coding assignments were collected from two groups of students, and assignments were graded and compiled by raters. After being rated, the rubrics were modified to be better adapted to teachers' expectations.
