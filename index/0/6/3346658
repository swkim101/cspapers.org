We demonstrate the RocketLogger, a mobile data logger designed for prototyping energy harvesting IoT devices. Novel IoT applications require new dataloggers with a highly increased dynamic range for current measurement to accommodate both ultra-low sleep currents of few nanoamperes as well as wireless communication currents in the range of hundreds of milliamperes. In parallel to ultra-low currents and high dynamic range measurements, novel applications require mobile measurements for easy in-situ characterization or wearable device testing. The RocketLogger is a solution that fulfills these requirements. While being fully mobile, it measures currents from 5 nA up to 500 mA with very fast and seamless range-switching. Using a sample energy harvesting application, we demonstrate its low-current measurement capabilities, fast, seamless auto-ranging and easy-to-use remote user interface.
