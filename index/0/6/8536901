We study integrality gaps and approximability of two closely related problems on directed graphs. Given a set <i>V</i> of <i>n</i> nodes in an underlying asymmetric metric and two specified nodes <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>, both problems ask to find an <i>s-t</i> path visiting all other nodes. In the <i>asymmetric traveling salesman path problem</i> (ATSPP), the objective is to minimize the total cost of this path. In the <i>directed latency problem</i>, the objective is to minimize the sum of distances on this path from <i>s</i> to each node. Both of these problems are NP-hard. The best known approximation algorithms for ATSPP had ratio <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) [7, 9] until the very recent result that improves it to <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>/ log log <i>n</i>) [3, 9]. However, only a bound of <i>O</i>(√<i>n</i>) for the integrality gap of its linear programming relaxation has been known. For directed latency, the best previously known approximation algorithm has a guarantee of <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>1/2+ε</sup>), for any constant ε > 0 [23].
 We present a new algorithm for the ATSPP problem that has approximation ratio of <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>), but whose analysis also bounds the integrality gap of the standard LP relaxation of ATSPP by the same factor. This solves an open problem posed in [7]. We then pursue a deeper study of this LP and its variations and their use in approximating directed latency. Our second major result is an <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>)-approximation to the directed latency problem. This also places an <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) bound on the integrality gap of a new LP relaxation of the latency problem that we introduce.
