In many online domains, agents share goods or services that are both cheap to provide and valuable to receive. Examples include ratings in a recommender system, forwarding a message to node closer to its destination in a mobile ad-hoc network, and uploading a file in a P2P system. Existing systems in these domains often rely on agents to voluntarily provide goods. Despite the low cost of doing so, many agents instead choose to free-ride, leading to a loss in social efficiency. We present an initial step towards addressing this problem in the context of an abstract, extremely simplified model, where we identify more efficient mechanisms, including one that is provably optimal. Of course, we are not the first to consider this problem, or to offer a solution (see, e.g., [1] for recommender systems, [3] for ad-hoc networks, and [2] and [4] for P2P systems).
