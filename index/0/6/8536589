Multistandard SoC's including advanced RF and analog circuitry with digital blocks are pervasive in modern IC's. However, the system design and verification methodologies that capture the complexity of multistandard RF SoC's are still limited. In this paper, an HDL design methodology is introduced for multistandard RF SoC's, which covers all the design layers from system design, to automatic extraction of the models from circuits and a systematic top level verification. The offered HDL based design methodology combines top down and bottom up design approaches, and brings the design and verification closer by reflecting the circuits to models automatically via an Automatic Parameter Extraction (APX) tool. System or block level verification is obtained with models automatically by overnight runs, without the need for extra test benches or designer interaction. This enables short term detection of functional errors or performance losses. A first time tape out of a multimode Bluetooth transceiver SoC is designed and fabricated in 8 months by using the offered methodology. The accuracy of the system level simulations show a very good match with the measurement results after fabrication. The test SoC is fabricated with 0.13 Î¼m CMOS technology.
