The perception, and perhaps reality, is that database theory toe rarely aids system-builders, and hence is a bad place to invest resources. While theoretical paradigms from mathematics receive priority, implementation efforts suffer from a lack of adequate, relevant theoretical models. Simultaneously, young theoreticians are being pushed unwillingly into jobs that donâ€™t utilize their academic skills. Support will increase only if more database theory is seen to impact real systems.
