Using hypervisors or virtual machine monitors for security has become very popular in recent years, and a number of proposals have been made for supporting multi-level security on secure hypervisors, including PR/SM, NetTop, sHype, and others. This paper looks at the requirements that users of MLS systems have and discusses their implications on the design of multi-level secure hypervisors. It contrasts the new directions for secure hypervisors with the earlier efforts of KVM/370 and Digital's A1-secure VMM kernel
