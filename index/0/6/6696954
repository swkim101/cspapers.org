We consider the task of reconstructing a curve in constant dimensional space from noisy data. We consider curves of the form <i>C = [(x,y<sub>1</sub>,•••,y<sub>c</sub>) | y<sub>j</sub> = p<sub>j</sub>(x)]</i>, where the <i>p<sub>j</sub></i>'s are polynomials of low degree. Given <i>n</i> points in <i>(c+1)</i>-dimensional space, such that <i>t</i> of these lie on some such unknown curve <i>C</i> while the other <i>n-t</i> are chosen <i>randomly and independently</i>, we give an efficient algorithm to recover the curve <i>C</i> and the identity of the good points. The success of our algorithm depends on the relation between <i>n</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>c</i> and the degree of the curve <i>C</i>, requiring <i>t = Ω (n deg(C)) <sup>1/(c+1)</sup></i>. This generalizes, in the restricted setting of random errors, the work of Sudan (J. Complexity, 1997) and of Guruswami and Sudan (IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 1999) that considered the case <i>c=1</i>.
