In this paper we describe a collection of course materials designed to be used in an undergraduate introduction to artificial intelligence (AI) course. These materials include three programming assignments, each touching upon core AI topics, which require that the students build the main functionalities of a guide robot. These assignments were carefully designed to allow the same solution to work both with a robot simulator and an inexpensive web-cam as well as with real robots. An overview of the course and the assignments is given along with references to online versions of the resources developed to teach the course.
