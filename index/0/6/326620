We resolve two long-standing open problems in distributed computation by describing polylogarithmic protocols for Byzantine agreement and leader election in the asynchronous full information model with a non-adaptive malicious adversary. All past protocols for asynchronous Byzantine Agreement had been exponential, and no protocol for asynchronous leader election had been known.
 Our protocols tolerate up to n/6+ε faulty processors, for any positive constant ε. They are Monte Carlo, succeeding with probability 1 - o(1) for Byzantine agreement, and constant probability for leader election. A key technical contribution of our paper is a new approach for emulating Feige's lightest bin protocol, even with adversarial message scheduling.
