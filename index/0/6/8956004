The second edition of the Workshop on Semantics, Analytics and Visualisation: Enhancing Scholarly Data (SAVE-SD 2016) is held in Montreal, Canada on April 11, 2016 and co-located with the 25th International World Wide Web Conference. Its main goal is bringing together publishers, companies and researchers working on semantics, analytics and visualisation of scholarly data in order to bridge the gap between the theoretical/academic and practical/industrial aspects in this field.
