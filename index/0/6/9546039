A corpus of German newspaper commentaries has been assembled and annotated with different information (and currently, to different degrees): part-of-speech, syntax, rhetorical structure, connectives, co-reference, and information structure. The paper explains the design decisions taken in the annotations, and describes a number of applications using this corpus with its multi-layer annotation.
