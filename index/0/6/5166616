This paper proposes an adptive approach for data fusion of information retrieval systems, which exploits estimated performances of all component input systems without relevance judgement or training. The estimation is conducted prior to the fusion but uses the same data as fusion applies. The experiment shows that our algorithms are competitive with, and often outperform CombMNZ, one of the most effective algorithms in use.
