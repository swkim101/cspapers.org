We give an explicit function h:{0,1}<sup>n</sup>->{0,1} such that any deMorgan formula of size O(n<sup>2.499</sup>) agrees with h on at most 1/2 + ε fraction of the inputs, where ε is exponentially small (i.e. ε = 2<sup>-n<sup>Ω(1)</sup></sup>). We also show, using the same technique, that any boolean formula of size O(n<sup>1.999</sup>) over the complete basis, agrees with h on at most 1/2 + ε fraction of the inputs, where ε is exponentially small (i.e. ε = 2<sup>-n<sup>Ω(1)</sup></sup>). Our construction is based on Andreev's Ω(n<sup>2.5-o(1)</sup>) formula size lower bound that was proved for the case of exact computation.
