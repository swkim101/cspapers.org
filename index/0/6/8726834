With the proliferation of app stores and the advancement of mobile devices, research that might have only been tested with a dozen participants in the past can now be released to millions. This offers huge opportunities, but also requires adaptations of existing methods in dealing with large deployments and making sense of large data sets. This workshop provides a forum for researchers to exchange experiences and strategies for wide distribution of applications as well as gathering and analyzing large scale data sets.
