This paper describes the mechatronic design of a humanoid neck. To research human machine interaction, the head and neck combination should be able to approach the human behavior as much as possible. We present a novel humanoid neck concept that is both fast, and has a long range of motion in 4 degrees of freedom (DOFs). This enables the head to track fast objects, and the neck design is suitable for mimicking expressions. The humanoid neck features a differential drive design for the lower 2 DOFs resulting in a low moving mass and the ability to use strong actuators. The performance of the neck has been optimized by minimizing backlash in the mechanisms, and by using gravity compensation. Two cameras in the head are used for scanning and interaction with the environment.
