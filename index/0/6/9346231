Medical information is accessible from diverse sources including the general web, social media, journal articles, and hospital records; information searchers can be patients and their families, researchers, practitioners and clinicians. Challenges in medical information retrieval include: diversity of users and user knowledge and expertise; variations in the format, reliability, and quality of biomedical and medical information; the multi-modal nature of much of the data; and the need for accuracy and reliability of medical information. The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in medical information search with the goal of identifying specific challenges that need to be addressed to advance the state-of-the-art.
