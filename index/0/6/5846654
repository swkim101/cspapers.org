Bored toddlers (children at the age of 1-3) often cause stress for parents during shopping trips in supermarkets. Sitting in the front of the shopping cart, they often grouch or arrogate different articles such as sweets or toys. The reason for this behavior is often the lack of useful activities for kids during shopping of their parents. In this paper, a concept for contextual learning games is introduced by using an interactive display attached to the shopping cart's handle bar. With this game, we want to let toddlers participate in the shopping process to a certain degree without annoying their parents. Using RFID technology, the shopping carts are able to detect the articles and products inside. These items are reflected in the game played by the toddlers. We are interested in up to which extent the integration of real world items in the game can provide a meaningful learning experience and also the needed distraction from sweets or toys. As a result, we expect parents to be more relaxed while their children pursue a useful experience. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).
