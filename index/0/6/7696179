Three aspects of learning to program are described-the organization and compilation of problem-solving operators, the impact of knowledge representation, and the impact of working memory limitations. The GRAPES system simulates the organization and compilation of these operators. The simulation of one problem solving episode is discussed. Also discussed are the impact of different data notations and the impact of working memory load on successful application of LISP functions.
