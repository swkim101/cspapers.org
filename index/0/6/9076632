This paper discusses the design and implementation of a three dimensional magnetic tweezer system to achieve measurement of mechanical properties of living cells by touching a magnetically levitated micro probe to specimen cells. The system consists of a three dimensional magnetic tweezer, an inverted optical microscope for 3D probe position measurement, and control/interface software. For reducing assembly error in the magnetic tweezer and accurate adjustment of the gap distance between sextuple magnetic poles that are sharpen-tipped permalloy rods having a driving coil on each, a pole positioning mechanism was implemented in the magnetic tweezer. Finally, two experiments were performed on the fabricated prototype: trajectory tracking in which a magnetic particle of 4.5Î¼m diameter floating in medium was steered to follow target trajectories, and homogeneity evaluation that compared force generation from each magnetic pole.
