Developing fast gaits for legged robots is a difficult task that requires optimizing parameters in a highly irregular, multidimensional space. In the past, walk optimization for quadruped robots, namely the Sony AIBO robot, was done by handtuning the parameterized gaits. In addition to requiring a lot of time and human expertise, this process produced sub-optimal results. Several recent projects have focused on using machine learning to automate the parameter search. Algorithms utilizing Powell's minimization method and policy gradient reinforcement learning have shown significant improvement over previous walk optimization results. In this paper we present a new algorithm for walk optimization based on an evolutionary approach. Unlike previous methods, our algorithm does not attempt to approximate the gradient of the multidimensional space. This makes it more robust to noise in parameter evaluations and avoids prematurely converging to local optima, a problem encountered by both of the previously suggested algorithms. Our evolutionary algorithm matches the best previous learning method, achieving several different walks of high quality. Furthermore, the best learned walks represent an impressive 20% improvement over our own best hand-tuned walks.
