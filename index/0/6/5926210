In this paper, we propose a new idea called ranking consistency in web search. Relevance ranking is one of the biggest problems in creating an effective web search system. Given some queries with similar search intents, conventional approaches typically only optimize ranking models by each query separately. Hence, there are inconsistent rankings in modern search engines. It is expected that the search results of different queries with similar search intents should preserve ranking consistency. The aim of this paper is to learn consistent rankings in search results for improving the relevance ranking in web search. We then propose a re-ranking model aiming to simultaneously improve relevance ranking and ranking consistency by leveraging knowledge bases and search logs. To the best of our knowledge, our work offers the first solution to improving relevance rankings with ranking consistency. Extensive experiments have been conducted using the Freebase knowledge base and the large-scale query-log of a commercial search engine. The experimental results show that our approach significantly improves relevance ranking and ranking consistency. Two user surveys on Amazon Mechanical Turk also show that users are sensitive and prefer the consistent ranking results generated by our model.
