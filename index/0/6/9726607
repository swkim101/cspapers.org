Although higher order language models (LMs) have shown benefit of capturing word dependencies for Information retrieval(IR), the tuning of the increased number of free parameters remains a formidable engineering challenge. Consequently,in many real world retrieval systems, applying higher order LMs is an exception rather than the rule. In this study, we address the parameter tuning problem using a framework based on a linear ranking model in which different component models are incorporated as features. Using unigram and bigram LMs with 2 stage smoothing as examples, we show that our method leads to a bigram LM that outperforms significantly its unigram counterpart and the well-tuned BM25 model.
