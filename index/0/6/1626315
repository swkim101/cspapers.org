We present a novel plane extraction algorithm based on coplanar line pairs for poorly textured scenes. Coplanar line pairs are extracted from intersecting line pairs and matched between two views, and their correspondences act as geometric primitives for 3D planar patch extraction. Each correspondence generates a plane hypothesis by estimating planar homography using the compatibility constraint with the fundamental matrix. These candidates are merged into disjoint planar regions using a greedy graph-clustering algorithm. In a graph, each candidate consists of a node and is connected to the others by edges weighted by transfer errors of the corresponding convex hulls. Compared to previous approaches, we do not assume known camera geometry or scene structures such as piece-wise planarity or the presence of rectilinear structure. In addition, uncertainty modeling for coplanar line pairs is incorporated into matching and reconstruction for accurate computation of the transfer errors reflecting 3D plane geometry.
