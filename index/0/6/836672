This paper describe a model-driven development (MDD) toolsuite called <i>Component Synthesis using Model-Integrated Computing</i> (CoSMIC), which configures and deploys distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems using quality of service (QoS)-enabled component middleware. We show how CoSMIC addresses crosscutting configuration and deployment concerns at multiple layers of middleware and applications in component-based DRE systems. We also discuss how CoSMIC leverages model checking and analysis tools to validate key properties for configured DRE systems.
