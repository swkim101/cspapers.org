We derive efficient algorithms for both detecting and representing matchings in lopsided bipartite graphs; such graphs have so many nodes on one side that it is infeasible to represent them in memory or to identify matchings using standard approaches. Detecting and representing matchings in lopsided bipartite graphs is important for allocating and delivering guaranteed-placement display ads, where the corresponding bipartite graph of interest has nodes representing advertisers on one side and nodes representing web-page impressions on the other; real-world instances of such graphs can have billions of impression nodes. We provide theoretical guarantees for our algorithms, and in a real-world advertising application, we demonstrate the feasibility of our detection algorithms.
