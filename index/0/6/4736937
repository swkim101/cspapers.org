Considering servers being the core position in network, this paper introduces how to monitor servers through simple network management protocol (SNMP). We expand MIB resources by defining MIB objects to monitor the resources of sever, and use multi-threading technology to collect data and process them, which can improve the collection efficiency. The experimental results prove that it is a successful way of integrated monitor and control for servers based on SNMP.
