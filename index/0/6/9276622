We describe the evolution of solvers for dominance constraints, a formalism used in underspecified semantics, and present a new graph-based solver using charts. An evaluation on real-world data shows that each solver (including the new one) is significantly faster than its predecessors. We believe that our strategy of successively tailoring a powerful formalism to the actual inputs is more generally applicable.
