The application of kernel-based learning algorithms has, so far, largely been conÔ¨Åned to real-valued data and a few special data types, such as strings. In this paper we propose a general method of constructing natural families of kernels over discrete structures, based on the matrix exponentiation idea. In particular, we focus on generating kernels on graphs, for which we propose a special class of exponential kernels, based on the heat equation, called diffusion kernels, and show that these can be regarded as the discretisa-tion of the familiar Gaussian kernel of Euclidean space.
