ProbLog is a probabilistic programming language based on Prolog. The new ProbLog system called ProbLog2 can solve a range of inference and learning tasks typical for the Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) and Statistical Rela- tional Learning (SRL) communities. The main mechanism behind ProbLog2 is a conversion of the given program to a weighted Boolean formula. We argue that this conversion approach can also be applied with certain restrictions to other probabilistic programming languages such as Church and Figaro.
