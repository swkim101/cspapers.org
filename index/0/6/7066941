The topic of this proposed special session is security education with an emphasis on increasing the number of schools and programs that teach it. We will review the current status of security education as it is taught within the CS discipline including funding, curriculum standards and government programs. We will also address misconceptions people may have regarding teaching security and how these views hinder the development of programs and curriculum. Another area we cover which we feel is critical to increasing participation in security education is resources for teaching security including existing curriculum, expert assistance from Centers of Excellence schools and other resources. The format of the session will consist of both presentation periods with at least half the session devoted to participant question and answer. Session participants will be encouraged to share experiences and common concerns to the benefit of everyone attending.
