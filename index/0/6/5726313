<b>The result.</b> <i>Parametric optimization problems</i> that concern graphs with continuously changing edge weights have been explored by numerous researchers, with motivation ranging from sensitivity analysis to mobile-data applications. For instance, Dey [5] has shown that for an undirected graph with <i>n</i> vertices and <i>m</i> edges where the edge weights are linear functions in one parameter ("time"), the minimum spanning tree (MST) can undergo at most <i>O</i>(<i>mn</i><sup>1/3</sup>) changes (edge swaps). Agarwal <i>et al.</i> [1] have given data structures to maintain the MST over time, with a cost of <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2/3</sup> polylog <i>n</i>) per change. Fernandez-Baca <i>et al.</i> [7] have given an algorithm to compute all changes to the MST in <i>O</i>(<i>mn</i> log <i>n</i>) total time.
