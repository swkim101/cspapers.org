With the increasing impact of the Internet of Things (IoT) in our everyday lives, it is imperative that a work force would be needed not only to develop the new IoT solutions but also to maintain the established IoT systems. In this paper, we discuss our experiences in curriculum development for three courses on the topic of IoT. This paper's main focus is course development for the latest offering (Spring 2017), and a discussion about what we changed from the previous two offerings. We discuss our weekly lecture plans for IoT topics' coverage along with programming assignments and other assessment activities. We also discuss our observation of students' interest levels, and how we used an incremental project development approach to keep students engaged and motivated. We conclude with our observations of what did and didn't worked for us. We also discuss what we missed because of time constraints but would try to include in our next offering.
