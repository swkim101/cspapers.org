The goal of this research is to investigate the possibility of automatically inferring a database schema. Our motivation is to make the task of the database designer easier. We require the designer only to provide a picture of how she expects the database to be used. This is provided in the form of natural language queries which the database might be expected to answer. The system synthesises a schema from this information. The above problem can be viewed as a problem in learning. The inference method we are proposing incrementally constructs the schema. The central idea of the inference mechanism is that it exploits certain features occurring in natural languages, namely, the syntactic structure of sentences.
