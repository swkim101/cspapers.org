The goal of this paper is to integrate the Conceptual Mapping Model with an ontology-based knowledge representation (i.e. Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO)) in order to demonstrate that conceptual metaphor analysis can be restricted and eventually, automated. In particular, we will propose a corpora-based operational definition for Mapping Principles, which are explanations of why a conventional conceptual metaphor has a particular source-target domain pairing. This paper will examine 2000 random examples of 'economy' (jingji) in Mandarin Chinese and postulate Mapping Principles based frequency and delimited with SUMO.
