Courses in concurrent programming are now a standard part of computer science curricula. The control of task scheduling and intertask communication scheduling within concurrent programs are important aspects in understanding the tasking model especially for embedded real-time systems. In order to deal with these scheduling controls in a systematic way in the classroom, the Illinois Institute of Technology has developed terminology to classify these controls. This paper describes this classification, gives examples of each control in current concurrent languages, and discusses the issues related to each control.
