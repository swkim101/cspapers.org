We give a randomized bi-criteria algorithm for the problem of finding a <i>k</i>-dimensional subspace that minimizesthe L<sub>p</sub>-error for given points, i.e., <i>p</i>-th root of the sum of <i>p</i>-th powers of distances to given points,for any p ≥ 1. Our algorithm runs in time Õ (mn · pk<sup>3</sup> (k/ε)<sup>2p</sup>) andproduces a subset of size Õ (pk<sup>2</sup> (k/ε)<sup>2p</sup>) from the given points such that, withhigh probability, the span of these points gives a (1+ε)-approximation to the optimal <i>k</i>-dimensionalsubspace. We also show a dimension reduction type of result for this problem where we can efficiently find asubset of size Õ (pk<sup>2(p+1)</sup> + (k/ε)<sup>p+2</sup>) such that, with high probability, theirspan contains a <i>k</i>-dimensional subspace that gives (1+ε)-approximation to the optimum. We prove similarresults for the corresponding projective clustering problem where we need to find multiple <i>k</i>-dimensional subspaces.
