Automatic detection of relevant terms in medical reports is useful for educational purposes and for clinical research. Natural language processing techniques can be applied in order to identify them. The main goal of this research is to develop a method to identify whether medical reports of imaging studies (usually called radiology reports) written in Spanish are important (in the sense that they have non-negated pathological findings) or not. We also try to identify which finding is present and if possible its relationship with anatomical entities.
