We applied statistical mechanics to an inverse problem of linear mapping to investigate the physics of optimal lossy compressions. We used the replica symmetry breaking technique with a toy model to demonstrate Shannon's result. The rate distortion function, which is widely known as the theoretical limit of the compression with a fidelity criterion, is derived. Numerical study shows that sparse constructions of the model provide suboptimal compressions.
