eCots (http://www.ecots.org) is an open directory portal providing services for collecting structured information on software COTS products and producers. The portal is sustained by eCots Association, founded January 2004 by Thales, EDF R&D and Bull. eCots makes itself different from existing software catalogues such as KnowledgeStorm, ComponentSource, Freshmeat, or Web Services catalogues by providing structured data consistent with a common description model, by promoting open content and knowledge sharing within eCots community and other cataloguing initiatives and by proposing a replication service allowing to extend both the data model and the database.
