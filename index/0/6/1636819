The \emph{Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol} (LISP) introduces several benefits to the Internet architecture, yet, since it is just in the initial deployment stage, comprehensive understanding of its integration performance with legacy Internet becomes essential. We leverage on RIPE Atlas, the largest Internet measurement infrastructure, to conduct large scale measurements analysis to provide the feedback to improve LISP technology. The preliminary evaluations show that LISP generally has a reliable performance, compared with the existing Internet. From our vantage point, we observe that LISP introduces a non-negligible latency for the European and North American destinations, occasionally some extremely large delay, however, it shows a faster connection for the Asian intercontinental transmission.
