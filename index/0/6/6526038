The paper presents the spherical joint mechanism, a new mechanism for implementing multiple collocated spherical joints. The mechanism is designed to be strong, rigid, easy to build and have a large range of motion. Two different design concepts are presented and compared to other implementations of spherical joints previously proposed. Finally, implementation issues and potential applications of the spherical joint mechanism are discussed.
