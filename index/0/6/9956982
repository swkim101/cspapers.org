How do online conversations build? Is there a common model that human communication follows? In this work we explore these questions in detail. We analyze the structure of conversations in three different social datasets, namely, Usenet groups, Yahoo! Groups, and Twitter. We propose a simple mathematical model for the generation of basic conversation structures and then refine this model to take into account the identities of each member of the conversation.
