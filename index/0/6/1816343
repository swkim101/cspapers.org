This paper provides a roadmap for software engineering. It 
identifies the principal research challenges being faced by 
the discipline and brings together the threads derived from 
the key research specialisations within software 
engineering. The paper draws heavily on the roadmaps 
covering specific areas of software engineering research 
collected in this volume.
