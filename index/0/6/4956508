We presented our works relative to anthropomorphic motions. We performed task recognition, full-dynamic motion generation, motion retargeting and editing in a unified framework: the stack of tasks. Thanks to the genericity of the task function formalism, our works can be further extended. For example, for the recognition, the use of the task function formalism applied to human motion is currently investigated. Also, preliminary results on the real robot for the retargeting and editing method have been obtained.
