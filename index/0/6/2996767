In Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE), feature modelling is frequently used to model commonalities and variabilities within a domain. A feature model captures an abstract view of a product line and it can serve as a starting point for software design and component implementation. Handling variability exposed within the feature model is an important problem in this context, and in this paper, we describe ongoing research aimed at automating the identification of variability realisation techniques from feature models
