In this paper, we study the problems of detecting holes and antiholes in general undirected graphs and present algorithms for them, which, for a graph on <i>n</i> vertices and <i>m</i> edges, run in <i>O(n + m<sup>2</sup>)</i> time and require <i>O(nm)</i> space; we thus provide a solution to the open problem posed by Hayward, Spinrad, and Sritharan in [12] asking for an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>4</sup>)-time algorithm for finding holes in arbitrary graphs. The key element of the algorithms is a special type of depth-first search traversal which proceeds along <i>P</i><inf>4</inf>s (i.e., chordless paths on four vertices) of the input graph. We also describe a different approach which allows us to detect antiholes in graphs that do not contain chordless cycles on 5 vertices in <i>O</i>(<i>n + m</i><sup>2</sup>) time requiring <i>O(n + m)</i> space. Our algorithms are simple and can be easily used in practice. Additionally, we show how our detection algorithms can be augmented so that they return a hole or an antihole whenever such a structure is detected in the input graph; the augmentation takes <i>O(n + m)</i> time and space.
