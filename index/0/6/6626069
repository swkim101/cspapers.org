The advent of large scale online social networks has resulted in a spurt of studies on the user participation in the networks. We consider a query incentive model on social networks, where user's queries are answered through her friendship network and there are `rewards' or `incentives' in the system to answer the queries utilizing ones community. We model the friendship network as a random graph with power-law degree distribution, and show that the reward function exhibits a theoretic threshold behavior on the scaling exponent α, a network parameter. Specifically, there exists a threshold on α above which the reward is exponential in the average path length in the network and below the threshold, the reward is proportional to the average path length. We demonstrate this finding on simulated power-law networks and real world data gathered from online social media such as Flickr, Digg, YouTube and Yahoo! Answers.
