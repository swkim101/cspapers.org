In this demonstration, we are going to present a workflow management system that is built up with distributed objects based on CORBA. In addition to its architecture, we will show how a workflow manager can act as a higher-level infrastructure over CORBA and how someone can reduce the complexity of a system by rending its use cases and then integrating them on the activities of the flow in a business process by means of such a workflow manager.
