This video presents a palm-size climbing robot which uses synthetic fibrillar dry adhesives inspired by geckos. With fibrillar footpads, the robot is shown to climb smooth surfaces such as glass and acrylic, and surfaces with micron-scale roughness such as wood. In particular, the agility of the robot is highlighted by demonstrations of climbing, steering, and plane-to-plane transitions.
