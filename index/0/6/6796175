When evolving object-oriented code, developers need to understand both the code structure and the runtime structure. However, Integrated Development Environments such as Eclipse still predominantly emphasize the code structure. We propose to add to Eclipse a Runtime Perspective to complement the existing perspectives such as the Java code perspective and the debugging perspective, and to present to developers a hierarchical abstract runtime structure in terms of abstract objects and relations between them.
