An opera t iona l theory is developed f o r the genera l i z a t i o n o f r e l a t i o n a l product ions in the presence of background in fo rmat ion . This provides a u n i f i e d t h e o r e t i c a l so l u t i on f o r a broad class of i n t e l l i g e n c e paradigms, inc lud ing l e t t e r sequence complet ion, v i sua l analogies, and the learn ing of operators from be fore-and-a f te r s i t u a t i o n pa i rs or from s i t u a t i o n sequences. Rela t iona l product i ons are used as a formal model f o r operators. The genera l i za t i on process is given access to a common body of background in fo rmat ion . Background l i t e r a l s which have assoc ia t ion chains to fo re ground l i t e r a l s may be incorporated i n to the gene r a l i z a t i o n . This theory has been computer implemented in SN0B0L4, and examples i l l u s t r a t e i t s app l i ca t i on in the four paradigms mentioned above.
