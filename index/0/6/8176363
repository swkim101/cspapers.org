A method for storing analog vectors in Hopfield's continuous feedback model is proposed. By analog vectors we mean vectors whose components are real-valued. The vectors to be stored are set as equilibria of the network. The network model consists of one layer of visible neurons and one layer of hidden neurons. We propose a learning algorithm, which results in adjusting the positions of the equilibria, as well as guaranteeing their stability. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the method.
