Autonomous mobile robots continuously perceive the world, plan or replan to achieve objectives, and execute the selected actions. Videos of autonomous robots are often naturally used to aid in replaying and demonstrating robot performance. However, plain videos contain no information about the ongoing internals of the robots. In this work, we contribute an approach to automate the overlay of visual annotations on videos of robots' execution to capture information underlying their reasoning. We concretely focus our presentation on the complex robot soccer domain, where the high speed of the robots' execution results from action planning for collaboration and response to the adversary.
