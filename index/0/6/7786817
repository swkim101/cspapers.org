INTRODUCTION Contemporary homes include a large number of electronically controlled devices such as microwave ovens, VCRs, heating/cooling systems and security systems which can be scheduled to start and stop functioning at given times.

Such a user interface must then be general enough to support scheduling any device for a variety of tasks.
