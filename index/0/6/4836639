 
 The ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI) is the annual meeting of the intelligent user interface community and serves as a premier international forum for reporting outstanding research and development on intelligent user interfaces. ACM IUI is where the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community meets the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. Here we summarize the latest trends in IUI based on our experience organizing the 20th ACM IUI Conference in Atlanta in 2015.
