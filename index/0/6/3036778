We incorporate the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSl) technique into a competition-based neural network model for information retrieval. The original neural network model was based on a causal inference network, incorporating Rogetâ€™s Thesaurus, that connects the index terms and related documents. Since the pmcIess of creating or updating a thesaurus is rather expensive, we apply the LSI technique to provide an automated procedure that captures the semantic relationship between the doctrments and
