Dragging is one of the most useful and popular techniques in direct manipulation graphical user interfaces. However, dragging has inherent restrictions caused by pixel resolution of a display. Although in some situations the restriction could be negligible, certain kinds of applications, e.g., real world applications where the range of adjustable parameters vastly exceed the screen resolution, require sub-pixel-pitch dragging. We propose a sub-pixel-pitch dragging tool, popup vernier, plus a methodology to transfer smoothly into ‘vernier mode’ during dragging. A popup vernier consists of locally zoomed grids and vernier scales displayed around them. Verniers provide intuitive manipulation and feedback of fine grain dragging, in that pixel-pitch movements of the grids represent sub-pixel-pitch movements of a dragged object, and the vernier scales show the object’s position at a sub-pixel accuracy. The effectiveness of our technique is verified with a proposed evaluation measure that captures the smoothness of transition from standard mode to vernier mode, based on the Fitts’ law.
