Video is a powerful medium for capturing and conveying information about how people interact with computers. It provides a record of sequential streams of natural observations, some of which are subtle (body language and eye movements) and difficult to capture in any other form. Video also preserves the context as well as the content of a session and provides multi-faceted, qualitative data that can be analyzed on a number of different levels. The price of video equipment has dropped dramatically in recent years, while image quality, portability, and ease of use have all improved.
