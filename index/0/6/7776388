This paper explores the relationship between explicit and predictive models of incremental speech understanding in a dialogue system that supports a finite set of user utterance meanings. We present a method that enables the approximation of explicit understanding using information implicit in a predictive understanding model for the same domain. We show promising performance for this method in a corpus evaluation, and discuss its practical application and annotation costs in relation to some alternative approaches.
