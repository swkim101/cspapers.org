Advances in brain theory need two complementary approaches: Analytical investigations by in situ measurements and as well synthetic modelling supported by computer simulations to generate suggestive hypothesis on purposeful structures in the neural tissue. In this paper research of the second line is described: Starting from a neurophysiologically inspired model of stimulus-response (S-R) and/or associative memorization and a psychologically motivated ministructure for basic control tasks, preconditions and conditions are studied for cooperation of such units in a hierarchical organisation, as can be assumed to be the general layout of macrostructures in the brain.
