This paper explores the problem of computing text similarity between verb phrases describing skilled human behavior for the purpose of finding approximate matches. Four parsers are evaluated on a large corpus of skill statements extracted from an enterprise-wide expertise taxonomy. A similarity measure utilizing common semantic role features extracted from parse trees was found superior to an information-theoretic measure of similarity and comparable to the level of human agreement.
