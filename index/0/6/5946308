In this paper the problem of horizontally partitioning data on a set of resources is considered.The main optimization parameter is the number of accesses performed by the application programs to different portions of data. The concepts which are required for the determination of relevant portions of data are defined and a methodology for determining the access parameters is proposed.The formulation of the general partitioning problem in 3 specific application environments is shown: distributed database design, file partitioning on a primary and a secondary memory and data distribution on different devices.It is shown that the analytical models of these specific applications use the parameters of the general formulation.
