We present SmartVenues, a system that recommends nearby venues to a user who visits or lives in a city. SmartVenues models the variation over time of each venue's level of attendance, and uses state-of-the-art time series forecasting algorithms to predict the future attendance of these venues. We use the predicted levels of attendance to infer the popularity of a venue at future points in time, and to provide the user with recommendations at different times of the day. If the users log in with their Facebook account, the recommendations are personalised using the pages they "like". In this demonstrator, we detail the architecture of the system and the data that we collect in real-time to be able to perform the predictions. We also present two different interfaces that build upon our system to display the recommendations: a web-based application and a mobile application.
