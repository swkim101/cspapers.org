This paper presents several computer aided techniques developed by the CIMTROL Division of Cincinnati Milling Machine Co. to assist in the writing of test specifications for fault detection on printed circuit boards used in Numerical Controls. Specific capabilities of this software support are depicted, as shown in figure 1. Each of the software packages is designed to support and augment the usefulness of a special N/C hardware tester built by and used by Cimtrol for manufacturing acceptance testing. The tester is a paper tape controlled machine capable of applying specified inputs to a manufactured circuit board. Outputs are then observed by the tester and compared to known standard outputs which have been pre-determined. All information necessary for the complete testing of a circuit board is gathered by the various computer routines and postprocessed for punched paper tape.
