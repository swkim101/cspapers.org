This syllabus is organized around the view of digital computer systems presented in chapter 1 of Bell and Newell the major divisions of the syllabus correspond to the major conceptual levels of design and description of digital systems, and the divisions (levels) appear in order of increasing complexity. Two things need to be said about this organization.
 First, while this conceptual structure of computer systems according to levels of complexity has an intrinsic formal appeal, many if not most of the references cited at any given level or sublevel of the structure do not confine themselves exclusively to material at that level. References occasionally reach up to borrow concepts from a higher level of complexity, and of course they frequently reach down to provide lower-level underpinnings for the systems they describe.
