A general problem in qualitative physics is determining the consequences of assumptions about the behavior of a system. If the space of behaviors is represented by an envisionment, many such consequences can be represented by pruning states from the envisionment. This paper provides a formal logic of occurrence which justifies the algorithms involved and provides a language for relating specific histories to envision ments The concepts and axioms are general enough to be applicable to any system of qualitative physics. We further propose the concept of transverse quantities as a general solution to qualitative versions of Zeno's paradox. The utility of these ideas is illustrated by a rational reconstruction of the pruning algorithms used in FROB, a working AI program.
