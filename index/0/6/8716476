We present a collection of algorithms that solve problems from the realm of computational geometry to illustrate several basic notions in algorithm design and analysis. Computational geometry is a young discipline that has much to offer both as a field of research and as a source of instruction materials. This paper aims to serve a dual purpose by (a) outlining results that might prick the interest of researchers looking for greener pastures (so to speak) for investigation; and (b) showing the pedagogic value of these results for teachers of algorithm design and analysis.
