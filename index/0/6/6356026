Sentiment domain adaptation is widely studied to tackle the domain-dependence problem in sentiment analysis field. Existing domain adaptation methods usually train a sentiment classifier in a source domain and adapt it to the target domain using transfer learning techniques. However, when the sentiment feature distributions of the source and target domains are significantly different, the adaptation performance will heavily decline. In this paper, we propose a new sentiment domain adaptation approach by adapting the sentiment knowledge in general-purpose sentiment lexicons to a specific domain. Since the general sentiment words of general-purpose sentiment lexicons usually convey consistent sentiments in different domains, they have better generalization performance than the sentiment classifier trained in a source domain. In addition, we propose to extract various kinds of contextual sentiment knowledge from massive unlabeled samples in target domain and formulate them as sentiment relations among sentiment expressions. It can propagate the sentiment information in general sentiment words to massive domain-specific sentiment expressions. Besides, we propose a unified framework to incorporate these different kinds of sentiment knowledge and learn an accurate domain-specific sentiment classifier for target domain. Moreover, we propose an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the model of our approach. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
