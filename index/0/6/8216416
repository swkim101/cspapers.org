The project presented in this paper has been developed for an advanced undergraduate computer architecture course specifically aimed at non-engineering students. The project is intended to develop understanding of issues in modern computer architecture through empirical testing and experimentation, using sophisticated execution time simulation and industry standard benchmark programs. The students are lead through the functional design process of a superscalar pipelined processor step by step, in a series of carefully structured experiments. The experiments either provide direct support for the design decisions, or make students explore a specific concept. The main goal of the project is to give students a true insight into the current technology and the driving forces behind modern computer architecture, without the burden of engineering and implementation details.
