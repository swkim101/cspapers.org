Formal method techniques provides a suitable platform for the software development in software systems. Formal methods and formal verification is necessary to prove the correctness and improve performance of software systems in various levels of design and implementation, too. Security Discussion is an important issue in computer systems. Since the antivirus applications have very important role in computer systems security, verifying these applications is very essential and necessary. In this paper, we present four new approaches for antivirus system behavior and a behavioral model of protection services in the antivirus system is proposed. We divided the behavioral model in to preventive behavior and control behavior and then we formal these behaviors. Finally by using some definitions we explain the way these behaviors are mapped on each other by using our new approaches.
