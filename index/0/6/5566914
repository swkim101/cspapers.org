Recently, as the community and businesses have begun to realize the power of jointly harnessing nomadic mobile sensing and selective infrastructure-based ambient sensing, we are beginning to see the emergence of a class of "urban crowdsensing" platforms that perform pervasive sensing in a more coordinated fashion. Such combined sensing opens up the possibilities for new exciting applications in a variety of urban spaces. Driven by these trends, PUCAA is an annual workshop that seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the areas of urban and crowd-driven sensing. The workshop provides a forum for the researchers to discuss large/innovative crowdsensing architectures, systems and platforms and their experiences on developing crowdsensing applications impacting urban lifestyles in a variety of areas such as personal & public healthcare, retail & commerce, transportation, public safety, crowd management, and utility services.
