Increasing network speeds challenge the packet processing performance of networked systems. This can mainly be attributed to processing overhead caused by the split between the kernel-space network stack and user-space applications. To mitigate this overhead, we propose Santa, an application agnostic kernel-level cache of frequent requests. By allowing user-space applications to offload frequent requests to the kernel-space, Santa offers drastic performance improvements and unlocks the speed of kernel-space networking for legacy server software without requiring extensive changes.
