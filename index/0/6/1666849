With the NAND flash memory technology of solid-state drives (SSDs), the usage of SSDs is expanded to various devices. Due to the cost and time limitations of measuring the actual execution time of each application on SSDs, it is difficult for users to determine the best SSD for their most commonly used applications. In this paper, we propose a framework of estimating the execution time of an application IO trace (i.e., a query IO trace) on a target SSD without its real execution. Our framework is based on the observation that if two IO traces are similar in their IO behavior, their execution times tend to be similar when executed on the same SSD. The performance of the framework is evaluated through extensive experiments on real applications. The results show that our framework is accurate in estimating the execution time of an IO trace on SSDs.
