Our goal as an investigation group in this area was not to make a check list of hundreds of items but to identify the “high level capabilities” that a real-time object-oriented analysis and design technique should provide. We are well aware that no current methodology provides very much of what we have identified. Nevertheless, we felt it was our task to define meaningful selection criteria regardless of whether they are currently available. These guidelines should provide direction for the developers of real-time object-oriented design and analysis systems as well as for developers of real-time systems.
