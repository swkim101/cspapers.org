Texts exhibit subtle yet identifiable modality about writers' estimation of how true each statement is (e.g., definitely true or somewhat true). This study is an analysis of such explicit certainty and doubt markers in epistemically modalized statements for a written news discourse. The study systematically accounts for five levels of writer's certainty (ABSOLUTE, HIGH, MODERATE, LOW CERTAINTY and UNCERTAINTY) in three news pragmatic contexts: perspective, focus, and time. The study concludes that independent coders' perceptions of the boundaries between shades of certainty in epistemically modalized statements are highly subjective and present difficulties for manual annotation and consequent automation for opinion extraction and sentiment analysis. While stricter annotation instructions and longer coder training can improve inter-coder agreement results, it is not entirely clear that a five-level distinction of certainty is preferable to a simplistic distinction between statements with certainty and statements with doubt.
