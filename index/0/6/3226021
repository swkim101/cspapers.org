A temporal evolutionary object-oriented data model (TEDM) for medical image data is presented in this paper. The images (e.g. X-rays, CT scans, hlR scans, etc.) and their features are represented as objects in the data model. A high-level declarative temporal evolutionary query language (TEQL) integrated with the data model is proposed which provides the user with the capabilities of querying on the temporal evolutionary contents of the med- ical images. Our proposed model and language constructs can be applied to application domains that exemplify the evolutionary transformations of objects.
