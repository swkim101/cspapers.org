We present a shape de nition language, called SDL, for retrieving objects based on shapes contained in the histories associated with these objects. It is a small, yet powerful, language that allows a rich variety of queries about the shapes found in historical time sequences. An interesting feature of SDL is its ability to perform blurry matching. A \blurry" match is one where the user cares about the overall shape but does not care about speci c details. Another important feature of SDL is its e cient implementability. The SDL operators are designed to be greedy to reduce non-determinism, which in turn substantially reduces the amount of back-tracking in the implementation. We give transformation rules for rewriting an SDL expression into a more e cient form as well as an index structure for speeding up the execution of SDL queries. We used SDL to \mine the mined rules" in a data mining application and found that the capability to query the behavior of the mined rules over a period of time led to the discovery of new and interesting information.
