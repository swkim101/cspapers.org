We present a new polynomial-time algorithm for the protein folding problem in the two-dimensional HP model introduced by Dill [l], which has been recently proved to be NP-hard [2]. Our algorithm guarantees a performance ratio (i.e., the ratio between the energy of the solution found by the algorithm and the optimal one) of l/4, equalling the two best polynomial-time performance guaranteed algorithms for this problem [3]. However, experimental results on a large set of random instances have shown an average performance ratio for our algorithm of 0.67, versus 0.55 and 0.48 for the
