This paper describes the design of a prototype machine translation system for a sublanguage of job advertisements. The design is based on the hypothesis that specialized linguistic subsystems may require special computational treatment and that therefore a relatively shallow analysis of the text may be sufficient for automatic translation of the sublanguage. This hypothesis and the desire to minimize computation in the transfer phase has led to the adoption of a flat tree representation of the linguistic data.
