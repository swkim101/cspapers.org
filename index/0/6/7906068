Tremor constitutes the most common motor disorder, and poses a functional problem to a large number of patients. Despite of the considerable experience in tremor management, current treatment based on drugs or surgery does not attain an effective attenuation in 25 % of patients, motivating the need for research in new therapeutic alternatives. In this context, this paper presents the concept design, development, and preliminary validation of a soft wearable robot for tremor assessment and suppression. The TREMOR neurorobot comprises a Brain Neural Computer Interface that monitors the whole neuromusculoskeletal system, aiming at characterizing both voluntary movement and tremor, and a Functional Electrical Stimulation system that compensates for tremulous movements without impeding the user perform functional tasks. First results demonstrate the performance of the TREMOR neurorobot as a novel means of assessing and attenuating pathological tremors.
