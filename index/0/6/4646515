In this paper a novel method for detecting plagiarized passages in document collections is presented. In contrast to previous work in this field that uses mainly content terms to represent documents, the proposed method is based on structural information provided by occurrences of a small list of stopwords (i.e., very frequent words). We show that stopword n-grams are able to capture local syntactic similarities between suspicious and original documents. Moreover, an algorithm for detecting the exact boundaries of plagiarized and source passages is proposed. Experimental results on a publicly-available corpus demonstrate that the performance of the proposed approach is competitive when compared with the best reported results. More importantly, it achieves significantly better results when dealing with difficult plagiarism cases where the plagiarized passages are highly modified by replacing most of the words or phrases with synonyms to hide the similarity with the source documents.
