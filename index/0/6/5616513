In this paper we propose to demonstrate a smart phone application, that estimates human blood pressure (BP) values from photoplethysmography (PPG) signal using Windkessel model. PPG signal is extracted from a video sequence of a user's index fingertip, acquired using smart phone camera. A set of time domain PPG features are used to estimate different lumped parameters of Windkessel model to simulate arterial BP. Under most of the cases, the application estimates systolic and diastolic BP values, within a range of Â±10% of clinical measurement.
