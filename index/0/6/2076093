An analog system-on-chip for kernel-based pattern classification and sequence estimation is presented. State transition probabilities conditioned on input data are generated by an integrated support vector machine. Dot product based kernels and support vector coefficients are implemented in analog programmable floating gate translinear circuits, and probabilities are propagated and normalized using sub-threshold current-mode circuits. A 14-input, 24-state, and 720-support vector forward decoding kernel machine is integrated on a 3mm × 3mm chip in 0.5μm CMOS technology. Experiments with the processor trained for speaker verification and phoneme sequence estimation demonstrate real-time recognition accuracy at par with floating-point software, at sub-microwatt power.
