Accurate network topology information is important for both network management and application performance prediction. Most topology discovery research has focused on wide-area networks and examined topology only at the IP router level, ignoring the need for LAN topology information. Recent work has demonstrated that bridged Ethernet topology can be determined using standard SNMP MIBs; however, these algorithms require each bridge to learn about all other bridges in the network. Our approach to Ethernet topology discovery can determine the connection between a pair of the bridges that share forwarding entries for only three hosts. This minimal knowledge requirement significantly expands the size of the network that can be discovered. We have implemented the new algorithm, and it has accurately determined the topology of several different networks using a variety of hardware and network configurations. Our implementation requires access to only one endpoint to perform the queries needed for topology discovery.
