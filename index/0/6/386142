The problem of parallel computation of local operations using five differently organized parallel processing machines (the SASD, SAPD, PASD, PAMD, and PAPD computers) is investigated. It is shown that for a special class of local operations, called window operations, there is a trade-off between computation time and machine complexity. It is also shown that for the PAMD computer, the computation time increases as the degree of disorderliness of the local operation increases. In conclusion, in the designing of special-purpose parallel processing machines, we must take into consideration the degree of disorderliness of the operations to be performed.
