Surface realisers divide into those used in generation (NLG geared realisers) and those mirroring the parsing process (Reversible realisers). While the first rely on grammars not easily usable for parsing, it is unclear how the second type of realisers could be parameterised to yield from among the set of possible paraphrases, the paraphrase appropriate to a given generation context. In this paper, we present a surface realiser which combines a reversible grammar (used for parsing and doing semantic construction) with a symbolic means of selecting paraphrases.
