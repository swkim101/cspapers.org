In this paper, Parallel Resolution Algorithm (PARA) is described to improve the execution efficiency in resolution process. PARA consists of two parts: parallel unification and generation of a resolvent. The first part is characteristic of PARA, which partitions whole set of expressions W into independent clusters as pre-processing and unifies each cluster in parallel. The efficient implementation for the processing peculiar to PARA is presented and checked by means of the experiment in comparison of execution efficiency of resolution. Experimental results show PARA is very effective in occurrence of many clusters.
