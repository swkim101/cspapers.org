We provide polynomial-time approximately optimal Bayesian mechanisms for makespan minimization on unrelated machines as well as for max-min fair allocations of indivisible goods, with approximation factors of 2 and min{mâˆ’k+1, O([EQUATION]k)} respectively matching the approximation ratios of best known polynomial-time algorithms (for max-min fairness, the latter claim is true for certain ratios of the number of goods m to people k). Our mechanisms are obtained by establishing a polynomial-time approximation-sensitive reduction from the problem of designing approximately optimal mechanisms for some arbitrary objective O to that of designing bi-criterion approximation algorithms for the same objective O plus a linear allocation cost term. Our reduction is itself enabled by extending the celebrated "equivalence of separation and optimization" [27, 32] to also accommodate bi-criterion approximations. Moreover, to apply the reduction to the specific problems of makespan and max-min fairness we develop polynomial-time bi-criterion approximation algorithms for makespan minimization with costs and max-min fairness with costs, adapting the algorithms of [45], [10] and [4] to the type of bi-criterion approximation that is required by the reduction.
