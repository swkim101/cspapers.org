To achieve the skillful task like the human, many researchers have been working on robot hand. An interaction with vision and tactile information are indispensable for realization of skillful tasks. In the existing research, the method using a camera to get the vision information is often found. But, in the boundary area of a non-contact phase and a contact phase, there are problem that lack of sensor information because the influence of occlusion comes up to surface. We devise to introduce the proximity sensor in this area. And we call the robot hand which is equipped with proximity, tactile and slip sensor “intelligent robot hand”. In this research, we show the constitution example of the intelligent robot hand and propose the method to realize Pick&Place as concrete task.
