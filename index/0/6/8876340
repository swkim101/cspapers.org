We present. and implement a ,ciphertext-only algorithm to break Gifford’s cipher, a stream cipher designed in 1984 by David Gifford of MIT and used to encrypt New York Times and Associated Press wire reports. Applying linear algebra over finite fields, we exploit a time-space tradeoff to separately determine key segments derived from a decomposition of the feedback function. This work, the first proposed attack on Gifford’s cipher, illustrates a powerful attack on stream ciphers and shows that Gifford’s cipher is ill-suited for encrypting broadcast data in the MIT-based Boston Community In-, formation System (BCIS). Gifford’s cipher is a filter generator-a linear feedback shift register with nonlinear output. Our cryptanalytic problem is to determine the secret 64-bit initial fill, which is changed for each news article. Representing the feedback function as a binary matrix F, we decompose the vector space of register states into a direct sum of four F-invariant *Support for this research was provided in part by the University of Maryland Graduate School, Baltimore, through a 1991-92 Graduate Merit Fellowship. ‘Part of this work was carried out while Sherman was a member of the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland College Park.
