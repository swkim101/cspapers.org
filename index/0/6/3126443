Over the past ten years Agile software development practices have grown in acceptance and have gained a solid foothold in commercial software development. Our students are entering the workforce with an increasing percentage of companies that are using Agile processes and practices in the development of their products and services. The most widely used Agile project management framework is Scrum. Scrum has a well defined approach for organizing and controlling a software development project. It is almost always implemented in combination with Agile software development practices, but is flexible enough to even be used for managing non-software projects. Selecting Scrum as the framework for student team projects has the advantage of introducing software process at a level of ceremony that both captures foundational software engineering practices and is manageable within the constraints of a class or capstone project. This workshop will introduce participants to the components of the Scrum framework with activities designed to demonstrate the flexibility of Scrum to support a diverse set of course learning outcomes at all levels of the curriculum.
