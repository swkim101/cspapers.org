This paper is concerned with the stabilization problem of multiple chained form control systems with input constraints. A new controller presented can stabilize the system to an arbitrarily, small /spl epsi/-neighborhood of its equilibrium in a finite time. This is achieved by the sliding mode approach and a multi-step control strategy. The application of it to a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot is described. Simulation result shouts that the proposed controller is effective.
