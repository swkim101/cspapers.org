The term scaffolding, with respect to human education, was first coined in the 1970ies, although the basic concept originates back to the 1930ies. The main idea is to formalize the superior knowledge of a teacher in a certain way to generate support for a trainee. In practice, this concept can be implemented as concrete as a cloze, which assists pupils in learning a foreign language, or it might be as abstract as a social environment, which facilitates learning of specific tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach towards robotic learning by means of such a scaffolding framework. In this case, the scaffolding is constituted by abstract patterns, which facilitate the structuring and segmentation of information during "Learning by Demonstration". The methodology was applied to a real-world scenario of robot-assisted surgery.
