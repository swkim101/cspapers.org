We describe a structure-from-motion framework that handles "generalized" cameras, such as moving rolling-shutter cameras, and works at an unprecedented scale-billions of images covering millions of linear kilometers of roads-by exploiting a good relative pose prior along vehicle paths. We exhibit a planet-scale, appearance-augmented point cloud constructed with our framework and demonstrate its practical use in correcting the pose of a street-level image collection.
