This paper presents a multi-robot system for autonomous vehicle extraction and transportation based on the “a-robot-for-a-wheel” concept. The developed prototype is able to extract vehicles from confined spaces with delicate handling, swiftly and in any direction. The novel lifting robots are capable of omnidirectional movement, thus they can under-ride the desired vehicle and dock to its wheels for a synchronized lifting and extraction. The overall developed system applies reasoning about available trajectory paths, wheel identification, local and undercarriage obstacle detection, in order to fully automate the process. The validity and efficiency of the AVERT robotic system is illustrated via experiments in an indoor parking lot, demonstrating successful autonomous navigation, docking, lifting and transportation of a conventional vehicle.
