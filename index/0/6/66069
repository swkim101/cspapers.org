We can obtain important optical transmission values of Germanium (Ge) doped-photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) of the effective area (A<sub>eff</sub>) (variable range 7 to 25 [μm<sup>2</sup>]), extreme higher nonlinear coefficient (γ) (variable range 8.22-18.1[W<sup>-1</sup> km<sup>-1</sup>]), and lower confinement loss (L<sub>c</sub>) than conventional pure-SiO<sub>2</sub> based PCFs by changing Ge-doped rate, respectively with core regions, using numerical analysis and actual measurement results, bi-directionally.
