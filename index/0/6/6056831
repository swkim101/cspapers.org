However, there has been lack of scientific study about privacy preservation in deep learning. In this paper, we concentrate on the auto-encoder, a fundamental component in deep learning, and propose the deep private auto-encoder (dPA). Our main idea is to enforce Îµ-differential privacy by perturbing the objective functions of the traditional deep auto-encoder, rather than its results. We apply the dPA to human behavior prediction in a health social network. Theoretical analysis and thorough experimental evaluations show that the dPA is highly effective and efficient, and it significantly outperforms existing solutions.
