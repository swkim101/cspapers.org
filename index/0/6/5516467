A heuristic model of planning in conflict situations is presented. This strategy-based model accounts for dynamic plan adaptation and replanning in obstructive and constructive counter planning situations. The former situation is characterized by an actor striving to thwart the goals and plans of a second actor. The latter, is the dual situations it provides general means for an actor to pursue his goal in spite of attempts by others to block his plans. The model has been implemented as part of the POLITICS system, a computer program that understands simple natural language accounts of International political conflicts.
