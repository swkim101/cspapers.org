A hybrid two-dimensional position sensing system is designed for mouse applications. The system measures the acceleration of hand-movements which are converted into two-dimensional location coor-dinates. The system consists of four major components: 1) MEMS accelerometers, 2) CMOS analog read-out circuitry, 3) an accelera-tion magnitude extraction module, and 4) a 16-bit RISC micropro-cessor. Mechanical and analog circuit simulation shows that the designed padless mouse system can detect accelerations as small as 5.3 mg and operate up to 18MHz.
