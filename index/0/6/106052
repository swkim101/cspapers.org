In this paper we study the community structure of <i>endorsement networks</i>, i.e., social networks in which a directed edge <i>u</i> â†’ <i>v</i> is asserting an action of support from user <i>u</i> to user <i>v</i>. Examples include scenarios in which a user <i>u</i> is <i>favoring</i> a photo, <i>liking</i> a post, or <i>following</i> the microblog of user <i>v</i>.
 Starting from the hypothesis that the footprint of a community in an endorsement network is a bipartite directed clique from a set of followers to a set of leaders, we apply frequent itemset mining techniques to discover such bicliques. Our analysis of real networks discovers that an interesting phenomenon is taking place: the leaders of a community are endorsing each other forming a <i>very dense nucleus</i>.
