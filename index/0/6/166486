Many clustering algorithms tend to break down in high-dimensional feature spaces, because the clusters often exist only in specific subspaces (attribute subsets) of the original feature space. Therefore, the task of projected clustering (or subspace clustering) has been defined recently. As a solution to tackle this problem, we propose the concept of local subspace preferences, which captures the main directions of high point density. Using this concept, we adopt density-based clustering to cope with high-dimensional data. In particular, we achieve the following advantages over existing approaches: Our proposed method has a determinate result, does not depend on the order of processing, is robust against noise, performs only one single scan over the database, and is linear in the number of dimensions. A broad experimental evaluation shows that our approach yields results of significantly better quality than recent work on clustering high-dimensional data.
