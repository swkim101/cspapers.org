We present a novel, eye gaze based interaction technique, using focus depth as an input modality for virtual reality (VR) applications. We also show custom hardware prototype implementation. Comparing the focus depth based interaction to a scroll wheel interface, we find no statistically significant difference in performance (the focus depth works slightly better) and a subjective preference of the users in a user study with 10 participants playing a simple VR game. This indicates that it is a suitable interface modality that should be further explored. Finally, we give some application scenarios and guidelines for using focus depth interactions in VR applications.
