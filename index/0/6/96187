Chalktalk is a computer-based visual language based around real-time interaction with virtual objects in a blackboard-style environment. Its aim is to be a presentation and communication tool, using animation and interactivity to allow easy visualization of complex ideas and concepts. This demonstration will show Chalktalk in action, with focus on its ability to link these objects together to send data between them, as well as the flexible type system, named Atypical, that underpins this feature.
