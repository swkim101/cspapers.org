Current interactive user interface construction tools are often more of a hindrance than a benefit during the early stages of user interface design. These tools take too much time to use and force designers to specify more of the design details than they wish to at this early stage. Most interface designers, especially those who have a background in graphic design, prefer to sketch early interface ideas on paper or on a white-board. We are developing an interactive tool that allows designers to quickly sketch an interface using an electronic pad and stylus. Our tool preserves the important properties of paper: A rough drawing can be produced very quickly and the medium is very flexible. However, unlike a paper sketch this electronic sketch can easily be exercised and modified. In addition, our system allows designers to examine, annotate, and edit a complete history of the design. When the designer is satisfied with this early prototype, the system can transform the sketch into a complete, finished interface in a specified look-and-feel. This transformation takes place with the guidance of the designer. By supporting the early design phases of the software life-cycle, our tool should both ease the prototyping of user interfaces and improve the speed with which a final interface can be created.
