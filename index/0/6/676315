Sensor networks are commonly deployed to monitor natural phenomena in the physical world. The sink uses data collected by sensors to build a map of the spatial propagation or the temporal evolution of the phenomenon under study. Recently, it has been observed that, even under normal operating conditions, data funneled toward the sink lead to large packet losses due to congestion. This congestion problem is accentuated because of the funneling effect (i.e., many-to-one multi-hop communications). While the funneling effect makes communications problematic, another innate characteristic of sensor networks provides a key to efficiently solving the congestion problem. In fact, traffic generated by sensor network applications is typically characterized by a high degree of spatialcorrelation [3] between data events because all the sensors located in the area where the phenomenon occurs, will notify the sink of the same event information. We believe such spatial-correlation can be exploited to efficiently mitigate network congestion in sensor networks. In addition, temporal correlation, where sensors frequently send data packets which do not differ very much over time, also contributes towards congestion. However, temporal correlation is not such a critical issue since it can be solved locally by nodes
