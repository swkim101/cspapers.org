Active learning reduces the labeling cost by selectively querying the most valuable information from the annotator. It is essentially important for multilabel learning, where the labeling cost is rather high because each object may be associated with multiple labels. Existing multi-label active learning (MLAL) research mainly focuses on the task of selecting instances to be queried. In this paper, we disclose for the first time that the query type, which decides what information to query for the selected instance, is more important. Based on this observation, we propose a novel MLAL framework to query the relevance ordering of label pairs, which gets richer information from each query and requires less expertise of the annotator. By incorporating a simple selection strategy and a label ranking model into our framework, the proposed approach can reduce the labeling effort of annotators significantly. Experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and a manually labeled real data validate that our approach not only achieves superior performance on classification, but also provides accurate ranking for relevant labels.
