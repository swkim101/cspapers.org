Current navigation mechanisms for the World Wide Web promote a depth-first search for information on pages in hyperspace. This search strategy frequently results in the unintentional and often undesirable behavior of “web surfing” — a user starts off in search of some information, but is sidetracked by tangential links. We propose a set of mechanisms based on breadth-first traversal that are better suited for directed searching. We have implemented our ideas as a scratchpad by augmenting an existing browser. Such a system makes web navigation both faster and easier.
