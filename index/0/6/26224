Web search quality can vary widely across languages, even for the same information need. We propose to exploit this variation in quality by learning a ranking function on bilingual queries: queries that appear in query logs for two languages but represent equivalent search interests. For a given bilingual query, along with corresponding monolingual query log and monolingual ranking, we generate a ranking on pairs of documents, one from each language. Then we learn a linear ranking function which exploits bilingual features on pairs of documents, as well as standard monolingual features. Finally, we show how to reconstruct monolingual ranking from a learned bilingual ranking. Using publicly available Chinese and English query logs, we demonstrate for both languages that our ranking technique exploiting bilingual data leads to significant improvements over a state-of-the-art monolingual ranking algorithm.
