Traditional machine-learned ranking algorithms for web search are trained in batch mode, which assume static relevance of documents for a given query. Although such a batch-learning framework has been tremendously successful in commercial search engines, in scenarios where relevance of documents to a query changes over time, such as ranking recent documents for a breaking news query, the batch-learned ranking functions do have limitations. Users' real-time click feedback becomes a better and timely proxy for the varying relevance of documents rather than the editorial judgments provided by human editors. In this paper, we propose an online learning algorithm that can quickly learn the best re-ranking of the top portion of the original ranked list based on real-time users' click feedback. In order to devise our algorithm and evaluate it accurately, we collected exploration bucket data that removes positional biases on clicks on the documents for recency-classified queries. Our initial experimental result shows that our scheme is more capable of quickly adjusting the ranking to track the varying relevance of documents reflected in the click feedback, compared to batch-trained ranking functions.
