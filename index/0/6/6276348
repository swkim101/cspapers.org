An efficient search algorithm for finding optimal deadlock-free schedules in FMS modeled by S/sup 4/R nets is presented. The algorithm is based on the branch and bound principle, the depth first search and truncation techniques based on the structure theory of Petri nets. It is applied to the timed S/sup 4/R net extended with priority rules. The efficiency of the proposed approach is illustrated using an example from the literature.
