I feel we should be very optimistic that future CAD will enable cost-effective device designs as process geometrics continue to scale downward. Obviously, CAD in the 80's will be significantly different than CAD in the 60's and 70's. We will experience a transition which will focus emphasis on the management of design complexity and higher-level forms of device design in an effort to maintain competitively acceptable levels of designer productivity. Also, the influence of color graphics, microprocessors, telecommunications, and distributed computing concepts will have a profound impact on VLSI device design methodology.
 The enormous increase in device complexity anticipated with VLSI, will demand conceptual and algorithmic innovations in digital-analog simulation and circuit analysis. It is rather obvious that continuous increases in model size, number of logic gates and circuit nodes, causes an exponential increase in computer costs associated with exercising the model in generating analytical behavior. Therefore, more cost-effective algorithmic techniques and hierarchial methods must be developed for VLSI digital-analog simulation and circuit analysis. Another extremely perplexing design problem is device testability. If built-in test (BIT) techniques, which appear very promising, are developed, it will impact future device architecture and test synthesis methodologies. CAD must be a partner in catalizing these technological changes.
