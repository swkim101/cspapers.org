This paper deals with the algebra used to compose access control policies of collaborating organizations. To maintain a conceptual coherence and to have a common basis for comparison, we seek a framework that can be viewed at different levels of abstraction. In [21, 22], we presented a propositional version of the algebra that can support algebraic manipulations of uninterpreted policies. This paper extends the algebra to many sorted first order predicate case. The predicate version can be used to reason about first order properties of security policies from their components. We show how to compose and reason about security properties such as those used in role based access control models usually specified using second order (set) quantifiers in languages (see RCL2000 [1]). We also show how different application specific notions of consistency and completeness can be formulated as sentences in our many sorted first order logic and propose a Hoare calculus to reason about them.
