We address the design space exploration of wireless body area networks for wearable and implantable technologies, a task that is increasingly challenging as the number and variety of devices per person grow. Our method efficiently decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems by coordinating specialized analysis and optimization techniques. We leverage mixed integer linear programming to generate candidate network configurations based on coarse energy estimations. Accurate discrete-event simulation is used to check the feasibility of the proposed configurations under reliability constraints and guide the search to achieve fast convergence. Numerical results show that our application-specific approach substantially reduces the exploration time with respect to generic optimization techniques and helps provide clear identification of promising solutions.
