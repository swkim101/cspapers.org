This paper presents a new, highly parallel algorithm for OPS5 production system matching, and a multiprocessor architecture to support it. The algorithm is based on a partitioning of the Rete algorithm at the comparison level, suitable for execution on an array of several hundred processing elements. The architecture' provides an execution environment which optimizes the algorithm's performance. Analysis of existing production systems and results of simulations indicate that an increase in match speed of two orders of magnitude or more over current implementations is possible.
