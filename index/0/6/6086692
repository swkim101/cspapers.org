In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking scheme where both visible and invisible watermarking are embedded into video sequences. Our invisible watermarking is implemented based on the influence of background after embedding the visible watermarking by the adaptive cross correlation (ACC) method. By doing so, our method can be used to achieve two purposes: 1) to announce the ownership of video and 2) to distinguish the legal user. Experimental results showed that our proposed method is suitable for digital e-commerce business and is robust against slight geometrical attacks and video processing attacks.
