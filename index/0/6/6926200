Tutor 'N' Trainer (TNT) is an automated tutor for vi, the UNIX#8482; system screen editor. TNT fosters learning by doing. The <italic>Tutor</italic> component guides the student's practice with spoken instruction and feedback. The <italic>Trainer</italic> component assures safety during practice by permitting only previously taught and appropriate operations. Individualization and effectiveness are achieved in two ways: special <italic>helper keys</italic> enable slow learners to get extra help and repeat troublesome tasks; and <italic>practice loops</italic> force slow learners to practice tasks repeatedly until competency is achieved.
