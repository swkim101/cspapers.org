Appearance models have been applied to model the space of human faces over the last two decades. In particular, active appearance models (AAMs) have been successfully used for face tracking, synthesis and recognition, and they are one of the state-of-the-art approaches due to its efficiency and representational power. Although widely employed, AAMs suffer from a few drawbacks, such as the inability to isolate pose, identity and expression changes. This paper proposes Bilinear Active Appearance Models (BAAMs), an extension of AAMs, that effectively decouple changes due to pose and expression/identity. We derive a gradient-descent algorithm to efficiently fit BAAMs to new images. Experimental results show how BAAMs improve generalization and convergence with respect to the linear model. In addition, we illustrate decoupling benefits of BAAMs in face recognition across pose. We show how the pose normalization provided by BAAMs increase the recognition performance of commercial systems.
