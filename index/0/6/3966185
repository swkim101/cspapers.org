Low-cost sensors are widely used to realize large-scale deployment for sensing systems. In this paper, we discuss challenges in using industrial-grade gas sensors for air quality monitoring. To overcome variation due to system errors, we present a framework for individualized calibration. Within the framework, multiple regression and interpolation methods are prepared for alternative optimization on fitting sensors' response to gas concentration.
