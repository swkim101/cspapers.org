Detecting malicious web pages used in attacks and building blacklists and signatures from them are done to protect users against drive-by download attacks. Gathering the content on web pages by crawling and evaluating it to check if it is malicious can help in detecting malicious web pages. Methods that apply supervised machine learning to this evaluation are proposed for detecting malicious web pages from a massive amount of web pages. However, these methods need manual inspections for preparing training data when classifiers are retrained in accordance with changes in the content on malicious web pages. In this paper, we propose a method that evaluates whether web pages are malicious and needs only the discrimination results of web pages identified by high-interaction honeyclients to prepare training data. This method evaluates maliciousness on the basis of the structural similarity of redirection chains arising from drive-by download attacks. The results of our experiments with two years of data showed that the accuracy of our method was about 20\% higher than that of the previous method.
