We investigate the effectiveness of a predictive interaction animation tool for understanding graph algorithms. We compare performance improvement of students after they have used two different animation tools for the given algorithms, when one of the tools forces a more active, predictive approach while the other is a more traditional animation. Results show significant improvement in performance after students use the predictive tool.
