In this paper we present a vector-based 3D localization formula for a paracatadioptric omnistereo system. Based on vector representation, the performance of this stereo system is analyzed numerically, including the maximum detectable range and the uncertainty of 3D localization, with respect to the flexible stereo configuration of the system, positions of scene points, as well as errors in correspondence matching and errors in stereo configuration. The results of performance analysis are used to guide the trajectory of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), which is equipped with a paracatadioptric omnidirectional camera, in a map building application.
