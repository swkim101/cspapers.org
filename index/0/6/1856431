In this paper, we address the task of crosslingual semantic relatedness. We introduce a method that relies on the information extracted from Wikipedia, by exploiting the interlanguage links available between Wikipedia versions in multiple languages. Through experiments performed on several language pairs, we show that the method performs well, with a performance comparable to monolingual measures of relatedness.
