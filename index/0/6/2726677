Effective indexing for XML must consider both the query requirements of the XPath language and the dynamic nature of XML. We introduce MASS, a Multiple Axis Storage Structure, to provide scalable indexing for XPath expressions with guaranteed update performance. We describe the building blocks of MASS and provide results that demonstrate MASS's scalability. We show that MASS can outperform other state-of-the-art XML indexing solutions, even with constrained system resources.
