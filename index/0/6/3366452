In this paper, we describe an automated learning approach to text categorization based on perception learning and a new feature selection metric, called correlation coefficient. Our approach has been teated on the standard Reuters text categorization collection. Empirical results indicate that our approach outperforms the best published results on this % uters collection. In particular, our new feature selection method yields comiderable improvement. We also investigate the usability of our automated hxu-n-~ approach by actually developing a system that categorizes texts into a tree of categories. We compare tbe accuracy of our learning approach to a rrddmsed, expert system ap preach that uses a text categorization shell built by Cams gie Group. Although our automated learning approach still gives a lower accuracy, by appropriately inmrporating a set of manually chosen worda to use as f~ures, the combined, semi-automated approach yields accuracy close to the * baaed approach.
