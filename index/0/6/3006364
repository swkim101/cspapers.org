We present WiBi, an approach to the automatic creation of a bitaxonomy for Wikipedia, that is, an integrated taxonomy of Wikipage pages and categories. We leverage the information available in either one of the taxonomies to reinforce the creation of the other taxonomy. Our experiments show higher quality and coverage than state-of-the-art resources like DBpedia, YAGO, MENTA, WikiNet and WikiTaxonomy. WiBi is available at http://wibitaxonomy.org.
