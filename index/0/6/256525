In typically developing infants, the onset of crawling and walking is associated with changes across development domains such as cognition and perception ([1], [2]). Currently, infants born with significant mobility impairments do not use powered wheelchairs until three years of age [3]. This potentially limits their development in the early growth years. The goal of this research is to train infants with impairments to safely and purposefully drive a mobile robot indoors while being seated on it. We anticipate that these impaired infants will benefit from early mobility in their early years, similar to their healthy peers.
