We introduce a new multilingual resource containing judgments about nominal compound compositionality in English, French and Portuguese. It covers 3 Ã— 180 noun-noun and adjective-noun compounds for which we provide numerical compositionality scores for the head word, for the modifier and for the compound as a whole, along with possible paraphrases. This resource was constructed by native speakers via crowdsourcing. It can serve as basis for evaluating tasks such as lexical substitution and compositionality prediction.
