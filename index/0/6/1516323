Computer evaluation, comparison, and selection is essentially a decision process. The decision making is based on a number of worth indicators, including various computer performance indicators. The performance indicators are obtained through the computer performance measurement procedure. Consequently, this procedure should be completely conditioned by the decision process.
 This paper investigates various aspects of computer performance measurement and evaluation procedure within the context of computer evaluation, comparison and selection process based on the Logic Scoring of Preference method. The set of elementary criteria for performance evaluation is proposed and the corresponding set of performance indicators is defined. The necessary performance measurements are based on the standardized set of synthetic benchmark programs and include three separate measurements: monoprogramming performance measurement, multiprogramming performance measurement, and multiprogramming efficiency measurement. Using the proposed elementary criteria, the measured performance indicators can be transformed into elementary preferences and aggregated with other non-performance elementary preferences obtained through the evaluation process. The applicability of presented elementary criteria is illustrated by numerical examples.
