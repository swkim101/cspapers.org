The purpose of this paper is to present the basis of an automata-theoretic model which treats the concept of “schedule” for programs which admit a (predefined) degree of parallelism.
 After a brief review of notational conventions (Section 2), the class of representing automata will be introduced as a device for treating a program's control structure. In Section 4, since the definition of schedules is non-constructive in the sense that no procedure is given for passing from a representing automaton to a schedule, a particular kind of schedule with such an effective presentation is given and shown to be optimal in the natural sense of optimality defined in Section 6. Section 5 presents one of the many possible interpretation schemes for our model; this scheme is used to justify some of the claims we have made in this section. Finally, we examine some elementary conditions, on a program's control structure which affect the existence of optimal schedules which have finite, explicit presentation.
