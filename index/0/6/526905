This paper details the development and implementation of a summer robotics camp for middle school children. The Cognitive Apprenticeship (CA) model is used as the framework for developing the camp. Specifically, methods such as modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, and exploration are integrated throughout the camp structure. Activities include the use of an engineering notebook, debugging logs, and various cognitive challenges, all supervised by a team of expert mentors. During the two-week summer camp, participants realized a positive shift in attitudes towards science, developed common engineering design skills, and showed increased proficiency in the reasoning pattern of isolation of variables. The CA framework, in conjunction with robotics are an excellent way to build interest in STEM and develop skills in engineering, science, and computational thinking.
