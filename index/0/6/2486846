Automated Test Case Generation (ATCG) is an important topic in Software Testing, with a wide range of techniques and tools being used in academia and industry. While their usefulness is widely recognized, due to the labor-intensive nature of the task, the effectiveness of the different techniques in automatically generating test cases for different software systems is not thoroughly understood. Despite many studies introducing various ATCG techniques, much remains to be learned, however, about what makes a particular technique work well (or not) for a specific software system. Therefore, we propose a new methodology to evaluate and select the most effective ATCG technique using structure-based complexity measures. Empirical tests are going to be performed using two different techniques: Search-based Software Testing (SBST) and Random Testing (RT).
