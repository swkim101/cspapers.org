This paper presents a logical extension of Nash's Cooperative Bargaining Theory. We introduce a concept of entrenchment measurement, which maps propositions to real numbers, as a vehicle to represent agent's belief states and attitudes towards bargaining situations. We show that Nash's bargaining solution can be restated in terms of bargainers belief states. Negotiable items, bargaining outcomes and conflicting arguments can then be explicitly expressed in propositional logic meanwhile Nash's numerical solution to bargaining problem is still applicable.
