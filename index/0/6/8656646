Currently, the most complex spacecraft attitude determination and control tasks are ultimately governed by ground-based systems and personnel. Conventional on-board systems face severe computational bottlenecks introduced by serial microprocessors operating on inherently parallel problems. New computer architectures based on the anatomy of the human brain seem to promise high speed and fault-tolerant solutions to the limitations of serial processing. This paper discusses the latest applications of artificial neural networks to the problem of star pattern recognition for spacecraft attitude determination.
