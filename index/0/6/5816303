Currently most of state-of-the-art methods for Chinese word segmentation are based on supervised learning, whose features aremostly extracted from a local context. Thesemethods cannot utilize the long distance information which is also crucial for word segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model for Chinese word segmentation, which adopts the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to keep the previous important information inmemory cell and avoids the limit of window size of local context. Experiments on PKU, MSRA and CTB6 benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms the previous neural network models and state-of-the-art methods.
