In information centric network (ICN), contents are fetched by their names from caches deployed in the network or from origin servers. Once the contents are fetched from the origin server, it is replicated and cached in all routers along the routing and forwarding paths from the user that issues the interest to the origin server, thus allowing further "interests" by other users to be fulfilled quickly. However, the way ICN caching and interest fulfillment work pose a great privacy risk; the time difference between response for interest of cached and uncached contents can be used as an indicator to infer whether or not a near-by user previously requested the same contents requested by the adversary. This work introduces the extent to which the problem is applicable in ICN and provides several solutions to address it.
