This paper describes a Computer Aided Design system for sketching free-form polygonal surfaces such as terrains and other natural objects. The user manipulates two 3D position and orientation trackers with three buttons, one for each hand. Each hand has a distinct role to play, with the dominant hand being responsible for picking and manipulation, and the less-dominant hand being responsible for context setting of various kinds. The less-dominant hand holds the workpiece, sets which refinement level that can be picked by the dominant hand, and generally acts as a counterpoint to the dominant hand. In this paper, the architecture of the system is outlined, and a simple surface is shown.
