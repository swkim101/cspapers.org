Inequality constraints are useful for specifying various aspects of user interfaces, such as constraints that clne window is to the left of another, or that an object is contained within a rectangle. However, current local propagation constraint solvers canâ€™t handle inequality constraints. We present Indigo, an efficient local propagation algorithm for satisfying acyclic constraint hierarchies, including inequality constraints.
