The Web is still awkward when it comes to online editing. It is time to fix that, and make it easier for developers to create smarter browser based editing tools. This short paper presents work on a test framework for a cross browser open source library for browser based editing. The aim is to encourage a proliferation of different kinds of browser based editing for a wide range of purposes. The library steps around the considerable variations in the details of browser support for designMode and contentEditable, which have acted as a brake on realizing the full potential for browser based editing.
