This work introduces a new method called Self Organizing Neural Network (SONN) algorithm and demonstrates its use in a system identification task. The algorithm constructs the network, chooses the neuron functions, and adjusts the weights. It is compared to the Back-Propagation algorithm in the identification of the chaotic time series. The results shows that SONN constructs a simpler, more accurate model, requiring less training data and epochs. The algorithm can be applied and generalized to appilications as a classifier.
