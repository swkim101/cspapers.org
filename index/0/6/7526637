The trivial-automaton model checking problem for higher-order recursion schemes has become a widely studied object in connection with the automatic verification of higher-order programs. The problem is formidably hard: despite considerable progress in recent years, no decision procedures have been demonstrated to scale robustly beyond recursion schemes that comprise more than a few hundred rewrite rules. We present a new, fixed-parameter polynomial time algorithm, based on a novel, type directed form of abstraction refinement in which behaviours of a scheme are distinguished by the abstraction according to the intersection types that they inhabit (the properties that they satisfy). Unlike other intersection type approaches, our algorithm reasons both about acceptance by the property automaton and acceptance by its dual, simultaneously, in order to minimize the amount of work done by converging on the solution to a problem instance from both sides. We have constructed Preface, a prototype implementation of the algorithm, and assembled an extensive body of evidence to demonstrate empirically that the algorithm readily scales to recursion schemes of several thousand rules, well beyond the capabilities of current state-of-the-art higher-order model checkers.
