We examine the evolution of five social networking sites where complex networks of social relationships developed: Twitter, Flickr, DeviantArt, Delicious, and Yahoo! Answers. We study the differences and similarities in edge creation mechanisms in these social networks. We find large differences in edge reciprocation rates and overall structure of the underlying networks. We demonstrate that two mechanisms can explain these disparities: directed triadic closure, which leads to networks that show characteristics of status-oriented behavior, and reciprocation, which leads to friendship-oriented behavior. We develop a model that demonstrates how variances in these mechanisms lead to characteristic differences in the expression of network subgraph motifs. Lastly, we show how a user's future popularity, her indegree, can be predicted based on her initial edge creation behavior.
