A logic for case structure systems is presented which allows variations in the order and number of terms in atomic formulas. This logic is used to describe and characterize four existing case systems. A computer program which allows flexible case structures is then described. Applications of the program to medical record analysis and disease modeling are used to illustrate important concepts about case systems. Several open problems are also discussed.
