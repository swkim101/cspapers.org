In this paper, a novel approach for parallel kinematic machine control relying on a fast exteroceptive measure is implemented and validated on the Orthoglide robot. This approach begins with rewriting the robot models as a function of the only end-effector pose. It is shown that such an operation reduces the model complexity. Then, this approach uses a classical Cartesian space computed torque control with a fast exteroceptive measure, reducing the control schemes complexity. Simulation results are given to show the expected performance improvements and experiments prove the practical feasibility of the approach.
