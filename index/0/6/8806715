We exploit and extend the Generative Lexicon Theory to develop a formal description of adnominal constituents in a lexicon which can deal with linguistic phenomena found in Japanese adnominal constituents. We classify the problematic behavior into "static disambiguation" and "dynamic disambiguation" tasks. Static disambiguation can be done using lexical information in a dictionary, whereas dynamic disambiguation requires inferences at the knowledge representation level.
