I n t r o d u c t i o n Natural language instructions, though prevalent in many spheres of communication, have only recently begun to receive at tention within computational linguistics[5]. Instructions are often accompanied by language intended to signal repetition of the action that they instruct. In order to develop a system that is able to understand instructions, with the goal of executing them, it is necessary to investigate what is meant by various types of repetition, and the different ways in which repetition can be expressed. We focus on sentences that are instructing that some action is to be performed and that this action is to be performed more than once 1. There are two aspects to consider scope (what part of the action that is instructed in the dialogue is to be repeated) and extent (how much repetition is to be done). This is illustrated by examples (1) and (2).
