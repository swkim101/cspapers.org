Node.js is one of the hottest open source web platforms currently available. It's used by companies like PayPal, DowJones, Walmart, Netflix, and Yahoo. Node.js allows you to use JavaScript to write all kinds of network servers in just a few lines of code, definitely easier than using other platforms based on languages such as C++, C# or Java. If you know how to use JavaScript on the front end (i.e., the browser), it's a breeze to use it on the back end (i.e., the server). This workshop is aimed at CS instructors that wish to teach students how to use and write RESTful web services (a.k.a. web APIs) using Node.js on a cloud platform. The only thing you need is a computer with a modern web browser and a Wi-Fi connection. Participants will use the free service provided by the Cloud9 platform (https://c9.io/) to learn how to write scalable web services using Node.js, the Express web framework, MySQL, and Ajax via jQuery. Web services allows us to build powerful web based applications using data from multiple online sources. And, by using a cloud platform, we have all our tools readily available through a web browser, thus eliminating the hassle related to installing a complete and fully functional web development environment. Participants are expected to have a working knowledge of JavaScript, SQL and HTML. Additional information available at http://node.arielortiz.info/ Laptop required.
