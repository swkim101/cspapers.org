Structured P2P systems are a prominent representative of a class of systems where participants communicate via a given structure. Peers in such systems must show cooperative behavior, to avoid performance degradation of the system. Economic literature has proposed various mechanisms to stimulate cooperation. Their effectiveness strongly depends on the interaction scenario. The two important scenarios are the partner scenario, where participants interact repeatedly, and the stranger scenario, where participants tend to interact only once. The use of shared histories is beneficial in the stranger scenario, but it is not necessary in the partner scenario. This paper is based on the observation that the systems investigated here do not match either of these scenarios. Thus, we propose indirect partner interaction as a new interaction scenario, i.e., peers interact indirectly via a sequence of peers. To study peer behavior in this new scenario without any assumptions, we have carried out economic experiments. They give way to the following results: Participants interacting on behalf of strangers show roughly the same degree of cooperative behavior as with the other mechanisms examined, like partner design or punishment. While participants tend to rely on the shared history if no other information is available, they use the network structure as basis for their strategic decisions whenever possible. The presence of a shared history does not lead to an increase of the payoff earned in such a system. We conclude that the settings investigated here do not need shared histories to stimulate cooperation.
