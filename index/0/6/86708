For decades, researchers have debated the pros and cons of adaptive user interfaces with enthusiastic AI practitioners often confronting skeptical HCI experts (Shneiderman & Maes, 1997). This paper summarizes the SUPPLE project’s six years of work analyzing the characteristics of successful adaptive interfaces and developing efficient algorithms for their automatic generation (Gajos & Weld, 2004; Gajos et al., 2005; Gajos & Weld, 2005; Gajos et al., 2006; Gajos, Wobbrock, & Weld, 2007; Gajos et al., 2008; Gajos, Wobbrock, & Weld, 2008). We conclude that personalized user interfaces, which are adapted to a person’s devices, tasks, preferences and abilities, can improve user satisfaction and performance. Further, we demonstrate that automatic generation of these interfaces is computationally feasible. We developed two systems which autonomously construct a broad range of personalized adaptive interfaces: 1) SUPPLE/ARNAULD uses decision-theoretic optimization to automatically generate user interfaces adapted to target device, usage patterns, and a learned model of user preferences, and 2) SUPPLE++ first performs a one-time assessment of a person’s motor abilities and then automatically generates user interfaces adapted to that user’s abilities. Our experiments show that these automatically generated interfaces significantly improve speed, accuracy and satisfaction of users with motor impairments compared to manufacturers’ defaults. We also provide the first characterization of the design space of adaptive interfaces and demonstrate how such interfaces can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of daily interactions for typical users.
