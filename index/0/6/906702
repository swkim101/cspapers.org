This paper presents a hierarchical composition approach for multi-view object tracking. The key idea is to adaptively exploit multiple cues in both 2D and 3D, e.g., ground occupancy consistency, appearance similarity, motion coherence etc., which are mutually complementary while tracking the humans of interests over time. While feature online selection has been extensively studied in the past literature, it remains unclear how to effectively schedule these cues for the tracking purpose especially when encountering various challenges, e.g. occlusions, conjunctions, and appearance variations. To do so, we propose a hierarchical composition model and re-formulate multi-view multi-object tracking as a problem of compositional structure optimization. We setup a set of composition criteria, each of which corresponds to one particular cue. The hierarchical composition process is pursued by exploiting different criteria, which impose constraints between a graph node and its offsprings in the hierarchy. We learn the composition criteria using MLE on annotated data and efficiently construct the hierarchical graph by an iterative greedy pursuit algorithm. In the experiments, we demonstrate superior performance of our approach on three public datasets, one of which is newly created by us to test various challenges in multi-view multi-object tracking.
