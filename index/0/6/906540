This paper describes an efficient control mechanism for incorporating picture-specific context in the task of image interpretation. Although other knowledge-based vision systems use general domain context in reducing the computational burden of image interpretation, to our knowledge, this is the first effort in exploring picture-specific collateral information. We assume that constraints on the picture are generated from a natural language understanding module which processes descriptive text accompanying the pictures. We have developed a unified framework for exploiting these constraints both in the object location and identification (labeling) stage. In particular, we describe a technique for incorporating constrained search in context-based vision. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in PICTION, a system that uses captions to label human faces in newspaper photographs.
