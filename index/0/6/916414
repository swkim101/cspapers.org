We present in this work a new model (named AntTree) based on artificial ants for document hierarchical clustering. This model is inspired from the self-assembly behavior of real ants. We have simulated this behavior to build a hierarchical tree-structured partitioning of a set of documents, according to the similarities between these documents. We have successfully compared our results to those obtained by ascending hierarchical clustering.
