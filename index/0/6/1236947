Hash-based similarity search reduces a continuous similarity relation to the binary concept "similar or not similar": two feature vectors are considered as similar if they are mapped on the same hash key. From its runtime performance this principle is unequaled--while being unaffected by dimensionality concerns at the same time. Similarity hashing is applied with great success for near similarity search in large document collections, and it is considered as a key technology for near-duplicate detection and plagiarism analysis. This papers reveals the design principles behind hash-based search methods and presents them in a unified way. We introduce new stress statistics that are suited to analyze the performance of hash-based search methods, and we explain the rationale of their effectiveness. Based on these insights, we show how optimum hash functions for similarity search can be derived. We also present new results of a comparative study between different hash-based search methods.
