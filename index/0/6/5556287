In this work, we present a distributed caching solution which addresses the problem of efficient delivery of HTTP live streams in large private networks. With our system, we have conducted tests on a number of pilot deployments. The largest of them, with 3000 concurrent viewers, consistently showed that our system saves more than 90% of traffic towards the source of the stream while providing the same quality of user experience of a CDN. Another result is that our solution was able to reduce the load on the bottlenecks in the network by an average of 91.6%.
