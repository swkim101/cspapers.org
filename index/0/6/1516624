Multi-dimensional data is being generated at an ever increasing rate in practically all modern applications. The development of techniques and tools to extract useful information out of such data is one of critical challenges to be tackled in the 21st century. Visualization is one popular technique for achieving effective data exploration by exploiting the visual perception abilities of domain experts. Visualization involves the graphical presentation of data and information for the purposes of communicating results, verifying hypotheses, and qualitative exploration. In this demonstration, we present our solution to particular challenges we have been tackling in this area in the context of our XMDVtool project, a multi-year effort funded by NSF. These include multivariate data visualization to facilitate outlier and pattern discovery via a variety of displays, visual interaction tools, scalability of these visualization techniques to large data sets, interaction with commercial database technology and, more recently, extensions to handle data of very high-dimensionality.
