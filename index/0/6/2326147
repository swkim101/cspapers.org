This paper describes a new task-oriented grasping method to reorient a rigid object to its nominal pose, which is defined as the configuration that it needs to be grasped from, in order to successfully execute a particular manipulation task. Our method combines two key insights: (1) a visual 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) pose estimation technique based on 2D-3D point correspondences is used to estimate the object pose in real-time and (2) the rigid transformation from the current to the nominal pose is computed online and the object is reoriented over a sequence of steps. The outcome of this work is a novel method that can be effectively used in the preparatory phase of a manipulation task, to permit a robot to start from arbitrary object placements and configure the manipulated objects to the nominal pose, as required for the execution of a subsequent task. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a full-size humanoid robot (WALK-MAN) using different objects with various pose settings under real-time constraints.
