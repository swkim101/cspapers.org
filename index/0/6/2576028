In this paper we consider the problem of controlling a robotic system using the projection of 3D lines in the image plane of central catadioptric systems. Most of the efforts in visual servoing are devoted to points, only few works have investigated the use of lines in visual servoing with traditional cameras and none has explored the case of omnidirectional cameras. First a generic central catadioptric interaction matrix for the projection of 3D straight lines is derived from the projection model of an entire class of camera. Then an image-based control law is designed and validated through simulation results.
