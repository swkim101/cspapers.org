We present an implemented XML data model and a new, simplified query language for multi-level annotated corpora. The new query language involves automatic conversion of queries into the underlying, more complicated MMAXQL query language. It supports queries for sequential and hierarchical, but also associative (e.g. coreferential) relations. The simplified query language has been designed with non-expert users in mind.
