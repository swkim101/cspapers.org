Predictive state representations (PSRs) are a recently-developed way to model discrete-time, controlled dynamical systems. We present and describe two algorithms for learning a PSR model: a Monte Carlo algorithm and a temporal difference (TD) algorithm. Both of these algorithms can learn models for systems without requiring a reset action as was needed by the previously available general PSR-model learning algorithm. We present empirical results that compare our two algorithms and also compare their performance with that of existing algorithms, including an EM algorithm for learning POMDP models.
