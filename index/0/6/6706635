We present a new chart parsing method for Lambek grammars, inspired by a method for D-Tree grammar parsing. The formulae of a Lambek sequent are firstly converted into rules of an indexed grammar formalism, which are used in an Earley-style predictive chart algorithm. The method is non-polynomial, but performs well for practical purposes---much better than previous chart methods for Lambek grammars.
