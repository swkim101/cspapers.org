This paper describes a one-dimensional compactor which works efficiently on basic VLSI layout. The compactor operates on a tiled layout structure which represents any VLSI layout containing 45Â° multiple angles. The compaction program performs both pitch minimization and wire length minimization in either X or Y directions. The compactor works quickly and efficiently due to the clever use of the layout structure and graph based Simplex method. The compactor corrects design rule violations and preserves wire widths. It does not yet introduce jogs or compact hierarchically. Results are given for a few CMOS examples.
