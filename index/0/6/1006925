We propose a technique to prepare the Google 1T n-gram data set for wildcarded frequency queries with a very low turnaround time, making unbatched applications possible. Our method supports token-level wildcarding and -- given a cache of 3.3 GB of RAM - requires only a single read of less than 4 KB from the disk to answer a query. We present an indexing structure, a way to generate it, and suggestions for how it can be tuned to particular applications.
