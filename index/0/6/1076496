In contrast to classical databases and IR systems, real-world information systems have to deal increasingly with very vague and diverse structures for information management and storage that cannot be adequately handled yet. While current object-relational database systems require clear and unified data schemas, IR systems usually ignore the structured information completely. Malleable schemas, as recently introduced, provide a novel way to deal with vagueness, ambiguity and diversity by incorporating imprecise and overlapping definitions of data structures. In this paper, we propose a novel query relaxation scheme that enables users to find best matching information by exploiting malleable schemas to effectively query vaguely structured information. Our scheme utilizes duplicates in differently described data sets to discover the correlations within a malleable schema, and then uses these correlations to appropriately relax the users' queries. In addition, it ranks results of the relaxed query according to their respective probability of satisfying the original query's intent. We have implemented the scheme and conducted extensive experiments with real-world data to confirm its performance and practicality.
