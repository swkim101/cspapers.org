There are numerous possibilities to assemble a very resource-efficient and power-aware distributed sensor network tailored to a specific application. However, the task of initializing the network has not yet attracted much attention. This paper presents the NoSE (Neighbor Search and link Estimation) initialization scheme. NoSE provides an exhaustive neighbor search including a thorough link assessment, leveraging both high reactivity and greatly minimized energy consumption. Based on the information obtained in the initial link assessment phase, a routing protocol can subsequently set up and use an optimized network topology.
