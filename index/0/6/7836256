At CHI 2016, the Development Consortium titled HCI Across Borders (HCIxB) was widely attended by 71 participants from 20 countries and six continents. The goal of this workshop was to build community and invite collaborations ?across borders? on themes of interest for the participants ? researchers actively involved in international HCI research, with many of them working in parts of the ?developing? world. In 2017, our goal is to extend these conversations to fuel community building beyond the workshop. The question we ask, therefore, is how we might align our efforts to reach potential members of our larger HCI community, even those who do not or are unable to attend CHI, to work towards a more cohesive global community. Further, we ask, what might the format of these efforts be? We invite proposals along these lines with the intention of bringing people together to discuss and workshop ideas for research directions, venues, activities, and events that would be natural extensions of HCIxB 2016 as well as HCIxB 2017, that we propose herein.
