TypeRight is a new tactile input device for text entry. It combines the advantages of tactile feedback with error prevention methods of word processors. TypeRight extends the standard keyboard so that the resistance to press each key becomes dynamically adjustable through software. Before each keystroke, the resistance of keys that would lead to a typing error according to dictionary and grammar rules is increased momentarily to make them harder to press, thus avoiding typing errors rather than indicating them after the fact. Two user studies showed that TypeRight decreases error correction rates by an average of 46%.
