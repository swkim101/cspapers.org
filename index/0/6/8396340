In this paper, an impedance control scheme for aerial robotic manipulators is proposed, with the aim of reducing the end-effector interaction forces with the environment. The proposed control has a multi-level architecture, in detail the outer loop is composed by a trajectory generator and an impedance filter that modifies the trajectory to achieve a complaint behaviour in the end-effector space; a middle loop is used to generate the joint space variables through an inverse kinematic algorithm; finally the inner loop is aimed at ensuring the motion tracking. The proposed control architecture has been experimentally tested.
