The computer simulation of internal combustion engines is a task that numerous researchers have contributed to in recent years, primarily because of the advent of digital computers with large storage and fast processing capabilities. Engine simulation is particularly important today as we try to solve the problems of air pollution and energy depletion.
 Many aspects of engine operation are poorly understood because of the problems encountered when attempting to measure the variables that describe the engine's operation. This fact complicates both the control and design of engines.
 Parameter sensitivity studies could very well lead to improved performance measures that will enhance both the control and design of internal combustion engines in the years to come. These studies are discussed here in terms of what they could contribute for control and also for design purposes.
