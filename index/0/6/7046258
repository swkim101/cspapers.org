We introduce a notion of universality in the context of optimization problems with partial information. Universality is a framework for dealing with uncertainty by guaranteeing a certain quality of goodness for all possible completions of the partial information set. Universal variants of optimization problems can be defined that are both natural and well-motivated. We consider universal versions of three classical problems: TSP, Steiner Tree and Set Cover.We present a polynomial-time algorithm to find a universal tour on a given metric space over n vertices such that for any subset of the vertices, the sub-tour induced by the subset is within O(log4n/log log n) of an optimal tour for the subset. Similarly, we show that given a metric space over n vertices and a root vertex, we can find a universal spanning tree such that for any subset of vertices containing the root, the sub-tree induced by the subset is within O(log4n/log log n) of an optimal Steiner tree for the subset. Our algorithms rely on a new notion of sparse partitions, that may be of independent interest. For the special case of doubling metrics, which includes both constant-dimensional Euclidean and growth-restricted metrics, our algorithms achieve an O(log n) upper bound. We complement our results for the universal Steiner tree problem with a lower bound of Î©(log n/log log n) that holds even for n vertices on the plane. We also show that a slight generalization of the universal Steiner Tree problem is coNP-hard and present nearly tight upper and lower bounds for a universal version of Set Cover.
