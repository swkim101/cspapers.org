We present a method to distinguish direct connections between two neurons from common input originating from other, unmeasured neurons. The distinction is computed from the spike times of the two neurons in response to a white noise stimulus. Although the method is based on a highly idealized linear-nonlinear approximation of neural response, we demonstrate via simulation that the approach can work with a more realistic, integrate-and-fire neuron model. We propose that the approach exemplified by this analysis may yield viable tools for reconstructing stimulus-driven neural networks from data gathered in neurophysiology experiments.
