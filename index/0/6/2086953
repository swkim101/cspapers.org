In this paper, we provide a uniform approach to global con-â€™ currency control and recovery in multidatabase environment. Instead of considering global serializability and global atomicity as two orthogonal concepts, we simply adopt global serializability as the only correctness criterion and require global serializability to be maintained even in a failure-prone multidatabase environment. We first propose rigid conflict serializability (R-CSR) as a sufficient condition for the global transaction manager to ensure global serializability in an autonomous: heterogeneous, and failure-free multidatabase environment. Following this, we show that the combination of cascadeless R-CSR of global transactions and a wnteztsetlJitiue and lute redo recovery leads to the achievement of global serializability in a failure-prone multidatabase environment.
