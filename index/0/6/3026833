We propose a new feedback technique for 3D interaction using penumbrae which the objects cast. Rather tlhan generating a real penumbra, which is computationally expensive, a fast, simplified algorithm is employed, which also is better suited for position feedback purposes. User studies show that 1) compared to orthographic shadow projections, 3D spatial recognition and placement tasks are substantially faster with our penumbrae, and 2) the users feel the feedback to be more natural.
