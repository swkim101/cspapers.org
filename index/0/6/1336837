We present three new visualization front-ends that aid navigation through the set of documents returned by a search engine (hit documents). We cluster the hit documents to visually group these documents and label the groups with related words. The different front-ends cater for different user needs, but all can browse cluster information as well as drilling up or down in one or more clusters and refining the search using one or more of the suggested related keywords.
