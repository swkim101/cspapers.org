Quorum is a relatively new programming language that was originally designed for students with disabilities. In recent years, as its adoption has increased worldwide in K-12 (largely in middle/high school) and at universities, it has expanded to be a powerful, commercial-grade, programming language that includes support for 3D gaming, music, and other fun and creative activities. While new features are designed for all, they maintain compatibility for people with disabilities, including a novel way for individuals who are blind to create 3D games. Finally, Quorum is the first language to use human-factors evidence from both field data and randomized controlled trials in its design. This approach provides the broader research community an organized way to influence the design of the language over time according to evidence based practices. We call this approach evidence-oriented programming. A laptop would help participants follow along with the session and handouts will be provided.
