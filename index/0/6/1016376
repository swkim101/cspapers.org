We give an efficient procedure for verifying that a finite state concurrent system meets a specification expressed in a (propositional) branching-time temporal logic. Our algorithm has complexity linear in both the size of the specification and the size of the global transition graph for the concurrent system. We also show how the logic and our algorithm can be modified to handle fairness. We argue that this technique can provide a practical alternative to manual proof construction or use of a mechanical theorem prover for verifying many finite state concurrent systems.
