We describe the use of smoothing spline analysis of variance (SSANOVA) in the penalized log likelihood context, for learning (estimating) the probability p of a '1' outcome, given a training set with attribute vectors and outcomes. p is of the form p(t) = ef(t)/(1 + ef(t)), where, if t is a vector of attributes, f is learned as a sum of smooth functions of one attribute plus a sum of smooth functions of two attributes, etc. The smoothing parameters governing f are obtained by an iterative unbiased risk or iterative GCV method. Confidence intervals for these estimates are available.
