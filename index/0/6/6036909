Personalize PageRank (PPR) is an effective relevance (proximity) measure in graph mining. The goal of this paper is to efficiently compute single node relevance and top-k/highly relevant nodes without iteratively computing the relevances of all nodes. Based on a "random surfer model", PPR iteratively computes the relevances of all nodes in a graph until convergence for a given user preference distribution. The problem with this iterative approach is that it cannot compute the relevance of just one or a few nodes. The heart of our solution is to compute single node relevance accurately in non-iterative manner based on sparse matrix representation, and to compute top-k/highly relevant nodes exactly by pruning unnecessary relevance computations based on upper/lower relevance estimations. Our experiments show that our approach is up to seven orders of magnitude faster than the existing alternatives.
