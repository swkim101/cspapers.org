We examine how to apply the hash-join paradigm to spatial joins, and define a new framework for spatial hash-joins. Our spatial partition functions have two components: a set of bucket extents and an assignment function, which may map a data item into multiple buckets. Furthermore, the partition functions for the two input datasets may be different.We have designed and tested a spatial hash-join method based on this framework. The partition function for the inner dataset is initialized by sampling the dataset, and evolves as data are inserted. The partition function for the outer dataset is immutable, but may replicate a data item from the outer dataset into multiple buckets. The method mirrors relational hash-joins in other aspects. Our method needs no pre-computed indices. It is therefore applicable to a wide range of spatial joins.Our experiments show that our method outperforms current spatial join algorithms based on tree matching by a wide margin. Further, its performance is superior even when the tree-based methods have pre-computed indices. This makes the spatial hash-join method highly competitive both when the input datasets are dynamically generated and when the datasets have pre-computed indices.
