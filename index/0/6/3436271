We provide an approach for real-time analysis of ongoing events in a controlled network. We propose ReasONets, i.e. Reasoning on Networks, a distributed and lightweight system, able to process and reason about anomalies and incidents observed in closed net- works. To the best of our knowledge this is the first system combining detections and classification of network events with real-time reasoning. Our demo will show a running prototype of the ReasONets, demonstrating the power and accuracy of the reasoning process in presence of incidents of various nature.
