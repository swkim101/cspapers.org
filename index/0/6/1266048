We consider a classic multidimensional generalization of the bin packing problem, namely, packing d-dimensional rectangles into the minimum number of unit cubes. Our two results are: an asymptotic polynomial time approximation scheme for packing d-dimensional cubes into the minimum number of unit cubes and a polynomial time algorithm for packing rectangles into at most OPT bins whose sides have length (1 + ε), where OPT denotes the minimum number of unit bins required to pack the rectangles. Both algorithms also achieve the best possible additive constant term. For cubes, this settles the approximability of the problem and represents a significant improvement over the previous best known asymptotic approximation factor of 2 - (2/3)d + ε. For rectangles, this contrasts with the currently best known approximation factor of 1.691....
