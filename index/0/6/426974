Network Security applications that run on Software Defined Networks (SDNs) often need to analyze and process traffic in advanced ways. Existing approaches to adding such functionality to SDNs suffer from either poor performance, or poor deployability. In this paper, we propose and benchmark OFX: an OpenFlow extension framework that provides a better tradeoff between performance and deployability for SDN security applications by allowing them to dynamically install software modules onto network switches.
