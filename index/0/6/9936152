Advanced robotics needs a new breed of actuators, capable to exhibit a large number of desirable features, ranging from high power/torque density, high efficiency, zero backlash and low noise, to low reflected mechanical impedance, high bandwidth and accuracy. Even if it is quite evident that to fully match these requirements new basic actuation principles have to be investigated and developed in the long term, there is still scope now for innovating the field by combining mature components into new actuation schemes. This paper reports the development and the experimental evaluation of a new actuator, aiming at improving the torque density and the mechanical efficiency. The device has shown impressive performances being able to exert up to 500Nm continuous torque and 800Nm peak torque with 85% mechanical efficiency and zero backlash, up to 60Â°/s maximum output speed for a total weight of just 6Kg, comprising the structural case covering the internal mechanics. The actuator has been expressly conceived as an actuation module to be integrated in a fully powered whole body exoskeleton intended for material handling in tight and unstructured environments (see Fig.1).
