A collapsible trash bag enclosure is formed from a plastic sheet set to have a rolled up configuration and unwindable to enclose and grip trash bags within it. A tubular section at one end slips over a rod driven into the ground to fix the enclosure to the ground. Slots in the sheet reduce wind resistance and allow the insertion of clips to clip together overlapping portions of the sheet.
