We describe a new steerable projector, whose projection center precisely corresponds with its rotation center, which we call a "fixed-center pan-tilt (FC-PT) projector." This mechanism allows it be set up more easily to display graphics precisely on the planes in the environment than for other steerable projectors; wherever we would like to display graphics, all we have to do are locating the FC-PT projector in the environment, and directing it to the corners of the planes whose 2D sizes have been measured. Moreover, as the FC-PT projector can recognize automatically whether each plane is connected to others, it can display visual information that lies across the boundary line of two planes in a similar way to a paper poster folded along the planes.
