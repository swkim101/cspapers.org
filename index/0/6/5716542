We examine the consistency problem for descriptions of trees based on remote dominance, and present a consistency-checking algorithm which is polynomial in the number of nodes in the description, despite disjunctions inherent in the theory of trees. The resulting algorithm allows for descriptions which go beyond sets of atomic formulas to allow certain types of disjunction and negation.
