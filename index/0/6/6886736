The interactive test sequence generator (ITSG) is a software tool which provides the capability of generating test sequences from logic specifications in an interactive manner. A logic specification is a collection of Horn clauses coded in Prolog describing the externally observable behaviour of a system. ITSG facilitates a controlled traversal of the execution paths described by a logic specification and is written in C_Prolog running under UNIX 4.2 on Vax 750.
In this paper, first the form of logic specifications is described and an outline of a logic specification for a protocol entity (i.e., protocol specification) is presented. Then, ITSG is introduced and its functionality is explained. As well, the possible usage of ITSG in constructing conformance test suites for protocol implementation testing is discussed and a simple scenario for developing a conformance test suite is presented.
