An important problem in fault diagnosis is how to locate faulty components by analysing performance measurements from those components. In this paper, we present an algorithm that uses the information-theoretic Minimum Message Length (MML) principle to locate faults in tree-structured networks. Tree-structured networks are an important application for fault diagnosis due to their use as distribution networks in telecommunication and power industries. The main advantage of using a MML approach is that we can model both the complexity of an explanation for a set of measurements, as well as the accuracy of the explanation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through an empirical evaluation on a range of simulated data.
