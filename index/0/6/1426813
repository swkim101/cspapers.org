Many reputation management systems have been developed under the assumption that each entity in the system will use a variant of the same scoring function. Much of the previous work in reputation management has focused on providing robustness and improving performance for a given reputation scheme. In this paper, we present a reputation-based trust management framework that supports the synthesis of trust-related feedback from many different entities while also providing each entity with the flexibility to apply different scoring functions over the same feedback data for customized trust evaluations. We also propose a novel scheme to cache trust values based on recent client activity. To evaluate our approach, we implemented our trust management service and tested it on a realistic application scenario in both LAN and WAN distributed environments. Our results indicate that our trust management service can effectively support multiple scoring functions with low overhead and high availability.
