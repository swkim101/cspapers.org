A teleoperation system has been developed for a hydraulic crane, of the type used on a forwarder vehicle, which travels off-road and collects logs cut by a harvester. The system developed consists of a 3D virtual environment, which allows the user to input a desired position for the crane tip using either the mouse or a joystick. The desired position is then transmitted (via UDP/IP) to a local control system. The crane is a redundant manipulator, so movements of the individual links are calculated using a pseudoinverse method, and controlled using PIDs with friction compensation. Encoder data from the crane links are continuously sent back to the user side, and the crane's movement is visualized in the virtual environment. The system has been tested on a real forwarder crane, experimental results and a video of the system's performance are provided.
