We give the first on-line poly-logarithmic competitve algorithm for minimizing average flow time with preemption on related machines, i.e., when machines can have different speeds. This also yields the first poly-logarithmic polynomial time approximation algorithm for this problem.More specifically, we give an O(log2 P â€¢ log S)-competitive algorithm, where P is the ratio of the biggest and the smallest processing time of a job, and S is the ratio of the highest and the smallest speed of a machine. Our algorithm also has the nice property that it is non-migratory. The scheduling algorithm is based on the concept of making jobs wait for a long enough time before scheduling them on slow machines.
