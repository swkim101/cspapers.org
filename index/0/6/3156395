The robotics workshop consists of a tutorial and a discussion. The workshop objectives are to provide both the comprehensive fundamentals of robot technology and the WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, and HOW of its applications and limitations.
 Industrial robots are considered to be a principal tool to improve manufacturing productivity and product quality during the 80's and beyond. They are one of the key ingredients in revitalization of the manufacturing operations throughout the U.S. The fundamentals of the technology must be understood, the technical features evaluated and properly planned to achieve maximum productivity gains. The application of robots to new and more challenging tasks is increasing as robots are getting smarter with increased computer control and advances in the tactile and visual senses. During this decade the robot industry is projected to grow from a level of approximately $100 million to $2 billion. The robot technology is expected to impact all aspects of our business - management, engineering, manufacturing, finance, and educational needs.
