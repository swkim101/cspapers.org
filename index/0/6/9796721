Integration of goal-driven, top-down attention and image-driven, bottom-up attention is crucial for visual search. Yet, previous research has mostly focused on models that are purely top-down or bottom-up. Here, we propose a new model that combines both. The bottom-up component computes the visual salience of scene locations in different feature maps extracted at multiple spatial scales. The topdown component uses accumulated statistical knowledge of the visual features of the desired search target and background clutter, to optimally tune the bottom-up maps such that target detection speed is maximized. Testing on 750 artificial and natural scenes shows that the modelâ€™s predictions are consistent with a large body of available literature on human psychophysics of visual search. These results suggest that our model may provide good approximation of how humans combine bottom-up and top-down cues such as to optimize target detection speed.
