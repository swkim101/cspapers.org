Most previous research has focused on classifying single human activities contained in segmented videos. However, in real-world scenarios, human activities are inherently continuous and gradual transitions always exist between temporally adjacent activities. In this paper, we propose a Fuzzy Segmentation and Recognition (FuzzySR) algorithm to explicitly model this gradual transition. Our goal is to simultaneously segment a given video into events and recognize the activity contained in each event. Specifically, our algorithm uniformly partitions the video into a sequence of non-overlapping blocks, each of which lasts a short period of time. Then, a multi-variable time series is creatively formed through concatenating the block-level human activity summaries that are computed using topic models over each block's local spatio-temporal features. By representing an event as a fuzzy set that has fuzzy boundaries to model gradual transitions, our algorithm is able to segment the video into a sequence of fuzzy events. By incorporating all block summaries contained in an event, the proposed algorithm determines the most appropriate activity category for each event. We evaluate our algorithm's performance using two real-world benchmark datasets that are widely used in the machine vision community. We also demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in important robotics applications, such as intelligent service robotics. For all used datasets, our algorithm achieves promising continuous human activity segmentation and recognition results.
