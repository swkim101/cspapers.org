In this paper, we propose to use a continuous authentication approach to detect the in-situ identity fraud incidents, which occur when the attackers use the same devices and IP addresses as the victims. Using Facebook as a case study, we show that it is possible to detect such incidents by analyzing SNS users' browsing behavior. Our experiment results demonstrate that the approach can achieve reasonable accuracy given a few minutes of observation time.
