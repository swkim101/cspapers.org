The traditional functional formulation of quick-sort is simple and elegant. But is it fast? Through a dialog, we observe that this traditional formulation does not retain certain crucial properties of the imperative version. We include a known derivation of a higher performing functional implementation together with a graph that illustrates the differences. Our pet peeve is that the faster quick-sort is frequently left out of texts on functional programming.
