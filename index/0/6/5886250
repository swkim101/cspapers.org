Assessing the quality of user generated content is an important problem for many web forums. While quality is currently assessed manually, we propose an algorithm to assess the quality of forum posts automatically and test it on data provided by Nabble.com. We use state-of-the-art classification techniques and experiment with five feature classes: Surface, Lexical, Syntactic, Forum specific and Similarity features. We achieve an accuracy of 89% on the task of automatically assessing post quality in the software domain using forum specific features. Without forum specific features, we achieve an accuracy of 82%.
