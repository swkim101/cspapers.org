“Push Technology” stands for the ability to transfer information as a reaction to event occurrence. This demonstration proposal describes Amit, a middleware framework that resolves a major problem in this area: the gap that exists between events that are reported by various channels, and the actual cases in which the user needs to react to, hereby called; reactive situations. These situations are composition of events or other situations (for example, “when atleast four events of the same type occurred”) or content filtering on events (for example, “only events that relate to IBM stocks”) or both (“when atleast four purchases of more than 50,000 shares have been performed on IBM stocks in a single week”). This paper describes the generic application development tool, the middleware architecture and framework, and describes the demo.
