Packet retransmission is a fundamental TCP mechanism that ensures reliable data transfer between two end nodes. Interestingly, when it comes to cellular data accounting, TCP retransmissions create an important policy issue giving rise to a tension between ISPs accounting for network resource consumption, and users only being aware of the application layer data. Regardless of the policies, we find that TCP retransmissions can be easily abused to manipulate the current practice of cellular
