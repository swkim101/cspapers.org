However, the global feature might not effectively capture the relevance between the query object and reference images in the object instance search task, especially when the query object is relatively small and there exist multiple types of objects in reference images. Moreover, the object instance search requires to localize the object in the reference image, which may not be achieved through global representations. In this paper, we propose a Fuzzy Objects Matching (FOM) framework to effectively and efficiently capture the relevance between the query object and reference images in the dataset. In the proposed FOM scheme, object proposals are utilized to detect the potential regions of the query object in reference images. To achieve high search efficiency, we factorize the feature matrix of all the object proposals from one reference image into the product of a set of fuzzy objects and sparse codes. In addition, we refine the feature of the generated fuzzy objects according to its neighborhood in the feature space to generate more robust representation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FOM framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in precision with less memory and computational cost on three public datasets.
