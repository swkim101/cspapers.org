An agent communication protocol specifies the " rules of encounter " governing a dialogue between agents in a multiagent system. In non-cooperative interactions (such as negotiation dialogues) occurring in open societies it is crucial that agents are equipped with proper means to check, and possibly enforce, conformance to protocols. We identify different levels of conformance (weak, exhaustive, and robust conformance) and explore how a specific class of logic-based agents can exploit a new representation formalism for communication protocols based on simple if-then rules in order to either check conformance a priori or enforce it at runtime.
