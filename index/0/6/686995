In the past few years the information retrieval (IR) community has been exploring ways to move further away from the Cranfield style evaluation paradigm, and make evaluations more `realistic' (more centered on real users, their needs and behaviours). As part of this drive, living labs which involve and integrate users in the research process have been proposed. The Living Labs for Information Retrieval Evaluation workshop (LL'13) brings together for the first time people interested in progressing the living labs for IR evaluation methodology.
