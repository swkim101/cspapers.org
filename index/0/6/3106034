The first MEMS process integrating soft elastomers in a standard silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer without assembly has been demonstrated for use in microrobotic mechanisms. This process allows silicon and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) features to be defined in-plane with feature sizes down to 2 µm. Test structures have been used to characterize the Young's modulus of the resulting PDMS at 1.4 MPa along with adhesion to silicon structures. In addition, compliant flexures have been designed, fabricated and characterized for eventual use in microrobot legs. Test structures have been mechanically folded 180° out of plane over 60 times without failure.
