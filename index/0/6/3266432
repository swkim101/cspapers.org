This paper addresses the basic question of how well can a tree approximate distances of a metric space or a graph. Given a graph, the problem of constructing a spanning tree in a graph which strongly preserves distances in the graph is a fundamental problem in network design. We present scaling distortion embeddings where the distortion scales as a function of ε, with the guarantee that for each ε the distortion of a fraction 1 - ε of all pairs is bounded accordingly. Such a bound implies, in particular, that the <i>average distortion</i> and <i>l<inf>q</inf></i>-distortions are small. Specifically, our embeddings have <i>constant</i> average distortion and <i>O</i>(√log <i>n</i>) <i>l<inf>2</inf></i>-distortion. This follows from the following results: we prove that any metric space embeds into an ultrametric with scaling distortion <i>O</i>(√1/ε). For the graph setting we prove that any weighted graph contains a spanning tree with scaling distortion <i>O</i>(√1/ε). These bounds are tight even for embedding in arbitrary trees. For probabilistic embedding into spanning trees we prove a scaling distortion of <i>Õ</i>(log<sup>2</sup>(1/ε)), which implies <i>constant l<inf>q</inf></i>-distortion for every fixed <i>q</i> < ∞.
