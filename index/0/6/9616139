Several recent code generators [4,5,6,8] use dagrewriting rules to accomplish both code generation and peephole optimization, and they compile these rules into hard code to generate code quickly. The chop system [S], for example, runs twice as fast as both pee and the GNU C compiler gee on a Sun 3/50 system and generates comparable code. These figures are for entire compilers; the code generators themselves run about seven times faster than comparable code generators. This paper describes a new system, currently under development, that further increases the speed of automatically-generated retargetable code generation. It offers two principal advantages over its predecessors.
