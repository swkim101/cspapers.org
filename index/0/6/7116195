We describe a highly accurate but efficient fault simulator for interconnect opens, based on characterizing the standard cell library with SPICE; using transistor charge equations for the site of the open; using logic simulation for the rest of the circuit; taking four different factors, that can affect the voltage of an open, into account; and considering the oscillation and sequential behaviour potential of opens. A novel test technique based on controlling the die surface voltage is also described. We present simulation results of ISCAS85 layouts using stuck-at and IDDQ test sets.
