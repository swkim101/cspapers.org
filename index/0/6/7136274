Given a set <i>S</i> of <i>n</i> points in IR<sup><i>d</i></sup>, a (<i>t,</i> ε)-<i>approximate Voronoi diagram (AVD)</i> is a partition of space into constant complexity cells, where each cell <i>c</i> is associated with <i>t</i> representative points of <i>S,</i> such that for any point in <i>c,</i> one of the associated representatives approximates the nearest neighbor to within a factor of (1 + ε). The goal is to minimize the number and complexity of the cells in the AVD. We show that it is possible to construct an AVD consisting of <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>/ε<sup><i>d</i></sup>) cells for <i>t</i> = 1, and <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) cells for <i>t</i> = <i>O</i>(1/ε<sup>(<i>d</i>-1)/2</sup>). In general, for a real parameter 2 ≤ γ ≤ 1/ε, we show that it is possible to construct a (<i>t,</i> ε)-AVD consisting of <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>γ<sup><i>d</i></sup>) cells for <i>t</i> = <i>O</i>(1/(εγ)<sup>(<i>d</i>-1)/2</sup>). The cells in these AVDs are cubes or differences of two cubes. All these structures can be used to efficiently answer approximate nearest neighbor queries. Our algorithms are based on the well-separated pair decomposition and are very simple.
