Using a large dataset of Yelp's online reviews for local businesses, we investigate how Word-of-Mouth research can inform the design of local online review systems and how these systems' data can extend our understanding of digital WOM in a local context. In this paper, we analyze how visual cues currently present in Yelp map to WOM concepts. We also show that these concepts are highly related to the perceived usefulness of the local reviews, which is aligned with prior WOM literature. Additionally, we found that local expertise, measured at the level of the neighborhood, strongly correlates with the perceived usefulness of reviews. Our findings augment the understanding of local online WOM and have design implications for local review systems.
