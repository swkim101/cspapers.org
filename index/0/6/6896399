Design verification via simulation is an important component in the development of digital systems. However, with continuing increases in the capabilities of VLSI systems, the simulation task has become a significant bottleneck in the design process. As a result, researchers are attempting to exploit parallel processing techniques to improve the performance of VLSI logic simulation. This tutorial describes the current state-of-the-art in parallel logic simulation, including parallel simulation techniques, factors that impact simulation performance, performance results to date, and the directions currently being pursued by the research community.
