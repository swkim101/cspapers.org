This paper aims at developing a unified and adaptive foot placement control for legged robots. The locomotion control of legged robots can be classified into three parts as body height control, body attitude control, and forward velocity control. In our study, the body attitude is controlled at stance phase by the hip actuator, and the height is controlled by the motion of the stance leg. In this case, the foot placement has a nearly linear correlation with forward velocity. Hereby, a generic foot placement controller is developed to control the forward velocity based on the online linear regression analysis of their coupled correlation. Our proposed algorithm is capable of adjusting the control parameters automatically, and is featured by good adaptability and higher control accuracy that outperforms the empirical tuning. The very same controller is able to produce stable hopping with accurate forward velocity tracking even with unknown mass offset, as well as stable bipedal running and walking with accurate velocity tracking.
