We investigate whether it is possible to improve the performance of automated facial forensic sketch matching by learning from examples of facial forgetting over time. Forensic facial sketch recognition is a key capability for law enforcement, but remains an unsolved problem. It is extremely challenging because there are three distinct contributors to the domain gap between forensic sketches and photos: The well-studied sketch-photo modality gap, and the less studied gaps due to (i) the forgetting process of the eye-witness and (ii) their inability to elucidate their memory. In this paper, we address the memory problem head on by introducing a database of 400 forensic sketches created at different time-delays. Based on this database we build a model to reverse the forgetting process. Surprisingly, we show that it is possible to systematically "un-forget" facial details. Moreover, it is possible to apply this model to dramatically improve forensic sketch recognition in practice: we achieve the state of the art results when matching 195 benchmark forensic sketches against corresponding photos and a 10,030 mugshot database.
