The paper describes an analogy-based measure of word-sense proximity grounded on distributional evidence in typical contexts, and illustrates a computational system which makes use of this measure for purposes of lexical disambiguation. Experimental results show that wordsense analogy based on contexts of use compares favourably with classical word-sense similarity defined in terms of thesaural proximity.
