3D dynamic surface tracking is an important research problem and plays a vital role in many computer vision and medical imaging applications. However, it is still challenging to efficiently register surface sequences which has large deformations and strong noise. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic method for non-rigid 3D dynamic surface tracking with surface Ricci flow and Teichmiiller map methods. According to quasi-conformal Teichmiiller theory, the Techm√ºller map minimizes the maximal dilation so that our method is able to automatically register surfaces with large deformations. Besides, the adoption of Delaunay triangulation and quadrilateral meshes makes our method applicable to low quality meshes. In our work, the 3D dynamic surfaces are acquired by a high speed 3D scanner. We first identified sparse surface features using machine learning methods in the texture space. Then we assign landmark features with different curvature settings and the Riemannian metric of the surface is computed by the dynamic Ricci flow method, such that all the curvatures are concentrated on the feature points and the surface is flat everywhere else. The registration among frames is computed by the Teichmiiller mappings, which aligns the feature points with least angle distortions. We apply our new method to multiple sequences of 3D facial surfaces with large expression deformations and compare them with two other state-of-the-art tracking methods. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by the clearly improved accuracy and efficiency.
