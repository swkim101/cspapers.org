We have constructed a two axis camera positioning system which is roughly analogous to a single human eye. This Artificial-Eye (A-eye) combines the signals generated by two rate gyroscopes with motion information extracted from visual analysis to stabilize its camera. This stabilization process is similar to the vestibulo-ocular response (VOR); like the VOR, A-eye learns a system model that can be incrementally modified to adapt to changes in its structure, performance and environment. A-eye is an example of a robust sensory system that performs computations that can be of significant use to the designers of mobile robots.
