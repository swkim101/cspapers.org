In an increasingly computer-driven world, it is no surprise that undergraduate interest in computer science has grown enormously over the years. To meet this growing demand, it is vital to ensure there is a growing supply of talented and passionate CS educators. However, most computer science professors must first earn a PhD at a research university. Therefore, we seek to understand whether these institutions are meeting the growing need for passionate and highly-trained computer science educators. Specifically, we analyze 19 years of historical data gathered from the University of Washington Computer Science & Engineering department. Although focusing on graduates from a single school is a limitation, University of Washington is somewhat unique in that it publicly posts graduating PhD students' preferences online, and UW has had numerous notable graduates pursue careers in teaching, research, and industry. Our analysis of 309 graduating students reveals that the number of graduating students interested in teaching is alarmingly small, and has not grown over time to meet the increased need for quality educators. Our more detailed analysis of the change in interest over time suggests several potential reasons for this phenomenon. We hope that this poster opens dialogue surrounding possible interventions that might alleviate this issue.
