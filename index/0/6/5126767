We introduce our research approach to investigating real world intelligence by building 'Remote-Brained Robots'. The key idea is that of interfacing AI systems with real-world behaviors through wireless technology. In this approach the robot system is designed to have the brain and body separate, both conceptually and physically. It allows us to tie AI directly to the world, enabling the verification of high-level AI techniques which could previously only be used in simulation. For robotics research, this approach opens the way to the use of large-scale powerful parallel computers. For AI, this approach allows experiments with realistic agents, an essential step to the application of AI in the real world. In this presentation we introduce the remote-brained approach, describe some remote-brained robots and discuss experiments.
