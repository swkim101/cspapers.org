This paper presents motion planning algorithms for underactuated systems evolving on rigid rotation and displacement groups. Motion planning is transcribed into (low-dimensional) combinatorial selection and inverse-kinematics problems. We present a catalog of solutions for all underactuated systems on SE(2), SO(3) and SE(2) /spl times/ /spl Ropf/ classified according to their controllability properties.
