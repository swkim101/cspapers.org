THIS PAPER INTRODUCES SOFTWARE DESIGN LANGUAGE SDL-1, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO SERVE AS A DESIGN TOOL FOR THE SOFTWARE ENGINEER. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, SOME NOVEL LANGUAGE CONSTRUCTS HAVE BEEN CONCEIVED.
 A SDL-1 DESIGN SPECIFICATION IS A TOP-DOWN 3-LEVEL STRUCTURE. SPECIAL KEYWORDS (CALLED STRUCTURE, STORAGE, AND CONTROL KEYWORDS) ARE EMPLOYED AND PLACED TO CLEARLY INDICATE THE DESIGN STRUCTURE. THESE KEYWORDS ARE HIGHLY SUGGESTIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE TO THE NATURE OF DATA STRUCTURE AND CONTROL CONSTRUCTS. SDL-1 REQUIRES THE DECLARATION OF ALL PROCEDURE NAMES AND THE DESCRIPTION OF THEIR FUNCTIONS AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS. IT REQUIRES ALSO THE DECLARATION OF ALL DATA STORAGES AND ALL SWITCHES, IT DESCRIBES THE PROCEDURE STRUCTURE, THE DATA-STORAGE REFERENCE STRUCTURE, AND THE SWITCH STRUCTURE. ALL PROCEDURES ARE DEFINED WITH SINGLE-IN-SINGLE-OUT CONTROL CONSTRUCTS WITH ONE EXCEPTION. THE FIRST PROCEDURE IS THE MAIN PROCEDURE. NO PROCEDURE DEFINITION IS PERMITTED WITHIN A PROCEDURE DEFINITION. THE WRITING STYLE AND DESIGN PRACTICE ARE ALSO A NECESSARY PART IN USING THE LANGUAGE FOR A SOFTWARE DESIGN.
 IN SHORT, A SDL DESIGN SPECIFICATION IS A STRUCTURED DESIGN WHOSE DATA STORAGE IS DESCRIPTIVE AND DIRECT, WHOSE PROCEDURE STRUCTURE DESCRIBES THE PROCEDURE CALLING AND RETURNING RELATIONSHIP, WHOSE SWITCH STRUCTURE AND REFERENCE STRUCTURE INDICATE THE INTER-PROCEDURE COMMUNICATION, AND WHOSE CONTROL FLOW IN A PROCEDURE IS STRUCTURED AND READILY OBSERVABLE.
