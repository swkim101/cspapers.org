Many languages use honoriﬁcs to express politeness, social distance, or the relative social status between the speaker and their ad-dressee(s). In machine translation from a language without honoriﬁcs such as English, it is difﬁcult to predict the appropriate honoriﬁc, but users may want to control the level of politeness in the output. In this paper, we perform a pilot study to control honoriﬁcs in neural machine translation (NMT) via side constraints , focusing on English → German. We show that by marking up the (English) source side of the training data with a feature that en-codes the use of honoriﬁcs on the (German) target side, we can control the honoriﬁcs produced at test time. Experiments show that the choice of honoriﬁcs has a big impact on translation quality as measured by B LEU , and oracle experiments show that substantial im-provements are possible by constraining the translation to the desired level of politeness.
