A system to manage human interaction in immersive environments was designed and implemented. The interaction is de(cid:12)ned by an interval script which describes the relationships be-tween the time intervals which command actuators or gather information from sensors. With this formalism, reactive, linear, and tree-like interaction can be equally described, as well as less regular story and interaction patterns. Control of actuators and sensors is accomplished using PNF-restriction, a calculus which propagates the sensed information through the interval script, determining which intervals are or should be happening at each moment. The prototype was used in an immersive, story-based interactive environment called SingSong, where a user or a per-former tries to conduct four computer character singers, in spite of the hostility of one of them.
