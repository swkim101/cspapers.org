The 位&sgr;-calculus is a refinement of the 位-calculus where substitutions are manipulated explicitly. The 位&sgr;-calculus provides a setting for studying the theory of substitutions, with pleasant mathematical properties. It is also a useful bridge between the classical 位-calculus and concrete implementations.
