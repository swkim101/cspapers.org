This paper considers the problem of joint encryption and error-correction coding and proposes a solution using D-sequences, which are Å“decimal' expansions of fractions. The encryption operation considered is equivalent to exponentiation which forms the basis of several public-key schemes. Several new results on D-sequences are also presented which make the applications to encryption and error coding possible.
