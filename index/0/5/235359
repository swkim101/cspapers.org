Each year many ACM SIG communities will recognize an outstanding researcher through an award in honor of his or her profound impact and numerous research contributions. This work is the first to investigate an automated mechanism to help in selecting future award winners. We approach the problem as a researchers' expertise ranking problem, and propose a temporal probabilistic ranking model which combines content with citation network analysis. Experimental results based on real-world citation data and historical awardees indicate that some kinds of SIG awards are well-modeled by this approach.
