A distributed real-time control system is modeled by automatically generating a virtual execution platform and integrating it with an abstract run-time model. This allows us to capture the dynamic effects of non-deterministic behavior of the underlying hardware and real-time operating system (RTOS), which cannot be accurately evaluated by existing static approaches. Our framework has been implemented and integrated with the existing AIRES toolkit. The construction of a virtual execution platform for a control application is observed to take 422ms. The integrated platform and control application consists of 56 software components connected by 1280 links for data exchanges and precedence relations, and the constructed platform executes the application at a normalized speed-defined as the ratio of simulation time to real time -10.6. Our preliminary evaluation has demonstrated the virtual execution platform's capability of providing accurate run-time information at a reasonable time-cost.
