The aim of this study is to investigate whether element retrieval (as opposed to full-text retrieval) is meaningful and useful for searchers when carrying out information-seeking tasks. Our results suggest that searchers find the structural breakdown of documents useful when browsing within retrieved documents, and provide support for the usefulness of element retrieval in interactive settings.
