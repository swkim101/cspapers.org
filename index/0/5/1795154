In this paper we consider an alternative, highly agile In this paper we consider an alternative, highly agile approach called backpressure routing for Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN), in which routing and forwarding decisions are made on a per-packet basis. Using information about queue backlogs, random walk and data packet scheduling nodes can make packet routing and forwarding decisions without the notion of end-to-end routes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever implementation of dynamic backpressure routing in DTNs. Simulation results show that the proposed approach has advantages in terms of DTN networks.
