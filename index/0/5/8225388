NASA has some of the largest and most complex data sources in the world, with data sources ranging from the earth sciences, space sciences, and massive distributed engineering data sets from commercial aircraft and spacecraft. This talk will discuss some of the issues and algorithms developed to analyze and discover patterns in these data sets. We will also provide an overview of a large research program in Integrated Vehicle Health Management. The goal of this program is to develop advanced technologies to automatically detect, diagnose, predict, and mitigate adverse events during the flight of an aircraft. A case study will be presented on a recent data mining analysis performed to support the Flight Readiness Review of the Space Shuttle Mission STS-119.
