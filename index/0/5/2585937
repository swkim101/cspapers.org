It is not uncommon for complex systems (like multi-component online services) to perform worse than expected. Configuration errors, buggy code, and tricky middleware/OS behavior induce performance anomalies under certain workloads and system configurations. It is challenging to pinpoint root causes of such performance problems in complex systems. Currently, performance problems are solved by system administrators who intimately understand the system and are willing to forgo a personal life.
