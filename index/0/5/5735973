We investigate a simple method of fraud management for secure devices that may serve as an alternative or complement to conventional hardware-based tamper resistance. Under normal operating conditions in our scheme, a secure device includes an authentication code in its communications, e.g., in the digital signatures it issues. This code may be verified by a fraud management center under a pre-determined key σ. When the device detects an attempted break-in, it modifies σ. This results in a change to the authentication codes issued by the device such that the fraud management center can detect the apparent break-in. Hence, in contrast to the case with typical tamper-resistance schemes, the deployer of our proposed scheme seeks to trace break-ins, rather than prevent them. In reference to the wartime practice of physically capturing and subverting underground radio transmitters – a practice analogous to the capture and use of secret information on secure devices – we denote this idea by the German term funkspiel, meaning “radio game.” One challenge in constructing a funkspiel scheme is to ensure that an attacker privy to the authentication codes of the secure device both before and after the break-in, as well as the secrets of the device following the break-in, cannot detect the alteration to σ.
