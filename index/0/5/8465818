We revisit the algorithm of Schutze (1995) for unsupervised part-of-speech tagging. The algorithm uses reduced-rank singular value decomposition followed by clustering to extract latent features from context distributions. As implemented here, it achieves state-of-the-art tagging accuracy at considerably less cost than more recent methods. It can also produce a range of finer-grained taggings, with potential applications to various tasks.
