Tree Adjoining Grammars have well-known advantages, but are typically considered too difficult for practical systems. We demonstrate that, when done right, adjoining improves translation quality without becoming computationally intractable. Using adjoining to model optionality allows general translation patterns to be learned without the clutter of endless variations of optional material. The appropriate modifiers can later be spliced in as needed. 
 
In this paper, we describe a novel method for learning a type of Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammar and associated probabilities from aligned tree/string training data. We introduce a method of converting these grammars to a weakly equivalent tree transducer for decoding. Finally, we show that adjoining results in an end-to-end improvement of +0.8 Bleu over a baseline statistical syntax-based MT model on a large-scale Arabic/English MT task.
