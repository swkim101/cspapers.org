We present a new technique for question answering called Predictive Annotation. Predictive Annotation identifies potential answers to questions in text, annotates them accordingly and indexes them. This technique, along with a complementary analysis of questions, passage-level ranking and answer selection, produces a system effective at answering natural-language fact-seeking questions posed against large document collections. Experimental results show the effects of different parameter settings and lead to a number of general observations about the question-answering problem.
