We introduce the ideas of developing a distributed event-based system for screening and monitoring the activities that can lead to the production of hazardous chemicals such as explosive materials and narcotic drugs. This system is built on top of the state-of-the-art content-based publish/subscribe messaging substrate that processes complex chemical events in a robust and scalable way. This system also leverages the chemical information encoded in semantic chemistry networks to identify any undesirable chemical reactions.
