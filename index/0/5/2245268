This session will discuss the emerging AccessGrid collaboration and visualization infrastructure that is emerging as part of a national HPC initiative in Canada. With the release of the Long Range Plan for High Performance Computing in Canada (www.c3.ca) and the establishment of the CFI National Platforms Fund (www.innovation.ca/programs/index.cfm?websiteid=431) the Canadian HPC community is being afforded the opportunity to directly determine the HPC funding priorities for Canada. This exciting initiative, if funded, will provide a cohesive HPC infrastructure for Canadian researchers.As part of the national HPC initiative an effort to establish an advanced collaboration capability across Canadian universities has been undertaken. Partially based on experiences gained in deploying AccessGrid within the WestGrid HPC consortium in Western Canada, this talk will discuss the approach taken in WestGrid and how the Canadian HPC initiative is looking at scaling this up to a national infrastructure.
