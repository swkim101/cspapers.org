We study Boyer-Moore-type string searching algorithms. First, we analyze the Horspoolâ€™s variant. The searching time is linear. An exact expression of the linearity constant is derived and is proven to be asymptotically 4, where c is the cardinality of the alphabet. We exhibit a stationary process and reduce the problem to a word enumeration. The same technique applies to other variants of the Boyer-Moore algorithm. We also study Boyer-Moore automata, a notion that we formalize. This approach appears to be faster than any other known algorithm, in both, the worst and average case number of inspections. A lower bound in the maxim.4 number of states of these automata is presented, and the concept of potential of a transition is introduced to improve the worst and average case behaviour of these machines. We show that looking at the rightmost unknown character, as suggested by Knuth et al, is not necessarily optimal.
