This software demonstration presents WebLicht (short for: Web-Based Linguistic Chaining Tool), a web-based service environment for the integration and use of language resources and tools (LRT). WebLicht is being developed as part of the D-SPIN project. We-bLicht is implemented as a web application so that there is no need for users to install any software on their own computers or to concern themselves with the technical details involved in building tool chains. The integrated web services are part of a prototypical infrastructure that was developed to facilitate chaining of LRT services. WebLicht allows the integration and use of distributed web services with standardized APIs. The nature of these open and standardized APIs makes it possible to access the web services from nearly any programming language, shell script or workflow engine (UIMA, Gate etc.) Additionally, an application for integration of additional services is available, allowing anyone to contribute his own web service.
