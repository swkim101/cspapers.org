In this paper, the authors design a sensor network architecture for soil and weather data collection and database generation. A multi-sensor device containing sensors for extracting soil characteristics operates as the first component of this architecture. It connects to a mobile phone which further connects to a base server system. An XML file containing location and time specific data travels through the network with soil information. At the base server, the system fetches weather information based on location parameters and a database is created where XML files provide values for every entry. The authors describe few potential applications of this architecture and express how this database can grow more with continuous participation.
