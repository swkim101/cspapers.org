Fuzzy logic control is a relatively new technology and hence it needs rigorous comparative analyses with other well-established conventional control schemes. Furthermore, fuzzy controller stability analysis is a major hindrance for its popularity among control engineers. This paper shows how stable fuzzy controllers may be synthesized for a typical AGV from the perspective of variable structure systems (VSS) theory. VSS or sliding model control (SMC) is an established robust nonlinear control methodology. The AGV is characterized by highly nonlinear, coupled and configuration dependent dynamics, with uncertainty in model parameters. Similarity in performance of the fuzzy controllers to the SMC controller is demonstrated through experimental results obtained for steering control of the AGV.
