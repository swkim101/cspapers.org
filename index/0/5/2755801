We improve the quality of paraphrases extracted from parallel corpora by requiring that phrases and their paraphrases be the same syntactic type. This is achieved by parsing the English side of a parallel corpus and altering the phrase extraction algorithm to extract phrase labels alongside bilingual phrase pairs. In order to retain broad coverage of non-constituent phrases, complex syntactic labels are introduced. A manual evaluation indicates a 19% absolute improvement in paraphrase quality over the baseline method.
