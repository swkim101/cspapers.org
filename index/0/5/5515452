The broad features of the semantics of deterministic simple imperative languages are well-understood. This understanding was the basis for the work on the semantics of ALGOL-like languages described in [4], [S], and [6]. In those places, there was a presentation of a way to embed the ideas behind the semantics of deterministic simple imperative languages in a framework supporting a stack discipline, implicit conversions between types, and higher-order procedures of arbitrarily complex types. What we would like to do is to add nondeterminacy and concurrency to ALGOL-like languages in a way that extends this earlier work. In this paper, we lay the necessary groundwork for that anticipated extension by constructing a set of meanings for commands involving concurrency, by giving this set an algebraic structure, and by characterizing this algebraic structure as the w structure compatible with the natural operational semantics for command meanings.
