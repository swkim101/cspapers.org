Context-enabled applications are just emerging and promisericher interaction by taking environmental context into account.However, they are difficult to build due to their distributednature and the use of unconventional sensors. The concepts oftoolkits and widget libraries in graphical user interfaces has beentremendously successtil, allowing programmers to leverage offexisting building blocks to build interactive systems more easily.We introduce the concept of context widgets that mediate betweenthe environment and the application in the same way graphicalwidgets mediate between the user and the application. We illustratethe concept of context widgets with the beginnings of a widgetlibrary we have developed for sensing presence, identity andactivity of people and things. We assess the success of ourapproach with two example context-enabled applications we havebuilt and an existing application to which we have addedcontext-sensing capabilities.
