Language generation from purely semantic representations is a challenging task. This paper addresses generating English from the Ab-stract Meaning Representation (AMR), consisting of re-entrant graphs whose nodes are concepts and edges are relations. The new method is trained statistically from AMR-annotated English and consists of two major steps: (i) generating an appropriate spanning tree for the AMR, and (ii) applying tree-to-string transducers to generate English. The method relies on discriminative learning and an argument realization model to overcome data sparsity. Initial tests on held-out data show good promise despite the complexity of the task.
