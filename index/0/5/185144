In this work, we consider the problem of routing in hypercycles which are a class of multidimensional graphs that are generalizations of hypercubes. Hypercycles are products of circulant graphs with simple routing, incremental expandability, and range in complexity from simple rings to fully connected graphs. We present a novel framework and design methodology for a controller through a simple hardware design language called CoDeL (Controller Description Language). The functionality of the controller can be described by manipulating primitives and the design can be synthesized from VHDL. Using FPGA as the medium of implementation, the controller can be reprogrammed for a gamut of routing policies as the application demands.
