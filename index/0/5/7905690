Many resource sensitive applications such as multimedia processing [1] and data-intensive computing [2] utilise data streams to pass information between sub-systems, components, processes and machines. The stream based programming model constrains applications to operate with smaller individual data blocks in a continuous manner. This reduces data storage and transport requirements, which in general leads to a more economical use of network and system resources. The creation of an application framework is highly desirable for the development of stream based applications. Application frameworks [3] can significantly ease development effort by providing proven architectures and well-engineered reusable components.
