In this paper we describe our experiences of exporting our introductory programming courses to community colleges. We used Tutored Video Instruction (TVI) as the mode of instruction where recorded versions of our lectures were shown to groups of students with local instructors periodically stopping the lecture for questions and discussion. We have offered a total of 16 sections of TVI courses, 11 were of our first quarter programming course (CSE142), and 5 were of our second quarter programming course (CSE 143). The courses were offered at seven institutions. Approximately 180 students completed the courses.We identify factors which contributed positively and negatively to the use of TVI for introductory programming courses. The two most important changes to our TVI program based on these experiences will the use of studio produced lectures and the abandonment of centralized course administration.
