We introduce an approach that leverages surface normal predictions, along with appearance cues, to retrieve 3D models for objects depicted in 2D still images from a large CAD object library. Critical to the success of our approach is the ability to recover accurate surface normals for objects in the depicted scene. We introduce a skip-network model built on the pre-trained Oxford VGG convolutional neural network (CNN) for surface normal prediction. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the NYUv2 RGB-D dataset for surface normal prediction, and recovers fine object detail compared to previous methods. Furthermore, we develop a two-stream network over the input image and predicted surface normals that jointly learns pose and style for CAD model retrieval. When using the predicted surface normals, our two-stream network matches prior work using surface normals computed from RGB-D images on the task of pose prediction, and achieves state of the art when using RGB-D input. Finally, our two-stream network allows us to retrieve CAD models that better match the style and pose of a depicted object compared with baseline approaches.
