We present the concepts, usage, and prototypic implementation of a new kind of visual debugging tool based on symbolic execution of Java source code called visual symbolic state debugger. It allows to start debugging of source code at any code location without the need to write a fixture as well as to visualize all possible symbolic execution paths and all symbolic states up to a finite depth. A code-based test generation facility is integrated.
