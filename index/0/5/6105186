Object relationships in modem software systems are becoming increasingly numerous and complex. Programmers who try to find violations of such relationships need new tools that allow them to explore objects in a large system more efficiently. Many existing debuggers present only a low-level, one-object-at-a-time view of objects and their relationships. We propose a new solution to overcome these problems: query-based debugging. The implementation of the query-based debugger described here offers programmers an effective query tool that allows efficient searching of large object spaces and quick verification of complex relationships. Even for programs that have large numbers of objects, the debugger achieves interactive response times for common queries by using a combination of fast searching primitives, query optimization, and incremental result delivery.
