With simple architecture and faster speed, linear feedback shift register often is selected to produce random number in many applications. However, the random number generated by LFSR cannot meet the demand of unpredictability for secure mechanism. The nonlinearity of Genetic algorithm can be used to improve the property of LFSR. We present a novel random number generator by using genetic algorithm to evolve LFSR. This random number generator is convenient for hardware implementation and has longer period and complex architecture. The property of random number generated by it can pass NIST randomness tests and meet the requirement of communication security by test.
