The wearable devices are small and easy to carry but typically with poor interaction experience. For example, Apple iWatch does not support instant text message input feature because of the lack of keyboard availability on the tiny touch screen. To address this problem, we develop a novel system, termed iKey, which enables users to use the back of one of their hands as virtual keyboard for wearable wristbands. iKey recognizes keystrokes based on a location-based training model via body vibration. We will demonstrate a real time functional prototype of iKey in this demo.
