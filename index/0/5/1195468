concept,; that do not contain properly a non-empty abstract concept are called atorrfic. We denote the atomic concepts by a t .. . . . et N where N _< 2 n. Every atomic concept ccj is identica~ to an intersection X l n . . . n X n where X i is either A i c,r i:s complement ~ A i. In the concept algebra every atomic ~:oncept Gtj is weighted by a real number .~j giving a vector x ,'x i ..... xN). The addition and multiplication defined by x + y = (xl+Y 1 .... . xN+YN) x * y = (xl*y 1 .. . . . xN*YN) are operations to extend and restrict weighted concepts. They are similar to the operations for joining and intersecting sets. Of course the scalar multiplication wx = (wx 1 .. . . . WXN) is used to weigh a vector. The inner product is defined by Ix,y] = ~ j : I , N xjl-t(aj)Yj where I.t(0tj) is the size of the atomic concept 0~j. We shall assume that all atomic concepts have the size t.t((xj) = 1 as it might be difficult to find appropriate values. Finally the relevance or retrieval status value of an information item indexed by the vector x is given by the cosine measure RSVq(x) = [x,q] / ([x,x]*[q,q]) 0.5 where q is the query vector. If all concepts are pairwise disjoint the terms are independent and we obtain the standard vector space model because n = N. Having a concept space, the linear function which maps the standard vector space (dimension = n) into the concept space (dimension = N) is given by the matrix Z where Zij is equal to 1 if ~i is in Aj and 0 if cq is outside of Aj. Obviously the concept algebra is closely related to the vector space model although it is based on a set-theoretic approach. As we will see below a slight difference consists of the possibility of assigning weights to Boolean expressions of terms; in vector space retrieval only simple terms can be weighted. Example:
