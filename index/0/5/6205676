In primary care medcine, clinical information is collected during patient interviews by skilled medical personnel. A Patient Data Acquisition System (PDAS) has been developed to embody interview expertise for primary care medicine. The PDAS, which produces a printed report conveying the patientâ€™s perception of the symptoms and problem, has three basic components: (a) an opening interview with the patient, (b) an inferencing system that analyzes natural language statements of the problem and symptoms to determine which physicaI systems (e.g., carthac) should be reviewed, and (c) detailed reviews of the physicaf systems. These physical systems are investigated in detail to provide the physician with information to confirm or rule out possible diagnoses. The PDAS is an expert informationgathering tool the physician retains responsibility for irtterpreting and using this information. Field experiences have shown medicaf information gathered with the PDAS to be both relevant and sufficient to support a diagnosis.
