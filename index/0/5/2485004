Multiple-interval graphs are a natural generalization of interval graphs where each vertex may have more then one interval associated with it. We initiate the study of optimization problems in multiple-interval graphs by considering three classical problems: MINIMUM VERTEX COVER, MINIMUM DOMINATING SET, and MAXIMUM CLIQUE. We describe applications for each one of these problems, and then proceed to discuss approximation algorithms for them. Our results can be summarized as follows: Let t be the number of intervals associated with each vertex in a given multiple-interval graph. For MINIMUM VERTEX COVER, we give a (2--1/t)-approximation algorithm which equals the best known ratio for 2t--1 bounded degree graphs. Since these graphs are known to be included in multiple-interval graphs with t intervals associated to each vertex, this ratio is in some sense tight. Following this, we give a t2-approximation algorithm for MINIMUM DOMINATING SET which adapts well to more general variants of the problem. We then proceed to prove that MAXIMUM CLIQUE is NP-complete for the case of t = 3, and provide a (t2--t+1)/2-approximation algorithm for the problem, using recent bounds proven for the so-called transversal number of t-interval families.
