There is an imbalance in the supply and demand for computing professionals that has generated shortages in meeting personnel needs within industry. A major program was developed by the U.S. National Science Foundation to encourage innovations in undergraduate computing education. There are a variety of new projects that are revitalizing undergraduate computing education. One approach to such revitalization is the introduction of interdisciplinary courses to expand the scope of computing education. The basic idea is to have students from various disciplines work together on computing projects to expand their educational horizons and make computing courses more appealing. This panel brings together research managers with educators who have developed and taught interdisciplinary courses with these goals in mind. The panelists will share their experiences and solicit new ideas from the audience.
