Many applications work with graph-structured data. As graphs grow in size, indexing becomes essential to ensure sufficient query performance. We present the GRIPP index structure (GRaph Indexing based on Pre- and Postorder numbering) for answering reachability queries in graphs.
 GRIPP requires only linear time and space. Using GRIPP, we can answer reachability queries on graphs with 5 million nodes on average in less than 5 milliseconds, which is unrivaled by previous methods. We evaluate the performance and scalability of our approach on real and synthetic random and scale-free graphs and compare our approach to existing indexing schemes. GRIPP is implemented as stored procedure inside a relational database management system and can therefore very easily be integrated into existing graph-oriented applications.
