This talk is about recent work on new ways to exploit preprocessed views of data tables for tractably solving big statistical queries. We'll describe deployments of these new algorithms in the realms of detecting killer asteroids and unnatural disease outbreaks.In recent years, several groups have looked at methods for pre-storing general sufficient statistics of the data in spatial data structures such as kd-trees and ball-trees so that both frequentist and Bayesian statistical operations become fast for large datasets. In this talk we will look at two other classes of optimization required in important statistical queries.The first involves iterating over all spatial regions (big and small). The second involves detection of tracks from noisy intermittent observations separated far apart in time and space. We will also discuss the implications that have arisen from making these operations tractable. We will focus particularly onDetecting all asteroids in the solar system larger than Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning (data to be collected over 2006-2010).
