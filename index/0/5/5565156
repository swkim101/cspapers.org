At Eurocrypt 2005, Sahai and Waters [7] introduced the concept of attribute-based encryption (ABE). ABE enables public key based one-to-many encryption and is envisioned as a promising cryptographic primitive for realizing scalable and fine-grained access control systems. There are two kinds of ABE schemes [1], key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) and ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) schemes. This paper, our concern is on the latter.
