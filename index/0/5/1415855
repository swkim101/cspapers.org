We present the first universal compact routing algorithm with maximum stretch bounded by 3 that uses sublinear space at every vertex. The algorithm uses local routing tables of size O(n2/3log4/3n) and achieves paths that are most 3 times the length of the shortest path distances for all nodes in an arbitrary weighted undirected network. This answers an open question of Gavoille and Gengler who showed that any universal compact routing algorithm with maximum stretch strictly less than 3 must use ?(n) local space at some vertex.
