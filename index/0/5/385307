Spatial data mining, i.e., discovery of interesting characteristics and patterns that may implicitly exist in spatial databases, is a challenging task due to the huge amounts of spatial data and to the new conceptual nature of the problems which must account for spatial distance. Clustering and region oriented queries are common problems in this domain. Several approaches have been presented in recent years, all of which require at least one scan of all individual objects (points). Consequently, the computational complexity is at least linearly proportional to the number of objects to answer each query. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical statistical information grid based approach for spatial data mining to reduce the cost further. The idea is to capture statistical information associated with spatial cells in such a manner that whole classes of queries and clustering problems can be answered without recourse to the individual objects. In theory, and confirmed by empirical studies, this approach outperforms the best previous method by at least an order of magnitude, especially when the data set is very large.
