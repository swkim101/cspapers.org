Automatic accent inserÂ·tion (AAI) is the problem of re-inserting accents (diacritics) into a text where they are missing. Unaccented French texts are still quite common in electronic media, as a result of a long his tory of character encoding problems and the lack of well-established conventions for typing accented char acters on computer keyboards. We present an AAI method for French, based on a stochastic language model. This method was implemented into a program and G library of functions, which are now commer cially available. Our experiments show that French text processed with this program contains less than one accent error per 130 words. We also show how our AAI method can be nsed to do on-the-fly accent in sertions within a word-processing environment, which makes it possible to write in French without having to type accents. A prototype of such a_ s'ystem was integrated into the Emacs editor, and iS now avail able to all students and employees of t}1e Universite de Montreal's computer science department.
