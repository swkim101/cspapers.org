We propose an affine extension to ADDs (AADD) capable of compactly representing context-specific, additive, and multiplicative structure. We show that the AADD has worst-case time and space performance within a multiplicative constant of that of ADDs, but that it can be linear in the number of variables in cases where ADDs are exponential in the number of variables. We provide an empirical comparison of tabular, ADD, and AADD representations used in standard Bayes net and MDP inference algorithms and conclude that the AADD performs at least as well as the other two representations, and often yields an exponential performance improvement over both when additive or multiplicative structure can be exploited. These results suggest that the AADD is likely to yield exponential time and space improvements for a variety of probabilistic inference algorithms that currently use tables or ADDs.
