Detecting conflicting statements is a foundational text understanding task with applications in information analysis. We propose an appropriate definition of contradiction for NLP tasks and develop available corpora, from which we construct a typology of contradictions. We demonstrate that a system for contradiction needs to make more fine-grained distinctions than the common systems for entailment. In particular, we argue for the centrality of event coreference and therefore incorporate such a component based on topicality. We present the first detailed breakdown of performance on this task. Detecting some types of contradiction requires deeper inferential paths than our system is capable of, but we achieve good performance on types arising from negation and antonymy.
