Let M be an arbitrary <i>n</i> by <i>n</i> matrix. We study the conditionnumber a random perturbation M+N<sub>n</sub> of M, where N<sub>n</sub> is arandom matrix. It is shown that, under very general conditions on M and M<sub>n</sub>, the condition number of M+N<sub>n</sub> is polynomial in <i>n</i>with very high probability. The main novelty here is that we allow N<sub>n</sub> to have discrete distribution.
