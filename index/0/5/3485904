The intersection between Science, Technology and the Arts is providing an insightful and rich playground for engaging historically underrepresented and underserved youth. This paper discusses an innovative and effective approach for learning Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) with an emphasis on using expressive arts as a culturally-centered engagement tool. Our framework incorporates a multimodal model that considers unconventional learning styles that appeal to underrepresented and underserved students, the power of cultural cues and the presence of minority STEM professionals to shape students learning experiences. In addition to demonstrating the importance of culturally-centered learning approaches, we've identified methods of engaging students' families and communities as a means of strengthening the pipeline to continued education in STEM.
