Much of the work in implementing a state machine involves tedious calculations that require no creativity. This report describes the development of a digital-circuit synthesis program that helps reduce the tedium. SMS accepts a high-level description of a state machine and returns equations for implementation that assume a sum-of-products next-state and output functions and that also assume JK or D flip-flops for memory.
