We present in this paper the security features of Think, an object-oriented architecture dedicated to build customized operating system kernels. The Think architecture is composed of an object-oriented software framework including a trader, and a library of system abstractions programmed as components. We show how to use this architecture to build secure and eï¬ƒcient kernels for embedded systems. Policy- neutral security is achieved by providing elementary tools that can be used by the system programmer to build a system resistant to denial of service attacks and incorporating data access control. An example of such a secure system is given by detailing how to ensure component isolation with a elementary software-based memory isolation tool.
