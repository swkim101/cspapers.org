Mapping and translating data across different representations is a crucial problem in information systems. Many formalisms and tools are currently used for this purpose, to the point that developers typically face a difficult question: "what is the right tool for my translation task?" In this paper, we introduce several techniques that contribute to answer this question. Among these, a fairly general definition of a data transformation system, a new and very efficient similarity measure to evaluate the outputs produced by such a system, and a metric to estimate user efforts. Based on these techniques, we are able to compare a wide range of systems on many translation tasks, to gain interesting insights about their effectiveness, and, ultimately, about their "intelligence".
