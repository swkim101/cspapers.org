Brazil has one of the lowest post-secondary enrollment rates in Latin America (currently around 12% of the 18â€“25 age cohort), but in recent decades has experienced a wide expansion of its post-secondary system. Although participation in secondary education initially increased during the 1970s and 1980s, participation rates have stopped growing and remained stagnant at around half of the traditionally aged population after the 1990s. Because secondary school participation has remained the same, and at the same time, the college participation rates have increased, we might expect to see an increased number of secondary graduates attending postsecondary schools. This expectation assumes that those who are graduating from high school are the ones going to college. However, this might not be the case. Instead, it may be older adults who are returning to school to further their education. This type of educational expansion would not significantly reduce class gaps among those in the same age cohort. If true, then policy makers would need to focus their attention at lower levels of education. In this paper, I investigate changes in opportunity of access to higher education for the Brazilian population between 1982 and 2006 to determine the extent to which post-secondary expansion reduces within-cohort gaps. Unlike prior studies that use only one round of data to create cohort differences, I take advantage of twenty-two rounds of data from a nationally representative household survey to create my cohorts, which allows me to estimate age and period effects. I present bivariate and multivariate analyses of the changing impact of age, and family material and cultural resources on the odds of attending post-secondary education in Brazil. The results from the analyses suggest that the increase in post-secondary openings benefited older adults more than secondary school graduates. Some policy implications from these results are further discussed.
