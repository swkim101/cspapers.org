We study the interactive channel capacity of an ε-noisy channel. The interactive channel capacity C(ε) is defined as the minimal ratio between the communication complexity of a problem (over a non-noisy channel), and the communication complexity of the same problem over the binary symmetric channel with noise rate ε, where the communication complexity tends to infinity.
 Our main result is the upper bound C(ε) ≤ 1-Ω(√H(ε)). This compares with Shannon's non-interactive channel capacity of 1-H(ε). In particular, for a small enough ε, our result gives the first separation between interactive and non-interactive channel capacity, answering an open problem by Schulman [Schulman1].
 We complement this result by the lower bound C(ε) ≥ 1-O(√H(ε)), proved for the case where the players take alternating turns.
