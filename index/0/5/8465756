This paper introduces an energy-aware topology management scheme which aims to reduce energy consumption by switching off as many underutilised base stations as possible in beyond next generation temporary event mobile broadband networks. The scheme aims to neutralise the effect of uneven traffic distribution scenarios during a temporary event occurrences. It is shown that the scheme successfully tunes the ON/OFF state of the base stations depending on traffic demands. In addition, the scheme reduces the effect of having a hotspot in terms of energy consumption when using other proposed green topology management schemes, saving around 20% more of energy on average for medium and high offered traffic (>200 Erlangs) without prejudicing the system QoS.
