Building a compiler for a domain specific language (a language designed for a specific problem domain) can engage students more than traditional compiler course projects. Most students feel that compiler courses are irrelevant because they are not likely to get a job writing compilers[2]. However, the technologies used to construct a compiler are widely applicable [2,5]. Using a domain specific language demonstrates to students the wide applicability of compiler construction techniques. This paper presents the results of using a domain specific language in an upper division compiler course.
