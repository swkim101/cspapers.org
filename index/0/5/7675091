In this paper, we tackle the challenge of rapidly disseminating rare events through a multi-hop network, while achieving unprecedented energy-efficiency. Contrary to state-of-the-art approaches, we circumvent the undesirable trade-offs associated with low-power duty-cycled protocols and backscatter technologies, and demonstrate a paradigm shift in low-power protocol design. We present Zippy, an on-demand flooding technique that provides robust asynchronous network wake-up, fine-grained per-hop synchronization and efficient data dissemination by leveraging low-complexity transmitter and receiver hardware. We are the first to demonstrate the on-demand flooding of rare events through a multi-hop network with end-to-end latencies of tens of milliseconds, while dissipating less than 10 microwatts during periods of inactivity. We present a prototype implementation of our proposed approach using a wireless sensor platform constructed from commercially available components. We extensively evaluate Zippy's performance in a laboratory setting and in an indoor testbed.
