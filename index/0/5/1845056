In this paper, we present a resource-constrained global scheduling technique for synthesis applications. The algorithm accepts specifications containing conditional branches and while loops and schedules them for a given set of resources. The algorithm performs several types of code motions across different basic blocks and trades off cost with performance. Several real-life examples are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.
