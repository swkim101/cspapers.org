In this paper a robust PID controller for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles is proposed that uses the parameter space approach. Stability and robustness analyses are carried out in the controller parameter space to determine a set of stable controller gains that guarantee also robustness against system parameter uncertainties. Additionally, the trade-off between robustness and performance is included in the control gain choice. Experimental results validate the proposed approach, where the robust behavior of a quadrotor is shown for step response and path following.
