Concise is a Forwarding information base (FIB) design that uses very little memory to support fast query of a large number of dynamic network names or flow IDs. Concise makes use of minimal perfect hashing and the SDN framework to design and implement the data structure, protocols, and system. Experimental results show that Concise uses significantly smaller memory to achieve faster query speed compared to existing FIB solutions and it can be updated very efficiently.
