We address the issue of on-line detection of communication problems in spoken dialogue systems. The usefulness is investigated of the sequence of system question types and the word graphs corresponding to the respective user utterances. By applying both rule-induction and memory-based learning techniques to data obtained with a Dutch train time-table information system, the current paper demonstrates that the aforementioned features indeed lead to a method for problem detection that performs significantly above baseline. The results are interesting from a dialogue perspective since they employ features that are present in the majority of spoken dialogue systems and can be obtained with little or no computational overhead. The results are interesting from a machine learning perspective, since they show that the rule-based method performs significantly better than the memory-based method, because the former is better capable of representing interactions between features.
