Abstract Real-time database systems incorporate the notion of a deadline into the database system model. USU- ally, deadlines are associated with transactions, and the system attempts to execute a given set of trans- actions so as to both meet the deadlines and ensure the database consistency. This paper presents an al- ternative model of real-time database processing in which deadlines are associated with consistency con- straints rather than directly with transactions. This model leads to a predicate-baaed approach to transac- tion management that allows greater concurrency and more flexibility in modeling real-world systems. 1 Introduction Real-time database systems (RTDBs) incorporate tim- ing considerations into a database system. Not only must the transactions execute correctly, but also, they must complete execution within some time limit called a deadline. Systems that incorporate strict deadlines are called
