Deleting a file from a storage medium serves two purposes: it reclaims storage resources and ensures that any sensitive information contained in the file becomes inaccessible. When done for the latter purpose, it is critical that the file is securely deleted, meaning that its content does not persist on the storage medium after deletion. Secure deletion is the act of deleting data from a storage medium such that the data is afterwards irrecoverable from the storage medium. The time between deleting data and it becoming irrecoverable is called the deletion latency.
