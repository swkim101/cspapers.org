Space and Earth monitoring is the next step for sensor networks. Distributed systems of small sensor-equipped satellites improve the cost efficiency and the missions' performance. This abstract discusses the characteristics of satellite Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and the challenges they introduce.
