We present an implemented system for the resolution of it, this, and that in transcribed multi-party dialog. The system handles NP-anaphoric as well as discoursedeictic anaphors, i.e. pronouns with VP antecedents. Selectional preferences for NP or VP antecedents are determined on the basis of corpus counts. Our results show that the system performs significantly better than a recency-based baseline.
