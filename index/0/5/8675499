We will demonstrate the operation of the Acoustic Embedded Networked Sensing Box (ENSBox), a platform for prototyping rapid-deployable distributed acoustic sensing systems. The ENSBox is a Linux-based acoustic sensing system with and integrated, high precision self-calibration facility sets it apart from other platforms. This selfcalibration is precise enough to support acoustic source localization applications in complex, realistic environments: e.g., 5 cm average 2D position error and 1.5 degree average orientation error over a 80x50 m outdoor area.
