The dominant paradigm for programming a computer today is text entry via keyboard and mouse, but there aremany common situations where this is not ideal. I address this through the creation of a new language thatis explicitly intended for spoken programming. In addition, I describe a supporting editor that improvesrecognition accuracy by making use of type information and scoping to increase recognizer context.
