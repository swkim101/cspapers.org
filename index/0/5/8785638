As the scale and dimensionality of data continue to grow in many applications of data analytics (e.g., bioinformatics, finance, computer vision, medical informatics), it becomes critical to develop efficient and effective algorithms to solve numerous machine learning and data mining problems. This tutorial will focus on simple yet practically effective techniques and algorithms for big data analytics. In the first part, we plan to present the state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms, including various stochastic gradient descent methods, stochastic coordinate descent methods and distributed optimization algorithms, for solving various machine learning problems. In the second part, we will focus on randomized approximation algorithms for learning from large-scale data. We will discuss i) randomized algorithms for low-rank matrix approximation; ii) approximation techniques for solving kernel learning problems; iii) randomized reduction methods for addressing the high-dimensional challenge. Along with the description of algorithms, we will also present some empirical results to facilitate understanding of different algorithms and comparison between them.
