A major problem when developing neural networks or machine diagnostics situations is that no data or very little data is available for training on fault conditions. However, the domain expert often has a good idea of what to expect in terms of input and output parameter values. If the expert can express these relationships in the form of rules, this would provide a resource too valuable to ignore. Fuzzy logic is used to handle the imprecision and vagueness of natural language and provides this additional advantage to a system. This paper investigates the development of a novel knowledge insertion algorithm that explores the benefits of prestructuring RBF neural networks by using prior fuzzy domain knowledge and previous training experiences. Pre-structuring is accomplished by using fuzzy rules gained from a domain expert and using them to modify existing Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks. The benefits and novel achievements of this work enable RBF neural networks to be trained without actual data but to rely on input to output mappings defined through expert knowledge.
