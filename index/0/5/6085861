Designers perform many tasks when developing new products and systems, and making decisions may be among the most important of these tasks. The trade space exploration process advocated in this work provides a visual and intuitive approach for formulating and solving single- and multi-objective optimization problems to support design decision-making. In this paper, we introduce an advanced sampling method to improve the performance of the visual steering commands that have been developed to explore and navigate the trade space. This method combines speciation and crowding operations used within the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to generate new samples near the region of interest. The accuracy and diversity of the resulting samples are compared against simple Monte Carlo sampling as well as the current implementation of the visual steering commands using a suite of test problems and an engineering application. The proposed method substantially increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the sampling process while maintaining diversity within the trade space.Copyright Â© 2008 by ASME
