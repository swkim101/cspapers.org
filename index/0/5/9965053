Applications that create and consume unstructured data have grown both in scale of storage requirements and complexity of search primitives. We consider two such applications: exhaustive search and integration of structured and unstructured data. Current block-based storage systems are either incapable or inefficient to address the challenges bought forth by the above applications. We propose a storage framework to efficiently store and search unstructured and structured data while controlling storage management costs. Experimental results based on our prototype show that the proposed system can provide impressive performance and feature benefits.
