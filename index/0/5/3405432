Systems integrating dozens of databases, in the scientific domain or in a large corporation, need to cope with a wide variety of imprecisions, such as: different representations of the same object in different sources; imperfect and noisy schema alignments; contradictory information across sources; constraint violations; or insufficient evidence to answer a given query. If standard query semantics were applied to such data, all but the most trivial queries will return an empty answer.
