In 1987, Henry Massalin, of Columbia University, described a super-optimizer that generates optimal instruction sequences given a function to be performed [1]. The sequences are found by doing an exhaustive search over a subset of the instructions of the machine for which the optinkation is made. Little or no mention of this important technique has occurred since, In the present work, we describe an alternative technique for constructing a superoptimizer, which will call the GNU Superoptimizer or GSO.
