Bag-of-words retrieval is popular among Question Answering (QA) system developers, but it does not support constraint checking and ranking on the linguistic and semantic information of interest to the QA system. We present anapproach to retrieval for QA, applying structured retrieval techniques to the types of text annotations that QA systems use. We demonstrate that the structured approach can retrieve more relevant results, more highly ranked, compared with bag-of-words, on a sentence retrieval task. We also characterize the extent to which structured retrieval effectiveness depends on the quality of the annotations.
