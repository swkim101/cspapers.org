Traditional parallel boundary element methods suffer from low parallel efficiency and poor scalability due to the long system solving time bottleneck. In this paper, we demonstrate how to avoid such a bottleneck by using an instantiable basis function approach. In our demonstrated examples, we achieve 90% parallel efficiency and scalability both in shared memory and distributed memory parallel systems.
