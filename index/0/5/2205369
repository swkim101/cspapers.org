The fact that employers regularly list communication skills among their top requirements for graduates of Computer Science programs and that communication skills are specifically included in ABET program outcomes attests to their significance for Computer Science educators. To prepare students, Computer Science programs typically require students to take a course in technical communications or writing intensive courses. A recent trend emerging from the communication specialist suggests that integrating communication skills with content across the Computer Science curriculum is more effective strategy. The three-year NSF-funded CPATH II project (CCF-0939122 and CCF-0939081) "Incorporating Communication Skills into the Computer Science Curriculum" brought together 40 Computer Science educators and communications specialists to develop assignments and communications supports that implement content and communication skills integration. The results are available on the project website (http://cs-comm.lib.muohio.edu/). Computer Science educators who seek to provide graduates of Computer Science programs with excellent communication skills will find this approach relevant and valuable. Those who have developed integrated materials will be encouraged to contribute to the project repository. Those who are interested in increasing the amount of communication taught in their curriculum will be encouraged to adapt assignments from the repository to their needs.
