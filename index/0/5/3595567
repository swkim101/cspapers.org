How to actively engage students using a more personalized approach in both online and face-to-face classes is an important topic in Computer Science discipline. Studies showed that adaptive learning approach can be used to redesign a course to achieve a better and more effective learning experience for the students. As a result, the Data Structures and Algorithms course at CSUEB has been redesigned using Smart Sparrow platform, with engaging adaptive learning objects embedded in the Blackboard LMS. Other tools like Open Educational Resources and ZyBook, as well as project-based group assignments were also utilized to transform the classes and student learning at the same time. The author reports on some preliminary results of a collaborative NSF grant that promotes the STEM education to a more diverse student body. Comparative results for control courses and the redesigned course demonstrate our findings and confirm the effectiveness of adaptive learning.
