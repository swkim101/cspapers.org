Processor scheduling on multiprocessor systems that simultaneously run concurrent applications is currently not well-understood. This paper reports a preliminary investigation of a number of fundamental issues which are important in the context of scheduling concurrent jobs on multiprogrammed parallel systems. The major motivation for this research is to gain insight into system behaviour and understand the basic principles underlying the performance of scheduling strategies in such parallel systems. Based on abstract models of systems and scheduling disciplines, several high level issues that are important in this context have been analysed.
