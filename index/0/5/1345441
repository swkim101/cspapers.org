The Group-Lasso method for finding important explanatory factors suffers from the potential non-uniqueness of solutions and also from high computational costs. We formulate conditions for the uniqueness of Group-Lasso solutions which lead to an easily implementable test procedure that allows us to identify all potentially active groups. These results are used to derive an efficient algorithm that can deal with input dimensions in the millions and can approximate the solution path efficiently. The derived methods are applied to large-scale learning problems where they exhibit excellent performance and where the testing procedure helps to avoid misinterpretations of the solutions.
