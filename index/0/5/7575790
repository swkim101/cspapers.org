Morphology and syntax interact considerably in many languages and language processing should pay attention to these interdependencies. We analyze the effect of syntactic features when used in automatic morphology prediction on four typologically different languages. We show that predicting morphology for languages with highly ambiguous word forms profits from taking the syntactic context of words into account and results in state-ofthe-art models.
