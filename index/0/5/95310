The focus of recent studies on Chinese word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and parsing has been shifting from words to characters. However, existing methods have not yet fully utilized the potentials of Chinese characters. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of character-level part-of-speech in the task of Chinese morphological analysis. We propose the first tagset designed for the task of character-level POS tagging. We propose a method that performs character-level POS tagging jointly with word segmentation and word-level POS tagging. Through experiments, we demonstrate that by introducing character-level POS information, the performance of a baseline morphological analyzer can be significantly improved.
