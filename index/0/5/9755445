The World-Wide Web was originally developed as a shared, writable, hypertext medium, a facility that is still widely needed.We have recently developed a Web-based management reporting system for a legal firm in an attempt to improve the efficiency and management of their overall business process. This paper shares our experiences in relating the firm's specific writing and issue tracking tasks to existing Web, open hypermedia, and Semantic Web research, and describes why we chose to develop a new solution --- a set of open hypermedia components collectively called the Management Reporting System --- rather than employ an existing system.
