This session provides a report of the joint curriculum task force effort to develop a new model curriculum for undergraduate programs in Information Systems. The curriculum work is the first collaborative effort between ACM and other professional societies associated with information systems education. The previous situation in which several different organizations had released proposed curriculum models was confusing to both academia and industry. The joint team has been in operation for the past year and is ready to present its work for comment.
