We consider a special class of homogeneous computer network comprising several essentially identical but independent computing systems (ICSs) sharing a single resource. Of interest here are the effects of modularly expanding the network by adding ICSs. We use a previously presented approximate queueing network model to analyze modular expansion in this class of network. The performance measure used in this analysis is the mean cycle time, which is the mean time between successive requests for service by the same job at the CPU of an ICS. In this analysis we derive an intuitively satisfying mathematical relation between the addition of ICSs and the incremental increase in the service rate of the shared resource required to maintain the existing level of system performance.
