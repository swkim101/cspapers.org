Technologies in autonomous vehicles have seen dramatic advances in recent years; however, it still lacks of robust perception systems for car detection. With the recent development in deep learning research, in this paper, we propose a LIDAR and vision fusion system for car detection through the deep learning framework. It consists of three major parts. The first part generates seed proposals for potential car locations in the image by taking LIDAR point cloud into account. The second part refines the location of the proposal boxes by exploring multi-layer information in the proposal network and the last part carries out the final detection task through a detection network which shares part of the layers with the proposal network. The evaluation shows that the proposed framework is able to generate high quality proposal boxes more efficiently (77.6% average recall) and detect the car at the state of the art accuracy (89.4% average precision). With further optimization of the framework structure, it has great potentials to be implemented onto the autonomous vehicle.
