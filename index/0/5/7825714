This paper presents a novel method for enabling fast development and easy customization of interactive data-intensive web applications. Our approach is based on a high-level hierarchical programming model that results in both a very clean semantics of the application while at the same time creating well-defined interfaces for customization of application components. A prototypical implementation of a conference management system shows the efficacy of our approach.
