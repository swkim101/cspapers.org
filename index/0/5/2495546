We present a path-planning algorithm that leverages a multi-scale representation of the environment. The algorithm works in n dimensions. The information of the environment is stored in a tree representing a recursive dyadic partitioning of the search space. The information used by the algorithm is the probability that a node of the tree corresponds to an obstacle in the search space. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and its completeness is shown.
