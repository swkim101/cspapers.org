The management of invasive fungal infections has been hampered by the inability to make a diagnosis at an early stage of the disease. Molecular diagnosis by PCR appears very promising since fungal DNA can be detected in the blood of infected patients earlier than when using conventional methods. Recently, interest in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections by real-time PCR has increased. Realtime methods also have quantitative properties and are useful both for initial diagnosis and to assess the response to treatment. Many recent studies have combined serological tests with measurement of fungal DNA by using real-time PCR. Real-time PCR helps early diagnosis and arrangement of treatment protocols for patients with high risk of fungal infection. Here real-time PCR methods for diagnosis of invasive fungal infections are described and discussed. caister.com/pcrbooks
