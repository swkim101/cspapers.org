This paper reports on the results of a study, sponsored by AFOSR, ARO and ONR, of current and future research directions in technological areas of computer science. This study is similar in spirit to the NSF-sponsored COSERS (Computer Science and Engineering Research Study) project, but is narrower in scope, emphasizing concepts and research issues relevant to software technology rather than the whole spectrum of research directions in computer science. It was started in the summer of 1975 and has resulted in a book to be published by the MIT press in the summer of 1978. Section 1 of this paper discusses the objectives and organization of the book and introduces a framework for structuring the subject matter of software technology which parallels the structure of the book. Sections 2 and 3 respectively discuss the impact on research of the changing technological environment and the unusual nature of software products. Sections 4-7 present a detailed summary of the contributions of individual chapters. Section 8 enumerates research directions for each of the areas considered. Section 9 briefly considers time horizons and funding philosophies.
