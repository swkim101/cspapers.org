In this paper, we consider the problem of mobile robots navigating in environments with non-rigid objects. Whereas robots can plan their paths more effectively when they utilize the information about the deformability of objects, they also need to consider the influence of the interaction with the deformable objects on their measurements during the execution of their navigation task. In this paper, we present a probabilistic approach to identify the measurements influenced by the deformable objects. Based on a learned statistics about the influence of the deformable objects on the measurements, the robot is able to perform a sensor-based collision avoidance of unforeseen objects. We present experiments carried out with a real robot that illustrate the practicability of our approach.
