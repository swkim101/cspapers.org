The Computer Science Principles project is in the fourth year of a roughly eight year project to develop a new Advanced Placement course that broadens participation in computer science while providing a rigorous yet engaging academic experience that will earn college credit and/or placement. In this special session we discuss new developments in the project and share student work and instructor perspectives from those pilot programs that have been part of the project for the past two years. In previous SIGCSE special sessions we have reported on the development of the project and its relationship to a national initiative (CS10K) to broaden participation in high school computing while expanding the number of teachers educating students in high school computing and computer science. [1-3] In this session we report on the conclusion of a second year of pilots that included nine high schools partnered with eight colleges (2011-2012) and a third pilot using a new portfolio exam (2012-2013) being conducted at six schools. The second pilot included new pedagogies and a prototype exam delivered to all students in the pilot. In this session we report on results this second round of piloting; on how the pilots succeeded in reaching goals of broadening participation and delivering a course that maintained fidelity to the curricular framework of the CS Principles project.
