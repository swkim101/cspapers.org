Conceptual schemas have been recognized as an important tool for the design and evaluation of integrated databases and knowledge-based systems. The paper surveys the back end of a conceptual design methodology called ANNAPURNA. Its theoretical foundation that relies on multi-typed functional and existence depeudencies is discussed. Quality measures for conceptual schemes are introduced. A general framework for the specification of conceptual schema transformations is proposed and algorithms for the evaluation and transformation of conceptual schemas are provided. The possibilities and limitations of using computerized tools for these tasks are discussed.
