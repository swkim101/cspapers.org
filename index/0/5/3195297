We study the complexity of the Channel Assignment problem. An open problem asks whether Channel Assignment admits an O(cn) (times a polynomial in the bit size) time algorithm, where n is a number of the vertices, for a constant c independent of the weights on the edges. We answer this question in the negative. Indeed, we show that in the standard Word RAM model, there is no 2o(nlog n) (times a polynomial in the bit size) time algorithm solving Channel Assignment unless the exponential time hypothesis fails. Note that the currently best known algorithm works in time O*(n!) = 2O(nlog n), so our lower bound is tight (where the O*() notation suppresses polynomial factors).
