This demonstration illustrates how the visualization tool, Performance Explorer (PE), can be used to understand the behavior of Java applications. PE allows the visualization of data over time in various graphical and tabular ways. In addition, PE allows the interactive creation and modification of visualizations. Most properties of the visualization are defined using expressions in a language similar to Java expressions. Finally, PE has an extensible trace format that allows flexible data acquisition and aggregation.
