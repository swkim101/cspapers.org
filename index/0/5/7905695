First, a “meta theory” of computer systems is developed so that the terms “process” and “deadlock” can be defined. Next, “reusable resources” are introduced to model objects which are shared among processes, and “consumable resources” are introduced to model signals or messages passed among processes. Then a simple graph model of computer systems is developed, and its deadlock properties are investigated. This graph model is useful for teaching purposes, unifies a number of previous results, and leads to efficient deadlock detection and prevention algorithms.
