In this paper, we show that the objections most frequently raised against the use of Bayesian statistics within the Al-in-medicine community do not seem to hold. In particular, we will show that the independence assumptions required to make Bayesian statistics computationally feasible are not nearly as damaging as has been claimed. We will also argue that Bayesian statistics is perfectly compatible with heuristic solutions to the multiple disease problem.
