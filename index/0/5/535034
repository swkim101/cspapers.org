Algorithms for the detection and diagnosis of faults in semiconductor random-access, word-organized memory systems are presented and evaluated. The memory system is conceptually partitioned into four major elements to facilitate analysis. During the testing of each element, previously tested elements are assumed to be fault-free, but untested elements may contain multiple faults. The problem of fault masking and interaction between the major elements of the system is investigated and considered in the development of the algorithms.
 The following analysis is not concerned with such problems as control signal timing and parameter tolerance, but rather with the detection and diagnosis of stuck-at 1 (SA1) and stuck-at 0 (SA0) solid faults within the system. It is useful to make a distinction between the concepts of a fault and a failure. Faults are logic gates, bit lines, etc., which are SA1 or SA0. Failures are deviations from correct system behavior which result from the presence of solid logic faults.
