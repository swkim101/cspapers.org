Despite the success of the Oracle8 i Extensibility Framework to index data from diverse domains (including text, images, spatial objects, chemical compounds, molecular structures, and genomic sequences), developing an indexing scheme is perceived as a difficult task, to be embarked upon only by experts, that too, for building support for complex domains. The goal of this demonstration is to show that: 1) the task of building and integrating an indexing scheme with the Oracle8 i Extensibility Framework is quite simple and 2) the applicability of the framework is not limited to complex domains. We chose to develop an indexing scheme for XML document collections, since XML is becoming widely popular. Using the Oracle8 i Extensibility Framework we will demonstrate 1) the ability to define domain operators with user-defined cost and selectivity functions, 2) the ability to define domain-specific indexing schemes, 3) the ability to specify user-defined index cost and statistics collection functions, 4) the ability to optimize queries involving domain operators via user-defined optimizer functions and 5) the ability to execute queries via domain indexes.
