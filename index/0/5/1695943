We describe a simple algorithm for approximating the empirical entropy of a stream of <i>m</i> values in a single pass, using <i>O</i>(ε<sup>-2</sup> log(Δ<sup>-1</sup>) log <i>m</i>) words of space. Our algorithm is based upon a novel extension of a method introduced by Alon, Matias, and Szegedy [1]. We show a space lower bound of Ω(ε<sup>-2</sup> / log(ε<sup>-1</sup>)), meaning that our algorithm is near-optimal in terms of its dependency on ε. This improves over previous work on this problem [8, 13, 17, 5]. We show that generalizing to <i>k</i>th order entropy requires close to linear space for all <i>k</i> ≥ 1, and give additive approximations using our algorithm. Lastly, we show how to compute a multiplicative approximation to the entropy of a random walk on an undirected graph.
