This paper explores the use of two graph algorithms for unsupervised induction and tagging of nominal word senses based on corpora. Our main contribution is the optimization of the free parameters of those algorithms and its evaluation against publicly available gold standards. We present a thorough evaluation comprising supervised and unsupervised modes, and both lexical-sample and all-words tasks. The results show that, in spite of the information loss inherent to mapping the induced senses to the gold-standard, the optimization of parameters based on a small sample of nouns carries over to all nouns, performing close to supervised systems in the lexical sample task and yielding the second-best WSD systems for the Senseval-3 all-words task.
