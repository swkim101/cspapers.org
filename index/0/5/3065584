Information Retrieval, Data Bases and Data Mining, Ontologies and Knowledge Representation provide crucial technologies to help navigate and structure large volumes of information and knowledge. But, some qualitatively distinct challenges require novel approaches, extending these disciplines beyond their traditional boundaries. For instance, we are faced with increasing volumes of streaming data: broadcast media, live surveillance, continuous trading via on-line markets, and so on, where the standard “index everything before querying” paradigm typical of IR and DBs does not apply. Another issue is how to make information and knowledge more proactive — so that the right knowledge is brought to bear when needed, essentially the difference between a medical textbook and an expert clinician. Although the full form of this challenge may be AI-complete, there may well be more modest, but yet very useful ways of creating proactive information-based reasoning agents that anticipate user needs. The presentation will discuss these and several other major challenges in information and knowledge management, and include examples of initial work to address these challenges at CMU and elsewhere.
