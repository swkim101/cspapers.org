In this work we propose a technique for spatial and temporal partitioning of a logic circuit based on the nodes activity computed by using a simulation at an higher level of abstraction. Only those components that are activated by a given input vector are added to the detailed simulation netlist. The methodology is suitable for parallel implementation on a multi-processor environment and allows us to arbitrarily switch between fast and detailed levels of abstraction during the simulation run. The experimental results obtained on a significant set of benchmarks show that it is possible to obtain a considerable reduction in both CPU time and memory occupation together with a considerable degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed technique easily fits in the existing industrial design flows.
