State-of-the-art subspace clustering methods are based on expressing each data point as a linear combination of other data points while regularizing the matrix of coefficients with ℓ<sub>1</sub>, ℓ<sub>2</sub> or nuclear norms. ℓ<sub>1</sub> regularization is guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity (i.e., there are no connections between points from different subspaces) under broad theoretical conditions, but the clusters may not be connected. ℓ<sub>2</sub> and nuclear norm regularization often improve connectivity, but give a subspace-preserving affinity only for independent subspaces. Mixed ℓ<sub>1</sub>, ℓ<sub>2</sub> and nuclear norm regularizations offer a balance between the subspace-preserving and connectedness properties, but this comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. This paper studies the geometry of the elastic net regularizer (a mixture of the ℓ<sub>1</sub> and ℓ<sub>2</sub> norms) and uses it to derive a provably correct and scalable active set method for finding the optimal coefficients. Our geometric analysis also provides a theoretical justification and a geometric interpretation for the balance between the connectedness (due to ℓ<sub>2</sub> regularization) and subspace-preserving (due to ℓ<sub>1</sub> regularization) properties for elastic net subspace clustering. Our experiments show that the proposed active set method not only achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance, but also efficiently handles large-scale datasets.
