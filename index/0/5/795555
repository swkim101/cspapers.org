Active collaborative ﬁltering (active CF) tries to solve this problem by intelligently soliciting user feedback in order to build an initial user proﬁle with minimal costs. Existing methods only query the user for feedback on items, while users can have preferences over items as well as certain item attributes. In this paper, we extend active CF via user feedback on both items and attributes. For example, when making movie recommendations, the system can ask users for not only their favorite movies, but also attributes such as genres, actors, etc. We design a uniﬁed active CF framework for incorporating both item and attribute feedback based on the random walk model. We test the active CF algorithm on real-world movie recommendation data sets to demonstrate that appropriately querying for both item and feature feedback can signiﬁcantly reduce the overall user effort measured in terms of number of queries. We show that we can achieve much better recommendation quality as compared to traditional active CF methods that support only item feedback.
