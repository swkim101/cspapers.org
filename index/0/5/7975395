In th~ paper we introduce uniuergal mobile channel, a new mobde communications abstraction that enables users and service providers to program apphcation-specific adaptive mobde services into a ce~ular Internet. Universal mobde channels are capable of supporting distinct adaptive qurdity of service control and mobfity management services over the same ce~ular access network infrastructure. Buflt on a split-leuel adaptation control scheme that operates at the ap pfication and network Ieveh, universal mobde channek offer a set of we~ defined open programmable interfaces to actively exploit the intrinsic scdabfity of adaptive mobfle ap phcations in ce~dar 1P networks. Universal mobde channeb can be programmed and expose interfaces that include: G) utility curves, which capture the adaptive nature of mobde applications in terms of the range of bandwidth over which they can successftiy operate; (ii) adaptation policy, which enables adaptive mobde apphcations to program per-session adaptation time-scales and bandwidth gramdarities rerdizing novel apphcation-specific adaptive servic~ and (iii) session policy, which enables users to specify the relative importance of flows/sessions within the same universfl mobde channel. To maintain adaptive services, universal mobde channek periodically probe the ce~tiar access network using a distributed network dgonthm achieving utility-based max-min jairness.
