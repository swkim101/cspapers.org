In this article, a recently developed approach for robot motion planning is extended and applied to non-holonomic mobile robots. This approach replace random sampling by deterministic one. We present several implementations of PRM-based planners: 1) Classical PRM with deterministic sampling and random sampling, 2) Deterministic and random Lazy-PRM, and 3) Lattice-based PRM. We have used several low-discrepancy sequences (Halton, Hammersley, Faure, and Sobol) and low-discrepancy lattices. Experimental results show that the deterministic variants of the PRM offer performance advantages in comparison to the original PRM.
