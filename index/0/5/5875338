This paper proposes the use of VLSI technology to perform relational database operations directly in hardware. It is shown that relational compulations, such as intersection, remove-duplicates, union, join, and division, can all be pipelined elegantly and efficiently on networks of processors having an array structure. These (systolic) processor arrays are readily and cost-effectively implementable with present technology, due to the extreme simplicity of their processors, and the high regularity of their interconnection structures.
