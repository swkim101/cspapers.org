Communication skills, including reading, writing, speaking, and teaming, are among the most sought after by employers of recent Computer Science/Software Engineering (CS/SE) graduates. We have been conducting a project that has developed a general framework for program-level integration of communication into CS/SE education. Our framework has been developed through workshops and field evaluation of training materials (and other resources) by faculty from a wide variety of institutions under the guidance of experts in writing and communication across the curriculum. This paper discusses the current state of communication teaching in the CS/SE domain, and presents our framework and experiences for program-wide implementation of communication skills.
