The access patterns of the users on a web site are traditionally investigated in order to improve the user access to the site s information In this study however a systematic approach is introduced in order to analyze the users navigation path to the advantage of the web site owner As users navigate through a web site they are transparently lling a questionnaire generated by the web site owner We rst cluster the users who navigate similar paths employing the Path Mining algorithm Next the correlation between a set of target questions and the structure of the WWW site is quanti ed This has been done by borrowing the concept of channel from information theory A channel can be considered as an information bridge between the users path classes and the answers to a questionnaire By adopting many concepts from information theory we introduce a natural measure to compute the e ectiveness of a WWW site structure in answering the target questionnaire Using this measure we provide a set of design guidelines to make WWW sites more informative for the server To nd the parameters of a channel we propose a learning process based on a set of training data and or inputs from a human expert Finally our proposed approach is tested on a sample WWW site and the results demonstrate dramatic improvement in the server information passing Author s work supported by NSF grant EEC IMSC ERC
