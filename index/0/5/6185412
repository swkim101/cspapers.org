Energy-wasting behavior is a big concern as it wastes around 1/3 of all energy consumption in buildings. Current solutions to address this issue either rarely offer privacy preservation or cannot satisfy occupants' comfort in an acceptable level. In this paper, we first propose an energy-wasting behavior detection platform. Based on that, we address a couple of privacy-related challenges in our platform through utilizing functional encryption to hide video data and by introducing noise disturbance which is mixed with metering data e.g. A/C power consumption signatures. In a privacy framework we proposed, we further quantify the privacy leakage by a set of theoretical models e.g. Hidden Markov model and differential privacy. Since our paper is still at its start phase, we plan to further extend our privacy evaluation model, assess privacy leakage on real-world dataset and accomplish experiments and we wish it could inspire colleagues' interests in this area.
