Two designs of wideband compact MIMO antenna using printed dipoles are firstly proposed in this paper. One is a three-port orthogonal polarization and the other is a cube-six-port antenna. Measured results for the antennas show that they resonate at 2.6 GHz and support a bandwidth of over 400 MHz. The worst mutual coupling for the three-port orthogonal polarization antenna is kept under −20 dB whereas that level of the cube-six-port antenna is −18 dB. Furthermore, experiments on MIMO systems with these antennas have been conducted. Measured data are analyzed to examine channel characteristics, such as cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of eigenvalues. Experiment results demonstrate that these compact antennas work very well in multipath-rich environments.
