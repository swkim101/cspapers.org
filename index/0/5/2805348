From its experimental 1968 inception in ARPANET, followed by CCITT standardization of the X.25 protocol in 1976, packet switching now provides inexpensive worldwide data communications capabilities for its subscribers. Customer connections to public packet switched network services are increasing at a phenomenal rate, typically 30-40% year over year with no foreseen slowdown. This 2-3 year doubling effect presents numerous challenges to network operators in trying to effectively support and evolve their packet switched networks while simultaneously increasing customer service levels.
This Panel presents an overview of current customer packet switching applications and then focuses on how network operators are innovatively meeting the challenges presented by high growth on the operation, control, support, configuration and evolution of their packet switched networks.
