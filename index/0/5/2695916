This paper presents our results of the acquisition of actual data of collapsing buildings, as part of our work on the Battleship Island monitoring project. Our Battleship Island monitoring system performs its task by acquiring data of images, sounds, and acceleration of collapsing buildings. The system is powered by solar energy. To enable the efficient use of solar-powered energy, this paper proposes a data-centric task scheduling system which consists of the DC-LQ (Data Centric LQ-Tracker) and BLB scheduling (battery-level based scheduling). An evaluation using computer simulation shows that data-centric task scheduling outperforms conventional task scheduling.
