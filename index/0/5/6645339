RouteFlow provides a way to run routing control platforms (e.g. Quagga) in OpenFlow networks. One of the issues of RouteFlow is that an administrator needs to devote a lot of time (typically 7 hours for 28 switches) in manual configurations. We propose and demonstrate a framework that can automatically configure RouteFlow. For this demonstration, we use an emulated pan-European topology of 28 switches. In the demonstration, we stream a video clip from a server to a remote client, and show that the video clip reaches at the remote client within 4 minutes (including the configuration time). In addition, we show automatic configuration of RouteFlow using a GUI (Graphical User Interface).
