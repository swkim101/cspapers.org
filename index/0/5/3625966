This paper considers the distribution of the rates at which flows transmit data, and the causes of these rates. First, using packet level traces from several Internet links, and summary flow statistics from an ISP backbone, we examine Internet flow rates and the relationship between the rate and other flow characteristics such as size and duration. We find, as have others, that while the distribution of flow rates is skewed, it is not as highly skewed as the distribution of flow sizes. We also find that for large flows the size and rate are highly correlated. Second, we attempt to determine the cause of the rates at which flows transmit data by developing a tool, T-RAT, to analyze packet-level TCP dynamics. In our traces, the most frequent causes appear to be network congestion and receiver window limits.
