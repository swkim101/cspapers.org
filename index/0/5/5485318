Several important theoretical improvements to parallel I/O have been proposed in recent years. Support for many of these suggestions is still limited to theoretical models or simulations. PARADISE is an experimental parallel file system for distributed memory multiprocessors which attempts to integrate many of these proposals into a unified and working prototype. PARADISE includes such features as cooperative caching, alternative file access modes, tuned message passing and elements of disk-directed I/O. PARADISE is implemented in a hybrid fashion in which functionality is concentrated in local servers with additions in a user callable library. It assumes a Mach 3.0 microkernel based operating system with homogeneous processing elements. However, we believe that the approach used and the lessons learned can be easily extended to other homogeneous MPP environments.
