Traditional monolithic database system architectures have been found to be inadequate for supporting end-user data modeling paradigms needed in complex application domains. Instead, database system architectures which are open, multi-layered, and extensible must be developed. In this paper, we explore the concept of a multilayer, extensible architecture for building new generation knowledge/data base systems. A Kernel Object Management System (KOMS) which serves as an intermediate layer in a multi-layer architecture is described. The aim is to build a generalized and extensible system which can be (a)upwardly extended into a high-level, end-user, semantic model and (b)downwardly extended to interface with various storage systems. To satisfy the generic or kernel requirement, the system uses an extensible Kernel Object Model (XKOM) which consists of a set of generalized or core object modeling constructs. Model Extensibility is facilitated by reflexively modeling the constructs of XKOM as objects, classes and associations. An object-based specification and implementation of the system architecture is used to achieve System Extensibility. By modifying and extending these model and system schemata, the model and system can be tailored or customized to suit various application domains. Various implementation issues and techniques related to the development of KOMS are also described.
