The hardware and software design and the analysis and evaluation of a microcomputer network system for managing distributed relational databases are presented. The system contains a set of commercially available microcomputers interconnected in a simple architectural structure with one serving as a controller processor and the rest as data processors which process distributed relation segments in a parallel fashion. A special purpose communication controller is designed to support data communication, command control, and synchronization among the set of processors. Parallel algorithms are formulated to carry out the macrocommands designed for processing relational algebraic operators. Data organization and processing technique are used to simulate associative processing of data by content and context rather than by their addresses. A failing processor can be replaced by any available processor. Thus, the system is a simple, low cost, highly reliable, flexible and efficient network.
