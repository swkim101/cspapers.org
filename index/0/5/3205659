Reading is an integral part of our lives. Most of us learned to read while we were young and never thought about how we learned to read. "ACEit!" (Assist Children in English-language) is an Android app developed to facilitate children in learning to read English. The app consists of a subset of the Dolch words (a set of 220 sight words that are proven to improve reading skill when they are learned) and uses a fading image strategy to support children in the early stages of learning to read and/or in special education. It gradually transitions the user from depending on pictures clues to recognize words, to recognizing words by themselves. This app is geared towards visual learners and provides them a more succinct yet entertaining way to learn using mobile devices.
