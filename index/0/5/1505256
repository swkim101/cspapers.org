In the process of establishing equitable and practical computer time allocations for our computer science courses this fall, we compared our seemingly high request with standards in other universities. Twenty-three private and state universities were chosen for the comparison and a questionnaire (appendix 1) was designed to elicit information about large introductory programming courses and more specialized systems programming/software engineering courses.
 The scope of the 25 item questionnaire covers course organization (size of class, number of meetings a week), course content (proficiency expected, languages used, size of programs written), and course budget (computer dollar allocation/ student, equipment and operating system used).
