Instead of supervision,we provide input features for each source signal and use convex methods toestimate the correlations between these features and the unobserved signaldecomposition. Contextually supervised source separation is a natural fit fordomains with large amounts of data but no explicit supervision; our motivatingapplication is energy disaggregation of hourly smart meter data (the separationof whole-home power signals into different energy uses). Here contextualsupervision allows us to provide itemized energy usage for thousands homes, a taskpreviously impossible due to the need for specialized data collection hardware.On smaller datasets which include labels, we demonstrate that contextualsupervision improves significantly over a reasonable baseline and existingunsupervised methods for source separation. Finally, we analyze the case of$\ell_2$ loss theoretically and show that recovery of the signal componentsdepends only on cross-correlation between features for different signals, not oncorrelations between features for the same signal.
