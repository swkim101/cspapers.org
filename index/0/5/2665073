We developed a new method of transforming Japanese case particles when transforming Japanese passive sentences into active sentences. It separates training data into each input particle and uses machine learning for each particle. We also used numerous rich features for learning. Our method obtained a high rate of accuracy (94.30%). In contrast, a method that did not separate training data for any input particles obtained a lower rate of accuracy (92.00%). In addition, a method that did not have many rich features for learning used in a previous study (Murata and Isahara, 2003) obtained a much lower accuracy rate (89.77%). We confirmed that these improvements were significant through a statistical test. We also conducted experiments utilizing traditional methods using verb dictionaries and manually prepared heuristic rules and confirmed that our method obtained much higher accuracy rates than traditional methods.
