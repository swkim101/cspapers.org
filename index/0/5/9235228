Designing heterogeneous chip multiprocessors (CMPs) with a mix of big cores (complex superscalar out-of-order pipelines) and small cores (simple in-order pipeline) is emerging as an attractive option for future architectures. Such architectures have the potential to deliver both high performance and power efficiency but this requires operating systems (OS) or virtual machine monitors (VMMs) to efficiently schedule each software thread on the type of core that is best suited for it. In this paper, we highlight the need for architectural support for OS scheduling in a heterogeneous CMP. We propose HeteroScouts, a hardware mechanism to assist the OS to efficiently predict the performance of a task on different cores in the platform.
