Multidimensional statistical models are generally computed outside a relational DBMS, exporting data sets. This article explains how fundamental multidimensional statistical models are computed inside the DBMS in a single table scan exploiting SQL and User-Defined Functions (UDFs). The techniques described herein are used in a commercial data mining tool, called Teradata Warehouse Miner. Specifically, we explain how correlation, linear regression, PCA and clustering, are integrated into the Teradata DBMS. Two major database processing tasks are discussed: building a model and scoring a data set based on a model. To build a model two summary matrices are shown to be common and essential for all linear models: the linear sum of points and the quadratic sum of cross-products of points. Since such matrices are generally significantly smaller than the data set, we explain how the remaining matrix operations to build the model can be quickly performed outside the DBMS. We first explain how to efficiently compute summary matrices with plain SQL queries. Then we present two sets of UDFs that work in a single table scan: an aggregate UDF to compute summary matrices and a set of scalar UDFs to score data sets. Experiments compare UDFs and SQL queries (running inside the DBMS) with C++ (running outside on exported files). In general, UDFs are faster than SQL queries and UDFs are more efficient than C++, due to long export times. Statistical models based on the summary matrices can be built outside the DBMS in just a few seconds. Aggregate and scalar UDFs scale linearly and require only one table scan, making them ideal to process large data sets.
