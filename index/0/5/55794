In the <sc>Minimum Bounded Degree Spanning Tree</sc> problem, we aregiven an undirected graph with a degree upper bound B<sub>v</sub> on eachvertex v, and the task is to find a spanning tree of minimumcost which satisfies all the degree bounds. Let OPT be the costof an optimal solution to this problem. In this paper, we presenta polynomial time algorithm which returns a spanning tree T ofcost at most OPT and d<sub>T</sub>(v) ≤ B<sub>v</sub>+1 for all v, where d<sub>T</sub>(v) denotes the degree of v in T. This generalizes aresult of Furer and Raghavachari [8] to weighted graphs, andsettles a 15-year-old conjecture of Goemans [10] affirmatively. The algorithm generalizes when each vertex v hasa degree lower bound A<sub>v</sub> and a degree upper bound B<sub>v</sub>, andreturns a spanning tree with cost at most OPT and A<sub>v</sub> - 1 ≤d<sub>T</sub>(v) ≤ B<sub>v</sub> + 1 for all v. This is essentially the bestpossible. The main technique used is an extension of the iterativerounding method introduced by Jain [12] for the design ofapproximation algorithms.
