We introduce Antonius, a wearable system that is able to detect real-world objects based on their visual appearance. Users can search for objects and be directed to their current location on a 3D map. Our formative evaluation indicates that 3D representation is preferred to 2D maps to show an object's location, and that both stationary and mobile systems would be beneficial depending on the scenario.
