We construct an oracle A such that PA = PA and NPA = EXPA: This relativized world has several amazing properties: The oracle A gives the first relativized world where one can solve satisfiability on formulae with at most one assignment yet P 6= NP. The oracle A is the first where PA = UPA 6= NPA = coNPA: The construction gives a much simpler proof than that of Fenner, Fortnow and Kurtz of a relativized world where all the NP-complete sets are polynomial-time isomorphic. It is the first such computable oracle. Relative to A we have a collapse of EXPA ZPPA PA/poly. We also create a different relativized world where there exists a set L in NP that is NP-complete under reductions that make one query to L but not complete under traditional many-one reductions. This contrasts with the result of Buhrman, Spaan and Torenvliet showing that these two completeness notions for NEXP coincide. Research done at Yale and the University of Maryland.
