While partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a natural decision-theoretic model for this problem, the computational cost of POMDP planning grows exponentially in the number of sensors, making it feasible only for small problems. We propose a new POMDP planning method that uses greedy maximization to greatly improve scalability in the number of sensors. We show that, under certain conditions, the value function of a dynamic sensor selection POMDP is submodular and use this result to bound the error introduced by performing greedy maximization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset from a multi-camera tracking system in a shopping mall show it achieves similar performance to existing methods but incurs only a fraction of the computational cost, leading to much better scalability in the number of cameras.
