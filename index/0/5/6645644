Semi-supervised clustering employs limited supervision in the form of labeled instances or pairwise instance constraints to aid unsupervised clustering and often significantly improves the clustering performance. Despite the vast amount of expert knowledge spent on this problem, most existing work is not designed for handling high-dimensional sparse data. This paper thus fills this crucial void by developing a Semi-supervised Clustering method based on spheRical K-mEans via fEature projectioN (SCREEN). Specifically, we formulate the problem of constraint-guided feature projection, which can be nicely integrated with semi-supervised clustering algorithms and has the ability to effectively reduce data dimension. Indeed, our experimental results on several real-world data sets show that the SCREEN method can effectively deal with high-dimensional data and provides an appealing clustering performance.
