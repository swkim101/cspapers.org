We develop a fast algorithm for the Admixture of Poisson MRFs (APM) topic model [1] and propose a novel metric to directly evaluate this model. The APM topic model recently introduced by Inouye et al. [1] is the first topic model that allows for word dependencies within each topic unlike in previous topic models like LDA that assume independence between words within a topic. Research in both the semantic coherence of a topic models [2, 3, 4, 5] and measures of model fitness [6] provide strong support that explicitly modeling word dependencies—as in APM—could be both semantically meaningful and essential for appropriately modeling real text data. Though APM shows significant promise for providing a better topic model, APM has a high computational complexity because O(p2) parameters must be estimated where p is the number of words ([1] could only provide results for datasets with p = 200). In light of this, we develop a parallel alternating Newton-like algorithm for training the APM model that can handle p = 104 as an important step towards scaling to large datasets. In addition, Inouye et al. [1] only provided tentative and inconclusive results on the utility of APM. Thus, motivated by simple intuitions and previous evaluations of topic models, we propose a novel evaluation metric based on human evocation scores between word pairs (i.e. how much one word "brings to mind" another word [7]). We provide compelling quantitative and qualitative results on the BNC corpus that demonstrate the superiority of APM over previous topic models for identifying semantically meaningful word dependencies.
