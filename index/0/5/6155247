The paper deals with the problem of computing schedules for multi-threaded real-time programs. In [14] we introduced a scheduling method based on the geometrization of PV programs. In this paper, we pursue this direction further by showing a property of the geometrization that permits finding good schedules by means of efficient geometric computation. In addition, this geometric property is also exploited to reduce the scheduling problem to a simple path planning problem originating from robotics, for which we developed a scheduling algorithm using probabilistic path planning techniques. These results enabled us to implement a prototype tool that can handle models with up to 100 concurrent threads.
