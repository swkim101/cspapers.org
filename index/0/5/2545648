In this paper, a novel composite 6-DOF parallel robot is introduced. Two independent components are included in this new mechanism. One is a planar 3-RPR mechanism, the other is a spatial 3-UPS-1-PU mechanism. The planar mechanism provides translations along the x and y axes and rotation around the z axis. As a complement, the 3-UPS-1-PU mechanism provides translation along the z axis and rotations around the x and y axis. These two mechanisms are combined using a serial connection. Different combinations of these two mechanism are proposed in this paper.
