This paper proposes a real time hand gesture recognition system. The approach uses a range camera to capture the depth data. After some preprocessing procedures, the depth data is used to segment the hand and then locate the hand in 3D space. The hand shape is classified into known categories using a chamfer matching method to measure the similarities between the candidate hand image and the hand templates in the database. The 3D hand trajectory is recognized by a Finite State Machine (FSM) method. Each gesture consists of several states. The 3D hand position determines the state transition of each gesture recognizer. Experiments show that the system performs reliably for recognizing both static hand shapes and spatial-temporal trajectories in real time.
