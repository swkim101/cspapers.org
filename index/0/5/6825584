We propose to use the community structure of Usenet for organizing and retrieving the information stored in newsgroups. In particular, we study the network formed by cross-posts, messages that are posted to two or more newsgroups simultaneously. We present what is, to our knowledge, by far the most detailed data that has been collected on Usenet cross-postings. We analyze this network to show that it is a small-world network with significant clustering. We also present a spectral algorithm which clusters newsgroups based on the cross-post matrix. The result of our clustering provides a topical classification of newsgroups. Our clustering gives many examples of significant relationships that would be missed by semantic clustering methods.
