We present a family of measures of proximity of an arbitrary node in a directed graph to a pre-specified subset of nodes, called the anchor. Our measures are based on three different propagation schemesand two different uses of the connectivity structure of the graph. We consider a web-specific application of the above measures with two disjoint anchors - good and bad web pages - and study the accuracy of these measures in this context.
