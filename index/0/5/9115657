Sixty-nine pairs of Latino and white middle school students were video recorded as they pair programmed for approximately 20 minutes. We quantitatively analyzed the partners' interactions specifically looking at characteristics of their collaboration. A qualitative analysis of interactions of three girl pairs was conducted to gain insight into how students' experience in diverse cultural communities may relate to their collaboration during pair programming.
