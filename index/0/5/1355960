This tutorial will cover the history and rationale behind the development of the Ada programming language. This includes covering both traditional Ada 83 and Ada 9X. Ada 9X is a new programming language that is a revision of the existing Ada 1983 standard. The discussion of the additions and modifications to the initial Ada 1983 programming language that lead to Ada 9X will include the rationale that lead to the language motivations.
