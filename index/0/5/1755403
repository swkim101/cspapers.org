This paper describes CQLF (CODASYL Query Language, Flat) [MAN081]. CQLF is a high level language for accessing and manipulating data in databases described using the 1981 ANSI dpANS version of the CODASYL Data Description Language [ANSI81]. CQLF has similarities to typical relational languages, such as SQL [ASTR76, CHAM76] and QUEL [STON76]. CQLF provides capabilities for querying and operating on databases described both in a "relational style" (having no CODASYL sets, using only values to represent interrecord relationships, and having records with no arrays), and in a "network style" (using CODASYL sets to represent interrecord relationships, and having records containing arrays).
