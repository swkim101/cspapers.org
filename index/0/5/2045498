We introduce an indirect train traffic monitoring system based on building vibration. Traffic monitoring is important to help improve the efficiency of transportation systems. However, current practices of traffic monitoring require either intensive labor or deployment of dedicated sensors, which is costly to install and maintain. To address these challenges, we use building vibration sensing systems, which often exist in buildings for structural health monitoring purposes, to monitor traffic events. In particular, our system detects passing trains and infers their direction by analyzing noisy building vibrations induced by the train. The key idea is to represent wave propagation inside building as signal information exchanges. Using causal analysis with an information theoretic approach, we can analyze the relationship between the vibration signals in different locations of building and infer traffic information despite noise. We evaluated our system using an 11-story building with trains passing nearby daily. The results show that the method can detect the train events with accuracy of up to 88%, and infer the direction of train event with 86.9%.
