RAM-model secure computation addresses the inherent limitations of circuit-model secure computation considered in almost all previous work. Here, we describe the first automated approach for RAM-model secure computation in the semi-honest model. We define an intermediate representation called SCVM and a corresponding type system suited for RAM-model secure computation. Leveraging compile-time optimizations, our approach achieves order-of-magnitude speedups compared to both circuit-model secure computation and the state-of-art RAM-model secure computation.
