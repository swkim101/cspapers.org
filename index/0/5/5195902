Modeling learning in any domain can be pursued in two alternative directions: either by finding domain-specific heuristics, or by applying general machine-learning methods. In the linguistic domain, programs such as FOULUP [1] and CHILD [2] have used specific heuristics, regardless of the general learning methodology; other programs [3,4] have focussed on the general learning methodology. In our particular task-learning idioms from examples, the evaluation of general learning models is very appealing, since such methods have been studied extensively, and may offer ready solutions.
