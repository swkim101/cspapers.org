Programming contests have a long established role as co-curricular activities. But as programming methodology has changed, the programming contest problems have not reflected these changes. In this paper, we describe a way to modernize the traditional ACM-style contest while preserving the problem solving aspects. We do so by introducing a new type of problem that requires that solutions interact with pre-defined classes. We discuss the effects of this change on a contest conducted for high school students.
