This paper proposes a novel noise-aware character alignment method for bootstrapping statistical machine transliteration from automatically extracted phrase pairs. The model is an extension of a Bayesian many-to-many alignment method for distinguishing nontransliteration (noise) parts in phrase pairs. It worked effectively in the experiments of bootstrapping Japanese-to-English statistical machine transliteration in patent domain using patent bilingual corpora.
