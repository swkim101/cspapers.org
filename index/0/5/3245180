Apart the use of catadioptric cameras, only few visual servoing works exploit the use of mirror. Such a configuration is however interesting since it allows to overpass the limited camera field of view. Based on the known projection equations involved in such a system, this paper introduces the theoretical background that allows the use of planar mirror for visual servoing in different configurations. Limitations intrinsic to such systems, such as the number of d.o.f actually controllable, is then discussed. Experiments using a mirror mounted on the end-effector of a 6 d.o.f robot validate the proposed approach.
