This paper proposes a novel flexible sliding actuator driven by fluid power. The actuator called Λ -drive is basically composed of a flat tube and a slider. In the slider the tube is bent, then the buckling point occurs, which helps to cut off the fluid passage in order to provide the driving force to the slider when pressurizing one side of the tube. The proposed actuator is applicable to not only the straight path but the spiral and the curved one as well. Moreover, the design method to drive stably and the analysis of the output force are discussed in this paper. Finally, “Fluid Ropeway” is also proposed as the application of Λ-drive aiming to search and rescue survivors in the half collapsed houses, and its feasibility is verified through the experiment.
