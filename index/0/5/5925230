Association rules are useful for determining correlations between attributes of a relation and have applications in the marketing, financial, and retail sectors. Furthermore, optimized association rules are an effective way to focus on the most interesting characteristics involving certain attributes. Optimized association rules are permitted to contain uninstantiated attributes and the problem is to determine instantiations such that either the support, confidence, or gain of the rule is maximized. In this paper, we generalize the optimized gain association rule problem by permitting rules to contain disjunctions over uninstantiated numeric attributes. Our generalized association rules enable us to extract more useful information about seasonal and local patterns involving the uninstantiated attribute. For rules containing a single numeric attribute, we present an algorithm with linear complexity for computing optimized gain rules. Furthermore, we propose a bucketing technique that can result in a significant reduction in input size by coalescing contiguous values without sacrificing optimality. We also present an approximation algorithm based on dynamic programming for two numeric attributes. Using recent results on binary space partitioning trees, we show that the approximations are within a constant factor of the optimal optimized gain rules. Our experimental results with synthetic data sets for a single numeric attribute demonstrate that our algorithm scales up linearly with the attribute's domain size as well as the number of disjunctions. In addition, we show that applying our optimized rule framework to a population survey real-life data set enables us to discover interesting underlying correlations among the attributes.
