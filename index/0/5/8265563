In this paper, we study the leader election problem in the full information model. We show two results in this context. First, we exhibit a constructive O(logN) round protocol that is resilient against linear size coalitions. That is, our protocol is resilient against any coalition of size less then N for some constant (but small) value of . Second, we provide an easy, non-constructive probabilistic argument that shows the existence of O(logN) round protocol in which can be made as large as 1 2 for any positive . Our protocols are extremely simple.
