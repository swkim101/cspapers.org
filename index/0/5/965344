We present a new methodology for visualizing navigation patterns on a Web site. In our approach, we rst partition site users into clusters such that only users with similar navigation paths through the site are placed into the same cluster. Then, for each cluster, we display these paths for users within that cluster. The clustering approach we employ is model based (as opposed to distance based) and partitions users according to the order in which they request Web pages. In particular, we cluster users by learning a mixture of rst-order Markov models using the ExpectationMaximization algorithm. Our algorithm scales linearly with both number of users and number of clusters, and our implementation easily handles millions of users and thousands of clusters in memory. In the paper, we describe the details of our technology and a tool based on it called WebCANVAS. We illustrate the use of our technology on user-traAEc data from msnbc.com.
