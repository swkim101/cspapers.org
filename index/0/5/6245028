As HPSG is head-driven, with clear semantic heads, semantic head-driven generation should be simple. We adapt van Noord's Prolog generator for use with an HPSG grammar in ProFIT. However, quantifiers and context factors are difficult to include in head-driven generation. We must adopt recent theoretical proposals for lexicalized scoping and context. With these revisions, head-driven generation with HPSG is not so simple, but it is possible.
