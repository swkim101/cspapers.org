We study the MSNBC Web site, one of the busiest in the Internet today. We analyze the dynamics of content creation and modification as well as client accesses. Our key findings are (a) files tend to change little upon modification, (b) a small set of files get modified repeatedly, (c) file popularity follows a Zipf-like distribution with an Î± much larger than reported in previous, proxy-based studies, and (d) there is significant temporal stability in file popularity but not much stability in the domains from which popular content is accessed. We discuss implications of these findings.
