Interest in pen-based user interfaces is growing rapidly. Onepotentially useful feature of pen-based user interfaces isgestures, that is, a mark or stroke that causes a command toexecute. Unfortunately, it is difficult to design gestures that areeasy 1) for computers to recognize and 2) for humans to learn andremember. To investigate these problems, we built a prototype tooltypical fo those used for designing gesture sets. An experiment wasthen performed to gain insight into the gesture design process andto evaluate this style of tool. The experiment confirmed thatgesture design is very difficult and suggested several ways inwhich current tools can be improved. The most important improvementis to make the tools more active and provide more guidance fordesigners. This paper describes the gesture design tool, theexperiment, and its results.
