The join of two relations is an important operation in database systems. It occurs frequently in relational queries, and join performance is a significant factor in overall system performance. Cost models for join algorithms are used by query optimizers to choose efficient query execution strategies. This paper presents an efficient analytical model of an important join method, the hybrid hash join algorithm, that captures several key features of the algorithm's performanceâ€”including its intra-operator parallelism, interference between disk reads and writes, caching of disk pages, and placement of data on disk(s). Validation of the model against a detailed simulation of a database system shows that the response time estimates produced by the model are quite accurate.
