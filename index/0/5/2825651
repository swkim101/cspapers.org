With the fast development and increasing population of the wearable devices involves in our daily life, the security of the privacy information on those devices is attracting significant attentions. One of the possible solution is to enable the devices to recognise the real owner with authentication system. Biometrics recognition is popular used for authentication systems. The biometrics used including faces, fingerprints, gait cycles and etc. Using gait cycles as the criteria for identities recognition is superior than other biometrics as the gait information can be collected by the IMU sensors which are most popular embedded on portable devices and they cannot be reproduced by the invaders. We propose, Securitas, the continuous authentication system exploits the information from IMU sensors on the smart glasses to distinguish different wearers.
