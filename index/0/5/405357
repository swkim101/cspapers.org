Temporal locality of reference in Web request streams emerges from two distinct phenomena: the popularity of Web objects and the temporal correlation of requests. Capturing these two elements of temporal locality is important because it enables cache replacement policies to adjust how they capitalize on temporal locality based on the relative prevalence of these phenomena. In this paper, we show that temporal locality metrics proposed in the literature are unable to delineate between these two sources of temporal locality. In particular, we show that the commonly-used distribution of reference interarrival times is predominantly determined by the power law governing the popularity of documents in a request stream. To capture (and more importantly quantify) both sources of temporal locality in a request stream, we propose a new and robust metric that enables accurate delineation between locality due to popularity and that due to temporal correlation. Using this metric, we characterize the locality of reference in a number of representative proxy cache traces. Our ndings show that there are measurable di erences between the degrees (and sources) of temporal locality across these traces, and that these di erences are e ectively captured using our proposed metric. We illustrate the signi cance of our ndings by proposing and evaluating a novel Web cache replacement policy|called GreedyDual*|which exploits both long-term popularity and short-term temporal correlation in an adaptive fashion. Our trace-driven simulation experiments show the superior performance of GreedyDual* when compared to other Web cache replacement policies.
