In this paper, we describe a method based on statistical machine translation (SMT) that is able to restore accents in Hungarian texts with high accuracy. Due to the agglutination in Hungarian, there are always plenty of word forms unknown to a system trained on a fixed vocabulary. In order to be able to handle such words, we integrated a morphological analyzer into the system that can suggest accented word candidates for unknown words. We evaluated the system in different setups, achieving an accuracy above 99% at the highest.
