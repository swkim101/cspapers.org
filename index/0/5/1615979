Cloning (ad hoc reuse by duplication of design or code) speeds up development, but also hinders future maintenance. Cloning also hints at reuse opportunities that, if exploited systematically, might have positive impact on development and maintenance productivity. Unstable requirements and tight schedules pose unique challenges for Web Application engineering that encourage cloning. We are conducting a systematic study of cloning in Web Applications of different sizes, developed using a range of Web technologies, and serving diverse purposes. Our initial results show cloning rates up to 63% in both newly developed and already maintained Web Applications. Expected contribution of this work is two-fold: (1) to confirm potential benefits of reuse-based methods in addressing clone related problems of Web engineering, and (2) to create a framework of metrics and presentation views to be used in other similar studies.
