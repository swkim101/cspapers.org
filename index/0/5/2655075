We present a demonstration scenario to validate a middleware architecture that we designed and implemented for distributing content between mobile users in an opportunistic manner. The peer-to-peer networking architecture allows content dissemination between mobile devices without relying on any infrastructure support. We developed a mobile application utilizing the services provided by the implemented middleware. The application facilitates opportunistic content distribution in both one-to-one and one-to-many dissemination modes.
