With the growth of social bookmarking a new approach for metadata creation called tagging has emerged. In this paper we evaluate the use of tag presentation techniques. The main goal of our evaluation is to investigate the effect of some of the different properties that can be utilized in presenting tags e.g. alphabetization, using larger fonts etc. We show that a number of these factors can affect the ease with which users can find tags and use the tools for presenting tags to users.
