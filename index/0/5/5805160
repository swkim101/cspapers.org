The CONTROL project at U.C. Berkeley has developed technologies to provide online behavior for data-intensive applications. Using new query processing algorithms, these technologies continuously improve estimates and confidence statistics. In addition, they react to user feedback, thereby giving the user control over the behavior of long-running operations. This demonstration displays the modifications to a database system and the resulting impact on aggregation queries, data visualization, and GUI widgets. We then compare this interactive behavior to batch-processing alternatives.
