The bootstrap algorithm is a computational intensive procedure to derive nonparametric confidence intervals of statistical estimators in situations where an analytic solution is intractable. It is applied to neural networks to estimate the predictive distribution for unseen inputs. The consistency of different bootstrap procedures and their convergence speed is discussed. A small scale simulation experiment shows the applicability of the bootstrap to practical problems and its potential use.
