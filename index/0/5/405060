This paper investigates the effect of predefining semantics in modelling the evolution of compositional languages versus allowing agents to develop these semantics in parallel with the development of language. The study is done using a multi-agent model of language evolution that is based on the Talking Heads experiment. The experiments show that when allowing a co-evolution of semantics with language, compositional languages develop faster than when the semantics are predefined, but compositionality appears more stable in the latter case. The paper concludes that conclusions drawn from simulations with predefined meanings, which most studies use, may need revision.
