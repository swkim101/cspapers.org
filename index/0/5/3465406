We develop a general model to estimate the throughput and goodput between arbitrary pairs of nodes in the presence of interference from other nodes in a wireless network. Our model is based on measurements from the underlying network itself and is thus more accurate than abstract models of RF propagation such as those based on distance. The seed measurements are easy to gather, requiring only O(N) measurements in an N-node networks. Compared to existing measurement-based models, our model advances the state of the art in three important ways. First, it goes beyond pairwise interference and models interference among an arbitrary number of senders. Second, it goes beyond broadcast transmissions and models the more common case of unicast transmissions. Third, it goes beyond homogeneous nodes and models the general case of heterogeneous nodes with different traffic demands and different radio characteristics. Using simulations and measurements from two different wireless testbeds, we show that the predictions of our model are accurate in a wide range of scenarios.
