We discuss the issues in using real-time databases for monitoring and control of manufacturing processes. We develop a distributed real-time database architecture based on open system principles for such appfications. In doing so, we describe an object-oriented data model for maintai-ing sensor data, and consider the issues involved in real-time data logging for maintenance and error recovery. We study the real-time needs of the involved tasks, and identify several related problems. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n The automated control of modern manufacturing systems involve the acquisition and management of considerable quantities of diverse sensor data. Information about the environment external to the computers (i.e., the equipment and processes constituting the manufacturing system) is sampled, stored, and often analyzed on-line and off-line for automated control [DEW95]. There are considerable advantages in using a realt ime database for monitoring such systems. The large amount of data generated necessitates good data management strategies. The database may need to support concurrent data access and provide well-defined interfaces between different application tasks. These tasks are subject to diverse timing constraints that are better handled by a real-time database. In this paper, we describe the architecture of a realt ime database for monitoring and control applications. The three main components, data acquisition, process monitoring and data logging, are outlined as follows. Data acquisition tasks get the current state of the process and store it in the database in a timely manner. Process monitoring involves analysis of the sensor data This work is supported in part by an NSF grant II:ti-9504412 l ~m i~ ioo to omll~ &Sitd/Imd c=pio of ~II or l~,m of mis m~daial for ~ , ~ a l or c l a i m ~ is wm~d withom f ~ provi&d I I ~ tim =0pia ~ ~ ~ l e o¢ d i m ~ l for profit or a m n m : i d K I v ~ u ~ , tim copyright n~ice, ~ litle o1'11~ publi~tion imd i~ dine apix~-, ~ 1 no6¢~ = sivm ~ copyri~ i~ by pffiminicv ~the ACM. ~ To ,~,y odmwi~, to rcpubliffih, to put on mrv~ ~ to ration'bin= ~ lira. mquiw Sl~ific DART "96 R,~'~¢I/,e.MD, USA 1997 ACM 0-8'9"/91-948.3/96/I I ..$3.50 to determine the state of the process. Data logging deals with the storage of the process data on the disk for off-line analyses (e.g., to determine the trends in the manufacturing environment), and to some extent for error recovery. In this paper, we focus more on the related aspects of a data model and logging. t Sensor data as well as the derived data can be viewed as series of values. Such data is often described by sequence data models which have been studied for various applications [SLR95, SLlt96]. However, while querying sequence data in a manner similar to the relational model has been developed, it does not offer the extensibility and real-time performance required in manufacturing systems. Still others describe data models for multivariate time series arising in stock market applications [DDS94,RS91], but these do not consider ordering domains important for manufacturing applications (e.g., the ordering as needed for transformed derived data). For the related issue of logging in real-time databases, the studies are inadequate for the domain of manufacturing automation. The approach in [SRS95] uses the memory hierarchy and exploits da ta characteristics to provide transactional semantics. For manufacturing systems, it may be unnecessary to provide transaction level durability [WKP96] since data is logged primarily for off-line analyses that identify slowly varying system parameters. In Section 2, we describe the architecture of a realtime monitoring and control system based on open system principles. The basics of an object-oriented sequence data model for sensor data are given in Section 3. In Section 4, we describe some issues related to data logging that tie-in with our sequence data model. Finally, Section 5 constitutes our conclusions, discussions, and status report. 2 A r c h i t e c t u r e The availability of reliable, inexpensive computers has led to distributed systems for manufacturing automation [PB90,TP90]. Such systems are more scalable and flexible for use in monitoring and control systems. Sev-
