We introduce a correspondence between the design space of web applications and that of domain-specific languages (DSLs). We note that while most web applications today are implemented in ways that correspond to external DSLs, very little attention is given to implementation techniques corresponding to internal DSLs. We contribute a technique based on internal DSLs, and demonstrate a web application implemented with our technique.
