This paper is concerned with multiuser downlink transmissions in the presence of inter-cell interference (ICI). In the considered system, precoding at base stations (BS) and postcoding at users are jointly determined to manage both inter-user interference (IUI) and ICI under mean square error (MSE) criterion. Unlike zero-forcing based precoding, the proposed MSE-based precoding scheme still work as the number of transmit antennas at each BS is smaller than the total number of receive antennas at all users.
