Predicting the performance of individual components of information retrieval systems, in particular the complex interactions between those components, is still challenging. Therefore, professionals are needed for the implementation and configuration of retrieval systems and retrieval components. Our web-based application, called Xtrieval Web Lab, enables newcomers and learners to gain practical knowledge about the information retrieval process. They can arrange a multitude of components of retrieval systems and evaluate them with real world data without utilizing a programming language. Game mechanics guide the learners in their discovery process and motivate them.
