This paper describes a posting compression technique to be used in dynamic full-text document retrieval environments. The compression technique being presented is applicable in main-memory document retrieval systems, and consists of two parts. First there is the efficient use of auxiliary tables, and second there is the application of the well-known rankfrequency law of Zipf. It is shown that on the basis of this law term weights can be approximated, and thus that their explicit storage can be avoided.
