Attribute based messaging (ABM) enables message senders to dynamically create a list of recipients based on their attributes as inferred from an enterprise database. Such targeted messaging can reduce unnecessary communications and enhance privacy, but faces challenges in access control. In this paper, we explore an approach to ABM based on deriving access control information from the same attribute database exploited by the addressing scheme. We show how to address three key challenges. First, we demonstrate a manageable access control system based on attributes. Second we show how this can be used with existing messaging systems to provide a practical deployment strategy. Third, we show that such a system can be efficient enough to support ABM for mid-size enterprises. Our implementation can dispatch ABM messages approved by XACML review for an enterprise of at least 60,000 users with only seconds of latency
