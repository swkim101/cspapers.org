Expertise in fault diagnosis often depends on recognizing particular patterns in observed data corresponding to situations that have previously been seen and correctly interpreted. This approach can result in significant efficiencies by avoiding a costly and detailed analysis based on the causal relationships between faults and observable data Recognition-based reasoning requires highly focused search strategies in order to extract relevant information from a knowledge base that contains a large number of prototypes for various possible faults This paper describes a model of recognition-based reasoning and describes an implementation of the model. designed to solve diagnostic problems in pediatric cardiology. The model first analyzes portions of the patient data to hypothesize a small set of potential diseases Knowledge specific to each selected hypothesis is then used to refine these initial choices. The model has been validated against actual hospital cases and performs in a manner comparable to expert physicians.
