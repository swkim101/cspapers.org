The ARTMAP-FD neural network performs both identification (placing test patterns in classes encountered during training) and familiarity discrimination (judging whether a test pattern belongs to any of the classes encountered during training). The performance of ARTMAP-FD is tested on radar pulse data obtained in the field, and compared to that of the nearest-neighbor-based NEN algorithm and to a k > 1 extension of NEN.
