A new computer literacy program has been implemented at James Madison University (Vs.). Our approach has been t o integrate the computer into appropriate existing courses, rather than introduce into the curriculum any new course(s) called "Computer Literacy." Three existing courses in mathematics were revised to include a computing component. These three courses, together with an introductory course in BASIC programming and a course in business computer applications, form the entry level of our computer literacy program. Beyond these courses, each discipline t h r o u g h o u t the University is being strongly encouraged to develop materials and to revise curricula in order to integrate computer use with appropriate applications in the discipline. The philosophical base for our approach and our curricular design are reported in detail.
