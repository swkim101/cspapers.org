Ubiquitous and Wearable Computing both have the goal of pushing the computer into the background, supporting all kinds of human activities. Application areas include areas such as everyday environments (e.g. clothing, home, office), promoting new forms of creative learning via physical/virtual objects, and new tools for interactive design. In this paper, we thrust ubiquitous computing into the extremely hostile environment of the sparring ring of a martial art competition. Our system uses piezoelectric force sensors that transmit signals wirelessly to enable the detection of when a significant impact has been delivered to a competitor's body. The objective is to support the judges in scoring the sparring matches accurately, while preserving the goal of merging and blending into the background of the activity. The system therefore must take into account of the rules of the game, be responsive in real-time asynchronously, and often cope with untrained operators of the system. We present a pilot study of the finished prototype and detail our experience.
