This paper describes an overall framework for the design of numerical libraries on a computational Grid of processors where the processors may be geographically distributed and under the control of a Grid-based scheduling system. A set of experiments are presented in the context of solving systems of linear equations using routines from the ScaLAPACK software collection along with various grid service components, such as Globus, NWS, and Autopilot.
