Discount usability evaluation methods have recently been introduced as a way to assess groupware systems. However, one criticism of these techniques is that they do not make use of information about users and their work contexts. To address this problem, we developed groupware walkthrough, a new usability inspection technique for groupware. The technique is a substantive modification of cognitive walkthrough to include consideration for the complexities of teamwork. The two components of groupware walkthrough are a task model for identifying and analysing real-world collaborative tasks, and a walkthrough process for assessing a system's support for those tasks. Groupware walkthrough is a low-cost technique that can identify collaboration-specific usability problems and can find problems that would not be revealed through other inspection methods
