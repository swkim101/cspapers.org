Computational phylogenetics has been shown to be effective over grammatical characteristics. Recent work suggests that constraintbased formalisms are compatible with such an approach (Eden, 2013). In this paper, we report on simulations to determine how useful constraint-based formalisms are in phylogenetic research and under what conditions.
