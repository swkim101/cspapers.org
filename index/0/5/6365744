In this paper we consider the classic scheduling problem of minimizing total weighted completion time on unrelated machines when jobs have release times, i.e, R|rij| Σj wjCj using the three-field notation. For this problem, a 2-approximation is known based on a novel convex programming (J. ACM 2001 by Skutella). It has been a long standing open problem if one can improve upon this 2-approximation (Open Problem 8 in J. of Sched. 1999 by Schuurman and Woeginger). We answer this question in the affirmative by giving a 1.8786-approximation. We achieve this via a surprisingly simple linear programming, but a novel rounding algorithm and analysis. A key ingredient of our algorithm is the use of random offsets sampled from non-uniform distributions. We also consider the preemptive version of the problem, i.e, R|rij, pmtn|ΣjwjCj. We again use the idea of sampling offsets from non-uniform distributions to give the first better than 2-approximation for this problem. This improvement also requires use of a configuration LP with variables for each job's complete schedules along with more careful analysis. For both non-preemptive and preemptive versions, we break the approximation barrier of 2 for the first time.
