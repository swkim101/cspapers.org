We present a method to compress relations close to their entropy while still allowing efficient queries. Column values are encoded into variable length codes to exploit skew in their frequencies. The codes in each tuple are concatenated and the resulting tuplecodes are sorted and delta-coded to exploit the lack of ordering in a relation. Correlation is exploited either by co-coding correlated columns, or by using a sort order that leverages the correlation. We prove that this method leads to near-optimal compression (within 4.3 bits/tuple of entropy), and in practice, we obtain up to a 40 fold compression ratio on vertical partitions tuned for TPC-H queries.We also describe initial investigations into efficient querying over compressed data. We present a novel Huffman coding scheme, called segregated coding, that allows range and equality predicates on compressed data, without accessing the full dictionary. We also exploit the delta coding to speed up scans, by reusing computations performed on nearly identical records. Initial results from a prototype suggest that with these optimizations, we can efficiently scan, tokenize and apply predicates on compressed relations.
