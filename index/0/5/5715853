The objective of the work described is to provide a software tool to assist real-time system specifiers and designers to predict, at an early stage of the development process, the timing behaviour of the system developed. The tool (simulation of real-time systems (SRT)) is used to model the timing aspects of a real-time system and then simulate the system to predict its behaviour.
