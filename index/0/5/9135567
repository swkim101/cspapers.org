Word embeddings have attracted a lot of attention. On social media, each user’s language use can be signiﬁcantly affected by the user’s friends. In this paper, we propose a socialized word embedding al-gorithm which can consider both user’s personal characteristics of language use and the user’s social relationship on social media. To incorporate personal characteristics, we propose to use a user vector to represent each user. Then for each user, the word embeddings are trained based on each user’s corpus by combining the global word vectors and local user vector. To incorporate social relationship, we add a regularization term to impose similarity between two friends. In this way, we can train the global word vectors and user vectors jointly. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we used the latest large-scale Yelp data to train our vectors, and designed several experiments to show how user vectors affect the results.
