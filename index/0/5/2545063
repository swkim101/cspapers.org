We address machine prediction of an individual’s label (private or public) for a given image. This problem is difﬁcult due to user subjectivity and in-adequate labeled examples to train individual, personalized models. It is also time and space consuming to train a classiﬁer for each user. We pro-pose a Group-Based Personalized Model for image privacy classiﬁcation in online social media sites, which learns a set of archetypical privacy models (groups), and associates a given user with one of these groups. Our system can be used to provide accurate “early warnings” with respect to a user’s privacy awareness level.
