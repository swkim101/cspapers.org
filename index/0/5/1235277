In this article we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of empirical research in software engineering. We argue that in order to improve the current situation we must create better studies and draw more credible interpretations from them. We finally present a roadmap for this improvement, which includes a general structure for software empirical studies and concrete steps for achieving these goals: designing better studies, collecting data more effectively, and involving others in our empirical enterprises.
