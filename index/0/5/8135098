We propose a generalized relational model for a temporal database which allows time stamping with respect to a Boolean algebra of multidimensional time stamps. The interplay between the various temporal dimensions is symmetric. As an application, a two dimensional model which allows objects with real world and transaction oriented time stamps is discussed. The two dimensional model can be used to query the past states of the database. It can also be used to give a precise classification of the errors and updates in a database, and is a promising approach for querying these errors and updates.
