Let <i>G</i> be a directed graph with weighted edges, embedded on a surface of genus <i>g</i>. We describe an algorithm to compute a shortest directed cycle in <i>G</i> in any given Z<sub>2</sub>-homology class in 2<sup><i>O</i>(<i>g</i>)</sup><i>n</i> log <i>n</i> time; this problem is NP-hard even for undirected graphs. We also present two applications of our algorithm. The first is an algorithm to compute a shortest non-separating directed cycle in <i>G</i> in 2<sup><i>O</i>(<i>g</i>)</sup><i>n</i> log <i>n</i> time, improving the recent algorithm of Cabello <i>et al</i>. [SOCG 2010] for all <i>g</i> = <i>o</i>(log <i>n</i>). The second is a combinatorial algorithm to compute minimum (<i>s, t</i>)-cuts in <i>undirected</i> surface graphs in 2<sup><i>O</i>(<i>g</i>)</sup><i>n</i> log <i>n</i> time, improving on previous combinatorial algorithms, and in particular the recent of Chambers <i>et al</i>. [SOCG 2009], for all <i>g</i> = <i>o</i>(log <i>n</i>). Unlike earlier algorithms for surface graphs that construct and search finite portions of the universal cover, our algorithms use another canonical covering space, called the Z<sub>2</sub>-<i>homology cover</i>.
