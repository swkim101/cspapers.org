This paper presents the results of a pilot experiment observ-ing the effect of tactile cues on vocabulary learning. Con-sidering that we generally memorize words by associating them with various cues, we designed a tactile cue presentation device that aids vocabulary learning by applying vibra-tions to the finger that is associated with the next key to press when typing on a keyboard. Experiments comparing tactile and visual cues indicated that tactile cues can signifi-cantly improve long-term retention of vocabulary after one week.
