Traversal recursion is a class of recursive queries where the evaluation of the query involves traversal of a graph or a tree. This limited type of recursion arises in many applications. In this report we investigate a simple file structure that efficiently supports traversal recursion over large, acyclic graphs. The nodes of the graph are sorted in topological order and stored in a B-tree. Hence, traversal of the graph can be done in a single scan. Nodes and edges can also be inserted, deleted, and modified efficiently.
