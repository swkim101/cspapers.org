Algorithms from several interesting application domains exhibit the property of inherent resilience to “errors” from extrinsic or intrinsic sources, offering entirely new avenues for performance and power optimization by relaxing the conventional requirement of exact (numerical or Boolean) equivalence between the specification and hardware implementation. We propose scalable effort hardware design as an approach to tap the reservoir of algorithmic resilience and translate it into highly efficient hardware implementations. The basic tenet of the scalable effort design approach is to identify mechanisms at each level of design abstraction (circuit, architecture and algorithm) that can be used to vary the computational effort expended towards generation of the correct (exact) result, and expose them as control knobs in the implementation. These scaling mechanisms can be utilized to achieve improved energy efficiency while maintaining an acceptable (and often, near identical) level of quality of the overall result. A second major tenet of the scalable effort design approach is that fully exploiting the potential of algorithmic resilience requires synergistic cross-layer optimization of scaling mechanisms identified at different levels of design abstraction. We have implemented an energy-efficient SVM classification chip based on the proposed scalable effort design approach. We present results from post-layout simulations and demonstrate that scalable effort hardware can achieve large energy reductions (1.2X-2.2X with no impact on classification accuracy, and 2.2X-4.1X with modest reductions in accuracy) across various sets. Our results also establish that cross-layer optimization leads to much improved energy vs. quality tradeoffs compared to each of the individual techniques.
