Many modeling techniques for embedded systems focus on events that occur in time and the causality relationships between them. Event-oriented modeling complements class-oriented, object-oriented, actor-oriented and state-oriented approaches. To facilitate event-oriented modeling, we have extended an older established model called event graphs to define new model of computation that we call Ptera (Ptolemy event relationship actors). Ptera is appropriate for modeling complex discrete-event systems. A key capability is that Ptera models conform with an actor abstract semantics that permits hierarchical composition with other models of computation such as discrete-event actors, dataflow, process networks and finite state machines. This enables their use in complex system design, where not every aspect of the system is best described with event-oriented modeling.
