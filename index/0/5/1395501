A combination of AIDA (the Adaptive Information Dispersal Algorithm) and pinwheel scheduling is proposed aa a solution to the problem of designing data access strategies in environments where (i) the data is frequently updated at a server, and needs to be made available to clients upon demand, (ii) the server-to-client bandwidth fax exceeds the bandwidth from any individual client back to the server, and (iii) timely retrieval of data is essential, even in the presence of transmission or other errors.
