Being able to comprehensively evaluate the individual strengths and weaknesses of worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis tools through benchmarking is essential for improving their accuracy. Unfortunately, a lack of knowledge about the detailed characteristics, actual complexities, and internal structures of existing benchmarks often prevents finegrained assessments, and sometimes even results in misleading conclusions. In this paper we present GENE, a tool that addresses these problems by automatically generating WCET benchmarks with known properties and predefined complexities. Due to the WCETs of benchmarks created by GENE being available, this approach for example makes it possible to precisely determine the accuracy of a WCET analyzer. In addition, the fact that GENE controls the program patterns of a benchmark enables fine-grained evaluations of the particular abilities and deficiencies of different WCET analyzers, as we demonstrate for aiT and PLATIN using multiple hardware platforms.
