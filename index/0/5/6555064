Rich's suggestion that the arcs of semantic nets be labelled so as to reflect confidence in the properties they represent is investigated in greater detail. If these confidences are thought of as ranges of acceptable probabilities, existing statistical methods can be used effectively to combine them. The framework developed also seems to be a natural one in which to describe higher levels of deduction, such as "reasoning about reasoning".
