A basic reasoning problem in dynamic systems is the projection problem: determine if a formula holds after a sequence of actions has been performed. In this paper, we propose a tractable solution to the projection problem in the presence of incomplete first-order knowledge and contextdependent actions. Our solution is based on a type of progression, that is, we progress the initial knowledge base (KB) wrt the action sequence and answer the query against the resulting KB. The form of reasoning we propose is always logically sound and is also logically complete when the query is in a certain normal form and the agent has complete knowledge about the context of any context-dependent actions.
