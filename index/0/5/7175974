Learning cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) is a widely studied problem in data stream summarization. While current techniques have efficient software implementations, their efficiency depends on updates to data structures that are not easily adapted to FPGA or ASIC implementation. In this work, we develop an algorithm and a compact hardware architecture for learning the CDF of a data stream and apply our technique to the problem of on-chip run-time testing for bias in the output of random number generators (RNGs). Unlike previous approaches, our method is successful regardless of the expected output distribution of the RNG under test.
