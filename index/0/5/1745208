We show that deterministic communication complexity can be super logarithmic in the partition number of the associated communication matrix. We also obtain near-optimal deterministic lower bounds for the Clique vs. Independent Set problem, which in particular yields new lower bounds for the log-rank conjecture. All these results follow from a simple adaptation of a communication-to-query simulation theorem of Raz and McKenzie (Combinatorica 1999) together with lower bounds for the analogous query complexity questions.
