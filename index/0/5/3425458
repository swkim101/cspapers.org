User authentication systems are at an impasse. The most ubiquitous method -- the password -- has numerous problems, including susceptibility to unintentional exposure via phishing and cross-site password reuse. Second-factor authentication schemes have the potential to increase security but face usability and deployability challenges. For example, conventional second-factor schemes change the user authentication experience. Furthermore, while more secure than passwords, second-factor schemes still fail to provide sufficient protection against (single-use) phishing attacks. We present PhoneAuth, a system intended to provide security assurances comparable to or greater than that of conventional two-factor authentication systems while offering the same authentication experience as traditional passwords alone. Our work leverages the following key insights. First, a user's personal device (eg a phone) can communicate directly with the user's computer (and hence the remote web server) without any interaction with the user. Second, it is possible to provide a layered approach to security, whereby a web server can enact different policies depending on whether or not the user's personal device is present. We describe and evaluate our server-side, Chromium web browser, and Android phone implementations of PhoneAuth.
