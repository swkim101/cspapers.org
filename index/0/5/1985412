A genetic algorithm (GA) for partitioning a hypergraph into two disjoint graphs of least ratio-cut is presented. Two notable features of this algorithm are: (i) a fast local optimizer, and (ii) a preprocessing step. Some supporting combinatorial arguments for the preprocessing heuristic are also provided. Experimental results on industrial benchmarks circuits are favorable when compared with recently published algorithms [25], [26], [19].
