This paper introduces to the calculus of regular expressions a replace operator and defines a set of replacement expressions that concisely encode alternate variations of the operation. Replace expressions denote regular relations, defined in terms of other regular expression operators. The basic case is unconditional obligatory replacement. We develop several versions of conditional replacement that allow the operation to be constrained by context.
