This paper demonstrates formal techniques useful in solving and reasoning about protocol conversion problems. A simple example problem is solved and the resulting conversion system is shown to have certain desired properties, using the projection paradigm. The example problem is representative of some real-world problems in that the protocols involved are similar in function, and even in structure, but have fundamental differences that render them incompatible in the absence of an active translation entity (protocol converter). The use of mappings, as well as images and inverse images of properties, in comparing semantics of protocols is discussed and illustrated.
