A landmark based heuristic is investigated for reducing query phase run-time of the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) motion planning method. The heuristic is generated by storing minimum spanning trees from a small number of vertices within the PRM graph and using these trees to approximate the cost of a shortest path between any two vertices of the graph. The intermediate step of preprocessing the graph increases the time and memory requirements of the classical motion planning technique in exchange for speeding up individual queries making the method advantageous in multi-query applications. This paper investigates these trade-offs on PRM graphs constructed in randomized environments as well as a practical manipulator simulation. We conclude that the method is preferable to Dijkstra's algorithm or the Aâˆ— algorithm with conventional heuristics in multi-query applications.
