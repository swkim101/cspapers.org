Distributed hash tables (DHTs) have been actively studied in literature and many different proposals have been made on how to organize peers in a DHT. However, very few DHT shave been implemented in real systems and deployed on alarge scale. One exception is <scp>KAD</scp>, a DHT based on Kademlia, which is part of eDonkey2000, a peer-to-peer file sharing system with several million simultaneous users. We have been crawling <scp>KAD</scp> continuously for about six months and obtained information about the total number of peers online and their geographical distribution.
 Peers are identified by the so called <scp>KAD</scp> ID, which was up to now assumed to remain the same across sessions. However, we observed that this is not the case: There is a large number of peers, in particular in China, that change their <scp>KAD</scp> ID, sometimes as frequently as after each session. This change of <scp>KAD</scp> IDs makes it difficult to characterize end-user availability or membership turnover.
