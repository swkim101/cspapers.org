In a session with live music and collaborative parody, we celebrate the long tradition of computing parody songs ("filks") and their potential to contribute to education and a fun environment in CS courses. We perform several new and classic CS filks, such as "Like it Called on Me (QuickSort)" [1], interspersing discussion of how and why these parodies were written. We also propose a song for the audience to parody and walk them through a structured small-group activity to help them brainstorm topics and lyrical phrases and fit them to the existing lyrics and music. Attendees should expect to laugh (and possibly cry) with the singing and to leave inspired to incorporate filks and other creative activities into their computing education practice: playing, performing, or writing songs themselves, and encouraging their students to do so as well.
