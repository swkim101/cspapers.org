This paper presents a ceiling mobile robot platform that enables multiple robots to move with low possibility of interference with humans and obstacles in an intelligent environment. An advantage of this platform is the potential to reduce sharing space between humans and robots while maintaining the robots' access to humans when their supports are needed. To realize the platform, two key techniques are developed. The first one is permanent magnet inductive traction method for the robots hanging under the ceiling plate. The second one is multiple robots simultaneous position measurement method using matrix of two dimensional codes. Validity of permanent magnet inductive traction method is confirmed by an experiment using a mock-up ceiling plate. Repeatability of position estimation using matrix of two dimensional codes is demonstrated by evaluation experiment. Finally as a demonstration of human support by the platform, transportation task is successfully performed.
