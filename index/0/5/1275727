The generic framework for formalising the subjective interestingness of patterns presented in [2] has already been applied to a number of data mining problems, including itemset (tile) mining [3, 8, 9], multi-relational pattern mining [18, 19, 20], clustering [10], and bi-clustering [12, 11]. Also, it has been pointed out without providing detail that also Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [7] can be derived from this framework [2]. This short note describes work-in-progress aiming to show in greater detail how this can be done. It also shows how the framework leads to a robust variant of PCA when used to formalise the subjective interestingness of a data projection for a user who expects outliers to be present in the data.
