The subject of this paper is a hybrid hip biped climbing robot. The hybrid hip provides both prismatic and revolute motion, discretely, to the robot, using a single actuator. This is intended to improve its adaptability in confined environments and its capability to maneuver over and around obstacles. Optimization of the hybrid hip relative to the robot size, weight, and actuation limits is considered while maximizing range of motion. The mechanical structure of the robot is discussed, as well as forward and inverse kinematics for motion planning. Workplace analysis indicates the hip provides an appreciable improvement in foot placement capability when compared to a purely prismatic or revolute hip movement.
