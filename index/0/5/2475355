FIT IoT-LAB's goal is to provide a very large scale open experimental testbed for the Internet of Things, by deploying more than 2700 experimentation nodes over 6 sites in France. Our demonstration purpose is to illustrate what the IoT-LAB platform offers through small applications involving radio communications and mobile nodes. Thanks to these examples, we will show how to run an experiment in the testbed and some of the tools it provides to help in developing, tuning and monitoring such large-scale applications.
