Query expansion has long been suggested as an effective way to resolve the short query and word mismatching problems. A number of query expansion methods have been proposed in traditional information retrieval. However, these previous methods do not take into account the specific characteristics of web searching; in particular, of the availability of large amount of user interaction information recorded in the web query logs. In this study, we propose a new method for query expansion based on query logs. The central idea is to extract probabilistic correlations between query terms and document terms by analyzing query logs. These correlations are then used to select high-quality expansion terms for new queries. The experimental results show that our log-based probabilistic query expansion method can greatly improve the search performance and has several advantages over other existing methods.
