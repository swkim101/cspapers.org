Finding quality descriptions on the web, such as those found in Wikipedia articles, of newer companies can be difﬁcult: search engines show many pages with varying relevance, while multi-document summarization algorithms ﬁnd it difﬁcult to distinguish between core facts and other information such as news stories. In this paper, we propose an entity-focused, hybrid generation approach to automatically produce descriptions of previously unseen companies, and show that it outperforms a strong summarization baseline.
