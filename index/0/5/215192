We present an algorithm for automatic detection of a large number of anthropometric landmarks on 3D faces. Our approach does not use texture and is completely shape based in order to detect landmarks that are morphologically significant. The proposed algorithm evolves level set curves with adaptive geometric speed functions to automatically extract effective seed points for dense correspondence. Correspondences are established by minimizing the bending energy between patches around seed points of given faces to those of a reference face. Given its hierarchical structure, our algorithm is capable of establishing thousands of correspondences between a large number of faces. Finally, a morphable model based on the dense corresponding points is fitted to an unseen query face for transfer of correspondences and hence automatic detection of landmarks. The proposed algorithm can detect any number of pre-defined landmarks including subtle landmarks that are even difficult to detect manually. Extensive experimental comparison on two benchmark databases containing 6, 507 scans shows that our algorithm outperforms six state of the art algorithms.
