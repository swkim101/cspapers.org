We address the problem of controlling a team of robots subject to constraints on relative positions. We adopt the general framework of leader-follower control in which a network of controllers is used to control the position and orientation of the team and its shape. We propose two improvements to this scheme. First, we introduce cooperative leader-following where the motion of a robot is determined not only by its leader, but also by other robots including their followers. Second, we allow constraints that are induced by limitations on ranges of sensors and wireless network cards. Our approach is based on potential field controllers for each robot and the on-line modification of these controllers to accommodate motion constraints induced by other robots in the group. We present experimental results with a team of three car-like robots equipped with omnidirectional cameras and 802.11b network cards.
