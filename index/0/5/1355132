The workshop on Multi-Language Object Models was organized to bring together experts from industry and academia who are using object-oriented techniques to achieve interoperability among application components that may be implemented in different programming languages, perhaps distributed across heterogeneous architectures. This workshop was motivated by the need for an open, but integrated, distributed computing environment and the desire for more effective reuse of software components implemented in different programming languages. The workshop sought to focus on object models that incorporate more features than the current “least common denominator” models and remain interoperable among different object-oriented languages. Of interest were both new and interesting design and implementation techniques (e.g., meta-object protocols, reflection, common run-time environment) for realizing these models as well as an examination of existing models that offer multilanguages object model features (e.g., SOM, COM).
