We show that the sparsest cut in graphs can be approximated within O(log2 n) factor in Õ(n3/2) time using polylogarithmic single commodity max-flow computations. Previous algorithms are based on multicommodity flows which take time Õ(n2). Our algorithm iteratively employs max-flow computations to embed an expander flow, thus providing a certificate of expansion. Our technique can also be extended to yield an O(log2 n) (pseudo) approximation algorithm for the edge-separator problem with a similar running time.
