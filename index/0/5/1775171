Computer Science is an evolving discipline. It continues to reinvent itself every 5-7 years. In order to keep up, Computer Science educators have had to continually modify the curriculum, either changing existing courses or introducing new ones. It is next to impossible for educators to keep abreast of all the developments in the discipline - learning a new area can place substantial demands on their time and effort.Therefore, this panel is intended as a quick introduction to some of the emerging areas and practices in Computer Science that deserve inclusion in the undergraduate curriculum. The panelists will present four new emerging areas - Grid Computing, Cybersecurity, Bioinformatics, and Robotics in the traditional Artificial Intelligence course. Each panelist will present a typical syllabus, list sample resources, and recount his/her experience developing the course. It is hoped that this panel will help interested faculty adopt successful practices.
