It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 8th ACM International Workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental evaluation & Characterization (WiNTECH 2013) hosted in Miami, Florida, USA. Similar to previous editions, WiNTECH workshop is serving as a major venue for bringing together researchers and practitioners working in the area of experimental wireless research. 
 
The call for papers this year attracted submissions from all over the world. The program committee did an excellent job in reviewing the papers, and we finally accepted 11 papers out 26 submissions. The papers in the program cover a variety of topics, including design and implementation of different wireless protocols (e.g., context-specific MAC, cooperative packet recovery, and mobile adaptive streaming), and evaluation and characterization of various wireless systems (e.g., 802.11n for drones, digital wireless channel emulator, video quality for mobile clients, low power wireless networks, and energy consumption monitoring.) The program also includes a keynote speech on "Spectrum Access from TV Bands to Millimeter Wave and Visible Light" by Edward Knightly from Rice University who is a world-renown researcher in the field of mobility and wireless systems. We conclude the workshop with the demo session, which has been an integral part of WiNTECH workshop over the years, including 8 exciting demos.
