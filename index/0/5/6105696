This paper extends the recent work proposed in [21]. In this work, it has been noted that three visual features (to control three degrees of freedom) obtained from the spherical projection of 3D spheres allows nice decoupling properties and global stability. However, even if such an approach is theoretically attractive, it is limited by a major practical issue since spherical objects have to be observed while only three degrees of freedom can be controlled. In this paper, we show that similar properties can be obtained by observing a set of points. The basic idea is to build a virtual 3D sphere from two 3D points and to analyse its related spherical projection. Furthermore, to control the six degrees of freedom a 2D 1/2 control scheme is proposed which allows us to fully decouple rotational motions from translational motions.
