Visual Analysis adds breadth to a computer graphics course by teaching students to compare and contrast the visual effects of rendering algorithms. Using slides to teach visual analysis minimizes the amount of required lecture time, and the interactive tool TERA facilitates further study outside of class. Visual analysis enhances depth as well as breadth of knowledge, because students become familiar with an algorithm's visual effect before they implement it.
