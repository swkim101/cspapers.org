Mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablet PCs, are becoming ubiquitous; it is increasingly popular for users to watch online streaming videos from their mobile devices. Because of the nature of wireless transmission, wireless routers (such as access points or base stations), they can get video transmissions from the video server and then send leads to several interested customers. In these videos, however, customers can be placed in different positions, and therefore they can deal with different wireless channels. In addition, customers may be interested in different video content, so different videos may have some popularity. Wireless heterogeneity and user interests make it difficult to break the bandwidth of wireless router video multicast. In this article, we propose a Utility-Based LayerEncoded Multicast Scheme, based on an instrument that takes into account the characteristics of the channels and heterogeneous users. The proposed approach that takes into account interests can improve the average visual quality to 9 db.
