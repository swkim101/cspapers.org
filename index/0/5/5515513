In this paper we present the UNRAVEL toolkit: It implements many of the recently published works on decipherment, including decipherment for deterministic ciphers like e.g. the ZODIAC-408 cipher and Part two of the BEALE ciphers, as well as decipherment of probabilistic ciphers and unsupervised training for machine translation. It also includes data and example configuration files so that the previously published experiments are easy to reproduce.
