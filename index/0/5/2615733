Active Networks provide a network infrastructure which can be programmed on a per-user or even a per-packet basis. While the flexibility of such systems is se ductive, the safety and security risks are greatly increased. Active network nodes must provide programmabil ity while respecting policy constraints of the network provider and protecting nodes and other users from f aulty applications. In addition, many modern applications demand Quality of Service guarantees which wi ll require exposing selected portions of the node resource management policy. As shared infrastructure, rel iability beyond that of general purpose computing systems is required. EROS (the Extremely Reliable Operating System) is an attrac tive andidate for resource management in an Active Network node. EROS is a pure capability system wh ich provides complete accountability for persistent, consumable and multiplexed resources. We have impl mented a prototype Active Network element on the EROS platform which provides the resource partitioni ng, quality of service, inter-client protection, and performance required of active networks. This paper presen ts the architecture, design and performance of this prototype, which is currently running on Intel x86 platform s.
