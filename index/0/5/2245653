This paper proposes a new formula protocol for distributed concurrency control, and specifies a staged grid architecture for highly scalable database management systems. The paper also describes novel implementation techniques of Rubato DB based on the proposed protocol and architecture. We have conducted extensive experiments which clearly show that Rubato DB is highly scalable with efficient performance under both TPC-C and YCSB benchmarks. Our paper verifies that the formula protocol and the staged grid architecture provide a satisfactory solution to one of the important challenges in the database systems: to develop a highly scalable database management system that supports various consistency levels from ACID to BASE.
