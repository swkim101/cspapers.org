The aim of this paper is to provide a sound framework for addressing a difficult problem: the automatic construction of an autonomous agent's modular architecture. We combine results from two apparently uncorrelated domains: Autonomous planning through Markov Decision Processes and a General Data Clustering Approach using a kernel-like method. Our fundamental idea is that the former is a good framework for addressing autonomy whereas the latter allows to tackle self-organizing problems.
