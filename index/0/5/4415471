We propose using the Successor Representation (SR) to accelerate learning in a constructive knowledge system based on General Value Functions (GVFs). In real-world settings, like robotics for unstructured and dynamic environments, it is impossible to model all meaningful aspects of a system and its environment by hand. Instead, robots must learn and adapt to changes in their environment and task, incrementally constructing models from their own experience. GVFs, taken from the field of reinforcement learning (RL), are a way of modeling the world as predictive questions. One approach to such models proposes a massive network of interconnected and interdependent GVFs, which are incrementally added over time. It is reasonable to expect that new, incrementally added predictions can be learned more swiftly if the learning process leverages knowledge gained from past experience. The SR provides a means of capturing regularities that can be reused across multiple GVFs by separating the dynamics of the world from the prediction targets. As a primary contribution of this work, we show that using the SR can improve sample efficiency and learning speed of GVFs in a continual learning setting where new predictions are incrementally added and learned over time. We analyze our approach in a grid-world and then demonstrate its potential on data from a physical robot arm.
