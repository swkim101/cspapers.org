We present feature transformations useful for exploratory data analysis or for pattern recognition. Transformations are learned from example data sets by maximizing the mutual information between transformed data and their class labels. We make use of Renyiâ€™s quadratic entropy, and we extend the work of Principe et al. to mutual information between continuous multidimensional variables and discrete-valued class labels.
