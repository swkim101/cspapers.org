The problem of processing shortest pa th queries in graphs arises in application areas such as intelligent t ranspor ta t ion system (ITS), geographic information system (GIS), and robotics. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithmic solution for processing shortest pa th queries in undirected planar graphs with non-negative edge weights. Previous algorithms for this problem on planar graphs all have a tradeoff between the query t ime and the da ta structure space used by the solutions. The previously best known trade-off on an n-vertex planar graph G in the worst case is O(v/-r) t ime for a pa th length query and O(v/-r + L) t ime for report ing an actual shortest path, with a da ta structure of O(n2/x/~) space, where r is an integer parameter with 1 < r _< n and L is the number of edges on the output shortest path. We present a new scheme, called frame search, that exploits the graph planari ty in a novel fashion. Wi th this scheme, we build an improved da ta structure of O(n + pv/-r + p2/r) space (in O(n + p2/v/~ + pr 3/4) time), where p is the minimum cardinality of a face-covering of the planar embedding of G with 1 < p < O(n), and r is an integer parameter with 1 < r < p. This da ta structure enables us to process each length query in O(v/-rlog r + a(n)) t ime and report an actual shortest path in an addit ional O(L) time, where a(n) is the inverse of Ackermann's function. In the worst case, our approach reduces the previously best query t ime by a factor of up to O(n 1/4) if the same amount of space is used. Our technique can also be applied to improve the previous query algorithms for some geometric shortest pa th problems on the plane.
