In the social tagging system, users annotate different web resources according to their need of future information organization and retrieval, and users also annotate resources with different types of tags, such as objective tag, subjective tag, self-organized tag and so on. Because every web resource has its own characteristics, the tag types of each web resource are different. According to the web resource, the quality of each tag type is different. We should depend on resource types to evaluate the quality of tag types, in order to provide efficient tag recommendation service and design better user tagging interfaces. In this paper, we firstly selected five web resources, namely the blog, book, image, music and video, to explore the tag types when annotating different resources. Then we chose specific resource and tags to explore the quality of each tag type according to these five web resources and study the relationship between tag type and quality. The conclusion is that the quality of tag types for different web resources is different.
