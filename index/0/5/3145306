Organizations conducting Electronic Commerce (e-commerce) can greatly benefit from the insight that data mining of transactional and clickstream data provides. Such insight helps not only to improve the electronic channel (e.g., a web site), but it is also a learning vehicle for the bigger organization conducting business at brick-and-mortar stores. The e-commerce site serves as an early alert system for emerging patterns and a laboratory for experimentation. For successful data mining, several ingredients are needed and e-commerce provides all the right ones (the Good). Web server logs, which are commonly used as the source of data for mining e-commerce data, were designed to debug web servers, and the data they provide is insufficient, requiring the use of heuristics to reconstruct events. Moreover, many events are never logged in web server logs, limiting the source of data for mining (the Bad). Many of the problems of dealing with web server log data can be resolved by properly architecting the e-commerce sites to generate data needed for mining. Even with a good architecture, however, there are challenging problems that remain hard to solve (the Ugly). Lessons and metrics based on mining real e-commerce data are presented.
