In a wireless sensor network of N nodes transmitting data to a single base station, possibly over multiple hops, what distributed mechanisms should be implemented in order to dynamically allocate fair and efficient transmission rates to each node? Our interferenceaware fair rate control (IFRC) detects incipient congestion at a node by monitoring the average queue length, communicates congestion state to exactly the set of potential interferers using a novel low-overhead congestion sharing mechanism, and converges to a fair and efficient rate using an AIMD control law. We evaluate IFRC extensively on a 40-node wireless sensor network testbed. IFRC achieves a fair and efficient rate allocation that is within 20-40% of the optimal fair rate allocation on some network topologies. Its rate adaptation mechanism is highly effective: we did not observe a single instance of queue overflow in our many experiments. Finally, IFRC can be extended easily to support situations where only a subset of the nodes transmit, where the network has multiple base stations, or where nodes are assigned different transmission weights.
