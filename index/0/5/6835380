We often hear about success stories in EDA. We are all justifiably proud of the impact we collectively make on the overall integrated circuit design and manufacturing machine. It is fair to say, however, the one learns far more from failure than one does from success. In this special session we found several brave practitioners who are willing to talk about problems in business-as-usual EDA. These problems include technology related issues; reliability related issues, power issues and even methodology issues - In short, covering a wide swatch of the EDA domain.
