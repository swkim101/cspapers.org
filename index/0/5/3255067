We construct PCPs with strong zero(cid:0)knowledge properties(cid:1) First(cid:2) we construct polynomi(cid:0) ally bounded (cid:3)in size(cid:4) PCP(cid:5)s for NP which can be checked using poly(cid:0)logarithmic queries(cid:2) with polynomially low error(cid:2) yet are statistical zero(cid:0)knowledge against an adversary that makes U arbitrary queries(cid:2) where U can be set to any polynomial(cid:1) Second(cid:2) we construct PCPs for NEXPTIME that can be checked using polynomially many queries(cid:2) yet are statistically zero(cid:0)knowledge against any polynomially bounded adversary(cid:1) These PCPs are exponential in size and have exponentially low error(cid:1) Previously(cid:2) it was only known how to construct zero(cid:0)knowledge PCPs with a constant error probability(cid:1) In the course of constructing these PCP(cid:5)s we abstract a tool we call locking systems (cid:1) We provide the de(cid:6)nition and also a locking system with very e(cid:7)cient parameters(cid:1) This mechanism may be useful in other settings as well(cid:1) (cid:0)
