In this paper we specify five abstract algorithms for the parallel execution of production systems on the DADO machine. Each algorithm is designed to capture the inherent parallelism in a variety of different production system programs. Ongoing research aims to substantiate our conclusions by empirically evaluating the performance of each algorithm on the DAD02 prototype, presently under construction at Columbia University.
