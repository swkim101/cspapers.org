The difficulty of accessing information details while preserving context has generated many different focus-in-context techniques. A common limitation of focus-in-context techniques is their ability to work well at high magnification. We present a set of improvements that will make high magnification in context more feasible. We demonstrate new distortion functions that effectively integrate high magnification within its context. Finally, we show how lenses can be used on top of other lenses, effectively multiplying their magnification power in the same manner that a magnifying glass applied on top of another causes multiplicative magnification. The combined effect is to change feasible detail-in-context magnification factors from less than 8 to more than 40.
