In a recent paper [8], it was shown how tests for database application systems can be executed efficiently. The challenge was to control the state of the database during testing and to order the test runs in such a way that expensive reset operations that bring the database into the right state need to be executed as seldom as possible. This work extends that work so that test runs can be executed in parallel. The goal is to achieve linear speed-up and/or exploit the available resources as well as possible. This problem is challenging because parallel testing can involve interference between the execution of concurrent test runs.
