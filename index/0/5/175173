From May to October 1985 members of the Undersea Systems Laboratory and the Computer Technology Research Laboratory of AT&T Bell Laboratories worked together to apply the executable specification language PAISLey to requirements for the “SL” communications system. This paper describes our experiences and answers three questions based on the results of the experiment: Can SL requirements be specified formally in PAISLey? Can members of the SL project learn to read and write specifications in PAISLey? How would the use of PAISLey affect the productivity of the software-development team and the quality of the resulting software?
