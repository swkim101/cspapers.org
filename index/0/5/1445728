A survey of business schools accredited by the Assembly of American Collegiate Schools of Business has provided data on the hardware and software used in introductory database courses. Survey results show that the size computer used most often in the course is the microcomputer, followed in popularity by upper-end minicomputers. Relational database management software is used in preference over hierarchical and network DBMS.
