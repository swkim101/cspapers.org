Social media users who post bullying related tweets may later experience regret, potentially causing them to delete their posts. In this paper, we construct a corpus of bullying tweets and periodically check the existence of each tweet in order to infer if and when it becomes deleted. We then conduct exploratory analysis in order to isolate factors associated with deleted posts. Finally, we propose the construction of a regrettable posts predictor to warn users if a tweet might cause regret.
