We propose multi-precision similarity matching where the image is divided into a number of subblocks, each with its associated color histogram. We present experimental results showing that the spatial distribution information recorded by multiprecision color histograms helps to make similarity matching more precise. We also show that sub-image queries are much better supported with multi-precision color histograms. To minimize the overhead, we employ a filtering scheme based on the 3-dimensional average color vectors. We provide a formal result proving that filtering with multi-precision color histograms is complete. Finally, we develop a novel extendible hashing structure for indexing the average color vectors. We give experimental results showing that the proposed structure significantly outperforms the SR-tree.
