Many companies employ programmers who use traditional procedural methods for software design. A new approach, object-oriented design, which allows for easy extensibility and reuse of previous designs, has recently been developed (Wirfs-Brock, Wilkerson, & Wiener, 1990). Major claims are made about the benefits of object-oriented design (Gibson, 1990). However, anecdotal evidence indicates that people who know procedural design have difficulty learning object-oriented design. Unfortunately, the benefits of object-oriented design will be lost if programmers have problems switching paradigms.
