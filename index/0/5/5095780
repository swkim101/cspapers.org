In peer-to-peer inference systems, each peer can reason locally but also solicit some of its acquaintances, sharing part of its vocabulary. This paper studies both theoretically and experimentally the problem of computing proper prime implicates for propositional peer-to-peer systems, the global theory (union of all peer theories) of which is not known (as opposed to partition-based reasoning).
