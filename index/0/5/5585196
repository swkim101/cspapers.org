This paper describes JES, a Java Execution Simulator that allows users to explore how a Java program executes. This interactive simulator displays a representation of a Java program and animates the running of the program. Instructors can use JES to demonstrate how data is moved when variables are assigned, when parameters are passed, and when values are returned by a method. JES is useful for comparing how primitive and object values are manipulated. The simulator also demonstrates scope rules, object creation, inheritance and polymorphism. While the simulator only supports variables of type double and object and does not support conditionals or looping, it allows users to write general Java programs that might be used as examples in the first weeks of a CS 1 course. JES also has support for arrays of doubles and objects. The simulator is written in Java and can be run as an application or an applet. Support for the simulator includes a simple mechanism for quickly running the simulator on a program developed with a standard Java development system.
