Addresses issues in developing a coordination system for mobile robots in a hostile environment. Sharing a common representation of the environment improves the ability to plan future environment states. The multi-agent planning system (MAPS) is described that addresses these issues. Performance is examined in the highly dynamic robot soccer environment and demonstrates MAPS as a viable method of providing robot coordination.
