A haptic rendering system is proposed for a puncture task of a virtual vertebra model. To build a mesh model from medical images, Delaunay triangulation is applied and physical models are based on elasticity theory. Also, a redundant actuated 6 DOF parallel type haptic device is designed to display large force and to resolve the singularity problem of parallel type mechanisms. Haptic feeling of puncture task and the performance of the proposed haptic device are tested by two puncture task experiments.
