It has been suggested that far-eastern (predominantly Chinese and Japanese) and western reasoning styles differ greatly: Westerners focus on objects, whereas Easterners focus on fields of interaction. 2.Traditional forms of object-orientation seem to follow the western style of thought, in which individual entities are captured cleanly, while interactions between them are not: It has been widely noted that many software systems that involve dynamically interacting components can be complex to design and implement using a strictly object-oriented approach.Eastern reasoning style lends itself better to description of interactions between entities than does the Western style. Hence, we posit that programmers designing systems that involve complex interactions might benefit from a more eastern approach for their design.However, there are currently no eastern-style programming languages of which we are aware. So, we begin our exploration with the work presented in this paper, in which we interview Easterners about how they would describe a typical object-oriented scene, and then attempt to capture and distill their descriptions into the guidelines for a programming paradigm.
