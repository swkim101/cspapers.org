This paper presents the rst dynamic routing scheme for high-speed networks. The scheme is based on a hierarchical bubbles partition of the underlying communication graph. Dynamic routing schemes are ranked by their adaptability, i.e., the maximum number of sites to be updated upon a topology change. An advantage of our scheme is that it implies a small number of updates upon a topology change. In particular, for the case of a bounded degree network it is proved that our scheme is optimal in its adaptability by presenting a matching tight lower bound. Our bubble routing scheme is a combination of a distributed routing database, a routing strategy, and a routing database update. It is shown how to perform the routing database update on a dynamic network in a distributed manner.
