This paper attempts to use an off-the-shelf anaphora resolution (AR) system for Bengali. The language specific preprocessing modules of GuiTAR (v3.0.3) are identified and suitably designed for Bengali. Anaphora resolution module is also modified or replaced in order to realize different configurations of GuiTAR. Performance of each configuration is evaluated and experiment shows that the off-the-shelf AR system can be effectively used for Indic languages.
