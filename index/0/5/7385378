Programming-by-Example approaches allow users to transform data by simply entering the target data. However, current methods do not scale well to complicated examples, where there are many examples or the examples are long. In this paper, we present an approach that exploits the fact that users iteratively provide examples. It reuses the previous subprograms to improve the efficiency in generating new programs. We evaluated the approach with a variety of transformation scenarios. The results show that the approach significantly reduces the time used to generate the transformation programs, especially in complicated scenarios.
