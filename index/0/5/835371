The problem of learning functional logic programs from positive examples is addressed. We describe a system, called FILP, which asks existential queries to the user, and is able to learn multiple predicates and recursive clauses. We prove that the learned descriptions are correct in the sense that they are consistent with the given examples. Moreover, a correct solution is always found if it exists.
