Digital logic modeling system based on MODLAN -- the language for multilevel description and simulation has been presented in this paper. The basic language notions and concepts of structural, functional and behavioral descriptions are recapitulated. MODLAN short presentation has been illustrated with examples of digital elements description. Two problems of the system implementation have been dealt with; one is that of data base organization, and the other concerns a simulation algorithm with special emphasis being put on a scheduling procedure on a event list.
