The purpose of this paper is to investigate infinity-sample properties of risk minimization based multi-category classification methods. These methods can be considered as natural extensions to binary large margin classification. We establish conditions that guarantee the infinity-sample consistency of classifiers obtained in the risk minimization framework. Examples are provided for two specific forms of the general formulation, which extend a number of known methods. Using these examples, we show that some risk minimization formulations can also be used to obtain conditional probability estimates for the underlying problem. Such conditional probability information will be useful for statistical inferencing tasks beyond classification.
