We present three novel methods to facilitate one hand targeting at discomfort regions on a mobile touch screen using tilting gestures; TiltSlide, TiltReduction, and TiltCursor. We conducted a controlled user study to evaluate them in terms of their performance and user preferences by comparing them with other related methods, i.e. ThumbSpace, Edge Triggered with Extendible Cursor (ETEC), and Direct Touch (directly touching with a thumb). All three methods showed better performance than ThumbSpace in terms of speed and accuracy. Moreover, TiltReduction led users to require less thumb/grip movement than Direct Touch while showing comparable performance in speed and accuracy.
