 
 We propose a hybrid architecture for systematically computing robust visual explanation(s) encompassing hypothesis formation, belief revision, and default reasoning with video data. The architecture consists of two tightly integrated synergistic components: (1) (functional) answer set programming based abductive reasoning with space-time tracklets as native entities; and (2) a visual processing pipeline for detection based object tracking and motion analysis. We present the formal framework, its general implementation as a (declarative) method in answer set programming, and an example application and evaluation based on two diverse video datasets: the MOTChallenge benchmark developed by the vision community, and a recently developed Movie Dataset.
