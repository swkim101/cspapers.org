This paper introduces a novel link-based ranking algorithm based on a model of focused Web surfers. FocusedRank is described and compared to implementations of PageRank and Topic-Sensitive PageRank. We report a user study that measures the relevance and precision of each approach. FocusedRank gives superior relevancy over PageRank, while significantly reducing the computational complexity compared to the Topic-Senstivice PageRank.
