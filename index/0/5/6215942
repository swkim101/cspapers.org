Optimal bounds are presented for dynamic string searching. If the longest common prefix between a query key x and a currently stored string y is ℓ words, then finding the stored string lexicographically nearest to x takes optimal &THgr;(√log n/log log n + ℓ) time. Similarly, we can insert and delete strings from the stored set within this time bound. The space requirements is linear and the time bounds are worst-case.
