The modularity indicates a one-to-one mapping between functional concepts and physical components. It can allow us to generate more product varieties at lower costs. Functional concepts can be described by precise syntactic structures with functional terms. Different semantic measures can be used to evaluate the strength of the semantic link between two functional concepts from port ontology. In this paper, different methods of modularity based on ontology are first investigated. Secondly, the primitive concepts are presented based on port ontology by using natural language, and then their semantic synthesis is used to describe component ontology. The taxonomy of port-based ontology are built to map the component connections and interactions in order to build functional blocks. Next, propose an approach to computing semantic similarity by mapping terms to functional ontology and by examining their relationships based on port ontology language. Furthermore, several modules are partitioned on the basis of similarity measures. The process of module construction is described and its elements are related to the similarity values between concepts. Finally, a case is studied to show the efficiency of port ontology semantic similarity for modular concept generation.Â© 2009 ASME
