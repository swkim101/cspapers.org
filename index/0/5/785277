Query recommendation has been widely used in modern search engines. Recently, several context-aware methods have been proposed to improve the accuracy of recommendation by mining query sequence patterns from query sessions. However, the existing methods usually do not address the ambiguity of queries explicitly and often suffer from the sparsity of the training data. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware query recommendation approach by modeling the high-order relation between queries and clicks in query log, which captures users' latent search intents. Empirical experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline methods in providing high quality recommendations for ambiguous queries.
