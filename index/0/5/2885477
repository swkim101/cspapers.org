We propose a mechanism for the promotion of high-standards in commercial Artificial Intelligence products, namely an association of companies which would regulate their own membership using a code of practice and the precedents set by previous cases. Membership would provide some assurance of quality. We argue the benefits of such a mechanism, and discuss some of the details including the proposal of a code of practice. This paper is intended as a vehicle for discussion rather than as the presentation of a definitive solution.
