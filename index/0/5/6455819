In this paper, we provide an overview of the MSR-Bing Web Scale Speller Challenge of 2011. We describe the motivation and outline the algorithmic and engineering challenges posed by this activity. The design and the evaluation methods are also reviewed, and the online resources that will remain publicly available to the community are also described. The Challenge will culminate in a workshop after the time of the writing where the top prize winners will publish their approaches. The main findings and the lessons learned will be summarized and shared in the Industry Track presentation accompanying this paper.
