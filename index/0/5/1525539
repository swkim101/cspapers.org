This paper presents an algorithm that uses equivalence and membership queries to learn the class of <italic>k</italic>-term DNF formulas in time O(<italic>n</italic>â€¢2<supscrpt>o(<italic>k</italic>)</supscrpt>), where <italic>n</italic> is the number of input variables. This improves upon previous O(<italic>n<supscrpt>k</supscrpt></italic>) bounds and allows one to learn DNF of O(log <italic>n</italic>) terms in polynomial time. We present the algorithm in its most natural form as a randomized algorithm, and then show how recent derandomization techniques can be used to make it deterministic. The algorithm is an <italic>exact learning</italic> algorithm, but one where the equivalance query hypotheses and the final output are general (not necessarily <italic>k</italic>-term) DNF  formulas.
For the special case of 2-term DNF formulas, we give a simpler version of our algorithm that uses at most 4<italic>n</italic> + 2 total membership and equivalence queries.
