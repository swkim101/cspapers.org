This paper presents a graph-theoretic model of the acquisition of lexical syntactic representations. The representations the model learns are non-categorical or graded. We propose a new evaluation methodology of syntactic acquisition in the framework of exemplar theory. When applied to the CHILDES corpus, the evaluation shows that the model's graded syntactic representations perform better than previously proposed categorical representations.
