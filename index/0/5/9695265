This paper describes an ego-motion estimation method by integrating multiple scan matching results. The method considers both the uncertainty of scan matching results and that of estimated ego-motions, and not only estimates the latest ego-motion but also updates previous ego-motions. The estimation process is formulated as an iterative one using Kalman filter. We implement the method by using an omnidirectional stereo-based scan matching method. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
