This paper studies the effects of boosting in the context of different classification methods for text categorization, including Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a Rocchio-style classifier. We identify the inductive biases of each classifier and explore how boosting, as an error-driven resampling mechanism, reacts to those biases. Our experiments on the Reuters-21578 benchmark show that boosting is not effective in improving the performance of the base classifiers on common categories. However, the effect of boosting for rare categories varies across classifiers: for SVMs and Decision Trees, we achieved a 13-17% performance improvement in macro-averaged F1 measure, but did not obtain substantial improvement for the other two classifiers. This interesting finding of boosting on rare categories has not been reported before.
