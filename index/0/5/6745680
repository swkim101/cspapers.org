Inverse-depth parameterization can successfully deal with the feature initialization problem in monocular simultaneous localization and mapping applications. However, it is redundant, and when multiple landmarks are initialized from the same image, it fails to enforce the “common origin” constraint. The authors propose two new variants that addresses both of these issues. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves a better performance at a lower computational cost.
