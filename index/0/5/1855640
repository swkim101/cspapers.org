In this paper, we propose an approach for the extraction of the repeating patterns in music objects. A repeating pattern is a sequence of notes which appears more than once in a music object. It is one of the most important music features which can be used for both content-based retrieval of music data and music data analysis. We propose a data structure called correlative matrix and its associated algorithms for extracting all repeating patterns in a music object. Experiments are also performed and the results are analyzed to show the efficiency and the effectiveness of our approach.
