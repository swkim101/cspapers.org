For the analysis of images, a deeper urtderstanding of their intrinsic structure is required, This has been obtained for 20 images by meaiis of statistical analysis [15, 181. Here, "e aiialyze the relation beh>een local image structures (i.e., homogeneous, edge-like, cot-ner-like 01- texturelike structures) and the underlying local 30 structure, represented in term of continuous sii faces aiid different kinds of 30 discontinuities, using 30 range data "it12 the true color infornzation. We jind that lzoinogeneous image patches correspond to continuous surfaces, and discontinuities are mainly foi-nzed by edge-like 01- coi-ner-like structures. The I-esults ai-e discussed with regard to existing and potential computer vision applications and the assunzptions made by these applications.
