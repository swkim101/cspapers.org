In this paper we study authentication codes (A-codes) that are <italic>r</italic>-fold secure against spoofing. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for such codes and give a characterization of codes with a minimum number of encoding rules. We will show that if the source is uniform, A-codes that provide perfect protection against spoofing attack of order <italic>r</italic> are <italic>r</italic>-fold secure.
