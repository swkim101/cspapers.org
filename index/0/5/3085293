Image quality assessment (IQA) tries to estimate human perception based image visual quality in an objective manner. Existing approaches target this problem with or without reference images. For no-reference image quality assessment, there is no given reference image or any knowledge of the distortion type of the image. Previous approaches measure the image quality from signal level rather than semantic analysis. They typically depend on various features to represent local characteristic of an image. In this paper we propose a new no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA) framework based on semantic obviousness. We discover that semantic-level factors affect human perception of image quality. With such observation, we explore semantic obviousness as a metric to perceive objects of an image. We propose to extract two types of features, one to measure the semantic obviousness of the image and the other to discover local characteristic. Then the two kinds of features are combined for image quality estimation. The principles proposed in our approach can also be incorporated with many existing IQA algorithms to boost their performance. We evaluate our approach on the LIVE dataset. Our approach is demonstrated to be superior to the existing NR-IQA algorithms and comparable to the state-of-the-art full-reference IQA (FR-IQA) methods. Cross-dataset experiments show the generalization ability of our approach.
