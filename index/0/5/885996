The constantly growing amount of semiconductors in automotive systems increases the number of possible defect mechanisms, and therefore raises also the effort to maintain a sufficient level of quality and reliability. A promising solution to this problem is the on-line application of structural tests in key components, typically ECUs. In this work, an approach for the optimized integration of both Software-Based Self-Tests (SBST) and Built-In Self-Tests (BIST) into E/E architectures is presented. The approach integrates the execution of the tests non-intrusively, i. e., it (a) does not affect functional applications and (b) does not require costly changes in the communication schedules or additional communication overhead. Via design space exploration, optimized implementations with respect to multiple conflicting objectives, i. e., monetary costs, safety, test quality, and required execution time are derived.
