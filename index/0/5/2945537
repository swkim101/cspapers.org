Over the recent years, a new approach for obtaining a succinct approximate representation of <i>n</i>-dimensional vectors (or signals) has been discovered. For any signal <i>x</i>, the succinct representation of <i>x</i> is equal to <i>Ax</i>, where <i>A</i> is a carefully chosen <i>R</i> x <i>n</i> real matrix, <i>R</i> â‰ª <i>n.</i> Often, <i>A</i> is chosen at random from some distribution over <i>R</i> x <i>n</i> matrices. The vector <i>Ax</i> is often refered to as the <i>measurement vector</i> or a <i>sketch</i> of <i>x.</i> Although the dimension of <i>Ax</i> is much shorter than of <i>x</i>, it contains plenty of useful information about <i>x.</i>
