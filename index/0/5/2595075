An efficient variant of an optimal algorithm is presented, which, in the context of a large dynamic fulltext information retrieval system, reorganizes data that has been compressed by an on-the-fly compression method based on LZ77, into a more compact form, without changing the decoding procedure. The algorithm accelerates a known technique based on a reduction to a graph-theoretic problem, by reducing the size of the graph, without affecting the optimality of the solution. The new method can thus effectively improve any dictionary compression scheme using a static encoding method.
