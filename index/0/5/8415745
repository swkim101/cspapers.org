Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) produce large quantities of raw data from multiple sources, such as cameras, temperature or humidity sensors. We propose a network that uses the knowledge of domain experts that use the network, as well as previously sensed data, to classify incoming sensed data in near real-time. Using a field centre in Malaysia as a testbed, we are currently implementing a prototype network to classify images of animals that trigger wildlife cameras. Initial experiments to test the individual components of the network have yielded positive results and a prototype is planned for deployment in July of 2012.
