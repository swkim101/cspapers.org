This paper proposes a new actuator system using a movable pulley for a bio-mimetic system and wearable robot applications, which is able to store energy in advance and to release it in such a way to satisfy desired speed and force control performances, simultaneously. Since new actuator system consists of two motors (dual-motors), a movable pulley, and series spring connection for high speed/force operation characteristics, it is referred to as Dual-motor system using a Movable Pulley with a Series Elastic Actuator (DuMP-SEA) in this paper. Also, the proposed actuator system not only combines individual speed/force operation region of each motor, but also extends the combined operation region by using the energy stored in advance. Finally, we suggest the extended operation region (high speed and high force characteristics) obtained by using the DuMP-SEA through simulations and experiments.
