We have combined four industry standard technologies to create a flexible, modular and easily extensible virtual server environment for both distance and local students to use in our networking, security, and system administration classes. By combining the remote access technologies of Remote Desktop, the multi-user capabilities of Microsoft Terminal Services, the ability to share sessions of Remote Assistance, and the ability to manipulate virtual machines and virtual networks using VMWare Workstation, the Remote Laboratory Emulation System (RLES) allows students to conduct labs very similar to our local labs from either inside or outside our lab facility. While other people have been experimenting with various combinations of these technologies we have aggressively developed and implemented this system and feel that it has become a very important tool in our ability to cost-effectively provide computing infrastructure for local and distant students, and student and faculty research.
