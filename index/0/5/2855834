We present a 6-approximation algorithm for the minimum-cost k-node connected spanning sub graph problem, assuming that the number of nodes is at least k3(k-1)+k. We apply a combinatorial preprocessing, based on the Frank-Tardos algorithm for k-out connectivity, to transform any input into an instance such that the iterative rounding method gives a 2-approximation guarantee. This is the first constant-factor approximation algorithm even in the asymptotic setting of the problem, that is, the restriction to instances where the number of nodes is lower bounded by a function of k.
