KAL (Knowledge Acquisition Languaqe) is a language intended not for programming but for the expression of qualitative scientific knowledge. It is designed to accommodate both the semantic constructs most frequently found in scientific text (at present, excluding the description of change) and the knowledge storage and retrieval mechanisms of languages like CONNIVER, in which it may be implemented. Emphasis is placed on using "real" text, and in interacting with scientists (particularly biologists) to discover their particular needs. Though KAL is English-like, most natural languages could be substituted with no difficulty.
