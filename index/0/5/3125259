Activity streams have become prevalent on the web and are starting to emerge in enterprises. In this work, we present Streamz, a novel application that uses a faceted search approach to provide employees with advanced capabilities of search, navigation, attention management, and other types of analytics on top of an enterprise activity stream. We provide a detailed description of the Streamz tool as well as usage analysis based on user interface logs and interviews of active users.
