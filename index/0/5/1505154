In this paper, we describe the Minor in Bioinformatics that we created to better prepare students, especially women, in acquiring computational and programming skills. Our program was motivated by the fact that women are underrepresented in computer science and in other information technology-related fields. We aim to recruit biology undergraduates, who are more than 60% female, to the new cohort-based integrative interdisciplinary Minor in Bioinformatics program. By rooting this new computational program in biological concepts and questions, we plan to interest and educate biology students in computational methods, which can be applied to complex questions in the growing field of bioinformatics. We expect that the Minor in Bioinformatics program will serve as a general framework for establishing similar interdisciplinary programs at large institutions and small colleges.
