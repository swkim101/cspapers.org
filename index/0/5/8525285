In this paper we formulate the problem of timing analysis with known false sub graphs. This problem is important when we want the timing analysis system to take into account false path information that is supplied either by the user or by another program, and supply accurate timing information to optimization programs such as placement and wiring. We present an efficient algorithm for the problem.
