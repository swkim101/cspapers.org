This paper proposes a kinematic modeling method for a bio-inspired robotic fish based on single joint. Lagrangian function of freely swimming robotic fish is built based on a simplified geometric model. In order to build the kinematic model, the fluid force acting on the robotic fish is divided into three parts: the pressure on links, the approach stream pressure and the frictional force. By solving Lagrange's equation of the second kind and the fluid force, the movement of robotic fish is obtained. The robotic fish's motion, such as propelling and turning are simulated, and experiments are taken to verify the model.
