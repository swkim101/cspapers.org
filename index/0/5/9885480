A highly portable collection of programs and data will soon be available to researchers who study combinatorial algorithms and data structures. All files will be in the public domain, and usable with only one restriction: They must not be changed! A “change file” mechanism will allow local customization while the master files stay intact. The programs are intended to be interesting in themselves as examples of “literate programming.” Thus, the Stanford GraphBase can also be regarded as a collection of approximately 30 essays for programmers to enjoy reading, whether or not they are doing algorithmic research. The programs are written in CWEB, a combination of TI$ and C that is easy to use by anyone who knows those languages and easy to read by anyone familiar with the rudiments of C. (The CWEB system is itself portable and in the public domain.) Four program modules constitute the kernel of the GraphBase: GB-FLIP is a portable random number generator; GBGRAPH defines standard data structures for graphs and includes routines for storage allocation; GB-IO reads data files and makes sure they are uncorrupted; ,, GB-SORT is a portable sorting routine for 32bit keys in linked lists of nodes. All of the other programs rely on GB-GRAPH and some subset of the other three parts of the kernel. A dozen or so generator modules construct graphs that are of special interest in algorithmic studies. For example gb-basic contains 12 subroutines to produce standard graphs, such as the graphs of queen moves on d-dimensional rectangular boards with “wrap-around” on selected coordinates. Another generator module, GB-RAND, produces several varieties of random graphs. Each graph has a unique identifier that allows researchers all over the world to work with exactly the same graphs, even when those graphs are “random.” Repeatable experiments and standard benchmarks will therefore be possible and widely available.
