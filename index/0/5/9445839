This research reduces the energy consumption of mobile applications via cloud offloading, a technique for executing energy-intensive functionality in the cloud. The contributions of this research lie in addressing the inefficiencies of static offloading by exploiting dynamic offloading mechanisms (program transformation and middleware) configured through intuitive and expressive programming constructs.
