In this paper we address the problem of immediate translation of XPath+IR queries to relational database expressions and exert the benefits of using an intermediate algebra. Adding an intermediate algebra on the logical level of a database enables a level of abstraction from both query languages for IR in XML documents and the underlying relational storage. This paper proposes a region algebra that can be extended to support ranking operators in an elegant way while staying algebraic. Furthermore, region algebra operator properties provide a firm ground for query rewriting and optimization.
