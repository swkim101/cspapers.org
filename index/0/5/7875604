The primary objective of various data stream applications is to monitor the on-going variations of data elements newly generated in data streams, so that appropriate services can be delivered to users timely. Basically, such monitoring activities can be divided into three categories: instant event monitoring, frequent behavior monitoring and analytic OLAP measures monitoring. Several prototype systems for data streams have been introduced but they are designated to support only the operations of one or two categories. However, many real-world data stream applications often require mixed operations of the three categories. This demonstration introduces an Integrated Stream Execution Environment (i-SEE) that can support the mixed execution of the operations of the three categories seamlessly, so that an i-SEE system can provide the multifaceted analytic results of on-line data streams continuously for various emerging applications.
