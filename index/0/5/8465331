We describe an interactive system which supports the exploration of arguments generated from Bayesian networks. In particular, we consider key features which support interactive behaviour: (1) an attentional mechanism which updates the activation of concepts as the interaction progresses; (2) a set of exploratory responses; and (3) a set of probabilistic patterns and an Argument Grammar which support the generation of natural language arguments from Bayesian networks. A preliminary evaluation assesses the effect of our exploratory responses on user's beliefs.
