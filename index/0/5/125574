This paper presents a new approach to inductive learning that combines aspects of instancebased learning and rule induction in a single simple algorithm. The RISE system searches for rules in a specific-to-general fashion, starting with one rule per training example, and avoids some of the difficulties of separate-and-eonquer approaches by evaluating each proposed induction step globally, i e, through an efficient procedure that is equivalent to checking the accuracy of the rule set as a whole on every training example. Classification is performed using a best-match strategy, and reduces to nearest-neighbor if all generalizations of instances were rejected. An extensive empirical study shows that RISE consistently achieves higher accuracies than state-of-the-art representatives of its "parent" paradigms (PEBLS and CN2), and also outperforms a decision-tree learner (C4 5) in 13 out of 15 test domains (in 10 with 95% confidence).
