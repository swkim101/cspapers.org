Popular sparse estimation methods based on l1-relaxation, such as the Lasso and the Dantzig selector, require the knowledge of the variance of the noise in order to properly tune the regularization parameter. This constitutes a major obstacle in applying these methods in several frameworks--such as time series, random fields, inverse problems--for which the noise is rarely homoscedastic and its level is hard to know in advance. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the joint estimation of the conditional mean and the conditional variance in a high-dimensional (auto-) regression setting. An attractive feature of the proposed estimator is that it is efficiently computable even for very large scale problems by solving a second-order cone program (SOCP). We present theoretical analysis and numerical results assessing the performance of the proposed procedure.
