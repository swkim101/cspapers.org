This paper presents group key distribution techniques for large and dynamic groups over unreliable channels. The techniques proposed here are based on the self-healing key distribution methods (with revocation capability) recently developed by Staddon et al. [27]. By introducing a novel personal key distribution technique, this paper reduces (1) the communication overhead of personal key share distribution from O(t2log q) to O(tlogq), (2) the communication overhead of self-healing key distribution with t-revocation capability from O((mt2+tm)log q) to O(mtlog q), and (3) the storage overhead of the self-healing key distribution with $t$-revocation capability at each group member from O(m2log q) to O(mlogq), where $t$ is the maximum number of colluding group members, $m$ is the number of sessions, and $q$ is a prime number that is large enough to accommodate a cryptographic key. All these results are achieved without sacrificing the unconditional security of key distribution. In addition, this paper presents two techniques that allow trade-off between the broadcast size and the recoverability of lost session keys. These two methods further reduce the broadcast message size in situations where there are frequent but short-term disruptions of communication and where there are long-term but infrequent disruptions of communication, respectively.
