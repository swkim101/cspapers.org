Holonomic omnidirectional mobile robots are useful because of their high level of mobility in narrow or crowded areas, and omnidirectional robots equipped with normal tires are desired for their ability to surmount difference in level as well as their vibration suppression and ride comfort. A caster-drive mechanism using normal tires has been developed to realize a holonomic omnidiredctional robot, but some problems has remain. Here we describe effective systems to control the caster-drive wheels of an omnidirectional mobile robot. We propose a Differential-Drive Steering System (DDSS) using differential gearing to improve the operation ratio of motors. The DDSS generates driving and steering torque effectively from two motors. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed system is effective for holonomic omnidirectional mobile robots.
