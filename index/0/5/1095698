We present DaNaLIX, a prototype domain-adaptive natural language interface for querying XML. Our system is an extension of NaLIX, a generic natural language interface for querying XML. While retaining the portability of a purely generic system like NaLIX, DaNaLIX can exploit domain knowledge, whenever available, to its advantage for query translation. More importantly, in DaNaLIX such domain knowledge does not have to be pre-defined; instead it can be automatically obtained from the interactions between a user and the system. In this demonstration, we describe the overall architecture of DaNaLIX. We also demonstrate how a generic system like DaNaLIX can take advantage of domain knowledge to improve its usability and query translation accuracy. In addition, we show DaNaLIX still possesses the portability of a generic system by using data collections from three different domains. Finally, we present how domain knowledge can be obtained through user interactions in an automatic fashion.
