Qualitative reasoning about mereotopological relations has been extensively investigated, while more recently geometrical and spatio-temporal reasoning are gaining increasing attention. We propose to consider mathematical morphology operators as the inspiration for a new language and inference mechanism to reason about space. Interestingly, the proposed morpho-logic captures not only traditional mereotopological relations, but also notions of relative size and morphology. The proposed representational framework is a hybrid arrow logic theory for which we define a resolution calculus which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first such calculus for arrow logics.
