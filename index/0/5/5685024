In this work, we use foursquare check-ins to cluster users via topic modeling, a technique commonly used to classify text documents according to latent "themes". Here, however, the latent variables which group users can be thought of not as themes but rather as factors which drive check in behaviors, allowing for a qualitative understanding of influences on user check ins. Our model is agnostic of geo-spatial location, time, users' friends on social networking sites and the venue categories-we treat the existence of and intricate interactions between these factors as being latent, allowing them to emerge entirely from the data. We instantiate our model on data from New York and the San Francisco Bay Area and find evidence that the model is able to identify groups of people which are of different types (e.g. tourists), communities (e.g. users tightly clustered in space) and interests (e.g. people who enjoy athletics).
