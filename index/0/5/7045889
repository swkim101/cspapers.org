In this paper, we present a machine learning system for identifying non-referential it. Types of non-referential it are examined to determine relevant linguistic patterns. The patterns are incorporated as features in a machine learning system which performs a binary classification of it as referential or non-referential in a POS-tagged corpus. The selection of relevant, generalized patterns leads to a significant improvement in performance.
