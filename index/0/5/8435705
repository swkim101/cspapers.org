Summarization of intermediary query result sets plays an important role when users browse through digital library collections. Summarization enables users to quickly digest the results of their queries, and provides users with important information they can use to narrow their search interactively. Techniques from the field of data analysis may be applied to the problem of generating summaries of query results efficiently. Such techniques should permit the incorporation of classification hierarchies in order to provide powerful browsing environments for digital library users.
