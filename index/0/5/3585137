This Lightning Talk describes a current effort to create an online learning system to address the unique learning needs of under-served groups. To ensure success in the most challenging scenarios, our first project iteration targets United Sates migrant farm workers and their families. Our goal is to teach migrant farm worker parents and children computer programming. Central to our project is the introduction of a new learning delivery model, the LMS/Support Model. The primary components of the model are: 1) a learning management system, featuring an open source course on the Go Programming Language hosted on a corporate cloud service), 2) live tutoring support provided by bilingual volunteers, and 3) a solar-powered, mobile wi-fi network on school buses. We have created the first course iteration and have made initial contact with a few non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We seek to form an interdisciplinary cadre, with scientists from the following fields: computer science, sociology, psychology and political science. We also seek to interface our educational effort with established social service efforts of universities near a high concentration of migrant farm workers. Our model scales well and can be replicated nationally and internationally. Successful deployment of our model in its initial iteration will significantly impact the lives of tens of thousands of overlooked migrant farm worker families. More importantly, it will lay the foundation for changing the lives of millions of children and adults internationally. In our allotted five minutes, we will discuss project details, assessment instruments and our inspiration for the project.
