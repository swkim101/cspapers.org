Can we assign attitudes to a computer based on its beeps? If so, which kinds of beeps are perceived as specific attitudes, such as "disagreement", "hesitation" or "agreement"? To examine this issue, I carried out an experiment to observe how participants perceive or assign an attitude to a computer according to beeps of different durations and F0 contour's slopes. The results revealed that 1) beeps with increasing intonation regardless of duration were perceived by participants as "disagreement", 2) flat sounds with longer duration were interpreted as "hesitation", and 3) decreasing intonations with shorter duration were as "agreement."
