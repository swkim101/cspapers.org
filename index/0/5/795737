We present a technique for scrolling through documents that is simple to implement and requires no special hardware. This is accomplished by simulating a hardware scroll ring--a device that maps circular finger motion into vertical scrolling. The technique performs at least as well as a mouse wheel for medium and long distances, and is preferred by users. It can be particularly useful in portable devices where screen-space and space for peripherals is at a premium.
