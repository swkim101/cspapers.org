We propose LATR-lazy TLB coherence-a software-based TLB shootdown mechanism that can alleviate the overhead of the synchronous TLB shootdown mechanism in existing operating systems. By handling the TLB coherence in a lazy fashion, LATR can avoid expensive IPIs which are required for delivering a shootdown signal to remote cores, and the performance overhead of associated interrupt handlers. Therefore, virtual memory operations, such as free and page migration operations, can benefit significantly from LATR's mechanism. For example, LATR improves the latency of munmap() by 70.8% on a 2-socket machine, a widely used configuration in modern data centers. Real-world, performance-critical applications such as web servers can also benefit from LATR: without any application-level changes, LATR improves Apache by 59.9% compared to Linux, and by 37.9% compared to ABIS, a highly optimized, state-of-the-art TLB coherence technique.
