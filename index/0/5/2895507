Prompted by changes in the numbers and demographics of students enrolled and being retained in computer science, the Department of Computer Science at NC State University is revising its undergraduate curriculum to better meet the needs of its students, and increase student attraction and retention. One set of changes concerns introductory computer science courses (CS1). This paper reports on a study conducted to assess the impact of class size and active learning in our CS1 courses. We find that smaller classes with integrated laboratories improve both learning and retention, as well as satisfaction of the students. Among other benefits, we found retention rates in small classes to be about 20% better than large classes.
