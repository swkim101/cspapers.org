Programmable analog devices have emerged as a powerful computing substrate for performing complex neuromorphic and cytomorphic computations. We present Arco, a new solver that, given a dynamical system specification in the form of a set of differential equations, generates physically realizable configurations for programmable analog devices that are algebraically equivalent to the specified system. On a set of benchmarks from the biological domain, Arco generates configurations with 35 to 534 connections and 28 to 326 components in 1 to 54 minutes.
