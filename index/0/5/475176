This work proposes a novel respiration monitoring system using Doppler signal from a low-cost motion sensor and received signal strength (RSS) measurements from a wireless network. We present the ambiguity problem of the Doppler monitoring system. We find that RSS from a wireless network is complimentary to Doppler signal, and we propose to integrate Doppler with RSS to make respiration monitoring more robust. Our experimental results show that the respiration rate estimation is more accurate by sensor fusion of these two radio frequency (RF) sensing modalities.
