Bayou's anti-entropy protocol for update propagation between weakly consistent storage replicas is based on pair-wise communication, the propagation of write operations, and a set of ordering and closure constraints on the propagation of the writes. The simplicity of the design makes the protocol very flexible, thereby providing support for diverse networking environments and usage scenarios. It accommodates a variety of policies for when and where to propagate updates. It operates over diverse network topologies, including low-bandwidth links. It is incremental. It enables replica convergence, and updates can be propagated using floppy disks and similar transportable media. Moreover, the protocol handles replica creation and retirement in a light-weight manner. Each of these features is enabled by only one or two of the protocol's design choices, and can be independently incorporated in other systems. This paper presents the anti-entropy protocol in detail, describing the design decisions and resulting features.
