Software verification presents many challenges. One of these isproviding programmers with automated tool support for verification, another is providing specification support that captures common programming idioms. In this talk, I will discuss these two challenges, drawing from experience with building program verifiersfor Spec# and C. I will also give a demo of the Spec# programming system, which includes the automatic static program verifier Boogie.
