In this paper we describe three pointer-based join algorithms that are simple variants of the nested-loops, sort-merge, and hybrid-hash join algorithms used in relational database systems. Each join algorithm is described and an analysis is carried out to compare the performance of the pointer-based algorithms to their standard, non-pointer-based counterparts. The results of the analysis show that the pointer-based algorithms can provide significant performance gains in many situations. The results also show that the pointer-based nested-loops join algorithm, which is perhaps the most natural pointer-based join algorithm to consider using in an object-oriented database system, performs quite poorly on most medium to large joins.
