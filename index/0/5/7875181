This paper is concerned with building linguistic resources and statistical parsers for deep grammatical relation (GR) analysis of Chinese texts. A set of linguistic rules is defined to explore implicit phrase structural information and thus build high-quality GR annotations that are represented as general directed dependency graphs. The reliability of this linguistically-motivated GR extraction procedure is highlighted by manual evaluation. Based on the converted corpus, we study transition-based, datadriven models for GR parsing. We present a novel transition system which suits GR graphs better than existing systems. The key idea is to introduce a new type of transition that reorders top k elements in the memory module. Evaluation gauges how successful GR parsing for Chinese can be by applying datadriven models.
