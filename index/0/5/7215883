We prove a complexity classification theorem that classifies all counting constraint satisfaction problems (#CSP) over Boolean variables into exactly three classes: (1) Polynomial-time solvable; (2) #P-hard for general instances, but solvable in polynomial-time over planar structures; and (3) #P-hard over planar structures. The classification applies to all finite sets of complex-valued, not necessarily symmetric, constraint functions on Boolean variables. It is shown that Valiant's holographic algorithm with matchgates is universal strategy for all problems in class (2).
