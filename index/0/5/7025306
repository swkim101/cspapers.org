His observations regarding the state of global affairs and the role of the individual in such matters have a intriguing parallel to the growth and maturation of object-oriented technology. the creation of new economic markets, and, ultimately, directly influence the quality of life for the individual. The second motor of history is the individual's struggle for recognition. This innate drive for significance and meaning in the presence of a much larger and potentially dehumanizing society causes individuals to fight for human dignity, to rise above their current conditions, and in the process, change themselves and often change the nature of the social institutions around them.

First, there is the logic and direction of modem science. Scientific inquiry is a rational process whose resulting knowledge is cumulative and, ultimately, irreversible (although some knowledge may be " lost, " the underlying truths upon which this knowledge is founded persist, leading to their eventual " rediscovery "). The fruits of science greatly affect the distribution and efficient use of scarce human and natural resources, serve as a tool for governments (particularly, as a means of affecting the outcome of military actions), permit Fukuyama observes that these two forces tend to drive even culturally disparate societies toward capitalist democracies2. Consider, for example, the rate at which free international markets and representative governments have been adopted during the past few decades. Today, democratic government is the dominant social structure, whereas in the 1700's, such structures were largely experimental Fukuyama speaks of this as marking the end of history, because it represents a logical, stable, and final social organizatiod.
