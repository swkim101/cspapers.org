We present a model of the firing of place and head-direction cells in rat hippocampus. The model can predict the response of individual cells and populations to parametric manipulations of both geometric (e.g. O'Keefe & Burgess, 1996) and orientational (Fenton et al., 2000a) cues, extending a previous geometric model (Hartley et al., 2000). It provides a functional description of how these cells' spatial responses are derived from the rat's environment and makes easily testable quantitative predictions. Consideration of the phenomenon of remapping (Muller & Kubie, 1987; Bostock et al., 1991) indicates that the model may also be consistent with non-parametric changes in firing, and provides constraints for its future development.
