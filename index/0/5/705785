P.I.A.N.O. aims to support learning to play piano with a steep learning curve. In order to achieve this, traditional, hard-to-learn music notation is substituted for an alternative representation of a composition, which is projected directly onto the piano. Furthermore, we propose three different learning modes which support the natural learning process, incorporate live feedback and performance evaluation, as well as the augmentation of the system with aspects of gamification to achieve early experiences of success and prolonged motivation.
