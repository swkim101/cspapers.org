We propose a syntactic filter for identifying non-coreferential pronoun-NP pairs within a sentence. The filter applies to the output of a Slot Grammar parser and is formulated in terms of the head-argument structures which the parser generates. It handles control and unbounded dependency constructions without empty categories or binding chains, by virtue of the unificational nature of the parser. The filter provides constraints for a discourse semantics system, reducing the search domain to which the inference rules of the system's anaphora resolution component apply.
