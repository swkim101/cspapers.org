In this paper, we propose the use of a neuro-fuzzy strategy to develop a Web personalization framework for the dynamic suggestion of URLs retained interesting for the currently connected users. In particular, a hybrid strategy exploiting the combination of the fuzzy logic with the neural paradigm is proposed in order to discover useful knowledge from session data identified from the analysis of log files and represent it in a set of fuzzy rules expressed in an interpretable form.
