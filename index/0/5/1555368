In this paper we are using the poset representation to describe the complex answers given by IR systems after a clustering and ranking processes. The answers considered may be given by cartographical representations or by thematic sub-lists of documents. The poset representation, with the graph theory and the relational representation opens many perspectives in the definition of new similarity measures capable of taking into account both the clustering and ranking processes. We present a general method for constructing new similarity measures and give several examples. These measures can be used for semi-ordered partitions; moreover, in the comparison of two sets of answers, the corresponding similarity indicator is an increasing function of the ranks of presentation of common answers.
