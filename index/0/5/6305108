The main result of this paper is a method that turns any almost sure sentence in the first order language of graphs into a deterministic polynomial space polynomial delay algorithm for listing the graphs that satisfy the sentence. (Our result is the first such method. ) Our work builds upon earlier work of Fagin. In particular, Fagin defined an infinite collection of combinatorial axioms and showed that for any fixed integer k almost every graph satisfies the k th axiom in his collection. Suppose that 0 is a sentence in the first order language of graphs. (For example, 0 might say “This graph does not have a triangle”, or “Every connected component of this graph is a clique”. ) Fagin has shown that for each such 19 there is an integer k such that either
