This paper presents the details of the new Commercial Data Masking Facility (CDMF) data privacy algorithm1. When implemented appropriately, products containing the CDMF algorithm can, in general, be freely exported from the United States. A short discussion of the requirements and rationale of the new algorithm is given.
This paper is an abbreviated version of a paper scheduled to be published in the March 1994 issue of the IBM Journal of Research and Development. The full paper will include a more extensive discussion of the requirements and rationale as well as a discussion of its strength under various threat scenarios and testcases to help ensure a correct implementation.
