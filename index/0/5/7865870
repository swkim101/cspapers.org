Conventional robotic rehabilitation devices for upper extremity are bulky, heavy or lack the ability to provide joint level rehabilitation. Some designs address these issues by replacing rigid links of the exoskeletons with light weight cables. However these designs are controlled in position mode instead of force control which is desirable for rehabilitation. In this paper, a 5 degree-of-freedom cable-driven upper arm exoskeleton, with control of force, is proposed. In this design, attachment points of cables on the arm are adjustable. The attachment points are optimized to achieve large workspace to perform activities of daily living. Simulation results of force field control for training and rehabilitation of the arm are presented. Experiments have been performed on a dummy robotic arm in the upper arm exoskeleton.
