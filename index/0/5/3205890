This paper presents an architecture for the generation of spoken monologues with contextually appropriate intonation. A two-tiered information structure representation is used in the high-level content planning and sentence planning stages of generation to produce efficient, coherent speech that makes certain discourse relationships, such as explicit contrasts, appropriately salient. The system is able to produce appropriate intonational patterns that cannot be generated by other systems which rely solely on word class and given/new distinctions.
