In the very near future complete households will be entirely networked as a de facto standard. In this poster we briefly describe our work in the area of domotics, where personalization, semantics and agent technology come together. We illustrate a home system oriented ontology and an intelligent agent based framework for the rapid development of home control and automation. The ever changing nature of the home, places the user in a position were he needs to be involved and become, through DoNet, a part of an ongoing home system optimization process.
