An approach for tight coupling of process models and software development tools — with the metaphor of component-based software development environments — supporting “eXecutable Process Models” (XPM) is presented. In this paper, we focus on the direction from the components of a software development environment towards the process models in order to automatically acquire process model information solving various drawbacks compared to a manual acquisition of this information. Requirements on a process modeling language for using this information are discussed.
