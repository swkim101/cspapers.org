The softassign quadratic assignment algorithm has recently emerged as an effective strategy for a variety of optimization problems in pattern recognition and combinatorial optimization. While the effectiveness of the algorithm was demonstrated in thousands of simulations, there was no known proof of convergence. Here, we provide a proof of convergence for the most general form of the algorithm.
