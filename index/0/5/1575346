InfiniBand has emerged as a new high bandwidth, low latency standard for high performance computing, but as a technology, is still focused on Layer 2 switching. Standards have not yet been defined for InfiniBand Layer 3 Routing, required for additional scalability, distance reach, security, and fault tolerance and isolation.The meeting will consist of:Product Leads from InfiniBand vendors discussing the unique requirements and advantages around InfiniBand routing.A Chance to Discuss potential direction and standards for InfiniBand routing, proactively soliciting input from real-world end users.An Opportunity for HPC researchers and end users to directly discuss how InfiniBand routing might be able to help optimize their infrastructure, and discuss 1:1 with leading InfiniBand technologists.
