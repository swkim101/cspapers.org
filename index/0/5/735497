In this paper, we introduce a new covariance based feature descriptor to be used on “colored” point clouds gathered by a mobile robot equipped with an RGB-D camera. Although many recent descriptors provide adequate results, there is not yet a clear consensus on how to best tackle “colored” point clouds. We present the notion of a covariance on RGB-D data. Covariances have not only been proven to be successful in image processing, but in other domains as well. Their main advantage is that they provide a compact and flexible description of point clouds. Our work is a first step towards demonstrating the usability of the concept of covariances in conjunction with RGB-D data. Experiments performed on an RGB-D database and compared to previous results show the increased performance of our method.
