Current modeling languages are based on the concepts taken from programming languages, leading to a poor mapping to an organizations' own domains and duplication of effort in problem solving, design and coding. Domain-specific languages allow faster development, based on models of the product rather than on models of the code. A domain-specific modeling language applies concepts and rules found in the domain. Together with generators and components it can automate a large portion of software production. Industrial applications of this approach show remarkable improvements in productivity: up to ten times faster. This poster describes a framework for implementing domain-specific visual modeling languages and summarizes industrial experiences from the use of domain-specific languages. The results of an OOPSLA workshop in this area will also be reported in this poster.
