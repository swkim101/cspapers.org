Using personal mobile devices for work gave rise to a trend called "bring your own device", or BYOD. BYOD brings a productivity boost for employees, but also headaches for employers: on the one hand, the business has a legitimate interest in monitoring the device, in order to prevent security breaches by employees; but on the other hand, employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy when they use their devices for private functions. This poster presents our project called Privacy-Preserving Accountability for peRsonal Devices (PriPARD, pronounced "prepared"). PriPARD addresses the tension described above by designing and evaluating concrete privacy mechanisms for mobile devices used in a corporate environment. Instead of imposing a "privacy firewall" between users and the Internet, in PriPARD the aim is protecting user privacy within the corporate network and non-disclosure outside this network. PriPARD's vision is to gather practical experience with the tradeoffs between monitoring and privacy needs, to help both mobile device users and managers of corporate networks.
