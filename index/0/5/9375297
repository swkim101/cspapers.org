Sustainability, defined by Penn State University as "the simultaneous pursuit of human health and happiness, environmental quality and economic well-being for current and future generations", is becoming a more frequent theme in colleges and universities. There is currently little published research involving the use of sustainability-themed modules or courses in Computer Science. As part of an institutional effort to integrate sustainability concepts into undergraduate courses, the author constructed a series of projects and activities to educate students about sustainability issues in three distinct CS1-style courses for non-majors. These projects and activities involve traditional introductory topics (e.g. loops, arrays) but each focuses a specific sustainability-related issue or domain. Examples of project issues included the impact of acid rain; the construction of an optimal planting schedule; the impact of air pollution; the benefits of trees on air quality; and the benefits of water catchment systems. These projects and activities included a discussion of the sustainability concept at hand while providing the student an opportunity to demonstrate his/her knowledge of the particular language and algorithmic concepts. Supporting efforts include the integration of speakers on sustainability topics and a parallel effort by undergraduate researchers to create graphics and animations for the project concepts. This poster will describe the results of the pilot study, the lessons learned, and future adjustments.
