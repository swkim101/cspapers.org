RECAL is a new recurrence relation for calculating the partition function and various queue length moments for closed, product form networks. In this paper we discuss a number of the issues involved in the software implementation of RECAL on both sequential computers and parallel, shared memory computers. After a brief description of RECAL, we describe software implementing RECAL on a sequential computer. In particular, we discuss the problems involved in indexing and data storage. Next we describe code implementing RECAL on a parallel, shared memory computer. Special attention is given to designing a special buffer for temporary data storage and several other important features of the parallel code. Finally, we touch on software for serial and parallel implementations of a tree algorithm for RECAL.
