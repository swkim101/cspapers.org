CPU-FPGA heterogeneous acceleration platforms have shown great potential for continued performance and energy efficiency improvement for modern data centers, and have captured great attention from both academia and industry. However, it is nontrivial for users to choose the right platform among various PCIe and QPI based CPU-FPGA platforms from different vendors. This paper aims to find out what microarchitectural characteristics affect the performance, and how. We conduct our quantitative comparison and in-depth analysis on two representative platforms: QPI-based Intel-Altera HARP with coherent shared memory, and PCIe-based Alpha Data board with private device memory. We provide multiple insights for both application developers and platform designers.
