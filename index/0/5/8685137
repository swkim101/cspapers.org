For years data mining techniques have been used to analyze data residing in relational databases. Accordingly, various database vendors found innovative ways to create forms of integration between the relational database and the data mining process. However, for the most part the data mining process was never a natural component of the relational model and applying data mining processes still requires significant understanding of a specialized data model and terminology. In this talk a framework for a unified data model for relational and data mining technologies will be offered and discussed. The framework uses relational concepts to define data mining models, train them and perform prediction queries on the data mining models all using standard SQL statements with a few natural extensions. The strong relational orientation of the framework makes it easy for database developers to adopt the data mining process and to create integrated relational-data mining applications. The framework is offered as an industry standard in the OLE DB for DM specification. The talk will be coupled with live demonstrations.
