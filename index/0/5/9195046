In this paper we present a technique for the propagation of bindings into disjunctive deductive databases. The optimization is based on the rewriting of the source program into a program which is equivalent to the original one under the possible semantics. In particular, the rewriting technique generates a program which is disjunctive with nested rules in the head, i.e., elements in the head may also be (special) rules. The proposed optimization reduces the size of the data relevant to answer the query and, consequently, (i) reduces the complexity of computing a single model and, more importantly, (ii) greatly *Work partially supported by a MURST grant under the project “Interdata”.Theauthorisalsosupportedby ISI-CNR.
