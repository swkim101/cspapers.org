We present a novel plane tracking algorithm based on the direct update of surface parameters from two stereo images. The plane tracking algorithm is posed as an optimization problem, and maintains an iteratively re-weighted least squares approximation of the plane's orientation using direct pixel measurements. To facilitate autonomous operation, we include an algorithm for robust detection of significant planes in the environment. The algorithms have been implemented in a robot navigation system.
