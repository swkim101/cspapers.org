We describe improvements to the use of semantic lexicons by a state-of-the-art query interpretation system powering a major search engine. We successfully compute concept label importance information for lexicon strings; lexicon augmentation with such information leads to a 6.4% precision increase on affected queries with no query coverage loss. Finally, lexicon filtering based on label importance leads to a 13% precision increase, but at the expense of query coverage.
