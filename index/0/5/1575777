In this paper we derive a formula for the moments of the residual life in operational context, and show that the Paradox of Residual Life holds also in a finite queueing model. In addition, we prove the renewal theorem, show that forward and backward times are independent, and state the memoryless property. As applications we point out how to derive Tak√†cs recurrence formula for the moments of the waiting time and how to base the Markovian state theory on this.
