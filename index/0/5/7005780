In this position paper we wish to propose and discuss several open research questions associated with the IoT. In particular, we wish to consider how crowdsourcing can be used as a scalable, reliable, and sustainable approach to support various computationally difficult and ambiguous tasks recognised in IoT research. We illustrate our work by examining a number of use cases related to healthcare and smart cities, and finally consider the future development of the IoT eco-system with respect to the socio-technical philosophy and implementation of the Web Observatory.
