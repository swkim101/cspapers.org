There are various antenna schemes which can be used to increase the throughput of the 4th mobile generation (4G) networks such as antenna diversity, beamforming, spatial multiplexing and MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) [1]. With the above antenna schemes OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) is a suitable selection for 4G. This paper proposes a multibeam antenna combining OFDMA for the next generation mobile communications. Analysis and simulation show that this kind of antenna is comparable to MIMO scheme and can be applied to 4G.
