A wish is "a desire or hope for something to happen." In December 2007, people from around the world offered up their wishes to be printed on confetti and dropped from the sky during the famous New Year's Eve "ball drop" in New York City's Times Square. We present an in-depth analysis of this collection of wishes. We then leverage this unique resource to conduct the first study on building general "wish detectors" for natural language text. Wish detection complements traditional sentiment analysis and is valuable for collecting business intelligence and insights into the world's wants and desires. We demonstrate the wish detectors' effectiveness on domains as diverse as consumer product reviews and online political discussions.
