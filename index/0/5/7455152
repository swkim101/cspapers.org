Recent progress of science and technology has made numerical simulation an important approach for studies in various fields. Although scalable and high performance numerical libraries on large scale computing resources are indispensable tools for handling various multiscale phenomena, few projects for integrating these numerical libraries have been reported. The object of this project is the development of a basic library of solutions and algorithms required for large scale scientific simulations, which have been developed separately in each fields, and its integration into a scalable software infrastructure. The components include a scalable iterative solvers library Lis, having a number of solvers, preconditioners, and matrix storage formats that are flexibly combinable, a fast Fourier transform library FFTSS for various superscalar architectures with SIMD instructions, which outperforms some vendor-provided FFT libraries, and a language- and computing environment-independent matrix computation framework SILC. We show some highlights of our achievements on leading high performance computers.
