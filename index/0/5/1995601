Noun phrases (NP) in a product review are always considered as the product attribute candidates in previous work. However, this method limits the recall of the product attribute extraction. We therefore propose a novel approach by generalizing syntactic structures of the product attributes with two strategies: intuitive heuristics and syntactic structure similarity. Experiments show that the proposed approach is effective.
