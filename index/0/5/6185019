iFind© (v1.0) is a web-based image retrieval system developed at Microsoft Research China. It provides the functionalities of text based image search, query by image example, and their combination. Images in the database are indexed by their lowlevel (visual) features, high-level (semantic) features (collected from image’s environment, e.g., the Web), and optionally, annotations if they are available. The key technology in the system is the integrated semantics and feature based image retrieval and relevance feedback approach and data mining of users’ feedback log. When the user provides feedback images, the system can refine the retrieval result based on the user’s feedback. In the meantime, the system updates the annotation of feedback images by increasing the linkage to the positive examples’ annotation and decreasing the linkage to the negative examples’ annotation. The updated annotation can further help to improve image retrieval results of the system in later use. Log mining can also help yield more accurate retrieval results by refining the semantic features. 2. Implementation
