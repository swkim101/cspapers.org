We argue that decidable classes of predicate logic combhted with efficient decision methods are a suitable basis for developing powerful knowledge representation languages. The paper presents some methods for developing such languages based on decidable classes. Queries can be answered and databases can be completed by using efficient dectilon refinements of the resolution method. Severaf decidable classes usable as new knowledge representation languages are presented, cent aining some well-known ones, like the base language ALC of KL-ONE type systems, along with the resolution-based inference engines.
