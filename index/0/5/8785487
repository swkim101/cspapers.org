This paper is a study on LRAAM-based (Labeling Recursive Auto-Associative Memory)classification of symbolic recursive structures encoding terms. The results reported here have been obtained by combining an LRAAM network with an analog perceptron. The approach used was to interleave the development of representations (unsupervised learning of the LRAAM) with the learning of the classification task. In this way, the representations are optimized with respect to the classification task. The intended applications of the approach described in this paper are hybrid (symbolic/connectionist) systems, where the connectionist part has to solve logic-oriented inductive learning tasks similar to the term-classification problems used in our experiments. These problems range from the detection of a specific subterm to the satisfaction of a specific unification pattern, and they can get a very satisfactory solution by our approach.
