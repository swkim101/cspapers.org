Multimedia and complex data are usually queried by similarity predicates. Whereas there are many works dealing with algorithms to answer basic similarity predicates, there are not generic algorithms able to efficiently handle similarity complex queries combining several basic similarity predicates. In this work we propose a simple and effective set of algorithms that can be combined to answer complex similarity queries, and a set of algebraic rules useful to rewrite similarity query expressions into an adequate format for those algorithms. Those rules and algorithms allow relational database management systems to turn complex queries into efficient query execution plans. We present experiments that highlight interesting scenarios. They show that the proposed algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than the traditional similarity algorithms. Moreover, they are linearly scalable considering the database size.
