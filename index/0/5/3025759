ListNet is a well-known listwise learning to rank model and has gained much attention in recent years. A particular problem of ListNet, however, is the high computation complexity in model training, mainly due to the large number of object permutations involved in computing the gradients. This paper proposes a stochastic ListNet approach which computes the gradient within a bounded permutation subset. It significantly reduces the computation complexity of model training and allows extension to Top-k models, which is impossible with the conventional implementation based on full-set permutations. Meanwhile, the new approach utilizes partial ranking information of human labels, which helps improve model quality. Our experiments demonstrated that the stochastic ListNet method indeed leads to better ranking performance and speeds up the model training remarkably.
