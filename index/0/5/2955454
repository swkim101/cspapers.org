Incremental hierarchical text document clustering algorithms are important in organizing documents generated from streaming on-line sources, such as, Newswire and Blogs. However, this is a relatively unexplored area in the text document clustering literature. Popular incremental hierarchical clustering algorithms, namely Cobweb and Classit, have not been widely used with text document data. We discuss why, in the current form, these algorithms are not suitable for text clustering and propose an alternative formulation that includes changes to the underlying distributional assumption of the algorithm in order to conform with the data. Both the original Classit algorithm and our proposed algorithm are evaluated using Reuters newswire articles and Ohsumed dataset.
