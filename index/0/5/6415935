Queries on digital libraries generally involve the retrieval of specific documents, but most techniques lack the ability to efficiently explore these collections. The integration of OLAP techniques with digital libraries allows users to navigate throughout these collections on multiple levels. In order to accomplish this, we propose the creation of OLAP networks, a complex data structure that contains summarized representations of the original collection of metadata to enrich traditional retrievals and allow the users to quickly explore the collection. We developed a system that enables OLAP-based exploration on the metadata of digital libraries through the use of a combination of efficient UDFs and optimized SQL queries. In addition, we also incorporated visualization methods into our system to allow fast navigation and exploration.
