We explore how research papers are shared in Twitter to understand its potential and limitation of the current practice that measures or predicts the scientific impact of research papers from the web. We track 54 second-level domains offering the top 100 journals listed in Google Scholar and collect 403,165 tweets sharing 75,677 unique research papers by 142,743 users over the course of 135 days. Our findings show the great potential of Twitter as a platform for paper sharing, but at the same time, indicate the limitations of measuring scientific impact through the lens of social media mainly due to the highly skewed and limited attention to few number of top journals.
