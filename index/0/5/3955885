An increasing number of applications are modeled and analyzed in network form, where nodes represent entities of interest and edges represent interactions or relationships between entities. Commonly, such relationship analysis tools assume homogeneity in both node type and edge type. Recent research has sought to redress the assumption of homogeneity and focused on mining heterogeneous information networks (HINs) where both nodes and edges can be of different types. Building on such efforts, in this work we articulate a novel approach for mining relationships across entities in such networks while accounting for user preference (prioritization) over relationship type and interestingness metric. We formalize the problem as a top-$k$ lightest paths problem, contextualized in a real-world communication network, and seek to find the $k$ most interesting path instances matching the preferred relationship type. Our solution, PROphetic HEuristic Algorithm for Path Searching (PRO-HEAPS), leverages a combination of novel graph preprocessing techniques, well designed heuristics and the venerable A* search algorithm. We run our algorithm on real-world large-scale graphs and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms a wide variety of baseline approaches with speedups as large as 100X. We also conduct a case study and demonstrate valuable applications of our algorithm.
