We develop a maximum entropy (maxent) approach to generating recommendations in the context of a user's current navigation stream, suitable for environments where data is sparse, high-dimensional, and dynamicâ€” conditions typical of many recommendation applications. We address sparsity and dimensionality reduction by first clustering items based on user access patterns so as to attempt to minimize the apriori probability that recommendations will cross cluster boundaries and then recommending only within clusters. We address the inherent dynamic nature of the problem by explicitly modeling the data as a time series; we show how this representational expressivity fits naturally into a maxent framework. We conduct experiments on data from ResearchIndex, a popular online repository of over 470,000 computer science documents. We show that our maxent formulation outperforms several competing algorithms in offline tests simulating the recommendation of documents to ResearchIndex users.
