The purpose of this paper is to give mathematical formulations for several basic problems arising in the assignment of gates to chips and to derive automated techniques using these models. In particular, the following three problems are considered. (a) The determination of the set of chips to be used to implement a given segment of logic. (b) The decomposition of the set of gates or elements into subsets, which are then assigned to chips, so as to minimize the number of long wires. (c) The assignment of the subsets determined in (b) to physically positioned chips to minimize the total wire length.
 The techniques described have been programmed in FORTRAN on the UNIVAC 1108. The many boards that have been processed indicate that the procedure is fast and yields very satisfactory results in terms of ultimate routability.
