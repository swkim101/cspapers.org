This paper describes the current state, and the ongoing developments, of the hard real-time motion control core, of the OROCOS project (Open Robot Control Software). This core is a component-based, distributed and configurable software framework. The presentation discusses both the design and the current implementation. The design separates the structure of the control system from its functionality. Its hard real-time core provides a generic control structure, with plug-in facilities for customization.
