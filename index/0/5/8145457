This paper presents the distributed robot control software architecture developed for the autonomous service robot Albert2. The development of this architecture is focused on two major issues: modularity and the integration of learning aspects. Each module within the architecture is presented, as well as the underlying event-based communication framework. An approach for integration of learning capabilities is proposed.
