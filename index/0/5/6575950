In this work, we introduce a new width notion that applies to non-deterministic conformant and contingent problems as well. We also develop a belief tracking algorithm for non-deterministic problems that is exponential in the problem width, analyze the width of non-deterministic benchmarks, compare the new notion to the previous one over deterministic problems, and present experimental results.
