We propose a new evolutionary method of extracting user preferences from examples shown to an automatic graph layout system. Using stochastic methods such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, automatic layout systems can find a good layout using an evaluation function which can calculate how good a given layout is. However, the evaluation function is usually not known beforehand, and it might vary from user to user. In our system, users show the system several pairs of good and bad layout examples, and the system infers the evaluation function from the examples using genetic programming technique. After the evaluation function evolves to reflect the preferences of the user, it is used as a general evaluation function for laying out graphs. The same technique can be used for a wide range of adaptive user interface systems.
