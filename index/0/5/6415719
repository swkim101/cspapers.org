This paper presents a new method for controlling legged robots during the multi support phase, where the robot may have hand contact with the walls, in addition of feet supported on ground. In our method, we consider the contact condition of each foot or hand separately by the locally defined ZMP. The locally defined ZMP are used to plain the robot motion and guaranty the stability. The proposed control algorithm is verified in the real hardware of prismatic joint biped robot. The experimental results show a good performance of the proposed control method.
