Emerging peer-to-peer computing provides new possibilities but also challenges for distributed applications. Despite their significant potential, current peer-to-peer networks lack efficient knowledge discovery and management. This paper addresses this deficiency and proposes the Intelligent File Sharing framework, which provides an effective and flexible query for P2P file sharing. The IFS is based on powerful schema and flexible inference, as well as efficiently integrated and extensible retrieval algorithms. Experimental results have provided evidence of the high performance and scalability of the Intelligent File Sharing (IFS) system in peer-to-peer environments.
