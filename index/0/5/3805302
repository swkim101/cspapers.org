The first part of this tutorial will examine the present "infrastructure" of MOS modeling for circuit simulation, with particular emphasis on how history has played a role at least as large as that of engineering. The viewpoint will be that of a circuit design "consumer" of MOS models who must make the best possible use of a badly flawed infrastructure. In recent years, the entire structure of MOS models has been evolving into continually more complicated and empirical forms, opening up a "reality gap" between a model's mathematical structure and circuit design usage.
