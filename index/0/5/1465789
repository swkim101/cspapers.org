In this paper we describe how the sales process of complex customizable products can be supported by an adaptive configurator interface. The task is to offer the appropriate choices to the customer in an adequate way of interaction. We illustrate our concepts with a short example from the domain of computer hardware configuration. Moreover, an architecture for an adaptive Web-based configurator is proposed.
