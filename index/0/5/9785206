We consider how to use external memory, such as disk storage, to improve the scalability of heuristic search in state-space graphs. To limit the number of slow disk I/O operations, we develop a new approach to duplicate detection in graph search that localizes memory references by partitioning the search graph based on an abstraction of the state space, and expanding the frontier nodes of the graph in an order that respects this partition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach both analytically and empirically.
