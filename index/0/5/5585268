Two problems of modelling intentions are identified: representing intentional and non-International (mechanical) actions in a single model consistently, and implementing a control structure that accounts for how intentional actions are initiated. These two problems stem from a common source: the interaction of intentional and nonintentional actions. We review a simulation model of cognitive and motivational processes based on a production system architecture that includes both types of actions. We then describe a meta system addition to the simulation model composed of nonintentional actions.
