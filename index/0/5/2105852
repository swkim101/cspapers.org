The brightness patterns in two successive image frames are used to recover the motion of a planar object without computing the optical flow as an intermediate step. Based on a least-squares formulation, a set of nine nonlinear equations are derived. A simple iterative scheme for solving these equations is presented. Using a selected example, it is shown that in general, the scheme may converge to cither of two possible solutions depending on the initial condition. Only in the special case where the translational motion vector is perpendicular to the surface does our algorithm converge to a unique solution.
