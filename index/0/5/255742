A zone diagram is a new variation of the classical notion of Voronoi diagram. Given points (sites) P 1 ,...,P n in the plane, each Pi is assigned a region R i , but in contrast to the ordinary Voronoi diagrams, the union of the R i has a nonempty complement, the neutral zone. The defining property is that each R i consists of all x ∈ R2 that lie closer (non-strictly) to P i . than to the union of all the other R j , j ≠ i. Thus, the zone diagram is defined implicitly, by a "fixed-point property," and neither its existence nor its uniqueness seem obvious. We establish existence using a general fixed-point result (a consequence of Schauder's theorem or Kakutani's theorem); this proof should generalize easily to related settings, say higher dimensions. Then we prove uniqueness of the zone diagram, as well as convergence of a natural iterative algorithm for computing it, by a geometric argument, which also relies on a result for the case of two sites in an earlier paper. Many challenging questions remain open.
