In the Discrepancy problem, we are given <i>M</i> sets {<i>S</i><sub>1</sub>,..., <i>S</i><sub><i>M</i></sub>} on <i>N</i> elements. Our goal is to find an assignment <i>χ</i> of {−1, + 1} values to elements, so as to minimize the maximum discrepancy max<sub><i>j</i></sub> | Σ<sub><i>iεSj</i></sub> <i>χ</i>(<i>i</i>)|. Recently, Bansal gave an efficient algorithm for achieving <i>O</i>(√<i>N</i>) discrepancy for any set system where <i>M</i> = <i>O</i>(<i>N</i>) [Ban10], giving a constructive version of Spencer's proof that the discrepancy of any set system is at most <i>O</i>(√<i>N</i>) for this range of <i>M</i> [Spe85].
 We show that from the perspective of computational efficiency, these results are tight for general set systems where <i>M</i> = <i>O</i>(<i>N</i>). Specifically, we show that it is NP-hard to distinguish between such set systems with discrepancy zero and those with discrepancy Ω(√<i>N</i>). This means that even if the optimal solution has discrepancy zero, we cannot hope to efficiently find a coloring with discrepancy <i>o</i>(√<i>N</i>). We also consider the hardness of the Discrepancy problem on sets with bounded shatter function, and show that the upper bounds due to Matoušek [Mat95] are tight for these sets systems as well.
 The hardness results in both settings are obtained from a common framework: we compose a family of high discrepancy set systems with set systems for which it is NP-hard to distinguish instances with discrepancy zero from instances in which a large number of the sets (i.e. constant fraction of the sets) have non-zero discrepancy. Our composition amplifies this zero versus non-zero gap.
