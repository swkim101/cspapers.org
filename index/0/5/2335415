In this paper we present the experimental results of a generic local appearance based face representation approach obtained from the first and fourth experiments of the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) version 1 data. The introduced representation approach is compared with the baseline system with the standard distance metrics of L1 norm, L2 norm and cosine angle. The experimental results show that the proposed local appearance based approach provides better and more stable results than the baseline system -holistic Eigenfaces- approach.
