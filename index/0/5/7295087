The area under the ROC curve (AUC) has been advocated as an evaluation criterion for the bipartite ranking problem. We study large deviation properties of the AUC; in particular, we derive a distribution-free large deviation bound for the AUC which serves to bound the expected accuracy of a ranking function in terms of its empirical AUC on an independent test sequence. A comparison of our result with a corresponding large deviation result for the classification error rate suggests that the test sample size required to obtain an ∊-accurate estimate of the expected accuracy of a ranking function with δ-confidence is larger than that required to obtain an ∊-accurate estimate of the expected error rate of a classification function with the same confidence. A simple application of the union bound allows the large deviation bound to be extended to learned ranking functions chosen from finite function classes.
