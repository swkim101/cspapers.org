Language-supported synchronization is a source of serious performance problems in many Java programs. Even single-threaded applications may spend up to half their time performing useless synchronization due to the thread-safe nature of the Java libraries. We solve this performance problem with a new algorithm that allows lock and unlock operations to be performed with only a few machine instructions in the most common cases. Our locks only require a partial word per object, and were implemented without increasing object size. We present measurements from our implementation in the JDK 1.1.2 for AIX, demonstrating speedups of up to a factor of 5 in micro-benchmarks and up to a factor of 1.7 in real programs.
