Virtualization has become an important technology that is used across many platforms, particularly servers, to increase utilization, multi-tenancy and security. Virtualization introduces additional overhead that often relates to memory management, interrupt handling and hypervisor mode switching. Among those, memory management and translation lookaside buffer (TLB) management have been shown to have a significant impact on the performance of systems. Two principal mechanisms for TLB management exist in today's systems, namely software and hardware managed TLBs. In this paper, we analyze and quantify the overhead of a pure software virtualization that is implemented over a software managed TLB. We then describe our design of hardware extensions to support virtualization in systems with software managed TLBs to remove the most dominant overheads. These extensions were implemented in the Power embedded A2 core, which is used in the PowerEN and in the Blue Gene/Q processors. They were used to implement a KVM port. We evaluate each of these hardware extensions to determine their overall contributions to performance and efficiency. Collectively these extensions demonstrate an average improvement of 232% over a pure software implementation.
