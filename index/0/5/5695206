In recent years, object-oriented (OO) views have been recognized as a powerful mechanism for customizing the structural as well as behavioral aspects of interfaces to object-oriented databases (OODBs) for diverse users. In this context, classification is concerned with the integration of virtual classes derived using an OO query into one unifying schema. Existing approaches either require the user to explicitly specify the relationship between a virtual class and existing base classes, or they relate a virtual class directly with its source class(es) or with the root of the schema. In this paper, we propose a solution to this classification problem that accomplishes the following goals: (1) generate maximally informative, and thus comprehensible, schemas that explicitly model the subclass relationships between base and virtual classes, and (2) support efficient type resolution for shared property functions by supporting upwards inheritance for both base and virtual classes. Correctness and complexity of the classification algorithm are also discussed.
