Through real-life experiments, it has been proved that spoofing is a practical threat to applications using the free civil service provided by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In this paper, we demonstrate a prototype that can verify the integrity of GNSS civil signals. By integrity we intuitively mean that civil signals originate from a GNSS satellite without having been artificially interfered with. Our prototype provides interfaces that can incorporate existing spoofing detection methods whose results are then combined into an overall evaluation of the signal's integrity, which we call integrity level. Considering the various security requirements from different applications, integrity levels can be calculated in many ways determined by their users. We also present an application scenario that deploys our prototype and offers a public central service -- localisation assurance certification. Through experiments, we successfully show that our prototype is not only effective but also efficient in practice.
