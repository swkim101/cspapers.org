When troubleshooting, finding components where changes in behavior occur only guides the search. In a misbehaving device, a correct component can indeed change its behavior. Distinguishing faulty components from correct ones requires modeling all possible correct behaviors of components. For analog circuits, there is a lack of numerical models and a lack of information on essentialparameters. Therefore, modeling becomes quickly the real trouble. Under the assumption that "a defect leads to significant change in the behavior of a device", we show that Qualitative Reasoning is a solution. To exploit the above assumption, order of magnitude reasoning is used for modeling and defining a strategy. Experience with the expert system DEDAIE has .shown that this assumption applies to a wide class of cases, and that Qualitative Reasoning can be used for a real size application .
