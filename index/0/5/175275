Recognition of tone and intonation is essential for speech recognition and language understanding. However, most approaches to this recognition task have relied upon extensive collections of manually tagged data obtained at substantial time and financial cost. In this paper, we explore two approaches to tone learning with substantially reductions in training data. We employ both unsupervised clustering and semi-supervised learning to recognize pitch accent in English and tones in Mandarin Chinese. In unsupervised Mandarin tone clustering experiments, we achieve 57-87% accuracy on materials ranging from broadcast news to clean lab speech. For English pitch accent in broadcast news materials, results reach 78%. In the semi-supervised framework, we achieve Mandarin tone recognition accuracies ranging from 70% for broadcast news speech to 94% for read speech, outperforming both Support Vector Machines (SVMs) trained on only the labeled data and the 25% most common class assignment level. These results indicate that the intrinsic structure of tone and pitch accent acoustics can be exploited to reduce the need for costly labeled training data for tone learning and recognition.
