Recent studies indicated that showing the similarity between the source code being developed and related high-level artifacts (HLAs), such as requirements, helps developers improve the quality of source code identifiers. In this paper, we present CodeTopics, an Eclipse plug-in that in addition to showing the similarity between source code and HLAs also highlights to what extent the code under development covers topics described in HLAs. Such views complement information derived by showing only the similarity between source code and HLAs helping (i) developers to identify functionality that are not implemented yet or (ii) newcomers to comprehend source code artifacts by showing them the topics that these artifacts relate to.
