This paper describes the use of the Microsoft Imagine Cup Software Design Invitational (SDI) as a way to overcome some of the issues related to traditional or "closed" style capstone projects. Problematic issues with traditional capstone projects, as identified by literature, are discussed in conjunction with how the SDI addresses them. The main premise is participation in the Imagine Cup SDI can address the issues faculty wrestle with as they attempt to provide students with the best possible learning experience. Additionally, the authors present some of the advantages and challenges that they have noted from personal experiences using SDI as a part of a capstone course.
