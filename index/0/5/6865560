The set of partially interdependent lexical and syntactic decisions that have to be made in the process of natural language generation are best seen as a complex planning and search problem. This paper discusses the phenomena involved in natural language generation planning and argues that a blackboard-type architecture with agenda-style control is more appropriate for this task than a sequential control architecture with backtracking. The blackboard architecture we describe is implemented in the language generator DIOGENES.
