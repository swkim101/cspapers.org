The increasing number of media façades is a prominent example of the digital augmentation of urban spaces. Many media façades cover most of the outer shell of a building and come with a 3D form factor. They offer great potential for remote interaction in which the interactive area goes beyond the parts of the façade that are visible from the user's current perspective. Common interaction techniques often focus on a fixed part of the media façade. This restricts exploiting the full capabilities and the potential of such gigantic screens. In this paper we describe how to apply cartographic map projections to create 2D map representations of media façades to address this problem. We describe how a continuous interaction with the media façade is possible, independent of the form factor. We analyze existing media façades and provide a set of guidelines for how to create façade maps for different form factors.
