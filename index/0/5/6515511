Supporting independent ISs and integrating them in distributed data warehouses (materialized views) is becoming more important with the growth of the WWW. However, views defined over autonomous ISs are susceptible to schema changes. In the <italic>EVE</italic> project we are developing techniques to support the maintenance of data warehouses defined over distributed <italic>dynamic</italic> ISs [5, 6, 7]. The <italic>EVE</italic> system is the first to allow views to survive <italic>schema changes</italic> of their underlying ISs while also adapting to changing data in those sources. <italic>EVE</italic> achieves this is two steps: applying view query rewriting algorithms that exploit information about alternative ISs and the information they contain, and incrementally adapting the view extent to the view definition changes. Those processes are referred to as <italic>view synchronization</italic> and <italic>view adaption</italic>, respectively. They increase the survivability of materialized views in changing environments and reduce the necessity of human interaction in system maintenance.
