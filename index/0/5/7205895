Edge and surface are two fundamental visual elements of an object. The majority of existing object proposal approaches utilize edge or edge-like cues to rank candidates, while we consider that the surface cue containing the 3D characteristic of objects should be captured effectively for proposals, which has been rarely discussed before. In this paper, an object-level proposal model is presented, which constructs an occlusion-based objectness taking the surface cue into account. Specifically, the better detection of occlusion edges is focused on to enrich the surface cue into proposals, namely, the occlusion-dominated fusion and normalization criterion are designed to obtain the approximately overall contour information, to enhance the occlusion edge map at utmost and thus boost proposals. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and MS COCO 2014 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves around 6% improvement on the average recall than Edge Boxes at 1000 proposals and also leads to a modest gain on the performance of object detection.
