We study the computational complexity of short sentences in Presburger arithmetic (SHORT-PA). Here by short we mean sentences with a bounded number of variables, quantifiers, inequalities and Boolean operations; the input consists only of the integer coefficients involved in the linear inequalities. We prove that satisfiability of SHORT-PA sentences with m+2 alternating quantifiers is SigmaP_m-complete or PiP_m-complete, when the first quantifier is exists or forall, respectively. Counting versions and restricted systems are also analyzed.
