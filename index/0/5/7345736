We address the problem of generating force-closed point contact grasps on complex surfaces and model it as a combinatorial optimization problem. Using a multilevel refinement metaheuristic, we maximize the quality of a grasp subject to a reachability constraint by recursively forming a hierarchy of increasingly coarser optimization problems. A grasp is initialized at the top of the hierarchy and then locally refined until convergence at each level. Our approach efficiently addresses the high dimensional problem of synthesizing stable point contact grasps while resulting in stable grasps from arbitrary initial configurations. Compared to a sampling-based approach, our method yields grasps with higher grasp quality. Empirical results are presented for a set of different objects. We investigate the number of levels in the hierarchy, the computational complexity, and the performance relative to a random sampling baseline approach.
