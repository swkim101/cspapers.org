Commercially available compilers, particularly those used for languages like ANSI C that have extensive commercial applicability, are not well-suited to students in introductory computer science courses because they assume a level of sophistication that beginning students do not possess. To alleviate this problem at Stanford, we have developed the Thetis programming environment designed specifically for student use. The system consists of a C interpreter and associated user interface that provides students with simple and easily understood editing, debugging, and visualization capabilities. Reactions of students and instructors indicate that Thetis fulfills the goals we set out to accomplish and provides a significantly better learning environment for students in CS1/CS2.
