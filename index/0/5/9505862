This paper describes how a technical computer science course was transformed into an intensive communication skills course without sacrificing the technical content of the course. By integrating this experience into existing technical courses, the acquired skills are specific to the CS context without requiring an additional course. The main contribution of this paper is a set of activities which are targeted to building communications skills required for successful research in computer science at any level, but also generally useful for computer science students entering careers not involving basic research. We describe the specific methods and tools implemented in a way to provide considerable support, guidance, and feedback to students without a large investment by the professor.
