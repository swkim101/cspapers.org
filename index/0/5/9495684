Since software applications increased rapidly in modern life, it is important to have enough reliability and minimizing the probability of faults in software products. Software testing is a process to finding faults in software products and increasing their reliability. Because testing process is very costly, automation techniques are need to reduce these costs and also, increase reliability. In automatic testing, an attempt is made to reduce human roles in testing process by converting the testing phases or part of them to performed by intelligent methods. Automatic testing has several advantages such as decrease testing time, resources and costs and on the other hand, increase quality and reliability. In this paper, after explaining software testing phases, a classification of existing automatic testing methods has shown. These methods can automate software testing phases or at least part of them with aim to reach above advantages. The aim of this classification is to show which technique can applied in which phase of software testing. The classification clarifies which problems must address in each phase before moving to next problems and how to automate each phase. Moreover, approaches for automating each testing phase have recommended.
