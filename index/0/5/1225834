Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) deployments are becoming increasingly popular in both industrial and consumer-oriented settings. To effectively exploit and operate such deployments, important challenges must be addressed, from managing RFID data streams to handling limitations in reader accuracy and coverage. Furthermore, deployments that support pervasive computing raise additional issues related to user acceptance and system utility. To better understand these challenges, we conducted a four-week study of a building-scale EPC Class-1 Generation-2 RFID deployment, the "RFID Ecosystem", with 47 readers (160 antennas) installed throughout an 8,000 square meter building. During the study, 67 participants having over 300 tags accessed the collected RFID data through applications including an object finder and a friend tracker and several tools for managing personal data. We found that our RFID deployment produces a very manageable amount of data overall, but with orders of magnitude difference among various participants and objects. We also find that the tag detection rates tend to be low with high variance across the type of tag, participant and object. Users need expert guidance to effectively mount their tags and are encouraged by compelling applications to wear tags more frequently. Finally, probabilistic modeling and inference techniques promise to enable more complex applications by smoothing over gaps and errors in the data, but must be applied with care as they add significant computational and storage overhead.
