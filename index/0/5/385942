We give the first O(l)-speed O(l) approximation polynomial-time algorithms for several nonpreemptive min-sum scheduling problems where jobs arrive over time and must be processed on one machine. More precisely, we give the first O(l)-speed O(l)-approximations for the non-preemptive scheduling problems; l|r<sub>j</sub>| Sigmaw<sub>j</sub>F<sub>j</sub> (weighted flow time), l |r<sub>j</sub>| SigmaT<sub>j</sub> (total tardiness), the broadcast version of 1 |r<sub>j</sub>| Sigmaw<sub>j</sub>F<sub>j</sub> , an O(I)-speed, 1-approximation for l |r<sub>j</sub>| Sigma U macr<sub>j</sub> (throughput maximization), and an O(l)-machine, O(l)-speed O(1)-approximation for l |r<sub>j</sub>| Sigmaw<sub>j</sub>T<sub>j</sub> (weighted tardiness). Our main contribution is an integer programming formulation whose relaxation is sufficiently close to the integer optimum, and which can be transformed to a schedule on a faster machine.
