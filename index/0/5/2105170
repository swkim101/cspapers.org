Social media services, such as Twitter, facilitate social interaction between friends providing a method to share of the information of their actions and states of mind. At times when emotions are running high, some people may benefit from the help of their friends. If people are aware of emotional states of their friends, they can start a conversation to understand why they feel like that and how to support them. I study on a new interaction method for the awareness of emotions and to manage the emotional states. This paper presents one part of my study that aims to help mobile users to interact offline with their friends when they need emotional support. Emotions of mobile users will be detected with the new emotion detection method in development.
