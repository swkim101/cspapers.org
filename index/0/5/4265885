This paper presents a new real-time collision avoidance approach for mobile robots. The nearness diagram method (ND) performs a high level information extraction and interpretation of the environment. Subsequently, this information is used to generate the motion commands. The proposed approach is well-suited to deal with unknown, unstructured and dynamic environments, where problems of other approaches are avoided. Some experimental results are shown using an holonomic mobile base to demonstrate the usefulness of the method.
