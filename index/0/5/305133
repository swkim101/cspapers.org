The challenges with privacy protection of time series are mainly due to the complex nature of the data and the queries performed on them. We study the anonymization of time series while trying to support complex queries, such as range and pattern similarity queries, on the published data. The conventional k-anonymity cannot effectively address this problem as it may suffer severe pattern loss. We propose a novel anonymization model called (k,P)-anonymity for pattern-rich time series. This model publishes both the attribute values and the patterns of time series in separate data forms. We demonstrate that our model can prevent linkage attacks on the published data while effectively support a wide variety of queries on the anonymized data. We also design an efficient algorithm for enforcing (k,P)-anonymity on time series data.
