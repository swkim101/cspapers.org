The skyrocketing complexities of SOC design have led to such design bottlenecks as iterations, poor scaling of tools, and inadequate computational power of desktop workstations and servers. At the same time, many organizations face long capital budgeting cycles for new hardware and software, and increased total cost of ownership (software, maintenance, integration, training, etc.) for their design capability. This panel addresses the “dot .com” phenomenon and its associated technology and infrastructure — e-services — which offer the promise of new design capabilities for chip designers and new business models for EDA companies. Issues include (1) for EDA, how will e-services transform sales channels, the push to interoperability, or how customer needs are addressed? (2) for ASIC vendors, will e-services change how end users design, and how vendors deploy their services? (3) for e-services providers and investors, what's real, what's the market, and how does this affect valuations and business strategy?
