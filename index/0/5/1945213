Due to its explicit modeling of the grammaticality of the output via target-side syntax, the string-to-tree model has been shown to be one of the most successful syntax-based translation models. However, a major limitation of this model is that it does not utilize any useful syntactic information on the source side. In this paper, we analyze the difficulties of incorporating source syntax in a string-to-tree model. We then propose a new way to use the source syntax in a fuzzy manner, both in source syntactic annotation and in rule matching. We further explore three algorithms in rule matching: 0-1 matching, likelihood matching, and deep similarity matching. Our method not only guarantees grammatical output with an explicit target tree, but also enables the system to choose the proper translation rules via fuzzy use of the source syntax. Our extensive experiments have shown significant improvements over the state-of-the-art string-to-tree system.
