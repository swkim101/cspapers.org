Software is becoming present in every aspect of our lives, pushing us inevitably towards a world of ambient computing systems. Multi-agent systems (MAS) are a prominent technology which facilitates modeling and development of large-scale distributed systems. In recent years, software engineering research has focused on methodologies and techniques for improving MAS design and implementation. However, making large MAS dependable is still an open issue. The Fifth Workshop on Software Engineering for Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems (SELMAS 2006) aims to bring together academic, industrial and commercial communities interested in agent-oriented software engineering topics to discuss the different technologies being defined and used in the development of dependable MAS.
