The Synchronous Dataflow Graph (SDFG) and Cyclo-Static Dataflow Graph (CSDFG) are two well-known models, used practically by industry for many years, and for which there is a large number of analysis techniques. Yet, basic problems such as the throughput computation or the liveness evaluation are not well solved, and their complexity is still unknown. In this paper, we propose K-Iter, an iterative algorithm based on K-periodic scheduling to compute the throughput of a CSDFG. By using this technique, we are able to compute in less than a minute the throughput of industry applications for which no result was available before.
