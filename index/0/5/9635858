We propose an integration of term proximity scoring into Okapi BM25. The relative retrieval effectiveness of our retrieval method, compared to pure BM25, varies from collection to collection.We present an experimental evaluation of our method and show that the gains achieved over BM25 as the size of the underlying text collection increases. We also show that for stemmed queries the impact of term proximity scoring is larger than for unstemmed queries.
