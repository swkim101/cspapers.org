CCITT Recommendation X.25 specifies an access protocol for the interface between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment for terminals operating in the packet mode on public data networks. The recommendation is written from the Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment's point of view. All of the internal implementation is left up to the designer.
 This paper describes some of the packet level issues that were encountered during the design and implementation of a packet switch; some solutions are given. Although some of these issues are general and pertain to other protocols, some are specific to Recommendation X.25. Issues covered are: what are the network actions when buffers are depleted; how is a permanent virtual circuit set up; what is done when the remote side of a permanent virtual circuit goes out of order; and what strategy should be taken for internal coupling of the network endpoints.
