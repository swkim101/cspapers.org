This paper investigates the general problem of efficiently performing key-value search at untrusted servers without loss of user privacy. Given key-value pairs from multiple owners that are stored across untrusted servers, how can a client efficiently search these pairs such that no server, on its own, can reconstruct the key-value pairs? We propose a system, called Peekaboo, that is applicable and practical to any type of key-value search while protecting both data owner privacy and client privacy. The main idea is to separate the key-value pairs across different servers. Supported by access control and user authentication, Peekaboo allows search to be performed by only authorized clients without reducing the level of user privacy.
