We introduce a novel cut-based debugging paradigm. It coordinates design emulation and simulation and enables fast transition from one to another. Emulation or functional implementation is used for fast application execution; simulation provides complete design observability and controllability. The implementation of the new debugging approach poses several CAD tasks. We formulate the optimization tasks and develop constraint-based heuristics to solve them. Effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a set of designs.
