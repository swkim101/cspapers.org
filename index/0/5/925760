This study is a comparison of three routing protocols proposed for wireless mobile ad-hoc networks. The protocols are: Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV), Ad-hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). Extensive simulations are made on a scenario where nodes moves randomly. Results are presented as a function of a novel mobility metric designed to reflect the relative speeds of the nodes in a scenario. Furthermore, three realistic scenarios are introduced to test the protocols in more specialized contexts. In most simulations the reactive protocols (AODV and DSR) performed significantly better than DSDV. At moderate traffic load DSR performed better than AODV for all tested mobility values, while AODV performed better than DSR at higher traffic loads. The latter is caused by the source routes in DSR data packets, which increase the load on the network. routers and hosts, thus a node may forward packets between other nodes as well as run user applications. Mobile ad-hoc networks have been the focus of many recent research and development efforts. Ad-hoc packet radio networks have so far mainly concerned military applications, where a decentralized network configuration is an operative advantage or even a necessity. Networks using ad-hoc configuration concepts can be used in many military applications, ranging from interconnected wireless access points to networks of wireless devices carried by individuals, e.g., digital maps, sensors attached to the body, voice communication, etc. Combinations of wide range and short range ad-hoc networks seek to provide robust, global coverage, even during adverse operating conditions.
