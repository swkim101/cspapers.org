WebMole is a browser-based tool that automatically and exhaustively explores all pages inside a web application. Contrarily to classical web crawlers, which only explore pages accessible through regular anchors, WebMole can find its way through Ajax applications that use JavaScript-triggered links, and handles state changes that do not involve a page reload. User-defined functions called oracles can be used to bound the range of pages explored by WebMole to specific parts of an application, as well as to evaluate Boolean test conditions on all visited pages. Overall, WebMole can prove a more flexible alternative to automated testing suites such as Selenium WebDriver.
