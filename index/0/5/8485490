This paper introduces a novel concept that enables transmitting wireless communication over CATV networks. We present the architecture of a system for Cellular Communication over CATV (CeTV) and review the required modifications to the cable network. These modifications affect only the cable network, thereby enabling the system to operate with unmodified cellular phones. In addition to improving in-building coverage, the CeTV system significantly increases the capacity of the cellular network. We also present the architecture of a Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) over CATV (Ca-Fi) system. The implementation of the Ca-Fi system requires improving the MAC protocol used by the Access Points that are deployed within the cable network. However, it does not require modifying the users' devices. We present a few alternative MAC protocols which aim at polling 802.11 stations using the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). These protocols deal with, and take advantage of the special characteristics of the CATV network. The performance of the proposed protocols is evaluated analytically and via simulation.
