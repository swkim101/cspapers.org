In this paper, we present a speech-driven second screen application for TV program discovery. We give an overview of the application and its architecture. We also present a user study along with a failure analysis. The results from the study are encouraging, and demonstrate our applicationâ€™s effectiveness in the target domain. We conclude with a discussion of follow-on efforts to further enhance our application.
