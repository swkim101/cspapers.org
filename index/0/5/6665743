In large multiagent games, partial observability, coordination, and credit assignment persistently plague attempts to design good learning algorithms. We provide a simple and efficient algorithm that in part uses a linear system to model the world from a single agent's limited perspective, and takes advantage of Kalman filtering to allow an agent to construct a good training signal and learn an effective policy.
