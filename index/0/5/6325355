The paper presents a novel 5 dofs (3T-2R) parallel mechanism. The mechanism is characterized by large singularity-free workspace and particularly large rotational capability which makes it suitable for 5 face-machining and similar applications. Having all its prismatic actuators along x direction, the x-motion is independent from other dofs-only limited by prismatic actuators' strokes-constituting another major advantageous feature. Besides, an analytical direct geometric model can be easily established which is a rare feature in parallel robots. The paper introduces the novel mechanism with its inverse and direct geometric models as well as its kinematic models (forward and inverse Jacobians). Also, it discusses its singularity analysis and presents sample workspace plots evaluated based on isotropic performance regarding velocity and static force.
