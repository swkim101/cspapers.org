The prevalence of multicore processors and virtualization technology enables parallel soft real-time applications to run in virtualized environment. However, current hypervisors do not provide adequate support for them because of soft real-time constraints and synchronization problems, which result in frequent deadline misses and serious performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel soft real-time scheduling algorithm which addresses them well, and implement a parallel soft real-time scheduler, named Poris, based on Xen. Our evaluation shows that Poris shortens the execution time of PARSEC benchmark by up to 44.12% compared to Credit scheduler.
