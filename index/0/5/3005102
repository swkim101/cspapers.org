We introduce an exceptionally simple gated recurrent neural network (RNN) that achieves performance comparable to well-known gated architectures, such as LSTMs and GRUs, on the word-level language modeling task. We prove that our model has simple, predicable and non-chaotic dynamics. This stands in stark contrast to more standard gated architectures, whose underlying dynamical systems exhibit chaotic behavior.
