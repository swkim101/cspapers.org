A knowledge based system for text understanding will incorporate both lexical and encyclopaedic information. The lexical information is the basis of the parsing process while the encyclopaedic information forms the target representation and is used in the knowledge acquisition process. This paper describes TWIG, a text understanding system where these two knowledge bases arc integrated into one representation. There is some theoretical justification for this and it has the advantage of reducing duplication of information in the system. This integration also has the advantage of making conceptual information available during the parsing process. Most of all this integration of diverse information forms a natural basis for a blackboard architecture.
