We present new algorithms to perform fast probabilistic collision queries between convex as well as non-convex objects. Our approach is applicable to general shapes, where one or more objects are represented using Gaussian probability distributions. We present a fast new algorithm for a pair of convex objects, and extend the approach to non-convex models using hierarchical representations. We highlight the performance of our algorithms with various convex and non-convex shapes on complex synthetic benchmarks and trajectory planning benchmarks for a 7-DOF Fetch robot arm.
