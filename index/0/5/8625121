Several recent efforts in statistical natural language understanding (NLU) have focused on generating clumps of English words from semantic meaning concepts (Miller et al., 1995; Levin and Pieracini, 1995; Epstein et al., 1996; Epstein, 1996). This paper extends the IBM Machine Translation Group's concept of fertility (Brown et al., 1993) to the generation of clumps for natural language understanding. The basic underlying intuition is that a single concept may be expressed in English as many disjoint clump of words. We present two fertility models which attempt to capture this phenomenon. The first is a Poisson model which leads to appealing computational simplicity. The second is a general nonparametric fertility model. The general model's parameters are boot-strapped from the Poisson model and updated by the EM algorithm. These fertility models can be used to impose clump fertility structure on top of preexisting clump generation models. Here, we present results for adding fertility structure to unigram, bigram, and headword clump generation models on ARPA's Air Travel Information Service (ATIS) domain.
