This work presents a method for deriving a gain scheduled balance controller to stabilize the gate of a three legged under-actuated robotic platform called THALeR (Tri-Pedal Hyper Altitudinal Legged Robot). The scheduler adapts the controller gains in real time based upon the system's instantaneous potential energy in order to create a smooth, stable gait. The final controller is simulated with white noise and impulse perturbations to show robustness.
