We consider the problem of planning in domains with continuous linear numeric change. Such change cannot always be adequately modelled by discretisation and is a key facet of many interesting problems. We show how a forward-chaining temporal planner can be extended to reason with actions with continuous linear effects. We extend a temporal planner to handle numeric values using linear programming. We show how linear continuous change can be integrated into the same linear program and we discuss how a temporal-numeric heuristic can be used to provide the search guidance necessary to underpin continuous planning. We present results to show that the approach can effectively handle duration-dependent change and numeric variables subject to continuous linear change.
