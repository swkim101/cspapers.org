In this paper we present a novel graph-based data abstraction for modeling the browsing behavior of web users. The objective is to identify users who discover interesting pages before others. We call these users early adopters. By tracking the browsing activity of early adopters we can identify new interesting pages early, and recommend these pages to similar users. We focus on news and blog pages, which are more dynamic in nature and more appropriate for recommendation. Our proposed model is called early-adopter graph. In this graph, nodes represent users and a directed arc between users u and v expresses the fact that u and v visit similar pages and, in particular, that user u tends to visit those pages before user v. The weight of the edge is the degree to which the temporal rule "v visits a page before v" holds. Based on the early-adopter graph, we build a recommendation system for news and blog pages, which outperforms other out-of-the-shelf recommendation systems based on collaborative filtering.
