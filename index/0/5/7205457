We describe an algorithm for embedding graphs on the torus (doughnut) which we implemented first in C, and then in C++. Although the algorithm is exponential in the worst case, it was very effective for indicating the small graphs which are torus obstructions. We have completed examination of the graphs on up to 10 vertices and the 11 vertex ones up to 24 edges, and of these 3884 are topological obstructions, and 2249 are also minor order obstructions. A cursory search of 12 and 13 vertex graphs resulted in several more. We purport that this approach has proved practical as it has permitted us to compile what we believe to be the biggest collection of torus obstructions in the world to date.
