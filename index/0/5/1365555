This paper presents ViAggre (Virtual Aggregation), a "configuration-only" approach to shrinking the routing table on routers. ViAggre does not require any changes to router software and routing protocols and can be deployed independently and autonomously by any ISP. ViAggre is effectively a scalability technique that allows an ISP to modify its internal routing such that individual routers in the ISP's network only maintain a part of the global routing table. 
 
We evaluate the application of ViAggre to a few tier- 1 and tier-2 ISPs and show that it can reduce the routing table on routers by an order of magnitude while imposing almost no traffic stretch and negligible load increase across the routers. We also deploy Virtual Aggregation on a testbed comprising of Cisco routers and benchmark this deployment. Finally, to understand and address concerns regarding the configuration overhead that our proposal entails, we implement a configuration tool that automates ViAggre configuration. While it remains to be seen whether most, if not all, of the management concerns can be eliminated through such automated tools, we believe that the simplicity of the proposal and its possible short-term impact on routing scalability suggest that it is an alternative worth considering.
