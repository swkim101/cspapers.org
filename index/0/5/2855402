Recently, hashing based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search has attracted much attention. Extensive new algorithms have been developed and successfully applied to different applications. However, two critical problems are rarely mentioned. First, in real-world applications, the data often comes in a streaming fashion but most of existing hashing methods are batch based models. Second, when the dataset becomes huge, it is almost impossible to load all the data into memory to train hashing models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to handle these two problems simultaneously based on the idea of data sketching. A sketch of one dataset preserves its major characters but with significantly smaller size. With a small size sketch, our method can learn hash functions in an online fashion, while needs rather low computational complexity and storage space. Extensive experiments on two large scale benchmarks and one synthetic dataset demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.
