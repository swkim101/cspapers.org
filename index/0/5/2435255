The combination of Java and the World Wide Web has opened up new opportunities for teaching at all levels. It is now possible to assume that all students in a class have access to the web through a browser that supports the Java language and a standard subset of the GUI API. One of the drawbacks of using Java through a browser is the lack of a standardized safe way for a Java applet to access resources on the local machine. Security measures prevent the applet from storing information generated by the applet on the local machine. The Jeli package contains a logging facility that allows an applet to store files either locally (if permitted) or on the server from which the applet was loaded. Jeli logging makes it significantly easier for instructors to develop applets that can permanently store information generated by user interaction with the application. The log can then be used by the student for study or the instructor for grading.
