In reallife clustering problems, the data in each view may haveconsiderable noise. However, existing clustering methods blindlycombine the information from multi-view data with possiblyconsiderable noise, which often degrades their performance. In thispaper, we propose a novel Markov chain method for RobustMulti-view Spectral Clustering (RMSC). Our method has a flavor oflow-rank and sparse decomposition, where we firstly construct atransition probability matrix from each single view, and then usethese matrices to recover a shared low-rank transition probabilitymatrix as a crucial input to the standard Markov chain methodfor clustering. The optimization problem of RMSC has a low-rankconstraint on the transition probability matrix, and simultaneouslya probabilistic simplex constraint on each of its rows. To solvethis challenging optimization problem, we propose an optimization procedurebased on the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier scheme. Experimentalresults on various real world datasets show that theproposed method has superior performance over severalstate-of-the-art methods for multi-view clustering.
