Local pattern mining is concerned with finding the set of patterns that satisfy a constraint in a database. We study local pattern mining in the context of ProbLog, a probabilistic Prolog system, and introduce an approach for finding correlated patterns in the form of queries in such a Prolog system. The approach combines principles of inductive logic programming, data mining and statistical relational learning. Experiments on a challenging biological network mining task provide evidence for the interestingness of the approach.
