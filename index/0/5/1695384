Series elastic actuators are frequently modeled using a conventional lumped mass model which has remained mostly unchanged since their introduction almost two decades ago. The lumped model has served well for early development but more descriptive models are now needed for new actuator designs and control approaches. In this paper we propose a new unlumped model specifically for linear series elastic actuators which uses a rack & pinion conceptualization to intuitively depict the mechanics of a linear ball screw drive. Results from hardware experiments are presented and compared to the predicted simulation results for both the conventional model and the new unlumped model. The results demonstrate that the new unlumped model is significantly more representative of the true actuator dynamics.
