Work in progress on JETS, the successor to PLANES, is described. JETS is a natural language question answering system that is intended to interface users to a large relational data base. The architecture is designed to extend the conceptual coverage of JETS to better meet the conversational and data base usage requirements of users. The implementation of JETS is designed to gain a high degree of closure over concept manipulation, contributing to a solution to the problems of perspicuity and scale. Specific examples are given of concept manipulation through the implied relationships of modification and of an approach to problem-solving through the use of frames.
