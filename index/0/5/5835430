Marion is a retargetable code generator system designed specifically for RISCS. Each code generator is built from a machine description that includes code selection and code scheduling information in a concise and readable format. The description language is designed to be easy to use, yet rich enough to support a broad range of RISCS. We have used Marion to produce code generators containing good instruction schedulers for the Motorola 88000, the MIPS R2000 and the Intel i860. Given this enabling technology, we have experimented with alternative architectures and different strategies for instruction scheduling and register allocation. This paper describes the Marion system and machine description language, with particular emphasis on instruction scheduling,
