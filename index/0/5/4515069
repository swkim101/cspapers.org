To save energy, wireless sensor networks often run in a low duty cycle mode, where the radios of sensor nodes are scheduled between ON and OFF states. For nodes to communicate with each other, Low Power Listening (LPL) and Low Power Probing (LPP) are two types of rendezvous mechanisms. Nodes with LPL or LPP rely on signal strength or probe packets to detect potential transmissions, and then keep the radio-on for communications. Unfortunately, in many cases, signal strength and probe packets are susceptible to interference, resulting in undesirable radio on time when the signal strength of interference is above a threshold or a probe packet is interfered. To address the issue, we propose ZiSense, an energy efficient rendezvous mechanism which is resilient to interference. Instead of checking the signal strength or decoding the probe packets, ZiSense detects the existence of ZigBee transmissions and wakes up nodes accordingly. On sensor nodes with limited information and resource, we carefully study and extract short-term features purely from the time-domain RSSI sequence, and design a rule-based approach to efficiently identify the existence of ZigBee. We theoretically analyze the benefit of ZiSense in different environments and implement a prototype in TinyOS with TelosB motes. We examine ZiSense performance under controlled interference and office environments. The evaluation results show that, compared with state-of-the-art rendezvous mechanisms, ZiSense significantly reduces the energy consumption.
