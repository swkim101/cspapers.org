For a directed graph <i>G</i> we consider queries of the form: "What is the shortest path distance from vertex <i>x</i> to vertex <i>y</i> in <i>G</i> avoiding a failed link (<i>u, v</i>), and what edge leaving <i>x</i> should we use to get on a such a shortest path?" We show that an oracle for such queries can be stored in <i>O</i>(<i>n<sup>2</sup></i> log <i>n</i>) space with a query time of <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>). No non-trivial solution was known for this problem.
