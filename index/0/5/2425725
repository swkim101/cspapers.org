We propose a method for semi-supervised training of structured-output neural networks. Inspired by the framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), we train a discriminator network to capture the notion of a quality of network output. To this end, we leverage the qualitative difference between outputs obtained on the labelled training data and unannotated data. We then use the discriminator as a source of error signal for unlabelled data. This effectively boosts the performance of a network on a held out test set. Initial experiments in image segmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework enables achieving the same network performance as in a fully supervised scenario, while using two times less annotations.
