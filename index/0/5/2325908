As CASE (computer-aided software engineering) technology begins to mature, there are more and more opportunities to integrate CASE into the computer science classroom. An undergraduate software engineering course taught at Bowling Green in the fall of 1989 was a pioneering attempt to use sophisticated and real-world CASE tools in a semester-long project. To assess the impact of the use of CASE on the studentsâ€™ attitudes, a questionnaire was distributed at completion of the project. In the specific example of undergraduate software engineering education, we found that CASE can be a significant enhancement. Student attitudes were positive and the quality of their work appeared to be better compared to the traditional course.
