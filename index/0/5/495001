This paper presents a tripartite model of dialogue in which three different kinds of actions are modeled: domain actions, problem-solving actions, and discourse or communicative actions. We contend that our process model provides a more finely differentiated representation of user intentions than previous models; enables the incremental recognition of communicative actions that cannot be recognized from a single utterance alone; and accounts for implicit acceptance of a communicated proposition.
