This paper explores the kinds of probabilistic relations that are important in syntactic disambiguation. It proposes that two widely used kinds of relations, lexical dependencies and structural relations, have complementary disambiguation capabilities. It presents a new model based on structural relations, the Tree-gram model, and reports experiments showing that structural relations should benefit from enrichment by lexical dependencies.
