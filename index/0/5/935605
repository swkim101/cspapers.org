The concept of combining loop invariants with algorithm analysis and design is a significant programming tool. However, teaching this concept is not easy. One way of motivating and supporting the introduction of such a concept, is by illustrating it with attractive examples. In this paper we describe how to illustrate it with mathematical games. In our description, we emphasize the links between heuristic search strategies, pattern exploration, induction, and invariant construction.
