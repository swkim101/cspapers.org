The widespread use of switching converters in many electronic systems for their high efficiency and smaller size makes the fundamental understanding of them a necessity for many electronic system design engineers. Unfortunately, learning the modeling and feedback controller design techniques of switching converter circuits are interesting but difficult, because they includes many areas of knowledge, e.g., the converter circuits and electronics, linear and nonlinear control system theory, and magnetics, etc. Teaching the dc-dc switching converters is a challenging undertaking because one cannot assume that all students enrolled in the class have solid prerequisite knowledge in so many areas. Therefore, to speed up the learning process, SIMULINK simulation modules of dc-dc hard-switching and resonant switching converters, and of ac-dc power factor correction switching rectifiers are devised in our laboratory to serve as teaching aids. They are also accurate and practical enough for students to validate both the transient and the steady-state responses of real switching converter circuits
