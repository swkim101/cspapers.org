In-hand manipulation with a multifinger hand is defined as changing the object pose from an initial to a final grasp configuration, while maintaining the fingertip contacts on the object surface. Given only the task constraints, represented as a desired motion of the object and an external force to be applied or resisted, the problem can be expressed as finding a good set of contact points on the object and a corresponding hand configuration compatible with the task to be executed. This paper presents a method for solving such problem, taking into account the kinematic structure and torque limits of the hand, the force closure condition (which must be guaranteed during the whole trajectory), and task compatibility. The feasibility of such method is tested in simulation of 2D and 3D examples.
