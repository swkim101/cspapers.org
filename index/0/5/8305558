A bed covering device such as a top and bottom sheet or the like is described wherein materials of proper size are combined to provide a top and bottom sheet which are attached. The bottom sheet is adapted to the contour of the mattress, forming a pocket into which the mattress fits. The top sheet is attached to the mattress pocket at the foot end so that the device can be used with either surface of the mattress.
