We describe Quality of service pICKER (QUICKER), a model-driven QoS mapping toolchain for supporting the QoS design and evolution of systems software. QUICKER automates the mapping of QoS requirements onto middleware-specific QoS configuration options by (1) choosing appropriate subset of QoS options for given QoS policies and (2) assigning values to each of these selected QoS options. QUICKER also provides support for validating the generated QoS configurations and resolving any dependencies between them using model checking.
