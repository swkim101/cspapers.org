We present a method for arranging an arbitrary 2-key table as an n by 2 array such that a search can be performed under either key in O(lg2n lglg n) time. This is in sharp contrast with an &OHgr;(âˆšn) lower bound for the problem under a model in which all comparisons must involve the value being searched for.
