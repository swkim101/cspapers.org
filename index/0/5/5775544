We present efficient, optimal algorithms for timing optimization by discrete wire sizing and buffer insertion. Our algorithms are able to minimize dynamic power dissipation subject to given timing constraints. In addition, we compute the complete power-delay tradeoff curve for added flexibility. We extend our algorithm to take into account the effect of signal slew on buffer delay which can contribute substantially to overall delay. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated experimentally.
