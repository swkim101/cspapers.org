We present an e ective caching scheme that reduces the computing and I/O requirements of a Web search engine without altering its ranking characteristics. The novelty is a two-level caching scheme that simultaneously combines cached query results and cached inverted lists on a real case search engine. A set of log queries are used to measure and compare the performance and the scalability of the search engine with no cache, with the cache for query results, with the cache for inverted lists, and with the two-level cache. Experimental results show that the two-level cache is superior, and that it allows increasing the maximum number of queries processed per second by a factor of three, while preserving the response time. These results are new, have not been reported before, and demonstrate the importance of advanced caching schemes for real case search engines.
