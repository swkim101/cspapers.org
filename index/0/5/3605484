Ultra-wideband (UWB) has great potential for wireless communications in emerging applications such as sensor networks. This paper considers UWB-based sensor networks and studies the following problem: given a set of source sensor nodes in the network each generating a certain data rate, is it possible to relay all these rates successfully to the base-station? We follow a cross-layer optimization approach, with joint consideration of link layer scheduling, power control, and network layer routing. The optimization problem is formulated as a non-linear programming problem. For small-sized networks, we develop a powerful approximation solution procedure to this problem based on the branch-and-bound approach and the novel Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT). For large-sized networks, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm by partitioning the sensor network into a core centered around the base-station and an edge that is outside the core. We also provide a closed-form analysis for the maximum rate that a base-station can receive. Simulation results exhibit the efficacy of our proposed optimization solution procedure and demonstrate the importance of the cross-layer approach to UWB-based sensor networks.
