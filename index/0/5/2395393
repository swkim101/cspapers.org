This paper presents an innovative hand-held device able to compute stiffness when interacting with a soft object. The device is composed of four linear indenters and a USB camera. The stiffness is computed in real-time, tracking the movements of spherical features in the image of the camera. Those movements relate to the movements of the four indenters when interacting with a soft surface. Since the indenters are connected to springs with different spring constants, the displacement of the indenters varies when interacting with a soft object. The proposed multi-indenting device allows measuring the object's stiffness as well as the pan and tilt angles between the sensor and the surface of the soft object. Tests were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed palpation mechanism against commercial springs of known stiffness. Results show that the accuracy and sensitivity of the proposed device increases with the softness of the examined object. Preliminary tests with silicon show the ability of the sensing mechanism to characterize phantom soft tissue for small indentation. It is noted that the results are not affected by the orientation of the device when probing the surface. The proposed sensing device can be used in different applications, such as external palpation for diagnosis or, if miniaturized, embedded on an endoscopic camera and used in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS).
