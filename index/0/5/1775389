This paper studies the problem of scheduling hard real-time sporadic suspending task systems under global earliest-deadline-first. A novel selective suspension-tocomputation conversion approach has been developed, with the fundamental idea of selecting and converting a limited set of jobs' suspensions into computation to eliminate suspension-induced pessimism in the analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this approach yields the first utilization-based test for globally-scheduled suspending task systems, which analytically dominates the suspension-oblivious approach and dramatically improves schedulability upon existing tests by over 50% on average, as shown by experiments. We believe this paper closes the loop on applying the methodology of selective suspension-to-computation conversion to analyze realtime suspending task systems.
