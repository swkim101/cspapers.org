The paper describes an algorithm based on AI techniques for recognizing words of printed or hand-written text--with the technique developed also applicable to correcting substitution spelling errors. The algorithm effectively integrates bottom-up information in the form of letter shapes, letter transitional probabilities and letter classification-error probabilities together with top-down knowledge in the form of a lexicon of legal words represented as a letter trie. Experimental results with the algorithm are reported for the combined top-down and bottom-up approach and for each of the two approaches individually.
