In this paper we introduce the notion of the limited-depth minor exclusion and show that graphs that exclude small limited-depth minors have relatively small separators. In particular, we prove that for any graph that excludes Kh as a depth l minor, we can find a separator of size O(lh2 logn + n=l). This, in turn, implies that any graph that excludes Kh as a minor has an O(hpn logn)-sized separator, improving the result of Alon, Seymour, and Thomas for the case where h plogn. We show that the d-dimensional simplicial graphs with constant aspect ratio, defined by Miller and Thurston, exclude Kh minors of depth L for h = (Ld 1) when d is a constant. These graphs arise in finite element computations. Our proof of separator existence is constructive and gives an algorithm to find the t-cut-covers decomposition, introduced by Kaklamanis, Krizanc, and Rao, in graphs that exclude small depth minors. This has two interesting implications. First, combination of our t-cut-cover algorithm with the results of Kaklamanis et al., gives a way to implement many finite element computations in three or more dimensions on a hypercubic parallel computer with asymptotically maximal speedup. Second, by combining the t-cut-cover algorithm with the techniques developed by Leiserson, Rao and Toledo, gives an algorithm to asymptotically improve the external memory traffic used by any out-of-core linear relaxation finite element computation in three or more dimensions.
