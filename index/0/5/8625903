Application profiling is an important performance analysis technique, when an application under test is analyzed dynamically to determine its space and time complexities and the usage of its instructions. A big and important challenge is to profile nontrivial web applications with large numbers of combinations of their input parameter values. Identifying and understanding particular subsets of inputs leading to performance bottlenecks is mostly manual, intellectually intensive and laborious procedure. We propose a novel approach for automating performance bottleneck detection using search-based input-sensitive application profiling. Our key idea is to use a genetic algorithm as a search heuristic for obtaining combinations of input parameter values that maximizes a fitness function that represents the elapsed execution time of the application. We implemented our approach, coined as Genetic Algorithm-driven Profiler (GA-Prof) that combines a search-based heuristic with contrast data mining of execution traces to accurately determine performance bottlenecks. We evaluated GA-Prof to determine how effectively and efficiently it can detect injected performance bottlenecks into three popular open source web applications. Our results demonstrate that GA-Prof efficiently explores a large space of input value combinations while automatically and accurately detecting performance bottlenecks, thus suggesting that it is effective for automatic profiling.
