A processing element and a structure element of data flow computer SIGMA-1 for scientific computations is now operational. The elements are evaluated for several benchmark programs. For efficient execution of loop constructs, the sticky token mechanism which holds loop invariants is evaluated and exhibits a remarkable effect. From the standpoint that performance of a single processor of a data flow computer must be comparable to that of a Von Neumann computer, comparison of both computers is discussed and improvement of the SIGMA-1 instruction set is proposed.
