We present Scout, a communication system leveraging TV whitespaces to support robust and high-speed streaming services. Scout uses two key techniques to improve video performance. First, it extends network coverage through an asymmetric network architecture where whitespace transceivers are used for the downlink direction while a cellular path is used for the uplink. Scout further leverages some unique opportunities that arise in vehicular systems. In particular, it sends a front radio to lookahead and identify the best channel parameters when the rear radio eventually reaches the forward post. We demonstrate the performance of Scout by using a single base station to stream a high-quality video to a vehicle driving along a 1.3km road stretch.
