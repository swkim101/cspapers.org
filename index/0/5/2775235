We present a novel method for the crosslingual transfer of dependency parsers. Our goal is to induce a dependency parser in a target language of interest without any direct supervision: instead we assume access to parallel translations between the target and one or more source languages, and to supervised parsers in the source language(s). Our key contributions are to show the utility of dense projected structures when training the target language parser, and to introduce a novel learning algorithm that makes use of dense structures. Results on several languages show an absolute improvement of 5.51% in average dependency accuracy over the state-of-the-art method of (Ma and Xia, 2014). Our average dependency accuracy of 82.18% compares favourably to the accuracy of fully supervised methods.
