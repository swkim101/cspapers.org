Active probing heuristics are usually based on queuing systems. However, a rigorous probabilistic treatment of probing methods has been lacking. For instance, it is not known even in principle, what can and cannot be measured in general, nor the true limitations of existing methods. We provide a probabilistic treatment for the measurement of cross traffic in the 1-hop case. We derive inversion formulae for the cross traffic process, and explain their fundamental limits, using an intuitive geometric framework.
