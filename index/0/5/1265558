In this article, we show how a bilingual texttranslation alignment method can be adapted to deal with more than two versions of a text. Experiments on a trilingual corpus demonstrate that this method yields better bilingual alignments than can be obtained with bilingual textalignment methods. Moreover, for a given number of texts, the computational complexity of the multilingual method is the same as for bilingual alignment.
