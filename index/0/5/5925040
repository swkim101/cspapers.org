Fall detection systems have been proposed to prevent additional injuries following fall accidents. This paper introduces an easily learnable fall detection system based on the data of an individual patient in a hospital room. The improvement of low performance using a single accelerometer at wrists and the inconvenience of sensor attached to a waist in the conventional approach was concentrated on by integrating heart rate signals to the conventional acceleration approach and changing the sensor location from a waist to wrists. As for the optimal heart rate feature selection, we proposed a four-feature vector combination (root mean square of successive differences, standard deviation of successive differences, normal to normal 50, normal to normal 20) with correlation and mutual information analysis in addition to mean absolute deviation selected as an accelerometer feature. To easily acquire and train the patients' fall data, our system was based on unsupervised learning approaches using Gaussian mixture models for optimal classifiers with the optimal cluster number decided by cluster validation index of square error sum. A 10-fold cross validation was applied for a final performance evaluation where each threshold for separating fall state from non-fall state was automatically decided in several comparison groups, which were created on the basis of fusion timing and used sensors. As a result, despite sensors attached to the wrist, the wearable inconvenience of the conventional is overcome using the feature-level fused approach between heart rates and accelerations with the accuracy up to 98.39 %, which is closest to 99.34 % of the case using a single accelerometer located at the waist.
