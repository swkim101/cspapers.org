This paper presents a method to localize a magnetically guided catheter using a single rotating C-Arm. Because the three dimensional position of the catheter tip, when extracted from a single view, contains large uncertainties, we propose to combine multiple views by rotating the C-Arm and using a Kalman filter. The proposed approach yields good tracking performance for several catheter poses and reduces the maximum estimated standard deviation to 0.3 cm after incorporating six views. This represents a 62 percent reduction in three dimensional position uncertainty.
