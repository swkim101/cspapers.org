DRAM memory is suffering increasingly aggravating refresh penalty, which no longer causes trivial performance degradation and power consumption. As memory capacity increases, refresh penalty has become increasingly worse as more rows have to be refreshed. In this work, we propose a simple, practical, and effective refresh approach called CAR (Compression-Aware Refresh) to efficiently mitigate refresh overheads. We apply data compression technique to store data in compressed format so that data blocks which are originally distributed across all the constituent chips of a rank only need to be stored in a subset of those chips, leaving banks in the remaining chips not fully occupied. As a result, the memory controller can safely skip refreshing memory rows which contain no useful data without compromising data integrity. Such a compression-aware refresh scheme can result in significant refresh savings and thus improve overall memory performance and energy efficiency. Moreover, to further take advantage of data compression, we adopt the rank subsetting technique to enable accesses to only those occupied chips for memory requests accessing compressed data blocks. Evaluations using benchmarks from SPEC CPU 2006 and the PARSEC 3.0 on the recent DDR4 memory systems have shown that CAR can achieve up to 1.66x performance improvement (11.7% on average).
