At educational computer conferences and exhibits, one is overwhelmed by the extensive use of computers as learning tools in almost any subject. However, the one subject which stands out for its limited use of computers is computer science. There is a tendency in computer science education to focus on what goes on in the mind: design and analysis of algorithms, development of data structures, and use of abstraction and modularization in programming. The computer is seen only as the object of study but not as a tool in the educational process. The danger in such an approach to teaching computer science is that the student may become facile in the use of formalism and languages but may fail to deeply grasp what is really going on One important way in which computers have been used in computer science to assist the educational process is by the development of algorithm animations. Algorithm animations have been created by a number of computer science educators including ourselves [2,3,4,5,6,7,8, 10,11, 12], The primary goals of these algorithm animations have been: .
