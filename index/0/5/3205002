The aim of this paper is to establish a generalized parameter estimation scheme to online estimate the Center of Gravity (COG) for multirotors, while using a geometric controller to perform position tracking for applications in aerial manipulation. The proposed scheme is developed so the controller uses the estimated COG to compensate and remove constant offset in the position tracking. The efficiency and validity of the proposed parameter estimation and compensation scheme is proved through two experimental evaluations, one when step changes to the COG are applied and one tracking experiment where a compact aerial manipulator is attached to the multirotor and performs sweeping motions.
