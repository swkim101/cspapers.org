The paper addresses the problem of action selection for an autonomous agent. An autonomous agent is viewed as a collection of "competence modules". The hypothesis that is put forward is that rational action selection can be modeled as an emergent property of an activation/inhibition dynamics among these modules. Results of a computer simulation are discussed and a first step towards a qualitative theory is presented. The advantages and disadvantages of this nonhierarchical, distributed form of control of action over the classical, programmed, centralized method are studied.
