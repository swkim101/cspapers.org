The Intel iAPX 432 is an object-based microcomputer which, together with its operating system iMAX, provides a multiprocessor computer system designed around the ideas of data abstraction. iMAX is implemented in Ada and provides, through its interface and facilities, an Ada view of the 432 system. Of paramount concern in this system is the uniformity of approach among the architecture, the operating system, and the language. Some interesting aspects of both the external and internal views of iMAX are discussed to illustrate this uniform approach.
