Voice biometrics is drawing increasing attention as it is a promising alternative to legacy passwords for mobile authentication. Recently, a growing body of work shows that voice biometrics is vulnerable to spoofing through replay attacks, where an adversary tries to spoof voice authentication systems by using a pre-recorded voice sample collected from a genuine user. In this work, we propose VoiceGesture, a liveness detection system for replay attack detection on smartphones. It detects a live user by leveraging both the unique articulatory gesture of the user when speaking a passphrase and the mobile audio hardware advances. Specifically, our system re-uses the smartphone as a Doppler radar, which transmits a high frequency acoustic sound from the built-in speaker and listens to the reflections at the microphone when a user speaks a passphrase. The signal reflections due to user's articulatory gesture result in Doppler shifts, which are then analyzed for live user detection. VoiceGesture is practical as it requires neither cumbersome operations nor additional hardware but a speaker and a microphone that are commonly available on smartphones. Our experimental evaluation with 21 participants and different types of phones shows that it achieves over 99% detection accuracy at around 1% Equal Error Rate (EER). Results also show that it is robust to different phone placements and is able to work with different sampling frequencies.
