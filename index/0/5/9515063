Query expansion methods using pseudo-relevance feedback have been shown effective for microblog search because they can solve vocabulary mismatch problems often seen in searching short documents such as Twitter messages (tweets), which are limited to 140 characters. Pseudo-relevance feedback assumes that the top ranked documents in the initial search results are relevant and that they contain topic-related words appropriate for relevance feedback. However, those assumptions do not always hold in reality because the initial search results often contain many irrelevant documents. In such a case, only a few of the suggested expansion words may be useful with many others being useless or even harmful. To overcome the limitation of pseudo-relevance feedback for microblog search, we propose a novel query expansion method based on two-stage relevance feedback that models search interests by manual tweet selection and integration of lexical and temporal evidence into its relevance model. Our experiments using a corpus of microblog data (the Tweets2011 corpus) demonstrate that the proposed two-stage relevance feedback approaches considerably improve search result relevance over almost all topics.
