An advanced camera-equipped mobile robot is being built at the CMU Robotics Institute to support research in control, perception, planning and related issues. It will be used initially to continue and extend visual navigation work (the Cart Project) completed in 1981 at Stanford's Al Lab. but is designed with mechanical, sensor and controller flexibility which should permit it to support a wide variety of other efforts.
