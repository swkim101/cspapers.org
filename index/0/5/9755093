To facilitate direct comparisons between different products, we present an approach to constructing short and comparative summaries based on product reviews. In particular, the user can view automatically aligned pairs of snippets describing reviewers' opinions on different features (also selected automatically by our approach) for two selected products. We propose a submodular objective function that avoids redundancy, that is efficient to optimize, and that aligns the snippets into pairs. Snippets are chosen from product reviews and thus easy to obtain. In our experiments, we show that the method constructs qualitatively good summaries, and that it can be tuned via supervised learning.
