In this work we introduce a conditional accelerated lazy stochastic gradient descent algorithm with optimal number of calls to a stochastic first-order oracle and convergence rate $O\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ improving over the projection-free, Online Frank-Wolfe based stochastic gradient descent of Hazan and Kale [2012] with convergence rate $O\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4}\right)$.
