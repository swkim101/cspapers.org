System Overview The approach acquires a domain-specific semantic representation by carrying out stochastic analysis of a corpus. Sets of conceptually similar paragraphs are utilised. The corpus and semantic representation are used to generate schematic structures. These are used to concisely store the knowledge contained within existing texts. New texts are processed to dynamically update the knowledge base. Any novel concepts encountered are analysed and a new structure added to the representation. A more comprehensive explanation of this system and references to related work are presented in (Collier 1994).
