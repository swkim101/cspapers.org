The basic idea of the artificial social systems approach of Shoham and Tennenholtz [1995; 1997] is to add a mechanism, called a social law, that will minimize the need for both centralized control and on-line resolution of conflicts. A social law is defined as a set of restrictions on the agentsâ€™ activities which allow them enough freedom on the one hand, but at the same time constrain them so that they will not interfere with each other. Several variants have been introduced to reason about the design and emergence of social laws. However, existing models of artificial social systems cannot be used for the evolution of such systems, because these models do not contain an explicit representation of the social laws in force. In this paper we use enforceable social laws [Boella and van der Torre, 2005] to address the question how artificial social systems can be extended to reason about the evolution of artificial social systems.
