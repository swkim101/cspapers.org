Generalized clauses differ from (ordinary) clauses by allowing conjunctions of literals in the role of (ordinary) literals, i.e. they are disjunctions of conjunctions of simple literals. An advantage of this clausal form is that implications with conjunctive conclusions or disjunctive premises are not split into multiple clauses. An extension of Lovelands model elimination calculus [Loveland, 1969a, Loveland, 1978] is presented able to deal with such generalized clauses. Furthermore we describe a method for generating lemmas that correspond to valid instances of conjunctive conclusions. Using these lemmas it is possible to avoid multiple proofs of the premises of implications with conjunctive conclusions.
