Upgrade of software is essential work for mission critical applications while system downtime for maintenance must be minimized. This paper presents the design and implementation of a method to upgrade binary modules for mission critical robotic services without stopping the running services. The base of the proposed method is thread swapping techniques and a programming paradigm of thread replaceability. Case studies present actual service suspension time which is often addressed in dynamic updating for server applications but rare for real physical applications.
