A recent trend has been to accompany Computer Science courses by "closed laboratories" where students carried out tasks with supervision and guidance. This paper presents a methodology for designing a complete sequence of laboratories to support the instruction in a course. The design considers both the technical concepts to be conveyed and the learning experiences through which students learn. We demonstrate the way the methodology has been used to design the lab sequence for a Pascal-based CS1 course.
