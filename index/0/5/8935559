Abstract
 We show that n lines in 3-space can be cut into 
 O(n2-1/69log16/69n) pieces, such that all depth cycles 
 defined by triples of lines are eliminated. This partially resolves 
 a long-standing open problem in computational geometry, motivated by
 hidden-surface removal in computer graphics.
