We review attempts at defining a general extension to the relational algebra to incl udc temporal semantics, and dcfinc two temporal operators to achieve a temporal relational algebra with a close correspondence to temporal logic using since and until. We then dcmonstratc how this temporal relational algebra may IO ;I limited extent be encoded in standard rclaticlnal algebra, and in turn show how an extcntlcd temporal SQL may be encoded in standard SQL.
