This paper describes the MyCS curriculum, which aims to encourage middle-years students, i.e., grades 4-10, to engage not only as consumers of CS, but as composers of computational artifacts. MyCS draws from many successful online tools and curricula, including Exploring Computer Science (ECS) and Scratch. MyCS's 18-week curriculum balances a broad treatment of the modern role of the computer with deepening students' hands-on skills through computational problem-solving, both unplugged and via programming. This paper summarizes assessments from several MyCS professional-development workshops, with an emphasis on eliciting teachers' needs and goals for their classrooms. In addition, we discuss the project's future in the format of a teacher-mediated MOOC that will enable a larger group of teachers to engage their students in CS.
