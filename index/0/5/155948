A new FORTRAN service course has been developed and is being pilot-tested. The course was designed to reduce the number of redundant FORTRAN courses, make more efficient use of faculty time, and provide more consistent and predictable learning outcomes for down-stream courses while improving faculty and student satisfaction. The course is largely self-instructional, mastery-based and self-paced. Incentives are used to reward students for mastery of learning outcomes and prompt completion of assignments. Preliminary evaluations of the course show that we have been largely successful in meeting design goals.
