An important feature of information systems is the ability to inform users about changes of the stored information. Therefore, systems have to 'know' what changes a user wants to be informed about. This is well known from the field of publish-/subscribe architectures. In this paper, we propose a solution for information system designers of how to extend their information model in a way that the notification mechanism can consider semantic knowledge when determining which parties to inform. Two different kinds of implementations are introduced and evaluated: one based on aspect oriented programming (AOP), the other one based on traditional database triggers. The evaluation of both approaches leads to a combined approach preserving the advantages of both techniques, using Model Driven Architecture (MDA) to create the triggers from a UML model enhanced with stereotypes.
