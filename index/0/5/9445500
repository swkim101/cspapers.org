The PARSEC benchmark suite [1] attempts to represent both current and emerging workloads for multiprocessing hardware, and is intended to help drive CMP research in both industry and academia. For this tool to help guide future designs, users must understand which hardware resources are most important for desired system behavior. Studying application behavior on existing systems representative of current design trends is a good starting point for developing this understanding. We therefore evaluate the PARSEC applications on a range of current CMPs. We investigate several aspects of current CMPs: memory speeds, SMT performance, out-of-order execution, and performance scaling with increasing numbers of threads. We also examine current microarchitectural resource bottlenecks.
