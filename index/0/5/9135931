This paper presents a system that compo-sitionally maps outputs of a wide-coverage Japanese CCG parser onto semantic representations and performs automated inference in higher-order logic. The system is evaluated on a textual entailment dataset. It is shown that the system solves inference problems that focus on a variety of complex linguistic phenomena, including those that are difﬁcult to represent in the standard ﬁrst-order logic.
