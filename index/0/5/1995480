This paper presents the design, analysis, and testing of a novel dual-range, dual-resolution XY micropositioning stage driven by a single actuator in each axis. As compared with dual-servo stages, it allows the reduction on the cost of both hardware and control design workload. The compliant stage is devised using leaf springs to achieve a large stroke. Strain sensors are employed to provide coarse and fine resolutions in the larger and smaller motion ranges, respectively. Analytical models are developed to facilitate the quantitative design of the motion ranges and coarse/fine resolution ratio. The motor selection criteria in terms of driving force and stroke are addressed as well. The models are verified through simulations with finite element analysis. A proof-of-concept prototype is fabricated for experimental investigations. The feasibility of the proposed idea is validated by a collection of experimental studies.
