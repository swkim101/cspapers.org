This paper presents a new method of calculating the semantic similarity between two articles based on WordNet. To further improve the performance of the proposed method, we build a new Compact Concept Ontology (CCO) from WordNet by combining the words with similar semantic meanings. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms a recent proposal of computing semantic similarity, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CCO method.
