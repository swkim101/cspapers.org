We consider the general problem of tracking moving objects in sensor networks. The specific application we consider is that of tracking a chemical plume moving over a large infrastructure network. We present a distributed index structure DIST that stores and updates distributed summaries as the plume moves. We present algorithms for range queries on the history of the plume. DIST localizes information with respect to time and space using a hierarchy that scales with the plume size. The highlight of our work is an analytical model to predict the cost of query algorithms based on the query location, query size, and plume's spatio-temporal distribution. Using this model, our adaptive scheme chooses the optimal scheme. Experimental results show that DIST outperforms alternative techniques in query, update, and storage costs, and scales well with the number of plumes.
