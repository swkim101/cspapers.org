In this paper, a network of communicating loqic programs is proposed as a model for parallol/concrurrent programming based on logic programs. This network is regarded as an extension of Kahn's pure dataflow in the sense that nodes are logic programs which have atoms for receiving and sending messages as well as queues to accept and memorize them. The nodes' behaviour is unboundedly nondeterministic. On the assumption that the channels' denotations should be defined by using sequence domains, the main concern of the present paper is whether or not mathematical semantics is always well-defined for a given network even when it is of unbounded nondeterminisrn. 
 
This paper will show that the proposed network is reduced to a dataflow when a kind of 'fairness' is asked for nondeterminisrn in which logic programs receive inputs and produce outputs based on their computations. The network, then, has a (least) fixpoint semantics; it is regarded as one of mathematical semantics of the network, since it can satisfy the recursive relations among the channels' denotations. 
 
It is also stated that the network with fair merge operators is applicable to the realization of a computational mechanism for sequential ligic programs.
