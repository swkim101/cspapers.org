At present, it is necessary to negotiate a manual completion phase in wiring multi-layer interconnection boards used in aerospace computers. This phase occurs after automatic placement of logic modules and routing of the greater majority of the requisite wiring. The GAPE (Graphic Aids to Packaging Engineering) System utilizes an IBM 2250 to minimize not only time-consuming and error-prone functions in the wiring completion process but also the total amount of computer time required. Selection and routing of wires in an n-plane environment is controlled using a displayed set of functions which are activated by light pen and function keyboard. Routing is enhanced by the ability of the system to rapidly switch between planes and subsections of the planes. The system also permits re-routing of wires already placed either in their entirety or portions thereof. Description of the physical board to be wired is supplied at execution time for maximum system flexibility and minimum user intervention. System tape output interfaces with printed circuit generator functions.
