Recent developments in very large scale integration have made it feasible to construct a highly parallel computer composed of large numbers of interconnected microcomputers. The modeling problems posed by this approach to parallel processing differ in several significant respects from those associated with traditional queueing network models of computer systems. Among them are the size of the models, the varied interconnection network topologies, and algorithm dependent internode communication patterns. We extend queueing theoretic models to include multimicrocomputer networks with primary emphasis on two areas: characterizing interconnection network workloads and finding efficient solution techniques for the resulting models.
