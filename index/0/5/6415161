In this paper, we describe a real-time 3D video system that is based on active stereo. Combining a NTSC standard camera/ projector equipment and a suitable color code, the geometric and photometric information of a scene is robustly obtained in 30fps. Our main motivation to develop this system is to create a platform for investigating the issues that will be posed by the next generation of digital video and how it can shape up new media.
