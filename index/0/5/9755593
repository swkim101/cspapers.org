In this paper, we examine the relationships between beliefs, goals, and intentions. In particular, we consider the formalization of the Asymmetry Thesis as proposed by Bratman [1987]. We argue that the semantic characterization of this principle determines if the resulting logic is capable of handling other important problems, such as the side-effect problem of beliefgoal-intention interaction. While Cohen and Levesque's [1990] formalization faithfully models some aspects of the asymmetry thesis, it does not solve all the side-effect problems; on the other hand the formalization provided by Rao and Georgeff [1991] solves all the side-effect problems, but only models a weak form of the asymmetry thesis. In this paper, we combine the intuition behind both these approaches and provide a semantic account of the asymmetry thesis, in both linear-time and branching-time logics, for solving many of these problems.
