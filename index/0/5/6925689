We will demonstrate the Secure Wireless Agent Testbed (SWAT), a unique facility developed at Drexel University to study integration, networking and information assurance for next-generation wireless mobile agent systems. SWAT is an implemented system that fully integrates: 1) mobile agents, 2) wireless ad hoc multi-hop networks, and 3) security. The demonstration will show the functionality of a number of decentralized agent-based applications, including applications for authentication, collaboration, messaging, and remote sensor monitoring. The demonstration will take place on a live mobile ad hoc network consisting of approximately a dozen nodes (PDAs, tablet PCs, and laptops) and hundreds of mobile software agents.
