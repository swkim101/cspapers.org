In this paper, we discuss a current attempt at applying the organizational principle Edelman calls Neuronal Group Selection to the control of a real, two-link robotic manipulator. We begin by motivating the need for an alternative to the position-control paradigm of classical robotics, and suggest that a possible avenue is to look at the primitive animal limb 'neurologically ballistic' control mode. We have been considering a selectionist approach to coordinating a simple perception-action task.
