Although computer tools for 3-D design applications are now widely available for use on personal computers, they are unnecessarily difficult to use. Conventions for establishing and manipulating views of 3-D objects require engineering-oriented dialogues that are foreign to most users. This paper describes the iterative design and testing of a new mechanism for moving 3-D objects with a mouse-controlled cursor in a space planning application prototype. Emphasis was placed on developing a design which would make 3-D interaction more intuitive by preserving users' experiences with moving objects in the real, physical world. Results of an informal user test of the current interface prototype are presented and implications for the development of a more general direct manipulation mechanism are discussed.
