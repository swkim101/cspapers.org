We introduce a knowledge-based approach to deep knowledge discovery from real-world natural language texts. Data mining, data interpretation, and data cleaning are all incorporated in cycles of quality-based terminological reasoning processes. The methodology we propose identifies new knowledge items and assimilates them into a continuously updated domain knowledge base.
