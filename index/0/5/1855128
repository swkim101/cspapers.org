This paper presents MTF — a modular, extensible and highly efficient open source framework for registration based tracking targeted at robotics applications. It is implemented entirely in C++ and is designed from the ground up to easily integrate with systems that support any of several major vision and robotics libraries including OpenCV, ROS, ViSP and Eigen. It is also faster and more precise than other existing tracking systems. In order to establish the theoretical basis for its design, a new way to conceptualize registration based trackers is also introduced that decomposes tracking into three sub modules — Search Method, Appearance Model and State Space Model. Along with being a practical solution for fast and high precision tracking, this framework can also serve as a useful research tool by allowing existing and new methods for any of the sub modules to be studied better. Through extensive use of generic programming, the system makes it easy to plug in a new method for any of the sub modules so that it can not only be tested comprehensively with existing methods but also become immediately available for deployment in any project that uses the framework.
