Various software tools have been proposed or developed for use in introductory programming courses. Usually, presentation of a new tool at the SIGCSE symposium occurs when a tool is first developed, leaving it to interested observers to identify success or failure of tools over their lifetime.For teachers, it can be difficult to compare available tools and judge potential application in their courses.In this session, three tools with an established track record of successful classroom use are presented: Karel J Robot [1], objectdraw [2], and BlueJ [2]. In addition to considering each tool individually, opportunities for combinations of these tools are also discussed.The focus of this session will be on concrete, hands-on advice that teachers can immediately apply in their classrooms.
