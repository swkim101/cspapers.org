We have developed a novel prototyping method that utilizes animated paper, a versatile platform created from paper and shape memory alloy (SMA), which is easy to control using a range of different energy sources from sunlight to lasers. We have further designed a laser point tracking system to improve the precision of the wireless control system by embedding retro-reflective material on the paper to act as light markers. It is possible to change the movement of paper prototypes by varying where to mount the SMA or how to heat it, creating a wide range of applications.
