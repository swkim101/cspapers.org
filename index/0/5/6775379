Wireless sensor network technology enables low-cost and high-density earthquake monitoring. The earthquake monitoring measures structural vibrations caused by earthquakes. The earthquake monitoring contributes the progress of earthquake engineering and earthquake resistant technology. If we acquire high quality vibration data, we can precisely estimate structural damage. However, the high quality sensing is difficult because of the distribution manner of wireless sensor networks. In [3], we described overview of our earthquake monitoring. In this paper, we focus on a synchronized sampling mechanism in the earthquake monitoring: especially, its design and evaluation. Section 2 discusses what kind of factors cause sensing error in wireless sensor networks, Section 3 propose a synchronized low-jitter sampling mechanism, which minimize sensing error, and Section 4 evaluates the synchronized lowjitter sampling using a shaking table. Finally, Section 5 concludes this work.
