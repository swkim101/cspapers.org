Based on the principle of divide and conquer, in this paper we propose an efficient traceback protocol for mobile ad hoc networks, The protocol is capable of detecting a hotspot where the attacker resides. It works by dividing the forwarding path of every packet into multiple interweaving fragments and each reachable fragment is individually reconstructed during a traceback process. Through simulations in theoretical mobility models as well as real mobility traces, we show that each traceback of our scheme can attribute to a very small hotspot and the attacker can be accurately identified after a number of traceback operations.
