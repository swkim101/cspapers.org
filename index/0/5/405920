Association rules are a fundamental class of patterns that exist in data. The key strength of association rule mining is its completeness. It finds all associations in the data that satisfy the user specified minimum support and minimum confidence constraints. This strength, however, comes with a major drawback. It often produces a huge number of associations. This is particularly true for data sets whose attributes are highly correlated. The huge number of associations makes it very diff icult, if not impossible, for a human user to analyze in order to identify those interesting/useful ones. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to overcome this problem. The technique first prunes the discovered associations to remove those insignificant associations, and then finds a special subset of the unpruned associations to form a summary of the discovered associations. We call this subset of associations the direction setting (DS) rules as they set the directions that are followed by the rest of the associations. Using this summary, the user can focus on the essential aspects (or relationships) of the domain and selectively view the relevant details. The approach is effective because experiment results show that the set of DS rules is typically very small . They can be analyzed manually by a human user. The proposed technique has also been applied successfully to a number of real-li fe applications.
