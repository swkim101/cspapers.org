The advantages of user-space protocols are well-known, but implementations often exhibit poor performance. This paper describes a user-space TCP implementation that outperforms a 'normal' kernel TCP and that achieves 80% of the performance of a 'single-copy' TCP. Throughput of 160 Mbit/s has been measured. We describe some of the techniques we used and some of the problems we encountered.
