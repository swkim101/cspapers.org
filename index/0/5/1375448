Economists have long been puzzled by event-ticket underpricing: underpricing reduces revenue for the performer, and encourages socially wasteful rent-seeking by ticket brokers. Why not use an auction to set price correctly? This paper studies the recent introduction of auctions into the event-ticket market by Ticketmaster. By combining primary-market data from Ticketmaster with secondary-market resale value data from eBay, we show that Ticketmaster's auctions work: the auctions substantially improve price discovery, roughly double performer revenues, and, on average, nearly eliminate the arbitrage profits associated with underpriced tickets. The data thus suggest that auctions can eliminate the speculator rent-seeking that has been associated with this market since the 19th century, and that seems to have exploded in volume in the 21st century.
