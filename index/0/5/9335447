We consider the problem of providing network access to hosts whose physical location changes with time. Such hosts cannot depend on traditional forms of network connectivity and routing because their location, and hence the route to reach them, cannot be deduced from their IP address. We present protocols that seamlessly integrate mobile hosts into the current IP networking infrastructure. They are primarily targeted at supporting a campus environment with mobile computers, but also extend gracefully to accomodate hosts moving between different networks. The key feature is the dependence on ancillary machines to track the location of the mobile hosts. Our protocols are designed to react quickly to changing topologies, to scale well, and not to place an overwhelming burden on the network.
