Computer Graphics, like so many areas of computer science, has undergone tremendous changes in the last few years. These changes make graphics available to a range of computer science programs which once found it impractical to teach. Thus it is useful to reevaluate the place of computer graphics in both the undergraduate and graduate computer science curricula. This panel will discuss the overall role of graphics in computer science, with speical emphasis on the different kinds of graphics courses which can be offered, and the kind of software and hardware system support which is needed. We will also show video examples of graphics having a direct bearing on computer science programs.
