With the increasing popularity of XML, there arises the need for managing and querying information in this form. Several query languages, such as XQuery, have been proposed which return their results in document order. However, most recent efforts focused on query optimization have disregarded order. This paper presents a simple yet elegant method to maintain document ordering for XML data. Analysis of our method shows that it is indeed efficient and scalable, even for changing data.
