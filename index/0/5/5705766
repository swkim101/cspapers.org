We present a real-world robotic agent that is capable of transferring grasping strategies across objects that share similar parts. The agent transfers grasps across objects by identifying, from examples provided by a teacher, parts by which objects are often grasped in a similar fashion. It then uses these parts to identify grasping points onto novel objects. We focus our report on the definition of a similarity measure that reflects whether the shapes of two parts resemble each other, and whether their associated grasps are applied near one another. We present an experiment in which our agent extracts five prototypical parts from thirty-two real-world grasp examples, and we demonstrate the applicability of the prototypical parts for grasping novel objects.
