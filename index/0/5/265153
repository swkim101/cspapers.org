ABBTRACT We introduce a framework for supporting crowds of participants in collaborative virtual environments (CVEs). The framework is realised as an extension to our previous spatiat model of interaction and aims to provide greater scalability and flexibility for communication between the inhabitants of virtual worlds. Our framework introduces an explicit crowd mechanism into CVEs in order to support the formation and activation of different kinds of crowd with different effects on mutual awareness and communication (achieved through the use of aggregation techniques combined with awareness adaptation). We present a demonstration application called the Arena a shared space for staging on-line performances in front of a live audience.
