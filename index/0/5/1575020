Spectral graph partitioning methods have received significant attention from both practitioners and theorists in computer science. Some notable studies have been carried out regarding the behavior of these methods for infinitely large sample size (von Luxburg et al., 2008; Rohe et al., 2011), which provide sufficient confidence to practitioners about the effectiveness of these methods. On the other hand, recent developments in computer vision have led to a plethora of applications, where the model deals with multi-way affinity relations and can be posed as uniform hypergraphs. In this paper, we view these models as random m-uniform hypergraphs and establish the consistency of spectral algorithm in this general setting. We develop a planted partition model or stochastic blockmodel for such problems using higher order tensors, present a spectral technique suited for the purpose and study its large sample behavior. The analysis reveals that the algorithm is consistent for m-uniform hypergraphs for larger values of m, and also the rate of convergence improves for increasing m. Our result provides the first theoretical evidence that establishes the importance of m-way affinities.
