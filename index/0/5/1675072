In this paper we present a method that uses optimal control for offline human gait synthesis that does not depend on motion capture data or task-specific controllers. Our method is based on efficient simulation of rigid multibody systems and a direct multiple-shooting method to solve the underlying space-time optimization problem. We formulated different optimization criteria and synthesized gaits for a fullbody 3-D human model with 34 degrees of freedom and compared the resulting movements with human data. By combining different criteria we are able to improve the similarity of the synthesized motions with respect to recorded human motioncapture motions.
