We give the first strongly polynomial time algorithm for computing an equilibrium for the linear utilities case of Fisher's market model. We consider a problem with a set B of buyers and a set G of divisible goods. Each buyer i starts with an initial integral allocation e<sub>i</sub> of money. The integral utility for buyer i of good j is U<sub>ij</sub>. We first develop a weakly polynomial time algorithm that runs in O(n<sup>4</sup> log U<sub>max</sub> + n<sup>3</sup> e<sub>max</sub>) time, where n = |B| + |G|. We further modify the algorithm so that it runs in O(n<sup>4</sup> log n) time. These algorithms improve upon the previous best running time of O(n<sup>8</sup> log U<sub>max</sub> + n<sup>7</sup> log e<sub>max</sub>), due to Devanur et al.
