Centralized search process requires that the whole collection reside at a single site. This imposes a burden on both the system storage of the site and the network traffic near the site. It thus comes to require the search process to be distributed. Recently, more and more Web sites provide the ability to search their local collection of Web pages. Query brokering systems are used to direct queries to the promising sites and merge the results from these sites. Creation of meta-information of the sites plays an important role in such systems. In this article, we introduce an ontology-based web site mapping method used to produce conceptual meta-information, the Vector Space approach, and present a serial of experiments comparing it with Na√Øve-Bayes approach. We found that the Vector Space approach produces better accuracy in ontology-based web site mapping.
