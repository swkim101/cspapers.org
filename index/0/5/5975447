We present a fast, simple, and high-accuracy short answer grading system. Given a short-answer question and its correct answer, key measures of the correctness of a student response can be derived from its semantic similarity with the correct answer. Our supervised model (1) utilizes recent advances in the identiﬁcation of short-text similarity, and (2) augments text similarity features with key grading-speciﬁc constructs. We present experimental results where our model demonstrates top performance on multiple benchmarks.
