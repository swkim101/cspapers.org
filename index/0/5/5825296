This paper suggests a unique method of organizing and staffing for the production of deliverable computer-based systems which takes advantage of assembly-line techniques. Although these production activities are common to most projects, Software Manufacturing is defined here as an inline, rather than support, function requiring special skills. A system development cycle is described, detailing the Software Manufacturing tasks with considerations for introducing this functions into existing development efforts. This organizational approach is concluded to lead to systematizing the production of software, to opening career opportunities for technician and production level people, and to better managed product development.
