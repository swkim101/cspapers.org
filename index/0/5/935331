The field programmable gate-array (FPGA) has become an important technology in VLSI ASIC designs. Most existing performance-driven technology mapping algorithms for Lookup-table (LUT) based FPGA designs are based on unit delay model. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm which finds an optimal technology mapping solution with minimum delay under arbitrary net delay models for LUTbased FPGA designs. The key step of this algorithm is the computation of a minimum height K-feasible cut in a Boolean network with arbitrary net delay, which is carried out through efficient flow computation. The capability of dealing with arbitrary net delay models enables our algorithm to be used not only as a FPGA technology mapper but also as an evaluation tool for delay model studies. We have implemented the algorithm and tested it on a number of MCNC benchmark examples.
