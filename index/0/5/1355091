Ensemble methods have proved to be highly effective in improving the performance of base learners under most circumstances. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that combines the merits of some existing techniques, namely bagging, arcing and stacking. The basic structure of the algorithm resembles bagging, using a linear support vector machine (SVM). However, the misclassification cost of each training point is repeatedly adjusted according to its observed out-of-bag vote margin. In this way, the method gains the advantage of arcing - building the classifier the ensemble needs - without fixating on potentially noisy points. Computational experiments show that this algorithm performs consistently better than bagging and arcing.
