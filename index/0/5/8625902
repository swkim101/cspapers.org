A binary tree machine which can handle all the dictionary machine and priority queue operations as well as some other data queries is designed in this paper. This machine supports operations like Insert, Delete, Extract-Min/Max, Membership and Near and their redundant forms. If the number of keys present in the tree is n, then each of the operations takes O(log n) steps, and can be fed into the tree in a pipeline manner at a constant rate. A machine with N&equil;2**s-1 processors can store upto N-s data elements. The output is generated at a fixed interval. It does not use any horizontal wires as in some previous designs. Moreover, this approach does not require any sorted-order, is potentially applicable to non-binary tree structures, and is significantly simpler to implement than all the previous designs.
