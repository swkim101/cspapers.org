Both vertebrate and invertebrate retinas are highly efficient in extracting contrast independent of the background intensity over five or more decades. This efficiency has been rendered possible by the adaptation of the DC operating point to the background intensity while maintaining high gain transient responses. The center-surround properties of the retina allows the system to extract information at the edges in the image. This silicon retina models the adaptation properties of the receptors and the antagonistic center-surround properties of the laminar cells of the invertebrate retina and the outer-plexiform layer of the vertebrate retina. We also illustrate the spatio-temporal responses of the silicon retina on moving bars. The chip has 59×64 pixels on a 6.9×6.8mm2 die and it is fabricated in 2 µm n-well technology.
