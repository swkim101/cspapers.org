A custom version of the TerminatorBot is described for core bored inspection during search-and-rescue operations. "Core bored inspection" refers to visual inspection of a void by passing a small camera through an access hole into the void. This is the classic "camera-on-a-stick" approach. Sometimes the access hole occurs naturally. Sometimes a suspected void has no access hole. To gain access, a hole is bored through the rubble with a coring tool, hence the term "core-bored inspection". In either case, the camera, once inside, can articulate to look around, but is limited to fine-of-sight. Occlusions can prevent a thorough inspection or force using/boring another hole. A small, agile robotic device could augment the use of such cameras. We propose the TerminatorBot as a prototype limbed robot for studying such applications.
