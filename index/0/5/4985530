This paper presents new methods to develop a running long jump for a simulated humanoid robot. Starting from a steady-state running motion, a new spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) based 3D template model for a running jump is presented. The use of this model is motivated by a simpler model from biomechanics which describes the dynamics of human long jumpers in the sagittal plane. While previously only used to describe the thrust step of a long jump, this type of model is also shown to generate useful Center of Mass (CoM) trajectories to return to steady-state running upon landing. A principled optimization approach for this new template is described to generate reference CoM trajectories for maximum span which are able to be kinematically and dynamically retargeted to the humanoid. The key features of an optimal long jump are highlighted, and a task-space control approach to realize the motion on a humanoid is summarized. A video attachment to this paper shows an optimal long jump for a 6 m/s approach speed, where the humanoid is able to clear a large gap, and highlights the effects of non-optimal takeoff-velocity angles.
