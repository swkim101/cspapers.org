Via detailed file system and disk system simulation, we examine the impact of disk built-in caches on the system performance. Our results indicate that the current trend of using large built-in caches is unnecessary and a waste of money and power for most users. Disk manufacturers could use much smaller built-in caches to reduce the cost as well as power-consumption, without affecting performance.
