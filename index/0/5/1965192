Augmented Reality (AR) systems can provide a method for browsing information that is situated in the real-world. We have developed a system that enable the user to browse the objects in the real-world with the help of AR. Our system is an AR application that incorporates information obtained by a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system. Our application runs on a smartphone or a tablet and its target space is a shelf. By aiming a mobile phone or tablet camera at a collection of items present on a shelf, a user can browse and interact with the items through the smartphone or tablet.The shelf is termed as smart shelf and it is equipped with the RFID system that makes it a smart space. All the items present on a shelf are RFID-tagged, so they can be inventoried and their locations are calculated with the help of the RFID system. The project is focused on enhancing and enriching the user experience in browsing physical reality.
