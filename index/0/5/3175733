This paper describes our design and implementation of a computeraugmented environment that allows users to smoothly interchangedigital information among their portable computers, table and walldisplays, and other physical objects. Supported by a camera-basedobject recognition system, users can easily integrate theirportable computers with the pre-installed ones in the environment.Users can use displays projected on tables and walls as a spatiallycontinuous extension of their portable computers. Using aninteraction technique called hyperdragging, users can transferinformation from one computer to another, by only knowing thephysical relationship between them. We also provide a mechanism forattaching digital data to physical objects, such as a videotape ora document folder, to link physical and digital spaces.
