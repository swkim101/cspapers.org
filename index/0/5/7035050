Despite many decades of research into mobile robot control, reliable, high-speed motion in complicated, uncertain environments remains an unachieved goal. In this paper we present a solution to realtime motion control that can competently maneuver a robot at optimal speed even as it explores a new region or encounters new obstacles. The method uses a navigation function to generate a gradient field that represents the optimal (lowest-cost) path to the goal at every point in the workspace. Additionally, we present an integrated sensor fusion system that allows incremental construction of an unknown or uncertain environment. Under modest assumptions, the robot is guaranteed to get to the goal in an arbitrary static unexplored environment, as long as such a path exists. We present preliminary experiments to show that the gradient method is better than expert human controllers in both known and unknown environments.
