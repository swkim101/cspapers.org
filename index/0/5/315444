To this end, we propose a learning-based hashing framework called Discrete Personalized Ranking (DPR), to map users and items to a Hamming space, where user-item affinity can be efficiently calculated via Hamming distance. Due to the existence of discrete constraints, it is possible to exploit a two-stage learning procedure for learning binary codes according to most existing methods. This two-stage procedure consists of relaxed optimization by discarding discrete constraints and subsequent binary quantization. However, such a procedure has been shown resulting in a large quantization loss, so that longer binary codes would be required. To this end, DPR directly tackles the discrete optimization problem of personalized ranking. And the balance and un-correlation constraints of binary codes are imposed to derive compact but informatics binary codes. Based on the evaluation on several datasets, the proposed framework shows consistent superiority to the competing baselines even though only using shorter binary code.
