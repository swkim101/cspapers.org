In this paper, we present a "value mapping" algorithm that does not rely on syntactic similarity or semantic interpretation of the values. The algorithm first constructs a statistical model (e.g., co-occurrence frequency or entropy vector) that captures the unique characteristics of values and their co-occurrence. It then finds the matching values by computing the distances between the models while refining the models using user feedback through iterations. Our experimental results suggest that our approach successfully establishes value mappings even in the presence of opaque data values and thus can be a useful addition to the existing data integration techniques.
