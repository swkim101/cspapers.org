Smartphones are becoming the convergent platform for personal sensing, computing, and communication. Our work attempts to exploit this convergence towards the problem of automatic image tagging. We envision TagSense, a smartphone based collaborative system that senses the people/activity/context in a picture, and merges them carefully to create tags on-the-fly. The main challenge pertains to discriminating phone users that are in the picture, from those that are not. Our demonstration system consists of 8 Android phones and a laptop. Phones -- with the TagSense application running -- will be randomly distributed to participants. Once a picture is taken by a participant with the phone, tags generated by TagSense will be shown on the phone screen.
