As the Web evolves in an integrated and interlinked knowledge space thanks to the growing amount of published Linked Open Data, the need to find solutions that enable the scholars to discover, explore and analyse the underlying research data emerges. Scholars, typically non-expert technology users, lack of in-depth understanding of the underlying semantic technology which limits their ability to interpret and query the data. We present a visual workflow to connect scholars and scientific resources on the Web of Data. We allow scholars to move from exploratory analysis in academic social networks to exposing relations between these resources. We allow them to reveal experts in a particular field and discover relations in and beyond their research communities. This paper aims to evaluate the potential of such a visual workflow to be used by non-expert users to interact with the semantically enriched data and familiarize with the underlying dataset.
