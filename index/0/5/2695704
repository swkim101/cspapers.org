The SharedPlans theory provides an axiomatic framework of collaborative plans based on four types of intentional attitudes. However, there still lacks an adequate semantics for the 'potential intention' operators. In this paper, we give a formal semantics to potential intentions, and examine models that can validate various relations between beliefs, intentions, and potential intentions.
