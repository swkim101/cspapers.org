In this work, we propose a method for tracking individuals in crowds. Our method is based on a trajectory-based clustering approach that groups trajectories of image features that belong to the same person. The key novelty of our method is to make use of a person's individuality, that is, the gait features and the temporal consistency of local appearance to track each individual in a crowd. Gait features in the frequency domain have been shown to be an effective biometric cue in discriminating between individuals, and our method uses such features for tracking people in crowds for the first time. Unlike existing trajectory-based tracking methods, our method evaluates the dissimilarity of trajectories with respect to a group of three adjacent trajectories. In this way, we incorporate the temporal consistency of local patch appearance to differentiate trajectories of multiple people moving in close proximity. Our experiments show that the use of gait features and the temporal consistency of local appearance contributes to significant performance improvement in tracking people in crowded scenes.
