Current Web search engines generally impose link analysis-based re-ranking on web-page retrieval. However, the same techniques, when applied directly to small web search such as intranet and site search, cannot achieve the same performance because their link structures are different from the global Web. In this paper, we propose an approach to constructing implicit links by mining users' access patterns, and then apply a modified PageRank algorithm to re-rank web-pages for small web search. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms content-based method by 16%, explicit link-based PageRank by 20% and DirectHit by 14%, respectively.
