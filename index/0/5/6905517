The set covering problem and the minimum cost assignment problem (respectively known as unate and binate covering problem) arise throughout the logic synthesis flow. This paper investigates the complexity and approximation ratio of two lower bound computation algorithms from both a theoretical and practical point of view. It also presents a new pruning technique that takes advantage of the partitioning.
