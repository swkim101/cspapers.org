We present the design of a routing system in which end-systems set tags to select non-shortest path routes as an alternative to explicit source routes. Routers collectively generate these routes by using tags as hints to independently deflect packets to neighbors that lie off the shortest-path. We show how this can be done simply, by local extensions of the shortest path machinery, and safely, so that loops are provably not formed. The result is to provide end-systems with a high-level of path diversity that allows them to bypass unde-sirable locations within the network. Unlike explicit source routing, our scheme is inherently scalable and compatible with ISP policies because it derives from the deployed Internet routing. We also sug-gest an encoding that is compatible with common IP usage, making our scheme incrementally deployable at the granularity of individual routers.
