We study restricted classes of programming systems (Gödel numberings), where a programming system is in a given class if every programming system can be translated into it by functions in a given restricted class. For pairs of systems in various “natural” classes we give results on the existence of isomorphisms (one-to-one and onto translations) between them from the appropriate class of functions. Our results with the most computational significance concern polynomial time programming systems. We show that if P&equil;NP then every two polynomial time programming systems are isomorphic via a polynomial time computable function. IfP@@@@NP this result points the way to the possible existence of “natural” but intractable computational problems concerning programming systems classified in terms of the polynomial time hierarchy. We also give results concerning the relationship between the complexity of certain important and commonly used properties of programming systems (such as effective composition of programs) and the complexity of translations into the systems.
