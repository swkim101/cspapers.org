This paper presents a new approach based on Equivalent Pseudowords (EPs) to tackle Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) in Chinese language. EPs are particular artificial ambiguous words, which can be used to realize unsupervised WSD. A Bayesian classifier is implemented to test the efficacy of the EP solution on Senseval-3 Chinese test set. The performance is better than state-of-the-art results with an average F-measure of 0.80. The experiment verifies the value of EP for unsupervised WSD.
