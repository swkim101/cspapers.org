This session is for K-12 (primary/secondary) educators who would like to talk about what types of professional development would be most relevant to them. It is also for curricular innovators who offer CS professional development to share how successful their attendees have been at implementing the strategies learned through their programs, and if attendees were able to use any materials the program provided in their own classrooms. We welcome an open and positive dialogue on opportunities for improvement in professional development offerings, and a celebration of successful strategies. The discussion leaders will share their own experience with the NSF funded Adventures in Alice workshops to prompt dialogue, and will encourage all attendees to actively participate in the session by sharing their own experiences, concerns, and triumphs.
