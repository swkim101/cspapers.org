Formalisms based on Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) and Milner's Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) for verifying protocols are currently being used by the International Standard Organisation (ISO). However, these models need to be extended if protocol performance specification and verification is to be done, as neither of these models have timing information (other than sequencing) nor a way of specifying controlled loss of information.
This paper presents two extensions to Hoare's CSP that are felt by the author to provide suitable mechanisms for specifying protocol performance. Firstly, the effects of introducing time into CSP are presented, based on the work done by Reed and Roscoe. Secondly, the traces model is modified by associating probabilities with event sequences.
Finally, some example specifications are given using these two extensions.
