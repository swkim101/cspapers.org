Collaborative tagging systems allow users to use tags to describe their favourite online documents. Two documents that are maintained in the collection of the same user and/or assigned similar sets of tags can be considered as related from the perspective of the user, even though they may not be connected by hyperlinks. We call this kind of implicit relations user-induced links between documents. We consider two methods of identifying user-induced links in collaborative tagging, and compare these links with existing hyperlinks on the Web. Our analyses show that user-induced links have great potentials to enrich the existing link structure of the Web. We also propose to use these links as a basis for predicting how documents would be tagged. Our experiments show that they achieve much higher accuracy than existing hyperlinks. This study suggests that by studying the collective behaviour of users we are able to enhance navigation and organisation of Web documents.
