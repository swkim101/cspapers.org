This paper presents a new method of obtaining couplings in networks.
 We begin by introducing a new class of networks which are structural extensions of triangular permuting networks. More, by using augmented cells, we increase the functionnal capability of such networks.
 Then we present an algorithm to solve the problem of constructing a complete coupling in such networks. This algorithm lends itself to a hardware implementation with partially distributed control.
