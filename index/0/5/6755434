The increased pervasiveness of wireless mobile computing devices draws new attention to the need for coordination among small networked components. The very nature of the environment requires devices to interact opportunistically when resources are available. Such interactions occur unpredictably as mobile agents generally have no advance knowledge of other agents they will encounter over the lifetime of the application. In addition, as the ubiquity of communicating mobile devices increases, the number of application agents supported by the network grows drastically. Managing access control is crucial to such systems, and application agents must directly manipulate and examine access policies because the agents require full control over their data. However, because these networks are often decoupled from a fixed infrastructure, reliance on centralized servers for authentication and access policies is impractical. In this paper, we explore the essential features of general access control policies tailored to the needs of agent coordination in the presence of physical and logical mobility. This access mechanism derives much of its flexibility and expressiveness from its ability to take into account context information. We propose and evaluate novel constructs to support such policies, especially in the presence of large numbers of highly dynamic application agents.
