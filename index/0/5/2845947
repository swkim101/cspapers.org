This paper presents Kick Ass Kung-Fu, a martial arts game installation where the player fights virtual enemies with kicks and punches as well as acrobatic moves such as cartwheels. Using real-time image processing and computer vision, the video image of the user is embedded inside 3D graphics. Compared to previous work, our system uses a profile view and two displays, which allows an improved view of many martial arts techniques. We also explore exaggerated motion and dynamic slow-motion effects to transform the aesthetic of kung-fu movies into an interactive, embodied experience. The system is described and analyzed based on results from testing the game in a theater, in a television show, and in a user study with 46 martial arts practitioners.
