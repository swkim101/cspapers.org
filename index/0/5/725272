This paper considers the problem of partitioning a large logic circuit into a collection of subcircuits each of which is implemented with a device from a specific (FPGA) library. The objective function that we minimize is not only the total cost of devices to be used in the partition but also the size of the interconnect between the devices. We introduce the concept of functional replication and a unified cost model for min-cut partitioning with replication. A prototype implementation demonstrates the feasibility of the approach, based on experimental results with a set of large benchmark circuits.
