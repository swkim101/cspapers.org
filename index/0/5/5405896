We propose an effective method to solve the event sequence clustering problems based on a novel Dirichlet mixture model of a special but significant type of point processes --- Hawkes process. In this model, each event sequence belonging to a cluster is generated via the same Hawkes process with specific parameters, and different clusters correspond to different Hawkes processes. The prior distribution of the Hawkes processes is controlled via a Dirichlet distribution. We learn the model via a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and propose an effective variational Bayesian inference algorithm. We specifically analyze the resulting EM-type algorithm in the context of inner-outer iterations and discuss several inner iteration allocation strategies. The identifiability of our model, the convergence of our learning method, and its sample complexity are analyzed in both theoretical and empirical ways, which demonstrate the superiority of our method to other competitors. The proposed method learns the number of clusters automatically and is robust to model misspecification. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that our method can learn diverse triggering patterns hidden in asynchronous event sequences and achieve encouraging performance on clustering purity and consistency.
