Classification of short text messages is becoming more and more relevant in these years, where billion of users use online social networks to communicate with other people. Understanding message content can have a huge impact on many data analysis processes, ranging from the study of online social behavior to targeted advertisement, to security and privacy purposes. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised knowledge-based classifier for short text messages, where each category is represented by an ego-network. A short text is classified into a category depending on how far its words are from the ego of that category. We show how this technique can be used both in single label and in multi-label classification, and how it outperforms the state of the art for short text messages classification.
