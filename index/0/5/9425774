This paper constitutes a proposal for an efficient and effective logical information retrieval system. Following a relational indexing approach, which is in our opinion a necessity to cope with the emerging applications such as those based on multimedia, we use the conceptual graphs formalism as our indexing language. This choice allows for relational indexing support and captures all the useful properties of the logical information retrieval model, in a workable system. First order logic and standard information retrieval techniques are combined together, to the same effect: obtaining an expressive system, able to accurately handle complex documents, improve retrieval effectiveness, and achieve good time performance. Experimentations on an image test collection, within a system available on the Web, provide an illustration of the role that logic may have in the future development of information retrieval systems.
