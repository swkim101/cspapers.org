Several researchers have proposed modeling temporally abstract actions in reinforcement learning by the combination of a policy and a termination condition, which we refer to as an option. Value functions over options and models of options can be learned using methods designed for semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs). However, all these methods require an option to be executed to termination. In this paper we explore methods that learn about an option from small fragments of experience consistent with that option, even if the option itself is not executed. We call these methods intra-option learning methods because they learn from experience within an option. Intra-optionmethods are sometimes much more efficient than SMDP methods because they can use off-policy temporaldifference mechanisms to learn simultaneously about all the options consistent with an experience, not just the few that were actually executed. In this paper we present intra-option learning methods for learning value functions over options and for learning multi-time models of the consequences of options. We present computational examples in which these new methods learn much faster than SMDP methods and learn effectively when SMDP methods cannot learn at all. We also sketch a convergence proof for intraoption value learning.
