A fast message-passing library FMPL has been designed and developed to maximize communication performance by utilizing general architectural communication support such as remote memory operations, as well as to maximize total performance by eliminating dynamic communication overhead and overlapping communication and computation. FMPL provides a low-cost general-purpose point-to-point communication and collective communication such as broadcast, barrier synchronization and reduction. On a Hitachi SR8000, FMPL achieves an 8-byte latency of 12.8µsec., while MPI achieves 20µsec. FMPL is designed for building more highly functional message-passing libraries like BLACS as well as applications that need maximum performance.
