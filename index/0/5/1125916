We enrich a curated resource of commonsense knowledge by formulating the problem as one of knowledge base completion (KBC). Most work in KBC focuses on knowledge bases like Freebase that relate entities drawn from a fixed set. However, the tuples in ConceptNet (Speer and Havasi, 2012) define relations between an unbounded set of phrases. We develop neural network models for scoring tuples on arbitrary phrases and evaluate them by their ability to distinguish true held-out tuples from false ones. We find strong performance from a bilinear model using a simple additive architecture to model phrases. We manually evaluate our trained modelâ€™s ability to assign quality scores to novel tuples, finding that it can propose tuples at the same quality level as mediumconfidence tuples from ConceptNet.
