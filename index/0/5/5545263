The problem of modelling and analysing the performance of software structures for distributed computer systems is addressed. A modelling technique is proposed which has many striking analogies with current techniques for evaluating hardware systems and yet focuses attention on the system software. The analysis of such models will draw heavily on the substantial work already done in the analysis of hardware models.
 To illustrate the modelling technique proposed, it is applied to an investigation of the trade-offs associated with the configuration of critical sections in a distributed software system. Simple queueing techniques are used to model a number of alternative configurations. The study throws some light on the regions of optimum decomposition, and the impact on performance of some of the important design variables.
