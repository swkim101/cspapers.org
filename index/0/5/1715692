Collaborative spaces supporting personal mobile devices provide for a powerful integration of personalized content with supportive embedded infrastructure. Social, spatial, and informational considerations have a salient impact on such modern collaborative spaces. The design, implementation, and evaluation of a collaborative workspace prototype that directly supports the integrated use of mobile devices not only yields insights into the basic capabilities behind such a space, but also a deeper understanding of the different composition control mechanisms available. Specifically, such environments can effectively work with existing laptop platforms, and show increased promise for supporting future generations of smaller mobile devices.
