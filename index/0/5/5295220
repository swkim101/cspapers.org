A unified database framework that will enable better comprehension of ranked XML retrieval is still a challenge in the XML database field. We propose a logical algebra, named score region algebra, that enables transparent specification of information retrieval (IR) models for XML databases. The transparency is achieved by a possibility to instantiate various retrieval models, using abstract score functions within algebra operators, while logical query plan and operator definitions remain unchanged. Our algebra operators model three important aspects of XML retrieval: element relevance score computation, element score propagation, and element score combination. To illustrate the usefulness of our algebra we instantiate four different, well known IR scoring models, and combine them with different score propagation and combination functions. We implemented the algebra operators in a prototype system on top of a low-level database kernel. The evaluation of the system is performed on a collection of IEEE articles in XML format provided by INEX. We argue that state of the art XML IR models can be transparently implemented using our score region algebra framework on top of any low-level physical database engine or existing RDBMS, allowing a more systematic investigation of retrieval model behavior.
