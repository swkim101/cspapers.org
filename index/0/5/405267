The Internet provides a highly suitable infrastructure for sharing multimedia meeting records, especially as multimedia technologies become more lightweight and workers more mobile. LiteMinutes is a system that uses both the Web and email for creating, revising, distributing, and accessing multimedia information captured in a meeting. Supported media include text notes taken on wireless laptops, slide images captured from presentations, and video recorded by cameras in the room. At the end of a meeting, text notes are sent by the note taking applet to the server, which formats them in HTML with links from each note item to the captured slide images and video recording. Smart link generation is achieved by capturing contextual metadata such as the on/off state of the media equipment and the room location of the laptop, and inferring whether it makes sense to supply media links to a particular note item. Note takers can easily revise meeting minutes after a meeting by modifying the email message sent to them and mailing it back to the serverâ€™s email address. We explore design issues concerning preferences for email and Web access of meeting minutes, as well as the different timeframes for access. We also describe the integration with a comic book style video summary and visualization system with text captions for browsing the video recording of a meeting.
