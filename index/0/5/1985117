In this paper we investigate a unique problem associated with fusing loops within a High Performance Fortran (HPF) program. In particular, we discuss the issue of performing loop fusion in an HPF compiler when compiling Fortran array assignment statements for execution on a distributedmemory machine. During compilation of an HPF program, Fortran array assignment statements must be scalarized into loop nests. We show how a certain class of these loop nests, when fused, can cause problems for the compilerâ€™s distributed-memory code generator. We then present an algorithm which not only prevents the fusion of these loops, but also increases t,he amount of useful fusion that can be
