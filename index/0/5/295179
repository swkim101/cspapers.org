A vital factor for a successful deployment of sensor nodes is testing of all system aspects in a realistic setup. This work presents a testbed architecture which allows for detailed monitoring and stimulation of a wireless sensor node. In particular, time-accurate state extraction and power measurements are provided in a distributed, yet synchronized context. The FlockLab testbed architecture provides a distributed lab instrument, where detailed observations of every sensor node enable thorough testing. Software services allow for formulating testcases and reliable test data collection.
