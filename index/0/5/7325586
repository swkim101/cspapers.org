We show that a moving observer can (in principle) compute the relative depth map of the environment given only the instantaneous positional velocity field on his "retina". The depth map (and surface normals) are computed by recovering the egomotion parameters which in turn determine the ratio of depth associated with any two neighbouring "retinal" points. The surface normal map may be computed to a degree of accuracy determined by the resolution of the "retina", and by the accuracy of approximation obtainable in the solution of three non-linear equations of the third degree in three unknowns.
