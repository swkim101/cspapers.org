This research study is about constructing "generic adaptable test cases" to counter test case libraries explosion problem. Our work focuses on effort reduction via systematic reuse of generic test assets by taking advantage of common aspects and predicted variability in test cases. We envision that the proposed approach to organizing test case libraries will be particularly useful in the context of Software Product Line Testing (SPLT). By exploring strategies for generic test cases, I hope to address problems of domain-level testing. Our work will investigate existing testing (SPLT) practices in variability management context by conducting empirical studies. We plan to synthesize principles for "generic test case" design, identify gaps between required and exiting techniques, and finally propose new approach for generic adaptive test case construction.
