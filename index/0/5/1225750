In this paper, a filled function approach for constrained global optimization (FFACGO) is proposed. It is a combination of the idea of filled function method in unconstrained global optimization with the concept of penalty function in constrained optimization.Moreover, this FFACGO can be easily actualized with a process that aims at successively finding better optimizer. The performance of the FFACGO in numerical experiments for several testing functions is quite satisfactory and shows its efficiency
