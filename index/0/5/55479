Children spend significant amounts of time on the Internet. Recent studies showed, that during these periods they are often not under adult supervision. This work presents an automatic approach to identifying suitable web pages for children based on topical and non-topical web page aspects. We discuss the characteristics of children's web sites with respect to recent findings in children's psychology and cognitive sciences. We finally evaluate our approach in a large-scale user study, finding, that it compares favourably to state of the art methods while approximating human performance.
