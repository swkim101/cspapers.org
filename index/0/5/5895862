We present a method to predict long-term motion of pedestrians, modeling their behavior as jump-Markov processes with their goal a hidden variable. Assuming approximately rational behavior, and incorporating environmental constraints and biases, including time-varying ones imposed by traffic lights, we model intent as a policy in a Markov decision process framework. We infer pedestrian state using a Rao-Blackwellized filter, and intent by planning according to a stochastic policy, reflecting individual preferences in aiming at the same goal.
