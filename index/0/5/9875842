In this paper, we characterize wide-area network applications that use the TCP transport protocol. We also describe a new way to model the wide-area traffic generated by a stub network. We believe the traffic model presented here will be useful in studying congestion control, routing algorithms, and other resource management schemes for existing and future networks. Our model is based on trace analysis of TCP/IP widearea internetwork traffic. We collected the TCP/IP packet headers of USC, UCB, and Bellcore networks at the point they connect with their respective regional access networks. We then wrote a handful of programs to analyze the traces. Our model characterizes individual TCP conversations by the distributions of: number of bytes transferred, duration, number of packets transferred, packet size, and packet interarrival time. Our trace analysis shows that both interactive and bulk transfer traffic from all sites reflect a large number of short conversations. Similarly, it shows that a very large percentage of traffic is bidirectional, even for bulk transfer. We observed that interactive applications send significantly different amounts of data in each direction of a conversation, and that interarrival times for interactive applications closely follow a constant plus exponential model. Half of the conversations are directed to a handful of networks, but the other half are directed to hundreds of networks. Many of these observations contradict commonly held beliefs regarding wide-area traffic. This research was supported by an equipment grant from the Charles Lee Powell Foundation.
