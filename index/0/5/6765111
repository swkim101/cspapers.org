This work presents the design and evaluation of a low-cost tri-axial force sensor, that has been developed to regain the sense of touch in minimally invasive surgeries (MIS). The force sensor uses an array of force sensitive resistors (FSR) with a mechanically pre-loaded structure to perform the force sensing. The sensor has a built-in signal conditioning circuitry to provide on-board power regulation, programmable signal amplification and analog to digital conversion. The sensor is inexpensive and highly sensitive to low-amplitude force, critical in surgical applications. We validate the efficacy of the sensor with two surgical applications â€” robotic palpation for stiffness mapping and obstacle avoidance for a highly articulated robotic probe (HARP). The results show that the sensor is capable of accurately detecting the stiff inclusions embedded in the tissues as well as detecting obstacles and helping HARP safely navigate around them.
