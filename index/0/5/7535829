In this paper we define a type of cohesive subgroups - called communities - in hypergraphs, based on the edge connectivity of subhypergraphs. We describe a simple algorithm for the construction of these sets and show, based on examples from image segmentation and information retrieval, that these groups may be useful for the analysis and accessibility of large graphs and hypergraphs.
