People who attempt to use a complex information store on a computer encounter a number of problems: They do not know what information exists or how to find information, they get no support in articulating a question, and they are unable to phrase their question in terms that the system understands. Helgon, an intelligent environment that supports limited cooperative problem solving, helps people deal with complex information stores. Helgon supports retrieval and editing by reformulation with multiple specification techniques, and it acquaints the user with the system model of the information store. Within the current Helgon system, a number of different information stores have been implemented. Empirical evaluations have shown that Helgon supports effective communication. In addition, the evaluations have shown interesting extensions for future work.
