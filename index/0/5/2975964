This video presents our recent research on the integration of physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) into imitation learning. First, a marker control approach for real-time human motion imitation is shown. Secondly, physical coaching in addition to observational learning is applied for the incremental learning of motion primitives. Last, we extend imitation learning to learning pHRI which includes the establishment of intended physical contacts. The proposed methods were implemented and tested using the IRT humanoid robot and DLR's humanoid upper-body robot Justin.
