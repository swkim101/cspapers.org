At present, the relevant research of the term structure of interest rates of our country is mostly directed against a certain specific market or a certain specific method, lacking the integrality. For constructing a systemic, scientific term structure of interest rate of our country, respective term structure of interest rate are deduced from the treasury bond market, bank deposit market, inter-bank borrowing market, bank repo market, and RMB interest rate swap market. And then according to different weights, a synthesized term structure of interest rate of our country is constructed out. Finally, empirical research is carried on by use of the method. Empirical results show that the method is better than the traditional methods, and the synthesized term structure curve of interest rate by the method is between various kinds of term structure curves by the traditional methods, reflecting the situation and information of each market on the whole.
