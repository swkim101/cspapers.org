The piracy of copyrighted digital content over the Internet infringes copyrights and damages the digital content industry. Accordingly, identifying and monitoring technology on the online content service like fingerprinting is getting valuable through the explosion of digital content sharing. This paper proposes a robust video fingerprinting feature to identify a modified video clip from a large scale database. Hierarchical symmetric difference feature is proposed in order to offer efficient video fingerprinting. The feature is robust and pairwise independent against various video modifications such as compression, resizing, or cropping. Moreover, videos undergoing a transformation such as flipping or mirroring can be identified by simply disordering the bit pattern of fingerprints. The performance of the proposed feature is extensively experimented on 6,482 hours of database and the experimental results show that the proposed fingerprinting is efficient and robust against various modifications.
