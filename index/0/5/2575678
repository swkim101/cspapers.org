In this paper, we analyze and compare five image-based visual servoing control laws. Three of them are classical while two new ones are proposed. The first new control law is based on a behavior controller to adjust the movement of the camera. It can also be used to switch between the classical methods. The second control law is designed to try to obtain the global stability of the system. An analytical study of all control schemes when translational motion along and rotational motion around the optical axis is also presented. Finally, simulation and experimental results show that the new control law with a behavior controller has a wider range of success than the other control schemes and can be used to avoid local minima and singularities.
