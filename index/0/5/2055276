Knowledge graph embedding aims at offering a numerical knowledge representation paradigm by transforming the entities and relations into continuous vector space. However, existing methods could not characterize the knowledge graph in a fine degree to make a precise prediction. There are two reasons: being an ill-posed algebraic system and applying an overstrict geometric form. As precise prediction is critical, we propose an manifold-based embedding principle (\textbf{ManifoldE}) which could be treated as a well-posed algebraic system that expands the position of golden triples from one point in current models to a manifold in ours. Extensive experiments show that the proposed models achieve substantial improvements against the state-of-the-art baselines especially for the precise prediction task, and yet maintain high efficiency.
