However, information available to subsystem controllers is often incomplete, and the operator becomes more difficult to model without this input information. In this work we present a data-driven, nonparametric model to capture both expectation and uncertainty of the upcoming duty for a subsystem controller. This model is a modified k-nearest neighbor regressor used to generate weighted samples from a distribution of upcoming duty, which are then exploited to generate an optimal control. We test the model on a simulated heterogeneous energy pack manager in an Electric Vehicle operated by a human driver. For this domain, upcoming load on the energy pack strongly affects the optimal use and charging strategy of the pack. Given incomplete information, there is a natural uncertainty in upcoming duty due to traffic, destination, signage, and other factors. We test against a dataset of real driving data gathered from volunteers, and compare the results other models and the optimal upper bound.
