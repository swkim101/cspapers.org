What is the fas tes t way to go from point X to point Y within a city using its public bus service, with bus changes as necessary? If buses ran according to a schedule this is an easy query it can be solved by using classical shor tes t pa th a lgor i thms. Unfortunately, as everyone knows, buses in most cities hardly confirm to a fixed schedule. Once you get into a bus it usually takes a predictable a m o u n t of t ime to reach its destinb.tion, bu t the amoun t of t ime you spend waiting for it is qui te r a ndom and can usually be es t imated only statistically. We present an a lgor i thm to generate travel p lans for such conditions. Our plans allow actions of the form "wai t for buses with route n u m b e r R1,R2 ... if you get into R1 get off at ... and wait for ..., else if you get into R2 ..." and are modeled as a tree. We gua ran tee tha t the expected t ime taken by the plan we genera te will be min imum over all possible plans for travel between the given s tar t ing point and dest inat ion. The algori thm has been implemented for the bus sys tem of Mumbai , and it genera tes the (optimal) travel plan essentially instantaneously. A t ranscr ip t of a session with the p rog ram is
