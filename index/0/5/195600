This paper describes the design criteria and annotation guidelines of Sinica Treebank. The three design criteria are: Maximal Resource Sharing, Minimal Structural Complexity, and Optimal Semantic Information. One of the important design decisions following these criteria is the encoding of thematic role information. An on-line interface facilitating empirical studies of Chinese phrase structure is also described.
