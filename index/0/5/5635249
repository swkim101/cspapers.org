This paper discusses practical strategies for transition from a pinching to a power grasping, where a multi-fingered hand mounted on a robotic arm envelops a cylindrical object on a table. When the manipulation system grasps a cylindrical object like a pen on a desk, a complete enveloping is not impossible in the initial configuration. The system firstly pinches the object only with two or three fingers and then grasps it with fingers and a palm after regrasping. In this pinching-grasping transition maneuver, human unconsciously selects proper strategy according to some conditions including object dimensions and initial pinching positions. In this paper we therefore develop six possible strategies for this pinching-grasping transition and then investigate their performances for some objects with various dimensions and various grasping positions, using numerical simulations. Based on their results, a strategy selection algorithm for these conditions is proposed and some experiment results are shown.
