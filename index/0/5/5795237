This paper shows that mathematical models of biological pattern formation are ideally suited to data parallelism. We present two new algorithms, one for simulating the dynamic structure of fibroblasts, and the other for studying the self-organization of motile bacteria. We describe implementations of these algorithms using a high level data parallel language called ZPL, and we give performance results for the Kendall Square Research KSR-2 and the Intel Paragon that include comparisons against sequential Fortran.
