In this case study we describe how method-resources were 
reconfigured across three design and evaluation projects 
conducted by an in-house design team within the same 
company during a six-year action research collaboration 
with academics from the field of Human-Computer 
Interaction (HCI). This case study specifically focuses on 
the reconfigurations that occurred in participant 
recruitment, task selection, reporting format and problem 
identification between the three projects. The underlying 
contextual factors behind the reconfigurations, in particular 
the application domain, organisational factors and project 
constraints, will be discussed to give unique insights into 
the realities of design work from within a single 
organisation over the six-year collaboration. This case study 
demonstrates the complexity of comparing methods across 
projects, particularly within dynamic and complex work 
domains, and that existing attempts may be too simplistic 
because they fail to account for these factors.
