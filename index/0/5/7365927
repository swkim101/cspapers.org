A major problem in automating the design of printed circuit boards and hybrids is an effective method of converting data from engineering documentation into machine readable form. The process is time consuming and error-prone, often representing 30% or more of the total design effort.This paper addresses several methods for capturing data from a schematic or logic diagram, and data entry. Traditional mediums, such as cards and tape, are reviewed. Conventional techniques, such as key-to-disc and key-to-tape are examined, and advanced techniques, such as graphic and voice data entry are also explored. Data conversion from other sources, such as existing wire lists, is also reviewed. The methods, techniques and procedures are investigated in detail.
