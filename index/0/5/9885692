The Order Statistic model of reliability growth offers improved• experimental design, and• flexibility in testing methodologycompared to conventional reliability growth models. It permits prediction of operational reliability without requiring that testing be conducted according to the operation profile of the program input space.This paper presents the first experimental use of the Order Statistic model under a test plan that combines both representative and directed tests. Results suggest that this is an effective way to obtain quantified measures of test quality without abandoning the advantages of directed test methods.
