Each linear fractional term ~(~1 ..... ~ ) ddxl,...,z~) is called a ratio. The SOLF problem appears in the algorithmic solutions for several geometric optimization problems. In layered manufacturing, Majhi et al. [17], [18] showed that the length-optimal supports for a simple nonconvex polygon can be obtained by solving the 1-D SOLF problem on an interval. Arkin et al. [1] formulated the problem of finding a minimum-area starshaped or monotone polygon that contains a simple polygon, which appears in material layout [1], [8], [21] (e.g., cloth manufacturing) and manufacturing [18], as one of optimizing the sum of 2-D fractional polynomials of degrees 3 and 2 under linear constraints. We will show that the objective function of this problem can actually be simplified to the 2-D SOLF form. For the problem of finding optimal penetrations among weighted regions [5], we shall show tha t the L1 and Leo versions of this problem have the 2-D SOLF problem as a key subproblem. The SOLF problem also arises in other areas. For example, in combinatorial optimization, a class of problems on finding a structure with the maximum (or minimum) mean-weight cost can be solved by optimizing some linear fractional functions [23]. In operations research, it was shown in [11], [24] that many economic applications (e.g., maximization of productivity, return on investment, and return/risk) can be reduced to solving the SOLF problem. Quite a few solutions have been given for the SOLF problem [1], [11], [15], [17], [18], [25]. It is interesting to note that the SOLF related problems were originally studied in economic applications, where the number of variables is usually much bigger than the number of fractional terms. As a result, many previous SOLF algorithms were designed to target problems with only a few fractional terms (less than 10) for a reasonable
