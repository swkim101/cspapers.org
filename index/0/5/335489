Landuse classification is an important problem in the remote sensing field. It can be used in a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method fusing edges and regions information for the landuse classification of multispectral images. It mainly includes the steps of image pre-processing, initial segmentation and region merging. Especially, a novel spatial mean shift procedure is proposed so that some information can be extracted and used in the successive steps. Aiming at the multispectral images processing, we also design a band weighting strategy that give a proper weight to each band adoptively according to the region to be processed. Experimental results on the Landsat TM and ETM+ images validate the performance of the proposed method.
