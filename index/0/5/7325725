This paper proposes a new image denoising approach using adaptive signal modeling and adaptive soft-thresholding. It improves the image quality by regularizing all the patches in image based on distribution modeling in transform domain. Instead of using a global model for all patches, it employs content adaptive models to address the non-stationarity of image signals. The distribution model of each patch is estimated individually and can vary for different transform bands and for different patch locations. In particular, we allow the distribution model for each individual patch to have non-zero expectation. To estimate the expectation and variance parameters for the transform bands of a particular patch, we exploit the non-local correlation of image and collect a set of similar patches as data samples to form the distribution. Irrelevant patches are excluded so that this non-local based modeling is more accurate than global modeling. Adaptive soft-thresholding is employed since we observed that the distribution of non-local samples can be approximated by Laplacian distribution. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art denoising methods such as BM3D and CSR in both the PSNR and the perceptual quality.
