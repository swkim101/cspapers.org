Survey class Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) typically rely on Doppler Velocity Logs (DVL) for precise navigation near the seafloor. In cases where the distance to the seafloor is greater than the DVL bottom lock range, localizing between the surface where GPS is available and the seafloor presents a localization problem, since both GPS and DVL are unavailable in the mid-water column. Previous work proposed a solution to navigation in the mid-water column that exploits the stability of the vertical water current profile in space over the minutes scale. With repeated measurements of these currents with the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) mode of the DVL during vertical descent, along with sensor fusion of other low cost sensors, position error growth is constrained to near the initial velocity uncertainty of the vehicle at the sea surface during the dive. Following DVL bottom lock, due to correlations in the joint vehicle and water current velocity estimation, the entire velocity history is further constrained. In this paper a number of extensions are developed to improve navigation performance during missions characterized by prolonged time-scales and horizontal transits. This includes explicitly accounting for the temporal evolution of water currents while revisiting locations and during the re-observation itself, in addition to employing high fidelity spatial models to account for the horizontal water current field. Furthermore, the validity of our method is demonstrated on deep water data sets. Results from the Sentry AUV are presented from a hydrothermal vent flux estimation mission and a surveying mission at Deepwater Horizon, illustrating a real-time dead-reckoning method with results for up to 20 hours.
