This paper presents European Union co-funded projects to advance the development and use of machine translation (MT) that will benefit from the possibilities provided by the Web. Current mass-market and online MT systems are of a general nature and perform poorly for smaller languages and domain specific texts. The ICT-PSP Programme project LetsMT! develops a user-driven machine translation "factory in the cloud" enabling web users to get customized MT that better fits their needs. Harnessing the huge potential of the web together with open statistical machine translation (SMT) technologies LetsMT! has created an innovative online collaborative platform for data sharing and building MT. Users can upload their parallel corpora to an online repository and generate user-tailored SMT systems based on user selected data. FP7 Programme project ACCURAT researches new methods for accumulating more data from the Web to improve the quality of data-driven machine translation systems. ACCURAT has created techniques and tools to use comparable corpora such as news feeds and multinational web pages. Although the majority of these texts are not direct translations, they share a lot of common paragraphs, sentences, phrases, terms and named entities in different languages which are useful for machine translation.
