Although various visualization techniques have been proposed for information retrieval tasks, most of them are based on a single strategy for viewing and navigating through the information space, and vague knowledge such as a fragment of the name of the object is not effective for the search. In contrast, people usually look for things using various vague clues simultaneously. For example, in a library, people can not only walk through the shelves to find a book they have in mind, but also they can be reminded of the authorâ€™s name by viewing the books on the shelf and check the index cards to get more information. To enable such realistic search strategies, we developed a multiple-view information retrieval system where data visualization, keyword search, and category search are integrated with the same smooth zooming interface, and any vague knowledge about the data can be utilized to narrow the search space. Users can navigate through the information space at will, by modifying the search area in each view.
