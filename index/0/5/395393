An Event-Join is mostly used to group several temporal attributes of an entity into a single relation. It combines temporal equi-join components into one operation. The temporal outerjoin component is different than a non-temporal outer-join operations. In this paper, we motivate the need to support the efficient processing of event- joins, and introduce several optimization algorithms, both for a general data organization and for specialized organizations (sorted and append-only databases). For the append-only database we introduce a new data structure, that can improve the performance of event-joins as well as other queries. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. 24 refs., 7 figs., 5 tabs.
