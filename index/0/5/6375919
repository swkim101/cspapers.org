Picking various objects in cluttered narrow space automatically is required for warehouse automation. In this space, multi-fingered robot hands have difficulty in grasping objects as objects are surrounded by obstacles. On the other hand, vacuum grippers have difficulty in grasping various objects stably. In this paper, we propose the Suction Pinching Hand, which has two underactuated fingers and one extendable and foldable suction finger whose fingertip has a suction cup. This hand can grasp objects in cluttered narrow space using the suction finger. In addition, it can grasp various objects stably using suction and pinch at the same time. The ability to grasp various objects stably of this hand is confirmed by tabletop experiments. We also propose a picking strategy using suction and pinch simultaneously in cluttered narrow space. We evaluate our proposed methods with shelf bin picking experiments. With our methods, a robot can pick various objects in cluttered narrow space.
