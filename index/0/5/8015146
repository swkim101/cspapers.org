The computer industry is facing a potential existential crisis: how to continue exponential increases in computing performance and efficiency after the end of transistor size scaling at roughly 5 nm feature sizes, which in principle is only two generations or as little as four years away. This challenge has demanded a great deal of attention from a variety of industrial, government and academic experts in various aspects of computing. In particular, the IEEE Rebooting Computing Initiative has held four Summits at which evolutionary and revolutionary approaches for computing ranging from new types of transistors to new architectures have been proposed and examined. In addition, the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), which for over two decades coordinated the efforts of the semiconductor industry and its supply chain to keep integrated circuits for processors and memory on the path of exponential increases in transistor count, has changed the emphasis of its efforts toward systems and applications, and is collaborating closely with Rebooting Computing. The good news to come out of these efforts is that there are many proposals that have the potential to dramatically improve computer energy efficiency. Now the challenge is to begin a comprehensive research effort that can advance these ideas to the point where they can be implemented or rejected. This effort will require contributions from multiple institutions and disciplines, and will almost certainly involve international cooperation and competition as well. These issues have been recognized recently by the US White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, which announced a new Nanotechnology-Inspired Grand Challenge
