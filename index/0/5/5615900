In this paper, we introduce socially relevant computing as a new way to reinvigorate interest in computer science. Socially relevant computing centers on the use of computation to solve problems that students are most passionate about. It draws on both the solipsistic and altruistic side of the current generation of students. It presents computer science as a cutting-edge technological discipline that empowers them to solve problems of personal interest (socially relevant with a little s), as well as problems that are important to society at large (socially relevant with a capital s). We believe that socially relevant computing offers a vision of computer science that has the potential to improve the quantity, quality and diversity of students in our discipline. We describe preliminary results from two on-going curricular experiments at SUNY Buffalo and at Rice University that implement our vision of socially relevant computing.
