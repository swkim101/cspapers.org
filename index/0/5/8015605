During initial development, KDD solutions often focus heavily on algorithms, architectures, software, hardware, and systems engineering challenges, without first thoroughly exploring how end-users will employ the new KDD technology. As a result of such "system-centered" design, many useless features are implemented that prolong development and significantly add to life cycle cost, while making the system hard to operate and use. This presentation will describe an alternate "user-centered" approach -- borrowed from the consumer products industry -- that can produce KDD solutions with shorter development cycles, lower costs, and much better usability.
