In recent years, cellular networks have experienced an astronomical increase in the use of Short Message Service (SMS), making it a popular communication means for inter-personal as well as content provider-to-person usage. Yet little is known about the traffic and message user behavior in real SMS systems. In this paper, we present a measurement study of SMS based on traces collected from a nationwide cellular carrier during a three-week period. We characterize message traffic at both the message level and the conversation thread level. We also examine the "store-and-forward" mechanism of SMS and present initial measurements on how messages are actually delivered.
