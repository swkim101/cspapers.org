For interactive networked applications like web browsing, every round-trip time (RTT) matters. We introduce ASAP, a new naming and transport protocol that reduces latency by shortcutting DNS requests and eliminating TCP's three-way handshake, while ensuring the key security property of verifiable provenance of client requests. ASAP eliminates between one and two RTTs, cutting the delay of small requests by up to two-thirds.
