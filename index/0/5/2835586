The design of a modular crossbar network that can be used to support a multiprocessor is reviewed in this paper. The network is viewed at a functional level and the objectives, motivations and resultant design decisions are discussed. Two of these decisions relating to the nature and depth of pipelining in the network are examined in detail. The network designed is expandable in an easy fashion, flexible and suitable for large-scale integration.
