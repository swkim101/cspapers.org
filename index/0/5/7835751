This paper deals with the modeling and the control of a dual stator induction generator (DSIG) integrated into a wind energy conversion system with a variable speed wind turbine. DSIG is increasingly used because of its advantages in better reliability and supply division. The objective of this work is to present the application of sliding mode control on a DSIG driven by a wind turbine in the second mode of operating (without wind turbine pitch control) in order to increase the flow of the transited power. Furthermore, the work treats the influence of a voltage dip on the quantities of our system which is the most common cause of energy quality problems. The proposed control is demonstrated through an illustrative simulation.
