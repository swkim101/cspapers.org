In recent years, many new algorithms have been proposed for performing a complete timing analysis of sequential logic circuits. In this paper, we present an incremental timing analysis algorithm. When an incremental design change is made on the logic network, this algorithm will identify the portion of design for which the timing is affected, and quickly derive the new arrival times and slacks. A fast incremental timing analysis is desirable for users doing interactive logic design. It is particularly important for a logic synthesis program, which needs to evaluate the circuit delays under many logic modifications.
