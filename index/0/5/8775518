This paper introduces two well-accepted path-following control methods, namely Vector Field Method (VF) and Line-Of-Sight Method (LOS) for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). We provide a comprehensive study of each algorithm, which includes investigating their mathematical origins, performing simulation evaluations and carrying out real-world field tests in adverse weather conditions. We compare different characteristics of the two methods, and the successful field trial results demonstrate their accuracy and robustness considering unexpected environmental influences. The presented work can assist USV practitioners to decide on a proper strategy for completion of a specific USV mission.
