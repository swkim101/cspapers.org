Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a popular paradigm for designing distributed applications. The existing RPC implementations do not allow special treatment of mobile hosts and wireless links which can be a cause of degraded performance and inconvenience in the presence of disconnections, moves and wireless errors. Future information oriented and location aware mobile applications will also need the ability to dynamically bind mobile clients to local information servers. III this paper we describe M-RPC, which provides a clean way for mob& clients to access existing RPC based services on the wired network with the additional features of dynamic binding, disconnected operation and call retries from the mobility support router (MSR).
