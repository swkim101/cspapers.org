This paper presents an automatic generation system for behavioral test programs of microprocessors. First, the test environment is presented, as well as its consequences on test program generation. In the second part, the test principles are outlined; it is a behavioral test, i.e a test determined from the user's description of the microprocessor; the resulting test programs are quite modular. The third part presents the description language and the generation system.
