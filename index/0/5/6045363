Word segmentation is a challenging issue, and the corresponding algorithms can be used in many applications of natural language processing. This paper addresses the problem of Vietnamese word segmentation, proposes a probabilistic ensemble learning (PEL) framework, and designs a novel PEL-based word segmentation (PELWS) algorithm. Supported by the data structure of syllable-syllable frequency index, the PELWS algorithm combines multiple weak segmenters to form a strong segmenter within the PEL framework. The experimental results show that the PELWS algorithm can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in the Vietnamese word segmentation task.
