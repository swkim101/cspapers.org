We first show how to represent sharp posterior probability distributions using real valued coefficients on broadly-tuned basis functions. Then we show how the precise times of spikes can be used to convey the real-valued coefficients on the basis functions quickly and accurately. Finally we describe a simple simulation in which spiking neurons learn to model an image sequence by fitting a dynamic generative model.
