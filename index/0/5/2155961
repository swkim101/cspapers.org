As people participate in the thousands of global conversations that comprise Usenet news, one thing they do is post their opinions of web resources. Phoaks is a collaborative filtering system that continuously parses, classifies, abstracts and tallies those opinions. About 3,500 users per day consult Phoaks web pages that reflect the results. Phoaks also features a general architecture for building similar collaborative filtering interfaces to conversational data. We report here on the Phoaks resource recommendation interface, the architecture, and the issues and experience that make up its rationale.
