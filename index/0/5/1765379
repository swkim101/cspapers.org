1 The problem The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been widely studied. Given a graph with lengths on its edges, the problem is to find a tour of minimum length that visits every vertex once. One usually makes the assumption that the edge lengths satisfy the triangle inequality, in which case the problem is equivalent to requiring the tour to visit every vertex at least (instead of exactly) once. With the further assumption that the edge lengths are symmetric (in other words, the graph is undirected), it is well-known that the optimum can be approximated to within a factor of 3/2. Without the latter assumption, i.e., when the graph is directed, the best-known approximation is a factor of log n ,[l]. Unfortunately, this algorithm can be nearly logn off from the optimum even when the edge lengths are all 1, and the underlying graph is known to be Hamiltonian. Here we study a linear programming relaxation for the problem. Our main result is that one can find a fractional solution to the relaxation that is very sparse ( with < 3n edges). We also show that in the special case when the underlying graph is Hamiltonian with edge lengths 1 and the (inand out-) degrees of every vertex are each at most 2, a solution to the relaxation can be rounded to an integral solution (a tour) whose length is at most twice the optimum. Note that even this special case of the problem is NP-hard! (and the previous algorithm is 0( $$&) off).
