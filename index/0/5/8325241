Microblog Ad-hoc retrieval has received much attention in recent years. As a result of the high vocabulary diversity of the publishing users, a mismatch is formed between the queries being formulated and the tweets representing the actual topics. In this work, we present a re-ranking approach relying on inter-document relations, which attempts to bridge this gap. Experiments with TREC's Microblog 2012 collection show that including such information in the retrieval process, statistically significantly improves retrieval effectiveness in terms of Precision and MAP, when the baseline performs well as a starting point.
