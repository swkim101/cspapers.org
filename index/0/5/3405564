Recent years have seen a rise in the number of unconventional publishing tools on the Internet. Tools such as wikis, blogs, discussion forums, and web-based content management systems have experienced tremendous rise in popularity and use; primarily because they provide something traditional tools do not: easy of use for non computer-oriented users and they are based on the idea of "collaboration." It is estimated, by pewinternet.org, that 32 million people in the US read blogs (which represents 27% of the estimated 120 million US Internet users) while 8 million people have said that they have created blogs.
