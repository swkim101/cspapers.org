We indicate below the various results in this paper and the sections where these results are fully described. Δ1 is introductory).(Δ2). The partial correctness assertion (PCA) A{α}B is expressed in PDL in the form A → [α]B. We shall consider the question of when a given finite set of PCAs implies another and give optimal complexity bounds. We also give other results of an algebraic nature.(Δ3). DPDL is less well understood than PDL since the filtration technique of F-L that applies to the latter falls for the former. We point out a translation from PDL to DPDL which leads to a lower bound for the latter.(Δ4). What do models of PDL look like? We show the existence of canonical and universal models and show how an infinite model can be related to its F-L factors.
