This special session will present a summary of the recommendations of the First SIGPLAN Workshop on Undergraduate Programming Language Curricula, held at Harvard University in May, 2008. The purpose of the workshop was to generate new recommendations for programming languages topics to be learned by all undergraduate CS majors. In this special session we will present a summary of the curriculum recommendations, why they were made, and ways of incorporating them into undergraduate CS curricula.
