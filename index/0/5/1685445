Behavior of deformable cylindrical actuators is qualitatively investigated with respect to constraint topology. Elastic shells expanded by air pressure have a capability of generating various motion directly by imposing mechanical constraints on the shells. In this paper, we propose a qualitative analysis of the motion of deformable cylindrical actuators with mechanical constraints.
