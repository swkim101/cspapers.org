Compilability is a fundamental property of knowledge representation formalisms which captures how succinctly information can be expressed. A l though many results concerning compilability have been obtained, they are all "worst-case" results. We develop a theory of average-case compilability which allows for the formal comparison and classification of knowledge representation formalisms "on average."
