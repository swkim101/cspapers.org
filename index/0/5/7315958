In this paper, we study the problem of how to maximize the throughput of a multimedia system, given a fixed amount of buffer space and disk bandwidth both pm-determined at design-time. Our approach is to maximize the utilizations of disk and buffers. We propose doing so in two ways. First, we analyze a scheme that allows multiple streams to share buffers. Our analysis and preliminary simulation results indicate that buffer sharing could lead to as much as 50% reduction in total buffer requirements. Second, we develop two prefetching strategies: SP and IP. As will be demonstrated by SP, straightforward prefetching is not effective at all. In contrast, IP, which prefetches more intelligently than does SP, could be valuable in maximizing the effective use of buffers and disk. Our preliminary simulation results show that IP could lead to a 40% improvement in throughput.
