The portfolio is a well-established method for documenting student learning outcomes. This paper presents the development of a web-based interactive programming portfolio methodology at our institution. This methodology allows the reviewer to easily interact with the computer program under review through the use of Java applets. Both an evaluation form as well as detailed rubrics for the evaluation of the portfolio entry is accessible from the web page containing the portfolio entry. These resources allow reviewers to easily submit their feedback electronically to our students.
