A given nonnegative <i>n x n</i> matrix <i>A</i> = (<i>a<inf>ij</inf></i>) is to be scaled, by multiplying its rows and columns by unknown positive multipliers λ<i><inf>i</inf></i> and μ<i><inf>j</inf></i>, such that the resulting matrix (<i>a<inf>ij</inf></i>λ<i><inf>i</inf>μ<inf>j</inf></i>) has specified row and column sums <i>r<inf>i</inf></i> and <i>s<inf>j</inf></i>.
 We give an algorithm that achieves the desired row and column sums with a maximum absolute error ε in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>4</sup>(log <i>n</i> + log <i>h/ε</i>)) steps, where <i>h</i> is the overall total of the result matrix.
 Our algorithm is a scaling algorithm. It solves a sequence of more and more refined discretizations. The discretizations are minimum-cost network flow problems with convex piecewise linear costs. These discretizations are interesting in their own right because they arise in proportional elections.
