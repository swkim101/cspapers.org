The general approach to storing data in such environments is to deploy network storage. Each member can store their data organized to their own likings in their dedicated location on the network. Additionally, users tend to store data in distributed manner such as on private devices, portable storage, or public and private repositories. Adding to this complexity, it is common for university departments to have high fluctuation of staff, resulting in major loss of information and data on an employeeâ€™s departure. A common scenario then is that it is known that certain data has already been created via experiments or simulation. However, it can not be retrieved, resulting in a repetition of generation, which is costly and time-consuming. Additionally, as of recent years, publishers and funding agencies insist on storing, sharing, and reusing existing research data. We show how digital preservation can help group leaders and their employees cope with these issues, by introducing our own archival system OntoRAIS.
