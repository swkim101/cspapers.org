In this paper, we present our Crossword Puzzle Resolution System (SACRY), which exploits syntactic structures for clue reranking and answer extraction. SACRY uses a database (DB) containing previously solved CPs in order to generate the list of candidate answers. Additionally, it uses innovative features, such as the answer position in the rank and aggregated information such as the min, max and average clue reranking scores. Our system is based on WebCrow, one of the most advanced systems for automatic crossword puzzle resolution. Our extensive experiments over our two million clue dataset show that our approach highly improves the quality of the answer list, enabling the achievement of unprecedented results on the complete CP resolution tasks, i.e., accuracy of 99.17%.
