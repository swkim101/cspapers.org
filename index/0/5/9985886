"Zero-knowledge proofs of membership" are methods for proving tha t a string x is in a language L without revealing any additional information. This is a fundamental notion that has proven to be useful and applicable in many settings. Two main variants have been considered in the literature. The first, "zero-knowledge proofs of decision power", consists of methods for proving the knowledge of whether a string x is in a language L or not without revealing any additional information. The second, "result-indistinguishable zero-knowledge proofs of decision", consists of methods for transfering whether a string x is in a language L or not without revealing any additional information. Due to the quite stringent definitions of these two variants, i t seemed tha t the class of languages having zero-knowledge proofs of membership was not as large as any of the classes of languages having zero-knowledge protocols in these two models. In this paper we give strong indications tha t this may not be the case. Our main result is tha t any language having what we call "meet-the challenge" game as a perfect (statistical) zk proof of membership, has also such a perfect (statistical) zk proof in the two "decision proof" models. This can be extended to prove, among other things, tha t honest-verifier statistical zk proof of membership for a language implies a honest-verifier statistical zk protocol in the two "decision" models. Technically, we introduce new protocol techniques, such as "language-based coin' flipping protocols" tha t may have other applications.
