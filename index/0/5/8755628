The University of Dayton, located in Dayton, Ohio, is a “medium-sized, private, coeducational school located in the heart of the Midwest,” with a full-time student body of sixty-five hundred. The University, which is also the fifth largest Catholic college in the country, “includes three schools and the college, offering a large selection of study ranging from art and philosophy to geology and computer science.&rdquo
 The Department of Computer Science, supported by the University's time shared RCA Spectra 70/46 and the department's own IBM 360/25, offers an interesting and challenging undergraduate program. Computer Science students are offered a wide selection of courses, both technical and non-technical, for a four year program and B.S. degree through a very flexible curriculum.
 In addition to the formal course work, the department feels that practical, hands-on experience with real problems in the computer field is highly desirable. Students are encouraged to seek part time or summer jobs as programmers. Some jobs are available at the University computer center and other students are given the opportunity to participate in departmental research projects. Current projects include a high speed compile and go PL/I compiler for the Spectra 70/46, microprogramming extensions to the 360/25, use of an interactive vector graphic crt, and the implementation of LISP on the 70/46.
