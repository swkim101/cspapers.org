An integrated platform which is capable of meeting the requirements of both traditional real-time control processing and multimedia processing has enormous potential for accommodating various kinds of new applications. However, except for the simplest of situations, few, if any, research or commercial systems successfully provide architectural and OS mechanisms which can efficiently support both hard real-time computation and multimedia soft real-time computation. The authors propose a multimedia server execution on multiprocessor real-time operating systems to provide different classes of guarantee to support both types of processing. The multimedia server supports multiple periodic multimedia streams with a capability for graceful QoS degradation during system overload. They (i) develop several multimedia server scheduling algorithms, (ii) evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and (iii) discuss realistic system implementation issues on the SGI IRIX/REACT/PRO operating system.
