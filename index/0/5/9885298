We propose a novel semantic annotation type of assigning truth values to predicate occurrences, and present TruthTeller, a standalone publiclyavailable tool that produces such annotations. TruthTeller integrates a range of semantic phenomena, such as negation, modality, presupposition, implicativity, and more, which were dealt only partly in previous works. Empirical evaluations against human annotations show satisfactory results and suggest the usefulness of this new type of tool for NLP.
