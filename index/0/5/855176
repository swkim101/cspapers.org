Denotational semantics is given for a Java-like language with pointers, subclassing and dynamic dispatch, class oriented visibility control, recursive types and methods, and privilege-based access control. Representation independence (relational parametricity) is proved, using a semantic notion of confinement similar to ones for which static disciplines have been recently proposed.
