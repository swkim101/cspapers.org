In this paper we argue that the extensive number of artifacts created during design processes as well as transitions between physical and digital tools impose both a challenge and opportunity for artifact-mediated collaboration techniques. We present our approach which is based on a cross-device spatial workspace within a computation-augmented design studio setting.
