We present a connectionist architecture and demonstrate that it can learn syntactic parsing from a corpus of parsed text. The architecture can represent syntactic constituents, and can learn generalizations over syntactic constituents, thereby addressing the sparse data problems of previous connectionist architectures. We apply these Simple Synchrony Networks to mapping sequences of word tags to parse trees. After training on parsed samples of the Brown Corpus, the networks achieve precision and recall on constituents that approaches that of statistical methods for this task.
