This paper presents the mechanical design of a modular robot called the 3D M-Block, a 50mm cubic module capable of both independent and lattice-based locomotion. The first M-Blocks described in [1] could pivot about one axis of rotation only. In contrast, the 3D M-blocks can exert on demand both forward and backward torques about three orthogonal axes, for a total of six directions. The 3D M-Blocks transform these torques into pivoting motions which allow the new 3D M-Blocks to move more freely than their predecessors. Individual modules can employ pivoting motions to independently roll across a wide variety of surfaces as well as to join and move relative to other M-Blocks as part of a larger collective structure. The 3D M-Block maintains the same form factor and magnetic bonding system as the one-dimensional M-Blocks [1], but a new fabrication process supports more efficient and precise production. The 3D M-blocks provide a robust and capable modular self-reconfigurable robotic platform able to support swarm robot applications through individual module capabilities and self-reconfiguring robot applications using connected lattices of modules.
