Portolan is a crowdsourcing system, aimed at monitoring and measuring large-scale networks, that uses smartphones as mobile observation elements. Currently, Portolan is able to collect information about both wired and wireless networks, in particular it is used to obtain the graph of the Internet with unprecedented resolution and to associate performance indexes (received signal strength, maximum throughput) of cellular networks to geographic locations.
