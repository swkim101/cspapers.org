We will demonstrate a tabletop robotic agent that learns new tasks through interactive natural language instruction. The tasks to be demonstrated are simple puzzles and games, such as Tower of Hanoi, Eight Puzzle, Tic-Tac-Toe, Three Men's Morris, and the Frog and Toads puzzle. We will include a live, interactive simulation of a mobile robot that learns new tasks using the same system.
