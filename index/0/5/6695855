In this paper a method for relational database storage organization is presented.The method is based upon a disaggregation of the relations and a subsequent reaggregation to form the domains on which the relations are defined.A hierarchical organization of the domain is proposed in order to keep track of the relational entities (i.e. relations, tuples and attributes) that insist on the values present in the domains.Then we introduce an implementation technique, referred to as Data Pool, suitable to be processed by a database machine capable of "on the fly" track processing.Finally we present an analytic evaluation of the DP method and an example of database and query with performance comparison of the DP method with the most common flat file technique.The proposed method appears to be generally advantageous in storage occupancy; in data retrieval operations it is extremely effective when joins between permanent relations are performed. Good performances can be achieved with other relational operations using proper parallel architectures and, when temporary relations are involved, using special purpose devices.
