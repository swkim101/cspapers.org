A fixed-space page replacement algorithm is presented. A variant of FIFO management using a secondary FIFO buffer, this algorithm provides a family of performance curves lying between FIFO and LRU. The implementation is simple, requires no periodic scanning, and uses no special hardware support. Simulations are used to determine the performance of the algorithm for several memory reference traces. Both the fault rates and overhead cost are examined.
