The outline of an introductory FORTRAN programming course based on structured programming is presented. The language IFTRAN was used as a FORTRAN preprocessor, allowing regular FORTRAN statements plus more powerful conditional and looping statements. Program development was taught in the course by means of top-down stepwise refinement. Students were well motivated and developed a professional attitude towards programming.
