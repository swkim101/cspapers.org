The 2nd Workshop on recent advances in behavior prediction and pro-active pervasive computing focuses on contributions that target recent challenges of context prediction and on applications of context prediction. The main challenges are a lack of benchmarks and common data sets, as well as a lack of development frameworks and that the main focus of context prediction still remains location prediction. Since context prediction is a key requirement to enable proactive applications, the workshop aims to intensify the discussion about the state and direction of context prediction research and to facilitate collaboration among research groups focusing on context prediction.
