In order for users to deploy mission-critical applications using distributed object technology, the fragility of ORB implementations is a concern. Also, practical considerations dictate that customers have to deploy objects on existing heterogeneous collections of machines. Therefore, out of necessity, more robust, scalable, and interoperable ORBS will be developed. BIO: Hari Madduri received his M.S. and Ph.D.(â€˜85) degrees in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He has worked on distributed systems, object oriented systems, and fault tolerance for over a decade. He was at Honeywell Research (Minneapolis) for five years working on various distributed systems projects. After joining IBM in April 1990 he worked on an advanced technology project aimed at building an object-oriented compound document toolkit (SOM grew out of this project) as an architect/designer. After that, he worked as the lead architect/designer of the Replication Framework component of the SOM Objects Toolkit. He is currently the lead designer and architect for the next release of DSOM.
