The next frontier of mobility -- from behavioral analysis for the app ecosystem to geolocation on steroids -- presents challenges as tough as the opportunities are expansive. What is the TCP/IP of the Internet of Things era? And who will build it? Hyper-aware smartphones that know you're in the snack aisle are great for retailers, but who's addressing the security implications? The industry is charting its strategic course, but there is an exciting opportunity for researchers and academia to provide the coordinates towards the solutions to mobility's hardest problems. In this keynote, Kit Colbert, Chief Technology Officer for End-User Computing at VMware, will discuss the unsolved challenges in mobility, and the possibilities that will be unlocked when the industry and academia partner on finding the answers.
