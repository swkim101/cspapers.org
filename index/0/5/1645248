Given a metric space <i>G</i> on <i>n</i> nodes, with a start node <i>r</i> and deadlines <i>D(v)</i> for each vertex <i>v</i>, we consider the <i>Deadline-TSP</i> problem of finding a path starting at <i>r</i> that visits as many nodes as possible by their deadlines. We also consider the more general <i>Vehicle Routing with Time-Windows</i> problem, in which each node <i>v</i> also has a release-time <i>R(v)</i> and the goal is to visit as many nodes as possible within their "time-windows" [<i>R(v)</i>,<i>D(v)</i>]. No good approximations were known previously for these problems on general metric spaces. We give an <i>O</i>(log<i>n</i>) approximation algorithm for Deadline-TSP, and extend this algorithm to an <i>O</i>(log<sup>2</sup><i>n</i>) approximation for the Time-Window problem. We also give a bicriteria approximation algorithm for both problems: Given an ε>0, our algorithm produces a (1/ε) approximation, while exceeding the deadlines by a factor of 1+ε. We use as a subroutine for these results a constant-factor approximation that we develop for a generalization of the orienteering problem in which both the start and the end nodes of the path are fixed. In the process, we give a 3-approximation to the orienteering problem, improving on the previously best known 4-approximation of [6].
