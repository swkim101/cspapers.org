In this paper, we propose a framework of multi-modal multi-correlation person-centric news retrieval, which integrates news event correlations, news entity correlations, and event-entity correlations simultaneously by exploring both text and image information. The proposed framework is confined to a person-name query and enables a more vivid and informative person-centric news retrieval by providing two views of result presentation, namely a query-oriented multi-correlation map and a ranking list of news items with necessary descriptions including news image, news title and summary, central entities and relevant news events. First, we pre-process news articles using natural language techniques, and initialize the three correlations by statistical analysis about events and entities in news articles and face images. Second, a Multi-correlation Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (MPMF) algorithm is proposed to complete and refine the three correlations. Different from traditional Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF), the proposed MPFM additionally considers the event correlations and the entity correlations as well as the event-entity correlations during the factor analysis. Third, the result ranking and visualization are conducted to present search results relevant to a target news topic. Experimental results on a news dataset collected from multiple news websites demonstrate the attractive performance of the proposed solution for news retrieval.
