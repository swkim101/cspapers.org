As web applications become more widespread, sophisticated, and complex, automated quality assurance techniques for such applications have grown in importance. Accurate interface identification is fundamental for many of these techniques, as the components of a web application communicate extensively via implicitly-defined interfaces to generate customized and dynamic content. However, current techniques for identifying web application interfaces can be incomplete or imprecise, which hinders the effectiveness of quality assurance techniques. To address these limitations, we present a new approach for identifying web application interfaces that is based on a specialized form of symbolic execution. In our empirical evaluation, we show that the set of interfaces identified by our approach is more accurate than those identified by other approaches. We also show that this increased accuracy leads to improvements in several important quality assurance techniques for web applications: test-input generation, penetration testing, and invocation verification.
