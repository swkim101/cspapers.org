Telecommunication networks process verylarge numbers of events in real time. In this environment, database applications demand both high throughput (at reasonable costs), and predictable, millisecond response times. Conventional disk-based database systems were not designed to meet such requirements. This paper sketches some real-time telecommunications applications, describes their database requirements, and then introduces Sunrise, a specialized, database system for real-time event processing and aggregation in telecommunication. Sunriseâ€™s architecture features shared-nothing parallelism, a mainmemory storage manager (DataBlitz), and a programming tool which allows new services to be authored and installed in an on-line system without interrupting event processing. Sunrise is an industrial-strength system, and has been used as the platform for a number of telecommunication applications with real-time event-processing and aggregation requirements.
