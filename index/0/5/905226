Wearable devices such as Google Glass are receiving increasing attention and look set to become part of our technical landscape over the next few years. At the same time, lifelogging is a topic that is growing in popularity with a host of new devices on the market that visually capture life experience in an automated manner. In this paper, we describe a visual lifelogging solution for Google Glass that is designed to capture life experience in rich visual detail, yet maintain the privacy of unknown bystanders. We present the approach called negative face blurring and evaluate it on a collection of lifelogging data of around nine thousand pictures from Google Glass.
