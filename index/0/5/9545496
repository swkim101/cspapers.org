Concurrency bugs are difficult to debug because of nondeterministic behaviors of concurrent programs. Existing fault-localization techniques for non-deadlock concurrency bugs do not provide the comprehensive information to identify and understand the bugs. Existing automatic fault-fix techniques for concurrency bugs do not provide confidence that the fault has been fixed. To address the limitations of existing techniques, this research will develop techniques that will assist developers in several aspects of debugging, from finding the locations of concurrency bugs to providing confidence after the fix. The expected contributions of this research include a fault-localization technique that locates concurrency bugs, a fault-comprehension technique that assists understanding of bugs, a fix-confidence technique that provides confidence of fixes, and a framework that implements the techniques and that is used to perform empirical studies to evaluate the techniques.
