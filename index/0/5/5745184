Key challenges in the performance estimation of distributed real-time embedded (DRE) systems include the systematic measurement of coverage by simulations, and the automated generation of directed test vectors. This paper investigates how DRE systems can be represented as discrete event systems (DES) in continuous time, and proposes an automated method for the performance evaluation of such systems. The proposed method also provides a way for the verification of dense time properties for a large class of DRE systems. This approach provides a formal executable model allowing to bridge the gap between simulations and formal verification. Our results show that the proposed DES-based evaluation method can achieve better coverage in large-scale DRE systems than alternative methods.
