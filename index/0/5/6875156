This paper gives a generalized overview of RESEDA, an interactive question answering system designed primarily for use by historians. Its data base consists of historical information, which attemps to describe the attitudes, political, religious and interpersonal, of the chief characters of the period. Question answering is done by search of the data base and by inference on the information therein. The difficulties of representing this type of data and of formulating inference rules dealing with human motivations and attitudes is also discussed.
