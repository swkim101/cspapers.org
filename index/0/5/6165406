Large knowledge bases consisting of entities and relationships between them have become vital sources of information for many applications. Most of these knowledge bases adopt the Semantic-Web data model RDF as a representation model. Querying these knowledge bases is typically done using structured queries utilizing graph-pattern languages such as SPARQL. However, such structured queries require some expertise from users which limits the accessibility to such data sources. To overcome this, keyword search must be supported. In this paper, we propose a retrieval model for keyword queries over RDF graphs. Our model retrieves a set of subgraphs that match the query keywords, and ranks them based on statistical language models. We show that our retrieval model outperforms the-state-of-the-art IR and DB models for keyword search over structured data using experiments over two real-world datasets.
