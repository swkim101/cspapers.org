Many production systems have split and merge operations to increase production capacity and variety, improve product quality, and implement product control and scheduling policies. In this paper, we present analytical methods to model and analyze Bernoulli production systems with circulate and priority split/merge policies. The recursive procedures for performance analysis are derived, the convergence of the procedures and uniqueness of the solutions, along with the structural properties, are proved analytically, and the accuracy of the estimation is justified numerically with high precision.
