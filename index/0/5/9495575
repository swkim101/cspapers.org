This paper targets on enhancing Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) by exploiting category labels. Specifically, in the term-document matrix, the vector for each term either appearing in labels or semantically close to labels is scaled before performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to boost its impact on the generated left singular vectors. As a result, the similarities among documents in the same category are increased. Furthermore, an adaptive scaling strategy is designed to better utilize the hierarchical structure of categories. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to significantly improve the performance of hierarchical text categorization.
