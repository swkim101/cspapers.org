In the present global society, information has to be exchangeable in open and dynamic environments, where interacting peers do not necessarily share a common understanding of the world at hand, and do not have a complete picture of the context where the interaction occurs. In this paper, we present the Esteem approach and the related peer architecture for emergent semantics in dynamic and multi-knowledge environments. In Esteem, semantic communities are built around declared interests in the form of manifesto ontologies, and their autonomous nature is preserved by allowing a shared semantics to naturally emerge from peer interactions.
