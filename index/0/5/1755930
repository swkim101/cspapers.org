The constant growth of data in all businesses leads to bigger database servers. While peak load times require fast and heavyweight hardware to guarantee performance, idle times are a waste of energy and money. Todays DBMSs have the ability to cluster several servers for performance and fault tolerance. Nevertheless, they do not support dynamic powering of the cluster's nodes based on the current workload.
 In this demo, we propose a newly developed DBMS running on clustered commodity hardware, which is able to dynamically power nodes. The demo allows the user to interact with the DBMS and adjust workloads, while the cluster's reaction is shown in real-time.
