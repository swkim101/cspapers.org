Graphical User Interface (GUI) APplications (GAPs) are ubiquitous and provide various services. Since many GAPs are not designed to exchange information (i.e., interoperate), companies replace legacy GAPs with web services, that are designed to interoperate over the Internet. However, it is laborious and inefficient to create unit test cases to test the web services. We propose to demonstrate a SysteM for Application Reference Testing (SMART) novel approach for generating tests for web services from legacy GAPs. During demonstration of Smart we will show how this tool enables nonprogrammers to generate unit test cases for web services by performing drag-and-drop operations on GUI elements of legacy GAPs. We published a research paper that describes our approach and the results of the evaluation of Smart [2].
