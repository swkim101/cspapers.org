An efficient algorithm is presented to achieve a conflict-free round-robin access scheme for use in a local area communication network based on the architecture of a Bidirectional Broadcast System to which an unidirectional control wire is added. This algorithm has its origins in the access control algorithm A2 proposed in [1], but it achieves a more efficient use of the bus bandwidth. In fact the time required to switch from one active station to the next in a round is of the order of signal detection time and is independent of the end-to-end network propagation delay.
