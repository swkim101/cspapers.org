This work explores the stabilization of desired dynamic motion tasks involving hard impacts at non-negligible speed for humanoid robots. To this end, a so-called reference spreading hybrid control law is designed showing promising results in simulation. The simulations are performed employing a dynamical model of an existing humanoid robot and impacts are assumed to be inelastic. The desired motion task consists of having the robot balancing on one foot while repeatedly making and breaking contact with a wall by means of one hand. The simulation results illustrate that the considered controller is suited to control humanoid robot motions with impacts.
