Rapid development of bike-sharing systems has brought people enormous convenience during the past decade. On the other hand, high transport flexibility comes with dynamic distribution of shared bikes, leading to an unbalanced bike usage and growing maintenance cost. In this paper, we consider to rebalance bicycle utilization by means of directing users to different stations. For the first time, we devise a trip advisor that recommends bike check-in and check-out stations with joint consideration of service quality and bicycle utilization. From historical data, we firstly identify that biased bike usage is rooted from circumscribed bicycle circulation among few active stations. Therefore, with defined station activeness, we optimize the bike circulation by leading users to shift bikes between highly active stations and inactive ones. We extensively evaluate the performance of our design through real-world datasets. Evaluation results show that the percentage of frequent used bikes decreases by 33.6% on usage number and 28.6% on usage time.
