This paper describes a set of experiments carried out to explore the domain dependence of alternative supervised Word Sense Disambiguation algorithms. The aim of the work is threefold: studying the performance of these algorithms when tested on a different corpus from that they were trained on; exploring their ability to tune to new domains, and demonstrating empirically that the Lazy-Boosting algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art supervised WSD algorithms in both previous situations.
