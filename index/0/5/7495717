Obesity is a growing problem affecting millions of people. Various behavior change programs have been designed to reduce its prevalence. An Australian supermarket has recently run a web-based health program to motivate people to eat healthily and do more physical activity. The program offered discounts on fresh products and a website, HealthierU, providing interactive support tools for participants. The stakeholders desire to evaluate if the program is effective and if the supporting website is useful to facilitate behavior changes. To answer these questions, in this work we propose a method to: (1) model individual purchase rate from sparse recorded transactions through a mixture of Non-Homogeneous Poisson Processes (NHPP), (2) design criteria for partitioning participants based on their interactions with the HealthierU website, (3) evaluate the program impact by comparing behavior changes across different groups of participants. Our case study shows that during the program the participants significantly increased their purchases of some fresh products. Both the distribution of behavior patterns and impact scores show that the program imposed relatively strong impact on the participants who logged activities and tracked weights. Our method can facilitate the enhancement of personalized health programs, especially aiming to maximize the program impact and targeting participants through web or mobile applications.
