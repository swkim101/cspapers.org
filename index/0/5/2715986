We explore fundamental performance limits of tracking a target in a two-dimensional field of binary proximity sensors, and design algorithms that attain those limits. In particular, using geometric and probabilistic analysis of an idealized model, we prove that the achievable spatial resolution Δ in localizing a target's trajectory is of the order of 1overρ R, where R is the sensing radius and ρ is the sensor density per unit area. Using an Occam's razor approach, we then design a geometric algorithm for computing an economical (in descriptive complexity) piecewise linear path that approximates the trajectory within this fundamental limit of accuracy. We employ analogies between binary sensing and sampling theory to contend that only a "lowpass" approximation of the trajectory is attainable, and explore the implications of this obervation for estimating the target's velocity.We show through simulation the effectiveness of the geometric algorithm in tracking both the trajectory and the velocity of the target for idealized models. For non-ideal sensors exhibiting sensing errors, the geometric algorithm can yield poor performance. We show that non-idealities can be handled well using a particle filter based approach, and that geometric post-processing of the output of the Particle Filter algorithm yields an economical path description as in the idealized setting. Finally, we report on our lab-scale experiments using motes with acoustic sensors to validate our theoretical and simulation results.
