This paper describes an application of one of the important abstract concepts taught in a compiler construction course. It demonstrates how the techniques behind the bottom-up SLR parser can be used to perform computer animation. The different phases of the implementation presented are identical to the ones used by the traditional compiler for parsing source codes written in high-level languages. This application can be used either to explain the different phases of the traditional compiler, or as an illustration of the bottom-up SLR parsing techniques applied in a non-traditional environment.
