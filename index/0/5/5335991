We analyze the behavior of hill-climbing algorithms for the minimum bisection problem on instances drawn from the “planted bisection” random graph model, Gn,p,q, previously studied in [3, 4, 10, 11, 14, 9, 7]. This is one of the few problem distributions for which various popular heuristic methods, such as simulated annealing, have been proven to succeed. However, it has been open whether these sophisticated methods were necessary, or whether simpler heuristics would also work. Juels [14] made the first progress towards an answer by showing that simple hill-climbing does suffice for very wide separations between p and q.
Here we give a more complete answer. A simple, polynomial-time, hill-climbing algorithm for this problem is given and shown to succeed in finding the planted bisection with high probability if p - q = &OHgr; (n-½ln3n). For dense graphs, this matches the condition for optimality of the planted bisection to within a polylogarithmic factor. Furthermore, we show that a generic randomized hill-climbing algorithm succeeds in finding the planted bisection in polynomial time if p - q = &OHgr; (n-¼ ln3 n), for any ∈ > 0. This algorithm, studied also by [14], is a degenerate case of both Metropolis and go-with-the-winners, and the range here properly includes those analyzed in [11, 9, 14]. So this result implies, extends, and unifies those from [11, 9, 14]. Thus, to get a provable distinction between simulated annealing and hill-climbing for natural problems will require considerable progress both on new positive results for SA and new negative results for hill-climbing methods.
