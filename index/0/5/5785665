The use of case library techniques to direct new designs for auto industry is becoming increasing widespread. In this paper, we use a genetic algorithm to realize a quick match with the best case, which can satisfy the intelligence request of the case library. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can greatly increase the efficiency of searching for the best case. Additionally, this paper presents a novel framework of auto-body panel die-design case library based on grid. By using grid technology, it has solved the principal problems existing in current case libraries. Consequently, we anticipate that this work will have a broad application in the making of auto-body panel dies.
