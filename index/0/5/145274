In this paper, we propose a novel structural correlation filter (SCF) model for robust visual tracking. The proposed SCF model takes part-based tracking strategies into account in a correlation filter tracker, and exploits circular shifts of all parts for their motion modeling to preserve target object structure. Compared with existing correlation filter trackers, our proposed tracker has several advantages: (1) Due to the part strategy, the learned structural correlation filters are less sensitive to partial occlusion, and have computational efficiency and robustness. (2) The learned filters are able to not only distinguish the parts from the background as the traditional correlation filters, but also exploit the intrinsic relationship among local parts via spatial constraints to preserve object structure. (3) The learned correlation filters not only make most parts share similar motion, but also tolerate outlier parts that have different motion. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on challenging benchmark image sequences demonstrate that the proposed SCF tracking algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods.
