One significant challenge in bringing the power of parallel machines to application programmers is providing them with a suite of software tools similar to the tools that sequential programmers currently utilize. In particular, automatic or semi-automatic testing tools for parallel programs are lacking. This paper describes our work in automatic generation of all-du-paths for testing parallel programs. Our goal is to demonstrate that, with some extension, sequential test data adequacy criteria are still applicable to parallel program testing. The concepts and algorithms in this paper have been incorporated as the foundation of our DELaware PArallel Software Testing Aid, della pasta.
