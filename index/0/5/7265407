In recent years, new developments in genetics have generated a lot of interest in genomic and proteomic data, investing international significance (and competition) in the fledgling discipline of bioinformatics. Researchers in pharmaceutical and biotech companies have found that database products can bring a wide range of relevant technologies to bear on their problems. Benefiting from a number of new technology enhancements, Oracle has emerged as a popular platform for pharmaceutical knowledge management and bioinformatics. We look at four powerful technologies that show promise for solving hitherto intractable problems in bioinformatics: the extensibility architecture to store gene sequence data natively and perform high-dimensional structure-searches in the database; warehousing technologies and data mining on genetic patterns; data integration technologies to enable heterogeneous queries across distributed biological sources, and internet portal technologies that allow life sciences information to be published and managed across intranets and the internet.
