While recent advances in graphics, display, and computer hardware support ultra-scale visualizations of a tremendous amount of data sets, mechanisms for interacting with this information on large high-resolution wall displays are still under investigation. Different issues in terms of user interface, ergonomics, multi-user interaction, and system flexibility arise while facing ultra-scale wall displays and none of the introduced approaches fully address them. We introduce HIPerPaper, a novel digital pen and paper interface that enables natural interaction with the HIPerSpace wall, a 31.8 by 7.5 foot tiled wall display of 268,720,000 pixels. HIPerPaper provides a flexible, portable, and inexpensive medium for interacting with large high-resolution wall displays.
