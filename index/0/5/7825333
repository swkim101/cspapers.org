AGM theory is the most influential formal account of belief revision. Nevertheless, there are some issues with the original proposal. In particular, Parikh has pointed out that completely irrelevant information may be affected in AGM revision. To remedy this, he proposed an additional axiom (P) aiming to capture (ir)relevance by a notion of syntax splitting. In this paper we generalize syntax splitting from logical sentences to epistemic states, a step which is necessary to cover iterated revision. The generalization is based on the notion of marginalization of epistemic states. Furthermore, we study epistemic syntax splitting in the context of ordinal conditional functions. Our approach substantially generalizes the semantical treatment of (P) in terms of faithful preorders recently presented by Peppas and colleagues.
