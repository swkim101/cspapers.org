This paper presents and discusses examples of mechanical i n fe rence problems which must be so lved in order to cons t ruc t e f f e c t i v e mechanical speech understanding systems. The examples are taken from incrementa l s imu la t i ons of a p ro to t ype speech understanding system which w i l l use s y n t a c t i c , semant ic , and pragmat ic i n f o r m a t i o n as w e l l as a c o u s t i c a l and phono log ica l i n f o r m a t i o n to mechanica l ly "unders tand" cont inuous speech u t t e rances . I n t r o d u c t i o n In experiments in spectrogram read ing [1] the performance obta ined by human exper ts f o r phonet ic segmentat ion and l a b e l i n g w i t h o u t conscious appeal to s y n t a c t i c , semant ic , o r vocabulary c o n s t r a i n t s was: approx imate ly 75% o f the segments c o r r e c t l y labe led (w i t h e i t h e r a complete or a p a r t i a l phonet ic s p e c i f i c a t i o n ) , 15% m is l abe led , and 10% segments missed. The f a c t t h a t human exper ts w i t h years o f exper ience i n l ook ing a t spectrograms and a d e t a i l e d understanding of the acous t i c c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of speech sounds f i n d i t imposs ib le t o un ique ly decide which o f seve ra l poss ib l e phonemes are present in a g i ven segment o f speech s i g n a l , and the f a c t t h a t they make a s i g n i f i c a n t number of e r r o r s i n bo th segmenting the s i g n a l i n t o phonet ic u n i t s and in the l a b e l i n g o f these u n i t s , make i t u n l i k e l y t h a t any mechanical a c o u s t i c a l process ing component w i l l be ab le to segment and l a b e l cont inuous speech s i gna l s w i t h very h igh r e l i a b i l i t y us ing on ly acous t i c i n f o r m a t i o n . Moreover, i t i s l i k e l y t h a t t h i s indeterminacy in the acous t i c domain is a fundamental p rope r t y of human speech and not j u s t an inadequacy in the ana lyzer . However, in the same exper iments , when the spectrogram reader used s y n t a c t i c , semant ic , and vocabulary c o n s t r a i n t s to a t tempt to i d e n t i f y the words in the sentences (using a computer ized word r e t r i e v a l r o u t i n e which f a c i l i t a t e d the vocabulary searches) the success r a t e f o r word i d e n t i f i c a t i o n was 963. There i s hope t h e r e f o r e t h a t w i t h the proper use of s y n t a c t i c , semant ic , and vocabulary c o n s t r a i n t s one cou ld b u i l d a system to understand cont inuous speech at a comparable l e v e l even though the acous t i c segmenter and l a b e l e r operates w i t h a s i g n i f i c a n t e r r o r r a t e . O f cou rse , i n both the i n i t i a l segmentat ion and l a b e l i n g and in the subsequent a p p l i c a t i o n of s y n t a c t i c and semantic c o n s t r a i n t s , the a t ta inment w i t h a mechanical a l g o r i t h m of performance comparable to t h a t of a human is no sma l l t a s k . The BBN Speech P r o j e c t The speech p r o j e c t at B o l t Beranek and Newman [ 2 , 5 , 6 ] is endeavoring to cons t ruc t a computer system which approaches the performance of human spectrogram readers at dec ipher ing the meaning of cont inuous spoken sentences. The task o f t h i s system w i l l be to "unders tand" spoken sentences and take a p p r o p r i a t e a c t i o n s . Note t h a t t h i s task does not i nc l ude producing an accura te phonet ic t r a n s c r i p t i o n o f the i n p u t o r even necessa r i l y an accura te l i s t o f the successive words o f the i n p u t (a l though i t would be hard to imagine i t g e t t i n g the a p p r o p r i a t e a c t i o n i f i t d i d no t i n f a c t i d e n t i f y most o f the words ) . What we are emphasizing here is t h a t i n a s i t u a t i o n i n which the acous t i cs i s unable to r e s o l v e the d e c i s i o n between two phonemes or between two words at some p o i n t in the sentence, bu t the remain ing components are ab le to dec ide the meaning o f the sentence in any case ( e . g . the meaning is the same rega rd less of which phoneme or word is chosen) , then the sentence w i l l be deemed to have been c o r r e c t l y unders tood. I t i s t h i s d i f f e r e n c e between what is r equ i red f o r a c o r r e c t ou tpu t t h a t d i s t i n g u i s h e s what the members of the ARPA speech p r o j e c t [3] have been c a l l i n g "speech unders tand ing" from the more t r a d i t i o n a l "speech r e c o g n i t i o n " . By examining the t e l e t y p e p ro toco l s of the K l a t t and Stevens exper iment [ 1 ] , we were ab le to gather cons iderab le i n f o r m a t i o n about the problem s o l v i n g processes and s t r a t e g i e s which those researchers used to untangle the meanings of spectrograms. On the bas is of these p r o t o c o l s one can concep tua l l y decompose the speech understanding process i n t o a number o f components or r o u t i n e s corresponding to d i f f e r e n t types o f knowledge and i n fe rence techniques a p p l i e d . These components i nc luded (1) EXTRACT, the r o u t i n e which performs the phonet ic segmentat ion and l a b e l i n g of the acous t i c s i g n a l (both segmenting and l a b e l i n g are i n t i m a t e l y cross connected) , (2) LEXRET, a l e x i c a l r e t r i e v a l r o u t i n e which recovers p o s s i b l e words from the vocabulary on the bas is o f p a r t i a l phone t i c i n f o r m a t i o n ( t h i s component was machine implemented in the K l a t t and Stevens exper imen t ) , (3) MATCH, a r o u t i n e which compares a g i ven cand ida te word aga ins t the speech s i g n a l at a g iven p o i n t and determines the q u a l i t y o f the match ( t h i s component i s in tended to i nc l ude the use o f phono log i ca l and a c o u s t i c p h o n e t i c r u l e s f o r
