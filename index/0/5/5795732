Computational Grids offer the promise of harnessing vast computing resources on a global scale for computationallyintensive tasks. While many uses are envisioned, data analysis and simulation by computational scientists seems to be the initial killer application. The data-intensive nature of modern scientific applications is driving a rethinking of basic grid architecture and tools. In emerging grid systems data management is a primary concern. Modern Grid efforts, such as the Grid Physics Network (GriPhyN) [1], are recognizing the importance of databases for data management, but have refrained from using database technology as a core paradigm. As part of the GriPhyN project we are exploring a deeper integration of grid and database technologies. We have developed GridDB, which is a system that provides a relational interface to Grid services. Our goal is to investigate the benefits of a declarative, data-centric interface that hides the complex workflows of procedural programs and non-relational data typically found in Grid data analysis. In this demonstration, we show an initial version of the GridDB system and highlight some of the advantages of our approach.
