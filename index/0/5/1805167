The research proposed here concentrates on the problem of designing and developing a spoken query retrieval (SQR) system to access large document databases via voice. The main challenge is to identify and address issues related to designing an effective and efficient speech user interface (SUI), especially if the aim is to facilitate spoken queries of large document databases. Furthermore, the task of presenting large query result sets aurally should be performed such that the user's short term memory is not overloaded. In this paper, a framework allowing information retrieval to large document databases via voice is presented and findings from a research study using the framework will be discussed as well.
