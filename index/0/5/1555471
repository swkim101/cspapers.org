In this paper, a modified power factor correction (PFC) converter based on Sheppard-Taylor PFC converter is proposed, and operation principle of this converter is studied. Compared with conventional Sheppard-Taylor converter, proposed converter has many advantages such as less ripple of input current and increased output voltage, which improves Sheppard-Taylor converter operation considerably. Finally, sliding mode control is applied to proposed converter and obtained results are studied.
