This paper employs the Human-Inspired Control framework in the formal design, optimization and implementation of controllers for 3D bipedal robotic walking. In this framework, controllers drive the robot to a low-dimensional representation, termed the partial hybrid zero dynamics, which is shaped by the parameters of the outputs describing human locomotion data. The main result of this paper is the use of partial hybrid zero dynamics in an optimization problem to compute physical constraints on the robot, without integrating the dynamics of the system, and while simultaneously yielding provably stable walking controllers for a 3D robot model. Controllers corresponding to various walking speeds are obtained through a second speed regulation optimization, and formal methods are presented which provide smooth transitions between walking speeds. These formal results are demonstrated through simulation and utilized to obtain 3D walking experimentally with the NAO robot.
