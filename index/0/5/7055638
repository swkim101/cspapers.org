Graph based semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods play an increasingly important role in practical machine learning systems. A crucial step in graph based SSL methods is the conversion of data into a weighted graph. However, most of the SSL literature focuses on developing label inference algorithms without extensively studying the graph building method and its effect on performance. This article provides an empirical study of leading semi-supervised methods under a wide range of graph construction algorithms. These SSL inference algorithms include the Local and Global Consistency (LGC) method, the Gaussian Random Field (GRF) method, the Graph Transduction via Alternating Minimization (GTAM) method as well as other techniques. Several approaches for graph construction, sparsification and weighting are explored including the popular k-nearest neighbors method (kNN) and the b-matching method. As opposed to the greedily constructed kNN graph, the b-matched graph ensures each node in the graph has the same number of edges and produces a balanced or regular graph. Experimental results on both artificial data and real benchmark datasets indicate that b-matching produces more robust graphs and therefore provides significantly better prediction accuracy without any significant change in computation time.
