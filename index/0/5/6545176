Conducting an Internet measurement study in a sound fashion can be much more difficult than it might first appear. We present a number of strategies drawn from experiences for avoiding or overcoming some of the pitfalls. In particular, we discuss dealing with errors and inaccuracies; the importance of associating <i>meta-data</i> with measurements; the technique of calibrating measurements by examining outliers and testing for consistencies; difficulties that arise with large-scale measurements; the utility of developing a discipline for reliably reproducing analysis results; and issues with making datasets publicly available. We conclude with thoughts on the sorts of tools and community practices that can assist researchers with conducting sound measurement studies.
