The emerging Phase Change Memory (PCM) technology exhibits excellent scalability and density potentials. At the same time, they require high current and high voltages to switch cell states. Their working voltages are provided by CMOS-compatible on-chip charge pumps (CPs). Unfortunately, CPs and particularly those for RESET, have a large parasitic power (a dominant component in total power loss) during operations, which significantly degrades their energy efficiency. In addition, CPs seriously suffer from the Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) problem due to their boosted operation voltage. To maintain a reasonable lifetime of CPs, existing solutions actively switch them on per-operation basis, resulting in large performance degradation. In this paper, we address the above issues through two designs - Reset_Sch (RESET scheduling) and CP_Sch (CP scheduling). Reset_Sch schedules when to perform a RESET for different cells upon writing a PCM line. It significantly reduces the power loss, and peak working power of RESET CP. CP_Sch incorporates a fast READ CP design to provide fast charge-up time for reads and minimize performance penalty. Our experimental results show that on average, 70%of power loss for RESET CP can be reduced; and performance loss can be reduced from 16% to 2% while achieving a 16% improvement in reliability.
