Capability leak is a vulnerability in Android applications, which violates the enforcement of permission model and threatens the secure usage of Android phone users. Malicious applications can launch permission escalation attacks with this vulnerability. In this paper, we propose a dynamic Intent fuzzing mechanism to uncover vulnerable applications in both Android markets and closed source ROMs. We built a prototype called IntentFuzzer. With it, we analyzed more than 2000 Android applications in Google Play and hundreds of in-rom applications inside two closed source ROMs. We found that 161 applications in Google Play have at least one permission leak, and 26 permissions in Xiaomi Hongmi phone and 19 permissions in Lenovo K860i stock phone are leaked. Finally, we give several cases of exploitation to verify our analysis result.
