This paper describes an event trace monitor implemented on Version 1.6 of the VMS operating system at Purdue University. Some necessary VMS terminology is covered first. The operation of the data gathering mechanism is then explained, and the events currently being gathered are listed. A second program, which reduces the data gathered by the monitor to usable form, is next examined, and some examples depicting its operation are given. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of some of the monitor's uses.
