Modern descriptors like HOG and SIFT are now commonly used in vision for pattern detection within image and video. From a signal processing perspective, this detection process can be efficiently posed as a correlation/ convolution between a multi-channel image and a multi-channel detector/filter which results in a single channel response map indicating where the pattern (e.g. object) has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for learning a multi-channel detector/filter efficiently in the frequency domain, both in terms of training time and memory footprint, which we refer to as a multichannel correlation filter. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy, we evaluate it across a number of visual detection/ localization tasks where we: (i) exhibit superior performance to current state of the art correlation filters, and (ii) superior computational and memory efficiencies compared to state of the art spatial detectors.
