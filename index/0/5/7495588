A previously developed 3 axis mini direct drive robot has been enhanced with two additional direct drive axes for general positioning and orientation of an axially symmetric tool. The arm has a work volume of about 50 cc and will have 5-10 micron or better resolution and repeatability. The arm forms an initial prototype for the NASA/University of Washington MicroTrex flight telerobotics experiment. The contemplated terrestrial applications include handling sub-microliter liquid samples for electrophoresis, and micro-manipulation with scaled force reflection.<<ETX>>
