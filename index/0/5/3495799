While 57% of US undergraduate degrees are awarded to women, women account for only 18% of computer science and related degrees. Studies of recent interventions have shown promise in increasing the number of women who choose to major or minor in computing or related disciplines. Two key findings from this research indicate the promising impact of high school outreach and providing a "mission driven" context for computer science for young women. We will present early findings from Summer Guild, a two-week immersive experience for rising freshman women offered in the summer between graduation from high school and the start of their first year of college. During this experiential learning program, students are engage in a compressed digital product development lifecycle including all of the elements of design thinking, prototyping and iteration in the context of a real-world civic or business challenge. In addition, they gain an introduction to Python and work with professional developers to build their digital solutions. We present the results of changes in student's self-reported attitudes, academic plans and acquisition of computing skills based on pre- and post-surveys, a selection and analysis of qualitative data provided by students via daily exit tickets, and the number of students registered for computer science or related classes during their freshman year.
