In this paper, we will describe the TSI (Teething ring Sound Instrument), a new sound instrument given to babies, which consists of a teething ring, a knob, an I-CubeX Digitizer [1] and a computer which processes MIDI messages. The TSI is designed to bring music experience to baby with the movement of the babies reflex sucking motion. We provided the TSI to a baby and observed her action to the TSI and her reaction to the generated sound. This experiment showed the high potential of the TSI.
