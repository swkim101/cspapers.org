Comparative evaluation of Machine Learning (ML) systems used for Information Extraction (IE) has suffered from various inconsistencies in experimental procedures. This paper reports on the results of the Pascal Challenge on Evaluating Machine Learning for Information Extraction, which provides a standardised corpus, set of tasks, and evaluation methodology. The challenge is described and the systems submitted by the ten participants are briefly introduced and their performance is analysed.
