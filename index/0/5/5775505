Programmable design environments (PDEs) are computational environments that integrate the conceptual frameworks and components of (a) design environments and (b) programmable applications. The integration of these two approaches provides elements (such as software "critics" and "query-able objects") that assist users in learning both the application and its domain; in addition, an interactive "appl ic ation-enriched" end-user programming environment stresses the values of expressiveness and modifiability_ By way of illustration, we present a newly-developed programmable design environment, SchemeChart, for the domain of charting and information displays.
