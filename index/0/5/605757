Ptool is designed to provide low overhead, high performance management of persistent objects. It provides scalable access to large numbers of objects by supporting multi-level caching and migration within a multilevel storage hierarchy. The physical design of ptool is based upon three concepts: segments, folios and stores. A segment is a continuous range of virtual memory that is managed by ptool. A segment may contain one or more objects or a piece of a large object. A folio is a physical collection of segments. A store is a physical collection of folios. Folios are maintained by ptool as files. Ptool contains three different managers. The Persistent Object Manager uses the virtual memory system and mapping to manage persistent objects. The Segment Cache Manager uses the virtual memory system to map segments from a local disk to virtual memory. The Folio Cache Manager manages segments and folios from network storage and hierarchical storage to local
