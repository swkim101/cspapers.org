A new sort algorithm, called AlphaSort, demonstrates that commodity processors and disks can handle commercial batch workloads. Using Alpha AXP processors, commodity memory, and arrays of SCSI disks, AlphaSort runs the industry-standard sort benchmark in seven seconds. This beats the best published record on a 32-cpu 32-disk Hypercube by 8:1. On another benchmark, AlphaSort sorted more than a gigabyte in a minute.
AlphaSort is a cache-sensitive memory-intensive sort algorithm. It uses file striping to get high disk bandwidth. It uses QuickSort to generate runs and uses replacement-selection to merge the runs. It uses shared memory multiprocessors to break the sort into subsort chores.
Because startup times are becoming a significant part of the total time, we propose two new benchmarks: (1) Minutesort: how much can you sort in a minute, and (2) DollarSort: how much can you sort for a dollar.
