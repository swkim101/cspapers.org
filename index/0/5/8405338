One of the most essential parameters of any information retrieval system is the time taken to retrieve answers to particular queries submitted to it. This quantity is especially important for information systems with large-sized document collections and/or in cases when immediate response to the user's query is required (for example, in on-line information retrieval systems). As a result of investigations aimed at shortening the retrieval time, a number of information retrieval methods have been developed (see, for example, Salton, 1968, 1971, 1975; van Rijsbergen, 1979). Among them one can distinguish a class of numerous information retrieval methods based on the clustering of document representations. In these cases the mutual similarity between document representations, determined in a direct way, is used to cluster the document representations. An alternative competitive class utilises previously created clusters of search request formulations for clustering the document representations. For simplicity, in the subsequent sections the clustering of document representations and search request formulations will be identified with the clustering of documents and queries, respectively. Information retrieval methods of the latter type developed some years ago (Lesser, 1966; Salton, 1968, 1975; Worona, 1971; Yu, 1974) can be applied only to those information systems in which both search request formulations and document representations are sets of
