Recently there has been increasing research on the development of autonomous flying vehicles.Whereas most of the proposed approaches are suitable for outdoor operation, only a few techniques have been designed for indoor environments. In this paper we present a general system consisting of sensors and algorithms which enables a small sized flying vehicle to operate indoors. This is done by adapting techniques which have been successfully applied on ground robots. We released our system as open-source with the intention to provide the community with a new framework for building applications for indoor flying robots. We present a set of experiments to validate our system on an open source quadrotor.
