Briefly, an example of a resolution plan can be described as follows: Let L1 ∨ A and L2 ∨ B be two clauses, where L1 and L2 are literals, and A and B are clauses. If L1 and L2 can be made complementary by some substitution, we shall call A ∨ B (L1,L2) a resolution plan. In general, a resolution plan is represented by C (LI,MI)...(Lr, Mr), where LI, MI,..., Lr, Mr are literals, and C is a clause. If C is empty, (L1,M1)...(Lr,Mr) is called a total plan. The total plan corresponds to a proof if there is a unifier which simultaneously make (Li,Mi) complementary, i = l,...,r. As shown elsewhere, the total plan approach can eliminate redundancies. In this paper, we shall show that all the strategies developed for resolution can be used to generate total plans.
