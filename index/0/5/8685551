Modern CPUs employ Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to boost performance, lower power, and improve energy efficiency. Good DVFS decisions require accurate performance predictions across frequencies. A new hardware structure for measuring leading load cycles was recently proposed and demonstrated promising performance prediction abilities in simulation. 
 
This paper proposes a method of leveraging existing hardware performance monitors to emulate a leading loads predictor. Our proposal, LL-MAB, uses existing miss status handling register occupancy information to estimate leading load cycles. We implement and validate LL-MAB on a collection of commercial AMD CPUs. Experiments demonstrate that it can accurately predict performance with an average error of 2.7% using an AMD Opteronâ„¢4386 processor over a 2.2x change in frequency. LL-MAB requires no hardware- or application-specific training, and it is more accurate and requires fewer counters than similar approaches.
