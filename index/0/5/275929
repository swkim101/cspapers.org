We propose a new application area for grammar inference which intends to make domain-specific language development easier and finds a second application in renovation tools for legacy systems. We use the genetic programming approach for grammatical inference and propose the use of frequent sequences, syntax graphs and incremental construction of grammars in order to be able to infer a more comprehensive set of context-free grammars.
