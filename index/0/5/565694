We present a novel method for creating A* estimates for structured search problems originally described in Haghighi, DeNero, & Klein (2007). In our approach, we project a complex model onto multiple simpler models for which exact inference is efficient. We use an optimization framework to estimate parameters for these projections in a way which bounds the true costs. Similar to Klein & Manning (2003), we then combine completion estimates from the simpler models to guide search in the original complex model. We apply our approach to bitext parsing and demonstrate its effectiveness.
