Since its inception, the concept of network coordinates has been proposed to solve a wide variety of problems such as overlay optimization, network routing, network localization, and network modeling. However, two practical problems significantly limit the applications of network coordinates today. First, how can network coordinates be stabilized without losing accuracy so that they can be cached by applications? Second, how can network coordinates be secured such that legitimate nodes' coordinates are not impacted by misbehaving nodes? Although these problems have been discussed extensively, solving them in decentralized network coordinates systems remains an open problem.
 This paper presents new distributed algorithms to solve the coordinates stability and security problems. For the stability problem, we propose an error elimination model that can achieve stability without hurting accuracy. A novel algorithm based on this model is presented. For the security problem, we show that recently proposed statistical detection mechanisms cannot achieve an acceptable level of security against even simple attacks. We propose to address the security problem in two parts. First, we show how the computation of coordinates can be protected by a customized Byzantine fault detection algorithm. Second, we adopt a triangle inequality violation detection algorithm to protect delay measurements. These algorithms can be integrated together to provide stable and secure network coordinates.
