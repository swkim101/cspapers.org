Group subscription is a useful mechanism for multicastcongestion control: RLM, RLC, FLID-DL, and WEBRC form a promisingline of multi-group protocols where receivers provide no feedbackto the sender but control congestion via group membershipregulation. Unfortunately, the group subscription mechanism alsooffers receivers an opportunity to elicit self-beneficial bandwidthallocations. In particular, a misbehaving receiver canignoreguidelines for group subscription and choose an unfairly highsubscription level in a multi-group multicast session. This poses aserious threat to fairness of bandwidth allocation. In this paper,we present the first solution for the problem of inflatedsubscription. Our design guards access to multicast groups withdynamic keys and consists of two independent components: DELTA(Distribution of ELigibility To Access) -- a novel method forin-band distribution of group keys to receivers that are eligibleto access the groups according to the congestion control protocol,and SIGMA (Secure Internet Group Management Architecture) -- ageneric architecture for key-based group access at edgerouters.
