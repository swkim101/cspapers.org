The traditional model of market equilibrium supports impressive existence results, including the celebrated Arrow-Debreu Theorem. However, in this model, polynomial time algorithms for computing (or approximating) equilibria are known only for linear utility functions. We present a new, and natural, model of market equilibrium that not only admits existence and uniqueness results paralleling those for the traditional model but is also amenable to efficient algorithms.
