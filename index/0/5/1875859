Recently healthcare using information technology progressed with the maturity of tele-health monitoring services through Internet, and the emergence of mobile apps on smartphones that are geared towards recording inputs of intakes (e.g. calories, fat, amount of water etc.), as well as monitoring one's activity levels (e.g. number of steps walked) and emotion states, for inferring one's health condition. In this paper, a novel concept of fusing the current mobile app software technology, big data, sensing technology, and machine learning (in decision rule induction, reasoning, and image recognition) into the principles of TCM healthcare is proposed. TCM has developed a set of practical, universal and thorough, and systematic health care system, which is notably characterized by its relations to our daily lifestyles. Currently it lacks of some ubiquitous tools such as mobile smartphone and its sensing apps to embrace this healthcare concept as a personal assistant, monitoring and advising the user regarding his/her health and forewarning of any health risk. The challenges and potential applications are discussed in this paper. The advantage of this project is tapped from the popularity and convenient use of mobile smartphone and EEG sensors for providing ubiquitous personal TCM healthcare
