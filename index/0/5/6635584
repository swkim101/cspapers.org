The explosive growth of the Internet, the widespread use of WWW-related applications, and the increased reliance on client-server architectures places interesting new demands on network servers. In particular, the operating system running on such systems needs to manage the machineâ€™s resources in a manner that maximizes and maintains throughput under conditions of high load. We propose and evaluate a new network subsystem architecture that provides improved fairness, stability, and increased throughput under high network load. The architecture is hardware independent and does not degrade network latency or bandwidth under normal load conditions.
