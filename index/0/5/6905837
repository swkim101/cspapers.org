Authenticating broadcast packet communications poses a challenge that cannot be addressed efficiently with public key signatures on each packet, or securely with the use of a pre-distributed shared secret key, or practically with unicast tunnels. Unreliability is an intrinsic problem: many broadcast protocols assume that some information will be lost, making it problematic to amortize the cost of a single public key signature across multiple packets. Forward Error Correction (FEC) can compensate for loss of packets, but denial of service risks prevent the naive use of both public keys and FEC in authentication. In this paper we introduce a protocol, Broadcast Authentication Streams (BAS), that overcomes these barriers and provides a simple and efficient scheme for authenticating broadcast packet communications based on a new technique called selective verification. We analyze BAS theoretically, experimentally, and architecturally.
