This leads us to define an atomic activity-based probabilistic framework that employs Allen's interval relations to represent local temporal dependencies. The framework introduces a latent variable from the Chinese Restaurant Process to explicitly characterize these unique internal configurations of a particular complex activity as a variable number of tables.It can be analytically shown that the resulting interval network satisfies the transitivity property, and as a result, all local temporal dependencies can be retained and are globally consistent.Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets suggest our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
