Information from the senses must be compressed into the limited range of firing rates generated by spiking nerve cells. Optimal compression uses all firing rates equally often, implying that the nerve cell's response matches the statistics of naturally occurring stimuli. Since changing the voltage-dependent ionic conductances in the cell membrane alters the flow of information, an unsupervised, non-Hebbian, developmental learning rule is derived to adapt the conductances in Hodgkin-Huxley model neurons. By maximizing the rate of information transmission, each firing rate within the model neuron's limited dynamic range is used equally often.
