A variable structure controller (VSC) for a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot is proposed for tracking desired trajectories. Although the matching condition for VSC is not satisfied due to nonholonomic property of the robot having two drive wheels, the proposed algorithm guarantees bounded tracking errors by choosing the sliding surface gain properly. Yet the robot tracks its given trajectory without error if there is no initial posture and velocity errors. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.
