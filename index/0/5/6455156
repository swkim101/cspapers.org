This paper presents an application of a low force interaction method in a control scheme of robot manipulation based on tactile sensing. Our aim is to develop an intelligent control system that can distinguish the hardness of unknown objects so that robotic fingers can effectively explore the object's surface without altering its physical properties or causing damage. Initially we developed a novel optical three-axis tactile sensor system based on an optical waveguide transduction method capable of acquiring normal and shearing forces. The sensors are mounted on the fingertips of the multi-fingered humanoid robot arm. We proposed a new control scheme applying low force interaction to distinguish the hardness of unknown objects in robot manipulation tasks based on tactile sensing. The scheme utilized new control parameters obtained by calibration experiments using hard and soft objects that enable robot fingers to precisely control grasp pressure and define the slippage sensation of the given object. Finally, verification experiments of the proposed control scheme using a humanoid robot arm were conducted whose results revealed that the finger's system managed to recognize the hardness of unknown objects and complied with sudden changes of the object's weight during object manipulation tasks.
