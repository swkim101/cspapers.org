The JastAdd Extensible Java Compiler is a high quality Java compiler that is easy to extend with new analyses as well as new language constructs. In this demonstration we show how the existing framework for name analysis and type checking can be extended when adding new language constructs to Java. The same techniques have been used to implement all language features of Java 5 as modular extensions to a Java 1.4 compiler.
