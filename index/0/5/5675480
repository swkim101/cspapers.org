We propose to construct routing overlay networks using the following principle: that overlay edges should be based on mutual advantage between pairs of hosts. Upon this principle, we design, implement, and evaluate Peer-Wise, a latency-reducing overlay network. To show the feasibility of PeerWise, we must show first that mutual advantage exists in the Internet: perhaps contrary to expectation, that there are not only "haves" and "have nots" of low-latency connectivity. Second, we must provide a scalable means of finding promising edges and overlay routes; we seek embedding error in network coordinates to expose both shorter-than-default "detour" routes and longer-than-expected default routes. 
 
We evaluate the cost of limiting PeerWise to mutually advantageous links, then build the intelligent components that put PeerWise into practice. We design and evaluate "virtual" network coordinates for destinations not participating in the overlay, neighbor selection algorithms to find promising relays, and relay selection algorithms to choose the neighbor to traverse for a good detour. Finally, we show that PeerWise is practical through a wide-area deployment and evaluation.
