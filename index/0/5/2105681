This paper presents a technique for specifying change of control (e.g. branch) commands at a sequential processor's macroinstruction set level. It is shown that by representing high level language (HLL) control statements with special machine language instructions, the usual delays associated with control flow changes can be reduced. Preserving the HLL control flow information increases performance by reducing both the number of executed branches and pipeline breaks.
