Recently, conditional logics have been developed for application to problems in default reasoning. We present a uniform framework for the development and investigation of conditional logics to represent and reason with "normality", and demonstrate these logics to be equivalent to extensions of the modal system S4. We also show that two conditional logics, recently proposed to reason with default knowledge, are equivalent to fragments of two logics developed in this framework.
