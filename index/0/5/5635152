One of the most innovative features of the new AP Computer Science Principles course framework is that it includes the Global Impact of Computing-not just as an occasional flourish, but as one of its foundational Big Ideas (#7). The real-world impact of computing-on society and on their own lives-is a great hook that can stimulate students' lasting interest in computer science, whether in CSP or any other CS class. Teach Global Impact is a collaborative effort among leading computer science educators that leverages seven excellent CSP curricula and PD programs. (BJC, CISS, Code.org CSP, CS Matters, CSP CS4HS, Mobile CSP, and UTeach CSP.) These curricula are contributing activities that highlight the potential impacts of big data, multimedia, artificial intelligence, and Internet connectivity, among other things. We are working to bring together all of these existing Global Impact lesson materials into a unified resource, and to fill in any gaps by creating new materials, along with classroom strategy guides for teaching about impact. This lightning talk will introduce teachers to the resources available on the Teach Global Impact website, including a database of existing materials, new activities and strategy guides, and a Computing in the News feed featuring student-curated stories aligned with CSP learning objectives. We'll also talk about new activities in the works, including classroom simulations around net neutrality and encryption ethics, a lesson plan on online research and writing for CS, and a series of videos illustrating key essential knowledge points.
