As concern for water resource availability increases, so does the need for intelligent aquatic sensing applications. The requirements, and complexity of such applications has also increased due to demands for: 1) broad spatial coverage and high spatial resolution monitoring, 2) capability for resolving fine scale spatiotemporal dynamics and 3) the need for rapid system deployment with semi-autonomous operation. With these criteria in mind, we present the Aquatic Networked InfoMechanical System (NIMS-AQ). NIMS-AQ was developed based on experience gained from engineering research and collaboration with aquatic scientists and environmental engineers during several in-field measurement campaigns [1], [2], [3]. In this paper we demonstrate the effectiveness of NIMS- AQ through two experimental sensing campaigns encompassing both river and lake environments. Each campaign is centered around critical water resource monitoring objectives such as temperature, flow and contaminant levels. Experimental results for autonomous depth profiling using a submersible sonar system as well as adaptive sampling algorithms guided by phenomena models are presented herein. The found results conform with our objectives for rapid and systematic operation. Preliminary studies also indicate the systems viability for use with an autonomous iterative experiment design for environmental applications (A-IDEA) methodology that is currently under development. The IDEA methodology [1] provides effective characterization of spatiotemporal dynamics in aquatic environments. A-IDEA, as it is to be implemented on the NIMS-AQ platform, is also described.
