When the company asked me to write a paper on the MPP I decided to submit it to ISCA-7. Management balked at first: why pick a conference in La Baule, France when there were so many other conferences here in the U.S.? They only agreed after I convinced them that ISCA is the best conference in computer architecture; that the chance the paper would be accepted was very low; and that I could always submit it to some other conference if ISCA-7 rejected it. Management was much surprised when the paper was accepted: to help amortize my travel expenses they had me visit a few European groups that had some interest in the MPP so my trip lasted two weeks.
