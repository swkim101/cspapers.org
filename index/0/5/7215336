Despite the best design practices and testing techniques, many faults exist and manifest themselves in deployed software. In this paper we propose a self-healing framework that aims to mask fault manifestations at runtime in Java applications by automatically applying workarounds. The framework integrates a checkpoint-recovery mechanism to restore a consistent state after the failure, and a mechanism to replace the Java code at runtime to apply the workaround.
