This paper presents a new control methodology for a nonholonomic electric two-wheeled vehicle wherein the autonomous and man-machine cooperative controls are synthesized. In the proposed control scheme, the ‘autonomous control’ and the ‘man-machine cooperative control’ are designed by synthesizing time-state control and impedance control. The time-state controller tries to reduce the machine's deviation from the guideline, the impedance controller, on the other hand, generates power to assist the operator's maneuver. Furthermore, experimental results are shown to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed strategy.
