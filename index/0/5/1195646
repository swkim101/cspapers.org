While unsupervised anaphoric zero pro-noun (AZP) resolvers have recently been shown to rival their supervised counter-parts in performance, it is relatively difficult to scale them up to reach the next level of performance due to the large amount of feature engineering efforts involved and their ineffectiveness in exploiting lexical features. To address these weaknesses, we propose a supervised approach to AZP resolution based on deep neural networks, taking advantage of their ability to learn useful task-specific representations and effectively exploit lexical features via word embeddings. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance when resolving the Chinese AZPs in the OntoNotes corpus.
