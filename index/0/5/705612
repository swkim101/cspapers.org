This study used educational software—courseware—that contained algorithm animations and data structure visualizations that were implemented with the programming language Java, and were embedded in a collection of World Wide Web pages. The objective of this study was to determine whether the interactive prediction facility provided by this courseware produced a significant learning advantage. Two experiments were conducted. The results indicated that the students who used the interactive version of the courseware spent significantly more time using it than those who used the noninteractive version. Students who used the interactive version scored better on several of the questions that tested the more difficult lessons, but performed more poorly overall. None of the differences were statistically significant.
