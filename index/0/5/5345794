Viewing information retrieval (IR) systems as models of human assessment of the similarity between requests and documents (SRD)t contributes to development of theory for IR and can aid in development of IR systems. This chapter reports the development and testing of a theory of IR based on this system-as· model (SAM) view;:. Implications for IR research and development are then considered. The SAM theory of IR is an expansion of the present model used in IR research. That model, and its expansion into a theory of IR, are described in the two sections below§.
