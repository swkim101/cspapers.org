The use of component-based development (CBD) is growing in the software engineering community and it has been successfully applied in many engineering domains such as office applications and in web-based distributed applications. Recently, the need of CBD is growing also in other domains related to dependable and embedded systems, namely, in the control engineering domain. However, the widely used commercial component technologies are unable to provide solutions to the requirements of embedded systems as they require too much resources and they do not provide methods and tools for developing predictable and analyzable embedded systems. There is a need for new component-based technologies appropriate to development of embedded systems. In this paper we briefly present a component-based development framework called SAVEComp. SAVEComp is developed for safety-critical real-time systems. One of the main characteristics of SAVEComp is syntactic and semantic simplicity which enables a high analyzability of properties important for embedded systems. We discuss how SAVEComp is able to provide an efficient support for designing and implementing embedded control systems by mainly focusing on simplicity and analyzability of functional requirements and of real-time and dependability quality attributes. In particular we discuss the typical solutions of control systems in which feedback loops are used and which significantly complicate the design process. We provide a solution for increasing design abstraction level and still being able to reason about system properties using SAVEComp approach. Finally, we discuss an extension of SAVEComp with dynamic run-time property checking by utilizing run-time spare capacity that is normally induced by real-time analysis.
