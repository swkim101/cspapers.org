AbstractWe prove new bounds on the average sensitivity of the indicator function of an intersection of k halfspaces. In particular, we prove the optimal bound of Onlog(k). This generalizes a result of Nazarov, who proved the analogous result in the Gaussian case, and improves upon a result of Harsha, Klivans and Meka. Furthermore, our result has implications for the runtime required to learn intersections of halfspaces.AMS Subject ClassificationPrimary; 52C45
