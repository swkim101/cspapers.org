This paper presents an effective approach to discard most entries of the rule table for statistical machine translation. The rule table is filtered by monolingual key phrases, which are extracted from source text using a technique based on term extraction. Experiments show that 78% of the rule table is reduced without worsening translation performance. In most cases, our approach results in measurable improvements in BLEU score.
