This paper describes SiN, a novel case-based planning algorithm that combines conversational case retrieval with generative planning. SiN is provably correct, and can generate plans given an incomplete domain theory by using cases to extend that domain theory. SiN can also reason with imperfect world-state information by incorporing preferences into the cases. Our empirical validation shows how these preferences affect plan quality.
