Recently, there has been a growing need for a metadata standard for the Internet. The files that are available on ftp and WWW sites can be difficult to search if they are enclosed in a container format (e.g., tar), and bibliographical data can be deeply embedded in documentation. This paper describes how IAFA Templates[1] have been used in a real archive to store the metadata of lots of different types of documents and software and to derive WWW, gopher, and text indices from them.
