The knowledge to be acquired for the development of knowledge based systems is often distributed across a group of experts rather than available for elicitation from a single expert. Group elicitation presents major problems because experts can disagree on the use of concepts and vocabulary, and this disagreement may be tacit causing confusion. This paper describes a computer-supported methodology for knowledge acquisition from groups in which the conceptual frameworks of different experts are compared in a way that makes such disagreements overt and readily identifiable.
