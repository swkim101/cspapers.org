We prove a parallel repetition theorem for general games with value tending to 0. Previously Dinur and Steurer proved such a theorem for the special case of projection games. We use information theoretic techniques in our proof. Our proofs also extend to the high value regime (value close to 1) and provide alternate proofs for the parallel repetition theorems of Holenstein and Rao for general and projection games respectively. We also extend the example of Feige and Verbitsky to show that the small-value parallel repetition bound we obtain is tight. Our techniques are elementary in that we only need to employ basic information theory and discrete probability in the small-value parallel repetition proof.
