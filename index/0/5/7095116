In this paper we present a novel approach to categorizing comments in online reviews as either a qualified claim or a bald claim. We argue that this distinction is important based on a study of customer behavior in making purchasing decisions using online reviews. We present results of a supervised algorithm for learning this distinction. The two types of claims are expressed differently in language and we show that syntactic features capture this difference, yielding improvement over a bag-of-words baseline.
