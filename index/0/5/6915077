This paper considers the challenges in the architectural design of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Cyber-physical systems are real-time control and coordination systems that rely on computational infrastructure. We help to elucidate these challenges by comparing cyber-physical system design to system-on-chip design. We then survey CPS architectures and identify several important challenges.
