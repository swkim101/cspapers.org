We present Video Lens, a framework which allows users to visualize and interactively explore large collections of videos and associated metadata. The primary goal of the framework is to let users quickly find relevant sections within the videos and play them back in rapid succession. The individual UI elements are linked and highly interactive, supporting a faceted search paradigm and encouraging exploration of the data set. We demonstrate the capabilities and specific scenarios of Video Lens within the domain of professional baseball videos. A user study with 12 participants indicates that Video Lens efficiently supports a diverse range of powerful yet desirable video query tasks, while a series of interviews with professionals in the field demonstrates the framework's benefits and future potential.
