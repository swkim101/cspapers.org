An approach to automatic detection of syllable boundaries is presented. We demonstrate the use of several manually constructed grammars trained with a novel algorithm combining the advantages of treebank and bracketed corpora training. We investigate the effect of the training corpus size on the performance of our system. The evaluation shows that a hand-written grammar performs better on finding syllable boundaries than does a treebank grammar.
