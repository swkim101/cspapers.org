Continuing changes in the domains of consumer devices and multimedia formats demand for a new approach to media adaptation. The publication of customized content on a device requires an automatic adaptation engine that takes into account the specifications of both the device and the material to be published. These specifications can be expressed using a single domain ontology that describes the concepts of the media adaptation domain. In this document, we provide insight into the implementation of an adaptation engine that exploits this domain knowledge. We explain how this engine, through the use of description matching and Semantic Web Services, composes a chain of adaptation services which will alter the original content to the needs of the target device.
