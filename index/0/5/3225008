Although existing mechanics-based models of concentric tube robots have been experimentally demonstrated to approximate the actual kinematics, determining accurate estimates of model parameters remains difficult due to the complex relationship between the parameters and available measurements. Further, because the mechanics-based models neglect some phenomena like friction, nonlinear elasticity, and cross section deformation, it is also not clear if model error is due to model simplification or to parameter estimation errors. The parameters of the superelastic materials used in these robots can be slowly time-varying, necessitating periodic re-estimation. This paper proposes a method for estimating the mechanics-based model parameters using an extended Kalman filter as a step toward on-line parameter estimation. Our methodology is validated through both simulation and experiments.
