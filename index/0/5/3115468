We introduce the optimization problem of target-specific ads allocation. Technique for solving this problem for different target-constraints structures is presented. This technique allows us to find optimal ads allocation which maximize the target such as CTR, Revenue or other system performances subject to some linear constraints. We show that the optimal ads allocation depends on both the target and constraints variables.
