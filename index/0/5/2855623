The critical need for computer security concepts to be taught in the undergraduate computer science curriculum is evident from current news stories, curricular guidelines, and government initiatives. Beginning to teach a standalone computer security course can be daunting, especially for instructors with little or no background or formal education in computer security. An elective course in cryptography and computer security was developed that matched the talents of the professor and the resources and context of the two Universities and departments in which it was taught. Two models of the course evolved: an elective semester-long computer science and mathematics cross-listed course, and an elective summer computer science course with significant hands-on laboratory exercises. Either course may be used as a model for an accessible course offering involving computer security.
