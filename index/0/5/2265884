We propose in this paper a new active perception scheme based on Model Predictive Control under constraints for generating a sequence of visual servoing tasks. The proposed control scheme is used to compute the motion of a camera whose task is to successively observe a set of robots for measuring their position and improving the accuracy of their localization. This method is based on the prediction of an uncertainty model (due to actuation and measurement noise) for determining which robot has to be observed by the camera. Simulation results are presented for validating the approach.
