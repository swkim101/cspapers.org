Yawat is a tool for the visualization and manipulation of word- and phrase-level alignments of parallel text. Unlike most other tools for manual word alignment, it relies on dynamic markup to visualize alignment relations, that is, markup is shown and hidden depending on the current mouse position. This reduces the visual complexity of the visualization and allows the annotator to focus on one item at a time. For a bird's-eye view of alignment patterns within a sentence, the tool is also able to display alignments as alignment matrices. In addition, it allows for manual labeling of alignment relations with customizable tag sets. Different text colors are used to indicate which words in a given sentence pair have already been aligned, and which ones still need to be aligned. Tag sets and color schemes can easily be adapted to the needs of specific annotation projects through configuration files. The tool is implemented in JavaScript and designed to run as a web application.
