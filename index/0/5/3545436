This paper presents a restricted version of Set-Local Multi-Component TAGs (Weir, 1988) which retains the strong generative capacity of Tree-Local Multi-Component TAG (i.e. produces the same derived structures) but has a greater derivational generative capacity (i.e. can derive those structures in more ways). This formalism is then applied as a framework for integrating dependency and constituency based linguistic representations.
