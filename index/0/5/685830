Web service applications are dynamic, highly distributed, and loosely coupled orchestrations of services which are notoriously difficult to debug. In this paper, we describe a user-guided recovery framework for web services. When behavioural correctness properties (safety and bounded liveness) of an application are violated at runtime, we automatically propose and rank recovery plans which users can then select for execution. For safety violations, such plans essentially involve "going back" -- compensating the occurred actions until an alternative behavior of the application is possible. For bounded liveness violations, such plans include both "going back" and "re-planning" --guiding the application towards a desired behavior. We report on the implementation and our experience with the recovery system.
