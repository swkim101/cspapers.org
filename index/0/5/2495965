The first force map has been generated for a 2 DOF wing designed for the MFI project. For the wing beating at a resonance frequency of 139 Hz, the average 3-D forces were found as a function of sinusoidal voltage amplitude and actuator phase difference. An image sequence of the wing trajectory allowed comparison to simulated forces using a quasi-steady state aerodynamic approximation. Finally, the results were compared to the case of ideally matched leading/lagging wing dynamics driven by sinusoids.
