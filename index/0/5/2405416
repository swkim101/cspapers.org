This paper presents an approach based on Chaotic Optimization Algorithm (COA) for designing current measuring transformers (CTs). This algorithm determines design parameters of CT to minimize ratio and phase displacement errors in different ratios of rated currents and manufacturing cost regarding some technical data. In comparison to conventional methods of CT designing, which are mostly based on trial and error, this method is of better performance. Effects of burden change have been taken into account and the rated burden of CT to reach the expected measuring accuracy has been obtained. At the end, typical current transformers with different rated values are designed using this method. Results show the effectiveness of proposed approach in optimal design of current transformer.
