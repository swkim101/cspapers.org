We discuss Feature Latent Semantic Analysis (FLSA), an extension to Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). LSA is a statistical method that is ordinarily trained on words only; FLSA adds to LSA the richness of the many other linguistic features that a corpus may be labeled with. We applied FLSA to dialogue act classification with excellent results. We report results on three corpora: CallHome Spanish, MapTask, and our own corpus of tutoring dialogues.
