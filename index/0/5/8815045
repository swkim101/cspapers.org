Visual attention is a crucial indicator of the relative importance of objects in visual scenes to human viewers. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to extract objects which attract visual attention from videos. As human attention is naturally biased towards high level semantic objects in visual scenes, this information can be valuable to extract salient objects. The proposed algorithm extracts dominant visual tracks using eye tracking data from multiple subjects on a video sequence by a combination of mean-shift clustering and Hungarian algorithm. These visual tracks guide a generic object search algorithm to get candidate object locations and extents in every frame. Further, we propose a novel multiple object extraction algorithm by constructing a spatio-temporal mixed graph over object candidates. Bounding box based object extraction inference is performed using binary linear integer programming on a cost function defined over the graph. Finally, the object boundaries are refined using grabcut segmentation. The proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art video segmentation using eye tracking prior and obtains favorable object extraction over algorithms which do not utilize eye tracking data.
