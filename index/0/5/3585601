We present a full semester course in which students build a complete computer system - hardware and software - from the ground up. Also known as "Nand to Tetris", the course is presently taught at 100+ universities, and is listed in Coursera's top-rated courses. The course synthesizes many abstractions, algorithms, and data structures learned in CS courses, and makes them concrete by building a complete computer system from first principles. The methodology is based on guiding students through a set of 12 homework assignments that gradually construct and unit-test a simple hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy, yielding a surprisingly powerful computer system. We'll start the workshop by demonstrating some interactive computer games running on this platform. The hardware projects are done in a simple hardware description language and a hardware simulator supplied by us. The software projects (assembler, VM, compiler and OS) can be done in any language, using API's and test programs supplied by us. The result is a general-purpose computer system, simulated on the student's PC. The course is completely self-contained, requiring only programming as a pre-requisite. Also, it is highly modular, and can be viewed as a set of 12 exciting, stand-along homework assignments. The course and the workshop assume no specific knowledge of, or bent for, computer organization/architecture, and are aimed at any instructor who wishes to strengthen his or her courses with engaging programming projects and with an integrated and hands-on understanding of how modern computer systems work, and how they are built.
