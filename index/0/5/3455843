First-year, college-level computing courses are gateway courses with low passing rates, resulting in student attrition and transfers out of computer science degrees. Learning Communities (LC) are a group of students who enroll in two or more courses, generally in different disciplines that are linked together by a common theme, in an academic semester. LCs capture and combine two important parts of college life: education and student cooperation. At our institution we have implemented a LC linking three first-year courses (Introduction to Computer Systems, CS0; Problem Solving with Computer Programming, CS1; and English Composition I) for over five years. In this study, we empirically show the pedagogical impact of LCs on student academic retention and performance outcomes in first-year computing courses (CS0 and CS1). We compared performance, attendance and study habits of students taking the computer courses as part of a LC (LC group) with students taking the same courses outside the LC (nLC group). Our results show that when first-year students take computing courses as part of the LC, retention rates increase and students perform significantly better. For example, student performance in three basic programming skills (sequence, selection and repetition) increases significantly from 66% (nLC; n = 146) to 82% (LC; n = 112) when students take the CS1 course as part of a LC. We also found that LCs promote class attendance and that the nature of students' relationships with classmates may play a critical role in the improvement of student performance observed in LC students.
