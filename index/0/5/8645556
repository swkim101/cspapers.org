Tekkotsu has grown from a specialized framework for development on the Sony Aibo to a general purpose robotics development environment with support for a variety of hardware, algorithms for autonomous operation, virtual simulation, and associated curriculum for undergraduate education. This paper describes the implementation of these features, provides examples of their use in research and education, and draws a comparison with other popular open-source robotics frameworks.
