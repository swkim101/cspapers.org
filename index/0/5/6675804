Hovering flight is one of the valuable capabilities for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform various missions. It is easily attainable by rotary-wing aircrafts such as a helicopter and multirotor. This flight maneuver, however, remains a significant challenge to a flapping wing micro air vehicle (FWMAV). This paper aims to regulate attitude angles of a FWMAV and maintain an altitude during hovering. For this task, we model dynamic equations of FWMAV to analyze the stability of longitudinal dynamics under the influence of tail wings. In order to examine the effect of the flapping wings on the fuselage, we carry out measurements on the power train. We develop a FWMAV with two pairs of main flapping wings and tail wings, to achieve stable hovering flight. For autonomous control, PID controllers are designed and onboard sensors are used; 9-degree of freedom (DoF) IMU is for attitude regulation and barometer is for an altitude control. For estimating an altitude, we also apply processing filter. Experimental results show that our strategy can accomplish and sustain autonomous hovering of a FWMAV.
