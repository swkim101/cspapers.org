A programming language for the partial computable functionals is used as the basis for a definition of the computational complexity of functionals (type2 functions). An axiomatic account in the spirit of Blum is then provided. The novel features of this approach are justified by applying it to problems in abstract complexity, specifically operator speed-up, and by using it to define the illusive notion of the polynomial degree of an arbitrary function. New results are obtained for these degrees.
