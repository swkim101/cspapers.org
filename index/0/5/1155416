This paper addresses the problem of recovering the locations of both mobile devices and access points from radio signals, a problem which we call colocalization, by exploiting both labeled and unlabeled data from mobile devices and access points. We first propose a solution using Latent Semantic Indexing to construct the relative locations of the mobile devices and access points when their absolute locations are unknown. We then propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on manifold to obtain the absolute locations of the devices. Both solutions are finally combined together in terms of graph Laplacian. Extensive experiments are conducted in wireless local-area networks, wireless sensor networks and radio frequency identification networks. The experimental results showthat we can achieve high accuracy with much less calibration effort as compared to several previous systems.
