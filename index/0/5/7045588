It is shown that the method of analytical heuristics /2/, binarized formalism /3/ and the model of Artificial Conceptual Intelligence /4/ could be successfully used as a basis for describing the process of "arrivxng at decisions" based on the unified description of "be-ginning of conditions", "body of condi-tions", "beginning of responces". "body of responces", "beginning or decisions", "body of decisions" /2/ by means of binary wave form of representing variables in tne vector-matrix form. The binary wave addressing we introduce tnat can be used for the "action space" as well, makes it possible to solve tne decision search problems without scanning difficulties. The complete "wave binarizati-on" of all the components for "behaviour during decision taking makes the solution of direct and reverse problem feasible , that is compilation of special "sys-tem of equations for accomulation of ex-perience" and "system of equations for decisions and conclusions". This method is formally presented as the one of decision table programming /1/. It is shown that the vector-matrices of states we have introduced are "fu-zzy" (L.Zadeh). The programs for multy-factor system estimation are created. It is illustrated by means of a well-known example of heuristical programming that theory avoids "scanning". Matrix form of an AI heuristico-conceptual model is easily presented in the form of "block-diagrams and programs.
