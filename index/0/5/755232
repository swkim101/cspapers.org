The problem of finding a local minimum of a black-box function is central for understanding local search as well as quantum adiabatic algorithms. For functions on the Boolean hypercube 0,1<sup><i>n</i></sup>, we show a lower bound of Ω(2<sup><i>n</i>/4</sup>/<i>n</i>) on the number of queries needed by a quantum computer to solve this problem. More surprisingly, our approach, based on Ambainis's quantum adversary method, also yields a lower bound of Ω(2<sup><i>n</i>/2</sup>/<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) on the problem's <i>classical</i> randomized query complexity. This improves and simplifies a 1983 result of Aldous. Finally, in both the randomized and quantum cases, we give the first nontrivial lower bounds for finding local minima on grids of constant dimension <i>d</i>≥3.
