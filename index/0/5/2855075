Our research is within the area of artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems. More specifically, we focus on evaluating trust relationships between the agents in multi-agent e-marketplaces and sensor networks and aim to address the following problems: 1) how to identify a trustworthy (good quality) agent; 2) how to cope with dishonest advisors i.e., agents who provide misleading opinions about others.
