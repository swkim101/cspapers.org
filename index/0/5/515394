In this paper, we present a unified formalism, based on Past Temporal Logic, for specifying conditions and events in the rules for active database system. This language permits specification of many time varying properties of database systems. It also permits specification of temporal aggregates. We present an efficient incremental algorithm for detecting conditions specified in this language. The given algorithm, for a subclass of the logic, was implemented on top of Sybase.
