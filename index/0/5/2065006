A control algorithm based on admittance regulation is proposed for human-robot cooperative force amplification. The controller is particularly suitable for physical interaction in both free space and constrained motions thanks to an active transition between the two modes. It is also able to cancel possible high frequency oscillations due to the contact with the environment. A mathematical analysis of the controller is provided and a preliminary experimental validation is performed on a 1-dof test-bench.
