This paper presents an indirect adaptive control methodology for quadorotors. The methodology aims at controlling a family of quadrotor micro air vehicle with a common set of sensors and processing hardware but with various sizes, configurations, payloads and propeller types. The parameter estimation is based on the Recursive Least Square algorithm which feeds the estimates to a linear parameter varying controller. The synthesis of the controller relies on structured Hâˆž algorithm.
