We present a system for extraction of temporal expressions from French texts. The identification of the temporal expressions is based on a context-scanning strategy (CSS) which is carried out by two complementary techniques: search for regular expressions and left-to-right and right-to-left local chart-parsing. A number of semantic and distant-dependency constraints have been integrated to the chart-parsing procedure in order to improve the precision of the system.
