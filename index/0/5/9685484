The intelligent personal assistant software such as the Apple’s Siri and Samsung’s S-Voice has been issued these days. This paper introduces a novel Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) module to predict user’s intention for determining system actions of the intelligent personal assistant software. The SLU module usually consists of several connected recognition tasks on a pipeline framework, whereas the proposed SLU module simultaneously recognizes four recognition tasks on a recognition framework using Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The four tasks include named entity, speech-act, target and operation recognition. In the experiments, the new simultaneous recognition method achieves the higher performance of 4% and faster speed of about 25% than other method using a pipeline framework. By a significance test, this improvement is considered to be statistically significant as a p-value of smaller than 0.05.
