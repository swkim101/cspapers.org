This paper describes a natural language processing system developed for the Semantic Network Array Processor (SNAP). The goal of our work is to develop a scalable and high-performance natural language processing system which utilizes the high degree of parallelism provided by the SNAP machine. We have implemented an experimental machine translation system as a central part of a real-time speech-to-speech dialogue translation system. It is a SNAP version of the Î¦ DMDIAIOG speech-to-speech translation system. Memory-based natural language processing and syntactic constraint network model has been incorporated using parallel marker-passing which is directly supported from hardware level. Experimental results demonstrate that the parsing of a sentence is done in the order of milliseconds.
