Robotic devices have been used in a variety of rehabilitation protocols, including gait rehabilitation after stroke. However, robotic intervention in gait therapy has only produced moderate results compared to conventional physiotherapy. We suggest a novel approach to robotic interventions which takes advantage of inter-limb coordination mechanisms. We hypothesize the existence of a mechanism of inter-leg coordination that may remain intact after a hemiplegic stroke that may be utilized to obtain functional improvement of the impaired leg. One of the most significant advantages of this approach is the safety of the patient, since this does not require any direct manipulation of the impaired leg. In this paper, we focus on designing and applying unilateral perturbations that evoke contralateral leg motions through mechanisms of inter-leg coordination. Real-time control of floor stiffness is utilized to uniquely differentiate force and kinematic feedback, creating novel perturbations. We present results of repeatable and scalable evoked muscle activity of the contralateral tibialis anterior muscle through unilateral stiffness perturbations. We also present a mathematical model that accurately describes the relationship between the magnitude of the stiffness perturbation and the evoked muscle activity, that could result in model-based rehabilitation strategies for impaired walkers. The novel methods and results presented in this paper set the foundation for a paradigm shift of robotic interventions for gait rehabilitation.
