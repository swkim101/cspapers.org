It is well known that college and university level programs in thecomputing sciences continue to turn out graduates who are schooledin topics such as compiler writing, automata theory and numericalanalysis, while the vast majority of potential employers of thesegraduates are seeking people knowledgeable in administrativesystems and application programming. This point was brought homeduring a recent visit I made to a graduate course in datastructures at a major university. When the instructor asked themore than forty students to list all the programming languages theyknew, COBOL went entirely unmentioned. Although COBOL is not anideal language for instructional purposes, the fact that it israrely taught in computing science programs is probably due more tothe tastes of instructors than to intrinsic weaknesses of COBOL. Myremarks here take the position that COBOL can be used quitesuccessfully as a demonstration language to help teach informationprocessing principles and good programming practices, whileproviding students with a much sought after skill.
