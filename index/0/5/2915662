The society has long regarded the architects as creators of ornate, artistic buildings and nothing more. However, many architects were, and still are the history's greatest artists. Nevertheless, many architects nowadays are still using nineteenth century methods to solve twentieth century problems. If they are to overcome this stigma and take the right place as a major influence in the shaping of man's destiny, architects must become divorced from the traditional, intuitive approaches to problem solving, and learn to utilize all the design tools at their disposal.
 The specific goal of this project is the computer aided programming and design of a Residential Living Unit and Diagnostic and Treatment Center to serve mentally retarded persons in the New Bedford, Massachusetts area.
