We present a denotational semantics for Stateflow, the graphical Statecharts-like language of the Matlab/Simulink toolsuite. This semantics makes use of continuations to capture even the most complex constructions of the language, such as inter-level transitions, junctions, or backtracking. An immediate application of this semantics is a formal compilation scheme for the language.
