An experiment was performed to examine predictions from Clarkâ€™s contribution theory of discourse. Pairs were asked to use a text-based synchronous messaging system to solve a problem involving the layout of a bank. Contribution theory suggests that in such text-only communication common ground will be difficult to achieve. This was shown to be the case. A parallel system, where participants could use a common report space in addition to the messaging space, significantly reduced these probIems. The implications for design are discussed in terms of providing additional channels for communicating the results of discussion separate from the conversation itself.
