For large computer programs, verification of compliance with structured programming rules can present difficult problems for programmers and managers. In order to certify that code is structured, an algorithm and test tool were recently developed to audit source code and verify the use of structured constructs. The paper describes the segmentation of programs as a way of representing their logical control structure; presents the basic algorithm, illustrates algorithm extensions; and briefly reports on experience in using the tool on a large software project.
