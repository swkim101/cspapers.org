Given the importance of parallel mesh generation in large-scale scientific applications and the proliferation of multilevel SMT-based architectures, it is imperative to obtain insight on the interaction between meshing algorithms and these systems. We focus on Parallel Constrained Delaunay Mesh (PCDM) generation. We exploit coarse-grain parallelism at the subdomain level and fine-grain at the element level. This multigrain data parallel approach targets clusters built from low-end, commercially available SMTs. Our experimental evaluation shows that current SMTs are not capable of executing fine-grain parallelism in PCDM. However, experiments on a simulated SMT indicate that with modest hardware support it is possible to exploit fine-grain parallelism opportunities. The exploitation of fine-grain parallelism results to higher performance than a pure MPI implementation and closes the gap between the performance of PCDM and the state-of-the-art sequential mesher on a single physical processor. Our findings extend to other adaptive and irregular multigrain, parallel algorithms.
