SHORE (Scalable Heterogeneous Object REpository) is a persistent object system under development at the University of Wisconsin. SHORE represents a merger of object-oriented database and file system technologies. In this paper we give the goals and motivation for SHORE, and describe how SHORE provides features of both technologies. We also describe some novel aspects of the SHORE architecture, including a symmetric peer-to-peer server architecture, server customization through an extensible value-added server facility, and support for scalability on multiprocessor systems. An initial version of SHORE is already operational, and we expect a release of Version 1 in mid-1994.
