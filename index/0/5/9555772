Accurate multilingual transfer parsing typically relies on careful feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical tensor-based approach for this task. This approach induces a compact feature representation by combining atomic features. However, unlike traditional tensor models, it enables us to incorporate prior knowledge about desired feature interactions, eliminating invalid feature combinations. To this end, we use a hierarchical structure that uses intermediate embeddings to capture desired feature combinations. Algebraically, this hierarchical tensor is equivalent to the sum of traditional tensors with shared components, and thus can be effectively trained with standard online algorithms. In both unsupervised and semi-supervised transfer scenarios, our hierarchical tensor consistently improves UAS and LAS over state-of-theart multilingual transfer parsers and the traditional tensor model across 10 different languages. 1
