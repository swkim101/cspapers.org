Negative expressions are common in natural language text and play a critical role in information extraction. However, the performances of current systems are far from satisfaction, largely due to its focus on intrasentence information and its failure to consider inter-sentence information. In this paper, we propose a graph model to enrich intrasentence features with inter-sentence features from both lexical and topic perspectives. Evaluation on the *SEM 2012 shared task corpus indicates the usefulness of contextual discourse information in negation focus identification and justifies the effectiveness of our graph model in capturing such global information.
