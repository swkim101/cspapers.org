More and more data is accumulated inside social networks. Keyword search provides a simple interface for exploring this content. However, a lot of the content is private, and a search system must enforce the privacy settings of the social network. In this paper, we present a workload-aware keyword search system with access control based on a social network. We make two technical contributions: (1) HeapUnion, a novel union operator that improves processing of search queries with access control by up to a factor of two compared to the best previous solution; and (2) highly accurate cost models that vary in sophistication and accuracy; these cost models provide input to an optimization algorithm that selects the most efficient organization of access control meta-data for a given workload. Our experimental results with real and synthetic data show that our approach outperforms previous work by up to a factor of three.
