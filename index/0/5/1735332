We describe a new widget and interaction technique, known as a "Frisbee," for interacting with areas of a large display that are difficult or impossible to access directly. A frisbee is simply a portal to another part of the display. It consists of a local "telescope" and a remote "target". The remote data surrounded by the target is drawn in the telescope and interactions performed within it are applied on the remote data. In this paper we define the behavior of frisbees, show unique affordances of the widget, and discuss design characteristics. We have implemented a test application and report on an experiment that shows the benefit of using the frisbee on a large display. Our results suggest that the frisbee is preferred over walking back and forth to the local and remote spaces at a distance of 4.5 feet.
