To allow soft global constraints, usually of high arity, to enjoy the same benefits, Lee and Leung give polynomial time algorithms to enforce generalized AC* (GAC*) and FDAC* (FDGAC*) for projection-safe soft non-binary constraints. Generalizing the stronger EDAC* is less straightforward. In this paper, we first reveal the oscillation problem when enforcing EDAC* on constraints sharing more than one variable. To avoid oscillation, we propose a weak version of EDAC* and generalize it to weak EDGAC* for non-binary constraints. Weak EDGAC* is stronger than FDGAC* and GAC*, but weaker than VAC and soft k-consistency for k > 2. We also show that weak EDGAC* can be enforced in polynomial time for projection-safe constraints. Extensive experimentation confirms the efficiency of our proposal.
