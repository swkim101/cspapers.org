This paper introduces an integrative approach to automatic word sense subjectivity annotation. We use features that exploit the hierarchical structure and domain information in lexical resources such as WordNet, as well as other types of features that measure the similarity of glosses and the overlap among sets of semantically related words. Integrated in a machine learning framework, the entire set of features is found to give better results than any individual type of feature.
