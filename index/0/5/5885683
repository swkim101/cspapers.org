This paper explores the role of user modelling in live help systems for e-commerce web sites. There are several potential benefits with user modelling in this context: 1) Human assistants can use the personal information in the user models to provide the users with efficient support tailored to their personal needs; 2) Assistants can be more comfortable in their supporting role; 3) Consultation resources can be saved, and thus, financial savings can be made for the e-commerce company. A user modelling approach has been implemented and deployed in a real web environment as part of a live help system. Following the deployment we have analysed consultation dialogue logs and answers to a questionnaire for participating assistants. The initial results show that assistants consider user modelling to be helpful and that consultation dialogues can be an important source for user model data collection.
