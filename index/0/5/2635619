We developed combined graduate and undergraduate courses in which undergraduates created a prototype based on user-centered design, and graduate students worked with them to evaluate those prototypes based on common usability principles. It provided undergraduate students experience practicing user centered design, while providing graduate students experience with usability evaluation. It also provided graduate students the opportunity to introduce current HCI research areas to students who may be considering graduate school. The course successfully engaged both graduate and undergraduate students while providing a beneficial experience through their interactions.
