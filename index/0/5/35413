As mobile devices get ubiquitous and grow in computational power, their management of interdependent data also becomes increasingly important. The mobile environment exhibits all the characteristics of a distributed database plus the feature of whimsical connectivity. Consequently, transactions respecting data consistency can suffer unbounded and unpredictable delays at both mobile and stationary nodes. The currently popular multi-tier model, in which mobile devices are in one end and always-connected stationary servers in the other, has certain practical advantages. However, it assumes that all integrity constraints are evaluated at the servers and hence relies on the semantics of operations for any autonomy enhancement of the mobile devices. In this paper, we examine the idea of constraint localization in cases where two mobile nodes each own data that share a constraint. It relies on reformulation of a constraint into more flexible local constraints that give more autonomy to the mobile nodes. The scheme also involves dynamic changes of these local constraints through negotiation, which we call re-localization. To overcome the problem of simultaneous requests for such re-localization, we give algorithms along with experimental results indicating their effectiveness.
