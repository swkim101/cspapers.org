This paper presents an exercise in the verification of a connection establishment protocol. A specification language named SPEX, tailored for the needs of communications protocols, is proposed, and its relation to a semi-automated verification system, AFFIRM, is discussed. This language is then used to specify a connection protocol currently being used. Certain errors are uncovered by analysis using the verification system. However, the major portion of the protocol's operation are shown to be correct.
