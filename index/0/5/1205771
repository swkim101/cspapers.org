We consider principal component analysis for contaminated data-set in the high dimensional regime, where the dimensionality of each observation is comparable or even more than the number of observations. We propose a deterministic high-dimensional robust PCA algorithm which inherits all theoretical properties of its randomized counterpart, i.e., it is tractable, robust to contaminated points, easily kernelizable, asymptotic consistent and achieves maximal robustness - a breakdown point of 50%. More importantly, the proposed method exhibits significantly better computational efficiency, which makes it suitable for large-scale real applications.
