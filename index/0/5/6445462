In recent years there has been an explosive increase in the volume of information available on the Internet. In particular, we are concerned with the huge increase in the availability of multiple news sources reporting essentially the same news. In general, users whether they are journalists or ordinary consumers, are not interested in the full spectrum of world events. Also, they donâ€™t want to read the same story repeated several times from different sources. Instead people want to be able to follow events in which they have a particular interest as the story unfolds. They may also wish to be notified of any breaking news stories as they occur.
