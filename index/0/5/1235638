Modal logic becomes action logic by adding programs as in propositional dynamic logic or the /spl mu/-calculus. Modal languages can be seen as decidable fragments of first-order logic that admit a natural bisimulation, and hence enjoy a good model theory. Recently, much stronger 'guarded fragments' of first-order logic have been identified that enjoy the same pleasant features. The latter can serve as richer action languages as well. We will develop the logic of guarded fragments as a form of process theory. In particular, moving from sequential to parallel process operations correlates with moving to first-order fragments that are close to, or perhaps just over the decidable-undecidable fence.
