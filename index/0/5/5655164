We developed a novel language model for Japanese based on grapheme-phoneme tuples, which is one order of magnitude smaller than word-based models. We also developed an alignment algorithm of graphemes and phonemes for both ordinary text and OCR output. We show, by experiment, that the combination of the grapheme-phoneme tuple ngram model and the grapheme-phoneme alignment algorithm significantly improve character recognition accuracy if both grapheme and phoneme representations are given.
