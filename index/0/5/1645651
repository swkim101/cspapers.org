INEX, the evaluation initiative for content-oriented XML retrieval, has since its establishment defined the relevance of an element according to two graded dimensions, exhaustivity and specificity. The former measures how exhaustively an XML element discusses the topic of request, whereas specificity measures how focused the element is on the topic of request. The reason for having two dimensions was to provide a more stable measure of relevance than if assessors were asked to rate the relevance of an element on a single scale. However, obtaining relevance assessments is a costly task. as each document must be assessed for relevance by a human assessor. In XML retrieval this problem is exacerbated as the elements of the document must also be assessed with respect to the exhaustivity and specificity dimensions. A continuous discussion in INEX has been whether such a sophisticated definition of relevance, and in particular the exhaustivity dimension, was needed. This paper attempts to answer this question through extensive statistical tests to compare the conclusions about system performance that could be made under different assessment scenarios.
