In this paper we present a Markov Logic Network for Semantic Role Labelling that jointly performs predicate identification, frame disambiguation, argument identification and argument classification for all predicates in a sentence. Empirically we find that our approach is competitive: our best model would appear on par with the best entry in the CoNLL 2008 shared task open track, and at the 4th place of the closed track---right behind the systems that use significantly better parsers to generate their input features. Moreover, we observe that by fully capturing the complete SRL pipeline in a single probabilistic model we can achieve significant improvements over more isolated systems, in particular for out-of-domain data. Finally, we show that despite the joint approach, our system is still efficient.
