Cross-domain image synthesis and recognition are typically considered as two distinct tasks in the areas of computer vision and pattern recognition. Therefore, it is not clear whether approaches addressing one task can be easily generalized or extended for solving the other. In this paper, we propose a unified model for coupled dictionary and feature space learning. The proposed learning model not only observes a common feature space for associating cross-domain image data for recognition purposes, the derived feature space is able to jointly update the dictionaries in each image domain for improved representation. This is why our method can be applied to both cross-domain image synthesis and recognition problems. Experiments on a variety of synthesis and recognition tasks such as single image super-resolution, cross-view action recognition, and sketch-to-photo face recognition would verify the effectiveness of our proposed learning model.
