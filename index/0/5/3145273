This paper proposes a learning method of a mobile robot with structured intelligence in a changing environment. Modular neural networks are applied for action control based on perceiving-acting cycle of ecological psychology. The robot extracts action rules from the behavior knowledge described by fuzzy rules. Next, we conduct several experiments using a mobile robot. The experimental results show the robot can learn actions based on the perceiving-acting cycle.
