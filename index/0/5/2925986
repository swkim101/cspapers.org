In this study, we introduce a nondeterministic method for referring expression generation. We describe two models that account for individual variation in the choice of referential form in automatically generated text: a Naive Bayes model and a Recurrent Neural Network. Both are evaluated using the VaREG corpus. Then we select the best performing model to generate referential forms in texts from the GREC-2.0 corpus and conduct an evaluation experiment in which humans judge the coherence and comprehensibility of the generated texts, comparing them both with the original references and those produced by a random baseline model.
