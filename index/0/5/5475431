We have built a hybrid Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Information Retrieval (IR) system that generates a query to the IR system by using information derived from CBR analysis of a problem situation. The query is automatically formed by submitting in text form a set of highly relevant cases, based on a CBR analysis, to a modified version of INQUERYâ€™s relevance feedback module. This approach extends the reach of CBR, for retrieval purposes, to much larger corpora and injects knowledge-based techniques into traditional IR.
