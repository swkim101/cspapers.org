The real-time indoor autonomous vehicle test environment (RAVEN) at MIT's Aerospace Controls Laboratory is home to a diverse fleet of aircraft, from a styrofoam and cellophane dragonfly to a set of quadrotor Draganflyer helicopters. The helicopters are used primarily for swarm and health management research. Alongside these machines is a set of more conventional aircraft designed to study autonomous aircraft flight control in constrained environments. The objectives of this work are to develop and validate flight control concepts for aggressive (aerobatic) maneuvers, and, in particular, to identify the sensor suites needed, and the likely limits of achievable performance. Our work is motivated by the future goals of flying micro (or nano) air vehicles in constrained (e.g., urban or indoors) environments.
