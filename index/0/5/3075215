We introduce a novel precedence reordering approach based on a dependency parser to statistical machine translation systems. Similar to other preprocessing reordering approaches, our method can efficiently incorporate linguistic knowledge into SMT systems without increasing the complexity of decoding. For a set of five subject-object-verb (SOV) order languages, we show significant improvements in BLEU scores when translating from English, compared to other reordering approaches, in state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT systems.
