Spam is highly pervasive in P2P file-sharing systems and is difficult to detect automatically before actually downloading a file due to the insufficient and biased description of a file returned to a client as a query result. To alleviate this problem, we first characterize spam and spammers in the P2P file-sharing environment and then describe feature-based techniques for automatically detecting spam in P2P query result sets. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques successfully decrease the amount of spam by 9% in the top-200 results and by 92% in the top-20 results.
