Despite the many significant advances made in robot motion research, few works have focused on the tight integration of high-level deliberative planning with reactive control at the lowest level. In particular, the real-time performance of existing integrated planning and control architectures is still not optimal because the reactive control capabilities have not been fully realized. This paper aims to enhance the low-level reactive capabilities of integrated planning and control with Cooperative Extended Kohonen Maps for handling complex, unpredictable environments so that the work-load of the high-level planner can be consequently eased. The enhancements include fine, smooth motion control, execution of more complex motion tasks such as overcoming unforeseen concave obstacles and traversing between closely spaced obstacles, and asynchronous execution of behaviors.
