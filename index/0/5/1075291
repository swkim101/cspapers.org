The current rapid development and deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and their application in mission critical systems are exacerbating the need for high confidence WSNs. Achieving high confidence WSNs will require new assurance technologies. Most current solutions deal with faults and reliability and not with application level semantics and associated assurances. We propose the use of a novel WSN design and assurance mechanism, run time assurance (RTA), to guarantee that important application-level requirements are met in mission critical applications.
