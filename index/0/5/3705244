To be successful in their program and in their subsequent professional commitments, the students of Requirements Engineering, in general, and Agile Requirements Engineering, in particular, need to acquire a certain set of cognitive, behavioral, social, and technical skills. These skills can be instilled through practice. The students also need to have a "toolbox" with a diverse collection of tools which complement each other. This poster aims to show that paper remains one of those tools which can help towards developing aforementioned skills within the framework of an active learning classroom environment. In that regard, the authors' approach is described, preliminary results of the authors' experience with the graduate students over the period of two semesters are presented, and recommendations for educators who may be interested in putting the approach into practice are given.
