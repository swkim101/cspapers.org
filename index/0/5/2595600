An efficient signaling protocol for mobility application part (MAP) is essential to mobility support when mobile terminals roam between different networks in next generation wireless systems such as IMT-2000. In this paper, a new signaling protocol is proposed to reduce the overhead caused by mobility management, alleviating network load and consumption of network resources. Moreover, the new protocol effectively reduces the latency of call delivery and call loss rate due to crossing wireless systems with different standards and signaling protocols. Instead of performing location registration after a mobile user arrives at the new system, the mobile user is required to update its location information prior to its reaching the boundary of two systems. Results in this study demonstrate that the new protocol yields significant benefits in terms of reducing signaling costs, delays, and call loss rates.
