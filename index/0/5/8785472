As reading is an integral part of our knowledge lives, we should know more about our reading activities. This paper introduces a reading application for smart phone and tablets that aims at giving user more quantified information about their reading habits. We present our work towards building an open library for eye tracking on unmodified tablets and smart phones to support some of the applications advanced functionality. We implemented already several eye tracking algorithms from previous work, unfortunately all seem not to be robust enough for our application case. We give an overview about our challenges and potential solutions.
