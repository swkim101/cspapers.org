We present some ideas here about prose reading comprehension tests, with analogies to program reading exercises, and suggest the potential usefulness of a standardized, nationwide program reading comprehension test as a means to assess on a comparative basis individual and department-wide progress through the computer science curriculum. We conclude with a research agenda on program reading and encourage contributions to the work from interested colleagues.
