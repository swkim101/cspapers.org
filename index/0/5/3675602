The DBpedia-entity collection has been used as a standard test collection for entity search in recent years. We develop and release a new version of this test collection, DBpedia-Entity v2, which uses a more recent DBpedia dump and a unified candidate result pool from the same set of retrieval models. Relevance judgments are also collected in a uniform way, using the same group of crowdsourcing workers, following the same assessment guidelines. The result is an up-to-date and consistent test collection.To facilitate further research, we also provide details about the pre-processing and indexing steps, and include baseline results from both classical and recently developed entity search methods.
