The carved acrylic boards have become popular along with the diffusion of carving machines (e.g., laser cutters). When a carved acrylic board is illuminated from its side, the carved patterns emerged beautifully. We propose an interactive technique, "AcrySense", which can add input functions to a carved acrylic board in a simple and inexpensive configuration. The AcrySense mainly consists of LEDs, Photo Transistors and a microcomputer attached under a carved acrylic board. This paper describes the concept and implementation of the system.
