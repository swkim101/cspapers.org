3D object detection and importance regression/ranking are at the core for semantically interpreting 3D medical images of computer aided diagnosis (CAD). In this paper, we propose effective image segmentation features and a novel multiple instance regression method for solving the above challenges. We perform supervised learning based segmentation algorithm on numerous lesion candidates (as 3D VOIs: Volumes Of Interest in CT images) which can be true or false. By assessing the statistical properties in the joint space of segmentation output (e.g., a 3D class-specific probability map or cloud), and original image appearance, 57 descriptive features in six subgroups are derived. The new feature set shows excellent performance on effectively classifying ambiguous positive and negative VOIs, for our CAD system of detecting colonic polyps using CT images. The proposed regression model on our segmentation derived features behaves as a robust object (polyp) size/importance estimator and ranking module with high reliability, which is critical for automatic clinical reporting and cancer staging. Extensive evaluation is executed on a large clinical dataset of 770 CT scans from 12 medical sites for validation, with the best state-of-the-art results.
