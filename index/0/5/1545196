Three types of collision-free channel access protocols for ad hoc networks are presented. These protocols are derived from a novel approach to contention resolution that allows each node to elect deterministically one or multiple winners for channel access in a given contention context (e.g., a time slot), given the identifiers of its neighbors one and two hops away. The new protocols are shown to be fair and capable of achieving maximum utilization of the channel bandwidth. The delay and throughput characteristics of the contention resolution algorithms are analyzed, and the performance of the three types of channel access protocols is studied by simulations.
