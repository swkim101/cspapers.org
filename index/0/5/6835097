In the cake cutting problem, <i>n</i> â‰¥ 2 players want to cut a cake into <i>n</i> pieces so that every player gets a "fair" share of the cake by his own measure. We describe a protocol with <i>n</i> - 1 cuts in which each player can enforce to get a share of at least 1/(2<i>n</i> - 2) of the cake. Moreover we show that no protocol with <i>n</i> - 1 cuts can guarantee a better fraction.
