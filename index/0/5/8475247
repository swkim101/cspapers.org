Semantic relations between text concepts denote the core elements of lexical semantics. This paper presents a model for the automatic detection of Intention semantic relation. Our approach first identifies the syntactic patterns that encode intentions, then we select syntactic and semantic features for a svm learning classifier. In conclusion, we discuss the application of intention relations to Q&A.
