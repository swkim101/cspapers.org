Morphological segmentation has been shown to be beneficial to a range of NLP tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, speech synthesis and information retrieval. Recently, a number of approaches to unsupervised morphological segmentation have been proposed. This paper describes an algorithm that draws from previous approaches and combines them into a simple model for morphological segmentation that outperforms other approaches on English and German, and also yields good results on agglutinative languages such as Finnish and Turkish. We also propose a method for detecting variation within stems in an unsupervised fashion. The segmentation quality reached with the new algorithm is good enough to improve grapheme-to-phoneme conversion.
