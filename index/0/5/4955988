The advent of social media has facilitated the study of information diffusion, expressing information spreading and influence among users on social graphs. In this demo paper, we present a system for real-time analysis of information diffusion on Twitter; it constructs the so-called information cascades that capture how information is being propagated from user to user. We face the challenge of managing and presenting large and fast-evolving graph data. For this purpose, we have developed methods for computing and visualizing information flow dynamically, offering rich structural and temporal information. The interface offers the possibility to interact with the dynamic, evolving cascades and gives valuable insights in terms of how information propagates on real-time and how users are influenced from each other.
