Though most translation systems have some mechanism for translating certain types of divergent predicate-argument structures, they do not provide a general procedure that takes advantage of the relationship between lexical-semantic structure and syntactic structure. A divergent predicate-argument structure is one in which the predicate (e.g., the main verb) or its arguments (e.g., the subject and object) do not have the same syntactic ordering properties for both the source and target language. To account for such ordering differences, a machine translator must consider language-specific syntactic idiosyncrasies that distinguish a target language from a source language, while making use of lexical-semantic uniformities that tie the two languages together. This paper describes the mechanisms used by the UNITRAN machine translation system for mapping an underlying lexical-conceptual structure to a syntactic structure (and vice versa), and it shows how these mechanisms coupled with a set of general linking routines solve the problem of thematic divergence in machine translation.
