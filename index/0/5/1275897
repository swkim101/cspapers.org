This paper specifies a surgical robot performing semi-autonomous electrosurgery for tumor resection and evaluates its accuracy using a visual servoing paradigm. We describe the design and integration of a novel, multi-degree of freedom electrosurgical tool for the smart tissue autonomous robot (STAR). Standardized line tests are executed to determine ideal cut parameters in three different types of porcine tissue. STAR is then programmed with the ideal cut setting for porcine tissue and compared against expert surgeons using open and laparoscopic techniques in a line cutting task. We conclude with a proof of concept demonstration using STAR to semi-autonomously resect pseudo-tumors in porcine tissue using visual servoing. When tasked to excise tumors with a consistent 4mm margin, STAR can semi-autonomously dissect tissue with an average margin of 3.67 mm and a standard deviation of 0.89mm.
