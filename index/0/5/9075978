Modern system development environments usually deploy the object management facilities of a so-called repository to store the documents created and maintained during system development. PCTE is the ISO and ECMA standard for a public tool interface for an open repository [23]. In this paper we present document retrieval extensions for an OQLoriented query language for PCTE. The extensions proposed cover (1) pattern matching, (2) term based document retrieval with automatically generated document description vectors, (3) the flexible definition of what is addressed as a “document” in a given query, and (4) the integration of these facilities into a CASE tool. Whereas the integration of pattern matching facilities into query languages has been addressed by other authors before, the main contribution of our approach is the homogeneous integration of term based document retrieval and the flexible definition of documents.
