Aiming to improve user experience for a job search engine, in this paper we propose an idea to switch from query-biased snippets used by most web search engines to rich structured snippets associated with the main sections of a job posting page, which are more appropriate for job search due to specific user needs and the structure of job pages. We present a very simple yet actionable approach to generate such snippets in an unsupervised way. The advantages of the proposed approach are two-fold: it doesn't require manual annotation and therefore can be easily deployed to many languages, which is a desirable property for a job search engine operating internationally; it fuses naturally with the trend towards Mobile Web where the content needs to be optimized for small screen devices and informativeness.
