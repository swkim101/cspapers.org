Traditional information extraction systems have focused on satisfying precise, narrow, pre-specified requests from small, homogeneous corpora. In contrast, the TextRunner system demonstrates a new kind of information extraction, called Open Information Extraction (OIE), in which the system makes a single, data-driven pass over the entire corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples, without requiring any human input. (Banko et al., 2007) TextRunner is a fully-implemented, highly scalable example of OIE. TextRunner's extractions are indexed, allowing a fast query mechanism.
