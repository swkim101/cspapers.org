Collaborative tagging systems allow users to label online resources. The tags are generally correlated and evolving according to the change of web contents, and the popularity of tags represent evolution of social interests. Tag taxonomy is a promising solution to organize the data in tagging systems. In this demonstration, we propose to construct the evolutionary taxonomy which incorporates the correlation and evolution of tags, as user generated tags grow and change temporally. We demonstrate that our approach is intuitive and efficient in tag organization which exploits the evolving characteristic of collaborative tagging systems.
