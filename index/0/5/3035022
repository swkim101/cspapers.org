Keys are very important in many aspects of data management, such as guiding query formulation, query optimization, indexing, etc. We consider the situation where an XML document does not come with key definitions, and we are interested in using data mining techniques to obtain a representation of the keys holding in a document. In order to have a compact representation of the set of keys holding in a document, we define a partial order on the set of all key expressions. This order is based on an analysis of the properties of absolute and relative keys for XML. Given the existence of the partial order, only a reduced set of key expressions need to be discovered.Due to the semistructured nature of XML documents, it turns out to be useful to consider keys that hold in "almost" the whole document, that is, they are violated only in a small part of the document. To this end, the support and confidence of a key expression are also defined, and the concept of approximate key expression is introduced. We give an efficient algorithm to mine a reduced set of approximate keys from an XML document.
