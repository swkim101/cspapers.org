In this paper, we describe an efficient parser for French based on an adaptation of Chomsky's Government-Binding (GB) theory. Reflecting the modular conception of a GB grammar, the parser consists of several distinct procedures corresponding to the subsystems of the grammar (e.g. phrase-structure rules, binding, control, 'theta'-theory, etc.). The interaction of these fairly simple modules produces the kind of complexity required in order to build all the linguistically motivated structures for a given sentence.
