There are many proposed methods for using clickthrough data for common queries to improve the quality of search results returned for that query. In this study we examine the search behaviour of users in a close-knit community on such queries. We argue that the benefit of using aggregated clickthrough data varies from task to task: it may improve document rankings for navigational or specific informational queries, but is less likely to be of value to users issuing a broad informational query.
