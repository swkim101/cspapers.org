An attribute is obligatory for a class in a Knowledge Base (KB), if all instances of the class have the attribute in the real world. For example, hasBirthDate is an obligatory attribute for the class Person, while has Spouse is not. In this paper, we propose a new way to model incompleteness in KBs. From this model, we derive a method to automatically determine obligatory attributes -- using only the data from the KB. Our algorithm can detect such attributes with a precision of up to 90%.
