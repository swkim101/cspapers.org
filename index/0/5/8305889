The next generation of supercomputers will be largely parallel MIMD architectures, ranging in peak performance from 10 to 100 GFLOPS in the mid nineties to 1000 GFLOPS in the late nineties. Largely parallel means that such a system will consist of hundreds or thousands of processing nodes (PN), and each PN will have a peak performance of several hundred MFLOPS. Obtaining such an extremely high performance is not only an issue of appropriate node architecture but requires also a very high bandwidth interconnection network and an extremely fast implementation of the inter process communication (IPC) protocol. The paper deals with an IPC protocol implementation that reduces the communication startup time to approximately 20 microseconds, by combining highly efficient software solutions, given in the form of lightweight processes, with dedicated hardware, given in the form of a specific communication processor in each PN, to perform the rendezvous required between sender and receiver processes.
