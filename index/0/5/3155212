During the conventional procedure of the colonoscopy, there are two important movements, the introduction of colonoscope in the colon and the maneuver of the distal end. In this paper, the authors focus on a new type of automatic bendable tip while keeping the advance of the colonoscope in the colon by endoscopist. The main purpose of this tip is to make the colonoscope overcome acute intestinal bends and make easier the progression of the colonoscope for the surgeon. Firstly, we model our current prototype tip, named EDORA (distal extremity with automatic orientation). Next, the parameters of the system are estimated by using the Levenberg-Margquardt's algorithm. Finally, by using the maximum of the sensitivity function a gain margin specification is made. A set point for a position controller is designed, thus the tip can stay in the middle of the colon with disturbance rejection due to the manipulation of the colonoscope. In the same time, this controller has been designed to make the tip have some degrees of compliance to reduce the contact force due to the undesirable contact with the colon. Simulation and experimental results for the controller would be presented by emulating the real environments.
