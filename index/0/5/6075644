In this poster, we present an Urban Sensor Network (USN) from a board perspective, i.e., any device in urban infrastructures is considered as a pervasive urban sensor if it generates data about residents' locations. Built upon correlation and divergence among various urban sensors, we aim to provide unseen urban dynamics in fined-grained spatio-temporal resolutions to support novel smart cities services. As opposed to previous ad hoc sensor networks, our approach aims to establish USN in a modular architecture as a middleware with open interfaces to various lower level urban infrastructures, ensuing interoperability and flexibility, which are crucial prerequisites for higher level applications.
