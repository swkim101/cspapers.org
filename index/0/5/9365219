The development of miniature flying robots has become a reachable dream, thanks to the new sensing and actuating technologies. Micro VTOL systems represent a useful class of flying robots because of their strong abilities for small-area monitoring and building exploration. In this paper, we present the results of two model-based control techniques applied to an autonomous four-rotor micro helicopter called quadrotor. A classical approach (PID) assumed a simplified dynamics and a modern technique (LQ) based on a more complete model. Various simulations were performed and several tests on the bench validate the control laws. Finally, we present the results of the first test in flight with the helicopter released. These developments are part of the OS4 project in our lab.
