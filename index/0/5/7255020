The paper presents a new convergence calculation method of the normal distributions transform (NDT) scan matching for high resolution grid map. The proposed method employs interactive closest point (ICP) algorithm to find corresponding point, even if the input scan points are in the outside of the reference grid area. It also enlarges the convergence area by modifying the eigenvalue of normal distribution so that the evaluation value can be driven effectively by all the pairing data for improving convergence speed. In the normal NDT scan matching algorithm, the grid size especially has much effect on the capability of convergence area and speed. Thus, it is difficult to generate the detailed map with small grids. The proposed convergence approach can solve the problem by the phased adjustment of convergence area. Experimental result shows the feasibility of the detailed environmental map generated by the NDT grid mapping.
