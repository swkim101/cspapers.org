Current blog opinion retrieval approaches cannot be applied if the topic relevance and opinion score distributions by rank are dissimilar. This problem severely limits the feasibility of these approaches. We propose to tackle this problem by fitting the distribution of opinion scores, which replaces the original topic relevance score distribution with the simulated one. Our proposed score distribution fitting method markedly enhances the feasibility of a state-of-the-art dictionary-based opinion retrieval approach. Evaluation on a standard TREC blog test collection shows significant improvements over high quality topic relevance baselines.
