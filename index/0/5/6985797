The Elmore delay is an extremely popular delay metric, particularly for RC tree analysis. The widespread usage of this metric is mainly attributable to it being the most accurate delay measure that is a simple analytical function of the circuit parameters. The only drawbacks to this delay metric are the uncertainty as to whether it is an optimistic or a pessimistic estimate, and the restriction to step response delay estimation. In this paper, we prove that the Elmore delay is an absolute upper bound on the 50% delay of an RC tree response. Moreover, we prove that this bound holds for input signals other than steps, and that the actual delay asymptotically approaches the Elmore delay as the input signal rise time increases. A lower bound on the delay is also developed using the Elmore delay and the second moment of the impulse response. The utility of this bound is for understanding the accuracy and the limitations of the Elmore delay metric as we use it for design automation.
