We have developed a software platform, called OpenHRP, for humanoid robotics which consists of a dynamic simulator and motion control library for humanoid robots. This paper attempts to answer a frequently asked question "do the dynamic simulations and the experiments of biped walking of humanoid robots correspond?". Using OpenHRP and humanoid robots HRP-1S and HRP-2P, the comparisons between the simulations and experiments are shown at various aspects.
