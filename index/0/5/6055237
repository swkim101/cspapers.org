We describe QUEST, an open source framework for machine translation quality estimation. The framework allows the extraction of several quality indicators from source segments, their translations, external resources (corpora, language models, topic models, etc.), as well as language tools (parsers, part-of-speech tags, etc.). It also provides machine learning algorithms to build quality estimation models. We benchmark the framework on a number of datasets and discuss the efficacy of features and algorithms.
