Passive network monitoring and data analysis, crucial to the correct operation of networks and the systems that rely on them, has become an increasingly difficult task given continued growth and diversification of the Internet. In this demo we present Blockmon, a novel composable measurement system with the flexibility to allow for a wide range of traffic monitoring and data analysis, as well as the necessary mechanisms to yield high performance on today's modern multi-core hardware. In this demo we use Blockmon's GUI to show how to easily create Blockmon applications and display data exported by them. We present a simple flow meter application and a more involved VoIP nomaly detection one.
