The CTADEL system provides an automated means of generating specific high performance scientific codes optimized for serial, vector, or shared virtual memory and distributed memory parallel computer architectures. One of the key elements of this system is the employment of algebraic simplification techniques and powerful methods for global common subexpression elimination to guarantee the generation of efficient high performance codes for various target architectures. In this paper we present the CTADEL Code-generation Tool for Applications based on Differential Equations using high-level Language specifications. A prototype implementation has been developed which is limited to explicit finite difference methods as numerical solution method. Performance results of the codes generated with this prototype implementation will be presented for a limited area numerical weather forecast routine on various hardware platforms. These results show that generation of efficient code is well feasible within the presented approach.
