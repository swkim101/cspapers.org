We argue that the current practice of using integer positions for pointing events artificially constrains human precision capabilities. The high sensitivity of current input devices can be harnessed to enable precise direct manipulation ""in between"" pixels, called subpixel interaction. We provide detailed analysis of subpixel theory and implementation, including the critical component of revised control-display gain transfer functions. A prototype implementation is described with several illustrative examples. Guidelines for subpixel domain applicability are provided and an overview of required changes to operating systems and graphical user interface frameworks are discussed.
