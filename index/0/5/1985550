Two national committees issued definitive computer curricula in the 1960s, Since then digital technology has changed, high school graduates have different preparation, computer science and computer engineering curricula have proliferated, and design has become more important. This paper proposes a computer engineering program that will respond to these changes. The program is a spiral one, based on an introductory computer engineering program, and emphasizing design through each of a number of streams that can reflect local interests and resources. This paper discusses the main courses of a stream and the basic introductory course.
