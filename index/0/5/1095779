We investigate attempting concurrent connections to multiple Wi-Fi access points (APs) from highly mobile clients. Previous multi-AP solutions are limited to stationary wireless clients and do not take into account a myriad of mobile factors. We show that connection duration, AP response times, channel scheduling, available and offered bandwidth, node speed, and dhcp joins all affect performance. Building on these results, we present a system, Spider, that establishes and maintains concurrent connections to 802.11 APs in a mobile environment. While Spider can manage multiple channels, we demonstrate that it achieves maximum throughput when using multiple APs on a single channel.
