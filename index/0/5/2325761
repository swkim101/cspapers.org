A new methodology and test program generator have been used for the functional verification of six IBM PowerPC processors. The generator contains a formal model of the PowerPC architecture and a heuristic data-base of testing expertise. It has been used on daily basis for two years by about a hundred designers and testing engineers in four IBM sites. The new methodology reduced significantly the functional verification period and time to market of the PowerPC processors. Despite the complexity of the PowerPC architecture, the three processors verified so far had fully functional first silicon.
