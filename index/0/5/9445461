A case-based reasoning system was created to support customers who purchased appliances from General Electric. When a customer calls General Electric for help, a call-taker uses the system to diagnose the problem and step the customer through its solution. The system has been in use by 300 call-takers since 1999. It has resulted in a 20 percent increase in the probability the customer's problem can be solved over the phone. This has greatly improved customer satisfaction and saved GE $44.5 million between 2000 and 2005 from reduced cost of visits of field service technician to customer's homes.
