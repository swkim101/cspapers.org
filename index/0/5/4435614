A frequently proposed solution to node misbehavior in mobile ad hoc networks is to use reputation systems. But in ephemeral networks - a new breed of mobile networks where contact times between nodes are short and neighbors change frequently - reputations are hard to build. In this case, local revocation is a faster and more efficient alternative. In this paper, we define a game-theoretic model to analyze the various local revocation strategies. We establish and prove the conditions leading to subgame-perfect equilibria. We also derive the optimal parameters for voting-based schemes. Then we design a protocol based on our analysis and the practical aspects that cannot be captured in the model. With realistic simulations on ephemeral networks we compare the performance and economic costs of the different techniques.
