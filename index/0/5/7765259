We have developed a system that allows users to add annotations immediately onto a Web page they are viewing, and share the information via a network. A novel feature of our method is that P2P nodes in the system determine their roles autonomously, and share the annotation data. Our method is based on P2P; however, P2P nodes in the system change their roles and data transfer procedures, depending on their network topology or the status of other nodes.Our method is robust to node or network problems, and has flexible scalability.
