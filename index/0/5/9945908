Text simplification aims to rewrite text into simpler versions, and thus make information accessible to a broader audience. Most previous work simplifies sentences using handcrafted rules aimed at splitting long sentences, or substitutes difficult words using a predefined dictionary. This paper presents a data-driven model based on quasi-synchronous grammar, a formalism that can naturally capture structural mismatches and complex rewrite operations. We describe how such a grammar can be induced from Wikipedia and propose an integer linear programming model for selecting the most appropriate simplification from the space of possible rewrites generated by the grammar. We show experimentally that our method creates simplifications that significantly reduce the reading difficulty of the input, while maintaining grammaticality and preserving its meaning.
