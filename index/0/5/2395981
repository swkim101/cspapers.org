The stiffness of a grasp is analyzed on the basis of the generalized virtual stiffness (GVS) model. Considering that the normal and lateral stiffness of the finger usually are not decoupled due to kinematics and mechanical design, GVS is formulated as coupled virtual springs. The authors relate GVS to the effective fingertip stiffness including the additional stiffness at the joint space. Based on the grasp stiffness formulation, simulations were carried out, focusing on the grasp stability.
