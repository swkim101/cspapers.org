Technical publications often make either subjective or unsubstantiated claims about today's functional verification process-such as, 70 percent of a project's overall effort is spent in verification. Yet, there are very few credible industry studies that quantitatively provide insight into the functional verification process in terms of verification technology adoption, effort, and effectiveness. To address this dearth of knowledge, a recent world-wide, double-blind, functional verification study was conducted, covering all electronic industry market segments. To our knowledge, this is the largest independent functional verification study ever conducted. This paper presents the findings from our 2014 study and provides invaluable insight into the state of the electronic industry today in terms of both design and verification trends.
