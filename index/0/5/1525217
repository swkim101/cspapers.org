An experiment using wearable sensor badges showed that there was a strong correlation between students' physical behaviors and their scholastic performance. For example, students whose bodily movements were in harmony with those of their classmates during class and students with more face-to-face interaction during break times had better scholastic performance. These results indicate that it may be possible to improve scholastic performance by changing student behaviors, as measured using wearable sensor badges.
