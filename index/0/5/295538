The ability to coordinate can offer significant performance advantages. This paper proposes an algorithm for decentralised control that is a function of both discrete and continuous variables. The algorithm is applied to a multi-robot, multi-target mapping scenario, where decisions that couple the continuous motion controls and discrete robot-to-target assignments are made. The algorithm out-performed benchmarks including implicit coordination, best-response, and the decoupling of continuous and discrete decision variables.
