In the formalization of MIML learning, instances come from a single source (single view). To leverage multiple information sources (multi-view), we develop a multi-view MIML framework based on hierarchical Bayesian Network, and derive an effective learning algorithm based on variational inference. The model can naturally deal with examples in which some views could be absent (partial examples). On multi-view datasets, it is shown that our method is better than other multi-view and single-view approaches particularly in the presence of partial examples. On single-view benchmarks, extensive evaluation shows that our method is highly competitive or better than other MIML approaches on labeling examples and instances. Moreover, our method can effectively handle datasets with a large number of labels.
