We describe a new version of the window protocol where message sequence numbers are taken from a finite domain and where both message disorder and loss can be tolerated. Most existing window protocols achieve only one of these two goals. Our protocol is based on a new method of acknowledgement, called <italic>block acknowledgement</italic>, where each acknowledgement message has two numbers <italic>m</italic> and <italic>n</italic> to acknowledge the reception of all data messages with sequence numbers ranging from <italic>m</italic> to <italic>n</italic>. Using this method of acknowledgement, the proposed protocol achieves the two goals while maintaining the same data transmission capability of the traditional window protocol.
