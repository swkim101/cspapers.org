This paper presents an efficient and robust method for registration of terrain models created using stereovision on a planetary rover. Our approach projects two surface models into a virtual depth map, rendering the models, as they would be seen from a single range sensor. Correspondence is established based on which points project to the same location in the virtual range sensor. A robust norm of the deviations in observed depth is used as the objective function, and the algorithm searches for the rigid transformation, which minimizes the norm. An initial coarse search is done using rover pose information from odometry and orientation sensing. A fine search is done using Levenberg-Marquardt. Our method enables a planetary rover to keep track of designated science targets as it moves, and to hand off targets from one set of stereo cameras to another. These capabilities are essential for the rover to autonomously approach a science target and place an instrument in contact in a single command cycle.
