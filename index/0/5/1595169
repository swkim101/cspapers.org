This paper surveys several approaches to semantic-network semantics that have not previously been treated in the Al or computational linguistics literature, though there is a large philosophical literature investigating them in some detail. In particular, propositional semantic networks (exemplihed by SNePS) are discussed. It is argued that only a fully intensional ("Meinongran") semantics is appropriate for them, and several Meinongran systems are presented.
