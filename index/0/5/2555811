This paper relates first experiences using a state-of-the-art, time-of-flight sensor that is able to deliver 3D images. The properties and capabilities of the sensor make it a potential powerful tool for applications within mobile robotics especially for real-time tasks, as the sensor features a frame rate of up to 30 frames per second. Its capabilities in terms of basic obstacle avoidance and local path-planning are evaluated and compared to the performance of a standard laser scanner.
