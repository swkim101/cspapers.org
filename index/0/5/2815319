Part-of-speech (POS) taggers trained on newswire perform much worse on domains such as subtitles, lyrics, or tweets. In addition, these domains are also heterogeneous, e.g., with respect to registers and dialects. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning a POS tagger for subtitles, lyrics, and tweets associated with African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). We learn from a mixture of randomly sampled and manually annotated Twitter data and unlabeled data, which we automatically and partially label using mined tag dictionaries. Our POS tagger obtains a tagging accuracy of 89% on subtitles, 85% on lyrics, and 83% on tweets, with up to 55% error reductions over a state-of-the-art newswire POS tagger, and 15-25% error reductions over a state-of-the-art Twitter POS tagger.
