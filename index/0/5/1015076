In an effort to confront the challenges brought forward by the networking revolution of the past few years, we present improved techniques for authorized access to computer system resources and data. More than ever before, the Internet is changing computing as we know it. The possibilities of this global network seem limitless; unfortunately, with this global access comes increased chances of malicious attack and intrusion. Alternatives to traditional access control measures are in high demand. In what follows we present one such alternative: computer access via keystroke dynamics. A database of 42 profiles was constructed based on keystroke patterns gathered from various users performing structured and unstructured tasks. We study the performance of a system for recognition of these users, and present a toolkit for analyzing system performance under varying criteria.
