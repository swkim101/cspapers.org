We consider the question of benchmarking the performance of methods used for estimating the depth of a scene from a single image. We describe various measures that have been used in the past, discuss their limitations and demonstrate that each is deficient in one or more ways. We propose a new measure of performance for depth estimation that overcomes these deficiencies, and has a number of desirable properties. We show that in various cases of interest the new measure enables visualisation of the performance of a method that is otherwise obfuscated by existing metrics. Our proposed method is capable of illuminating the relative performance of different algorithms on different kinds of data, such as the difference in efficacy of a method when estimating the depth of the ground plane versus estimating the depth of other generic scene structure. We showcase the method by comparing a number of existing single-view methods against each other and against more traditional depth estimation methods such as binocular stereo.
