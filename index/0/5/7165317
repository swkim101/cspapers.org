This paper introduces the Zooniverse citizen science project and software framework, outlining its structure from an observatory perspective: both as an observable web-based system in itself, and as an example of a platform iteratively developed according to real-world deployment and used at scale. We include details of the technical architecture of Zooniverse, including the mechanisms for data gathering across the Zooniverse operation, access, and analysis. We consider the lessons that can be drawn from the experience of designing and running Zooniverse, and how this might inform development of other web observatories.
