This paper presents a new protocol for certified email. The protocol aims to combine security, scalability, easy implementation, and viable deployment. The protocol relies on a light on-line trusted third party; it can be implemented without any special software for the receiver beyond a standard email reader and web browser, and does not require any public-key infrastructure.
