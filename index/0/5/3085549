We show that nodes of high degree tend to occur infrequently in random graphs but frequently in a wide variety of graphs associated with real world search problems. We then study some alternative models for randomly generating graphs which have been proposed to give more realistic topologies. For example, we show that Watts and Strogatz's small world model has a narrow distribution of node degree. On the other hand, Barabasi and Albert's power law model, gives graphs with both nodes of high degree and a small world topology. These graphs may therefore be useful for benchmarking. We then measure the impact of nodes of high degree and a small world topology on the cost of coloring graphs. The long tail in search costs observed with small world graphs disappears when these graphs are also constructed to contain nodes of high degree. We conjecture that this is a result of the small size of their "backbone", pairs of edges that are frozen to be the same color.
