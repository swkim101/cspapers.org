We present a distributed data structure, which we call the rainbow skip graph. To our knowledge, this is the first peer-to-peer data structure that simultaneously achieves high fault-tolerance, constant-sized nodes, and fast update and query times for ordered data. It is a non-trivial adaptation of the SkipNet/skip-graph structures of Harvey et al. and Aspnes and Shah, so as to provide fault-tolerance as these structures do, but to do so using constant-sized nodes, as in the family tree structure of Zatloukal and Harvey. It supports successor queries on a set of n items using O(log n) messages with high probability, an improvement over the expected O(log n) messages of the family tree. Our structure achieves these results by using the following new constructs:• Rainbow connections: parallel sets of pointers between related components of nodes, so as to achieve good connectivity between "adjacent" components, using constant-sized nodes.• Hydra components: highly-connected, highly fault-tolerant components of constant-sized nodes, which will contain relatively large connected subcomponents even under the failure of a constant fraction of the nodes in the component.We further augment the hydra components in the rainbow skip graph by using erasure-resilient codes to ensure that any large subcomponent of nodes in a hydra component is sufficient to reconstruct all the data stored in that component. By carefully maintaining the size of related components and hydra components to be O(log n), we are able to achieve fast times for updates and queries in the rainbow skip graph. In addition, we show how to make the communication complexity for updates and queries be worst case, at the expense of more conceptual complexity and a slight degradation in the node congestion of the data structure.
