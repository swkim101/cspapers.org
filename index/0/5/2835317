Now that ITiCSE has reached its teenage years, it's time to take a look at where we've been, where we are, and where we'd like to go. The panelists will offer a historical perspective of the conference, what makes it stand out from other conferences, and give some ideas of how they would like to see ITiCSE mature. Come hear what they have to say, and there will be plenty of time for the audience to offer their own suggestions of where they would like to see ITiCSE go.
