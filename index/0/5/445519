We deploy information-centric networks (ICN) to serve several applications including content distribution, vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V), home networks (homenet), and sensor networks. These applications require policy and context-based interaction between service producers and consumers. We visualize the ICN service layer as a contextualized information-centric bus (CIBUS), over which diverse sets of service producers and consumers co-exist. We develop a prototype and demonstrate several desirable features of ICN for homenets such as contextual service publishing and subscription, zero-configuration based node and service discovery, policy based routing and forwarding with name-based firewall, and device-to-device communication. Furthermore the prototype is applicable to both ad hoc and infrastructure settings, and can deal with diverse devices and services.
