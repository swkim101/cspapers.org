An algorithm is presented for online learning of rotations. The proposed algorithm involves matrix exponentiated gradient updates and is motivated by the von Neumann divergence. The multiplicative updates are exponentiated skew-symmetric matrices which comprise the Lie algebra of the rotation group. The orthonormality and unit determinant of the matrix parameter are preserved using matrix logarithms and exponentials and the algorithm lends itself to intuitive interpretation in terms of the differential geometry of the manifold associated with the rotation group. A complexity reduction result is presented that exploits the eigenstructure of the matrix updates to simplify matrix exponentiation to a quadratic form.
