We describe a system for rapidly determining document similarity among a set of documents obtained from an information retrieval (IR) system. We obtain a ranked list of the most important terms in each document using a rapid phrase recognizer system. We store these in a database and compute document similarity using a simple database query. If the number of terms found to not be contained in both documents is less than some predetermined threshold compared to the total number of terms in the document, these documents are determined to be very similar. We compare this to the shingles approach.
