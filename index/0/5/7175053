The advanced computer aided design system, ICAD/PCB, was recently put into operation at Fujitsu. The system provides designers with powerful tools to significantly lower the cost and the time required to design and manufacture printed circuit boards (PCBs). Interactive and automatic facilities to support the entire PCB design process are integrated in the ICAD/PCB system.
