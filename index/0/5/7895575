This paper presents super-threading, which generically means the architectural and software mechanisms for optimizing parallel computation. Super-threading includes architectural optimization of a processing element (PE), mechanism for supporting fast communication and computation, techniques of a compiler and a run time system for optimizing thread creation, thread allocation, tuning of granularity and data allocation to physically distributed storage.
This paper states what super-threading is and examines some of the technologies belonging to it. The processor architecture based on super-threading is proposed and its implementation on a highly parallel computer EM-4 is shown with performance data. Software issues about super-threading are also examined mainly from the viewpoint of granularity optimization. Dynamic granularity optimization methods are proposed here, and evaluated on EM-4. The performance data indicate that super-threading is a key technology for realizing an efficient massively parallel computer.
