With the rise of tools for predictive human performance modeling in HCI comes a need to model legacy applications. Models of legacy systems are used to compare products to competitors, or new proposed design ideas to the existing version of an application. We present CogTool-Helper, an exemplar of a tool that results from joining this HCI need to research in automatic GUI testing from the Software Engineering testing community. CogTool-Helper uses automatic UI-model extraction and test case generation to automatically create CogTool storyboards and models and infer methods to accomplish tasks beyond what the UI designer has specified. A design walkthrough with experienced CogTool users reveal that CogTool-Helper resonates with a "pain point" of real-world modeling and provide suggestions for future work.
