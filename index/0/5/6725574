We consider the task of monocular visual motion estimation from video image sequences. We hypothesise that performance on the task can be improved by incorporating an understanding of physically likely and feasible object dynamics. We test this hypothesis by incorporating a physical simulator into a least-squares estimation procedure. We initialise a full trajectory estimate using RANSAC followed by gradient descent refinement. We present results for 2D image sequences consisting of single ambiguous, visible or occluded balls, as well as results for 3D computer-generated sequences of objects in free-flight with added noise. Results suggest that restricting the estimation to allow only motions that are feasible according to the physics simulator can produce marked improvement when the observed object motion is within the limits of the physics simulator and its world model. Conversely, merely penalising deviations from feasible physical dynamics produces a consistent but incremental improvement over more common dynamics models.
