A large proportion of the resources available on the world-wide 
web refer to information that may be regarded as geographically 
located. Thus most activities and enterprises take place in one or 
more places on the Earth's surface and there is a wealth of survey 
data, images, maps and reports that relate to specific places or 
regions. Despite the prevalence of geographical context, existing 
web search facilities are poorly adapted to help people find 
information that relates to a particular location. When the name of 
a place is typed into a typical search engine, web pages that 
include that name in their text will be retrieved, but it is likely 
that many resources that are also associated with the place may 
not be retrieved. Thus resources relating to places that are inside 
the specified place may not be found, nor may be places that are 
nearby or that are equivalent but referred to by another name. 
Specification of geographical context frequently requires the use 
of spatial relationships concerning distance or containment for 
example, yet such terminology cannot be understood by existing 
search engines. Here we provide a brief survey of existing 
facilities for geographical information retrieval on the web, before 
describing a set of tools and techniques that are being developed 
in the project SPIRIT : Spatially-Aware Information Retrieval on 
the Internet (funded by European Commission Framework V 
Project IST-2001-35047).
