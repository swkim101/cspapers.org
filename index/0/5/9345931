The Internet has become an important source for media content. Content types are not limited to text and pictures but also include video and audio. Currently audiovisual media is presented as it is. However, these media do not integrate the huge amount of related information, which is available on the Web. In this paper we present the Chrooma+ approach to improve the user experience of media consumption by enriching media content with additional information from various sources in the Web. Our approach focuses on the aggregation and combination of this related information with audiovisual media. This approach involves using new HTML5 technologies and with WebVTT a new annotation format to display relevant information at definite times. Some of the advantages of this approach are the usage of a rich annotation format and extensibility to include heterogeneous information sources.
