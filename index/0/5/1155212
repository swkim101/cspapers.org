A promising technique used in some planning systems to improve their performance is the use of domain dependent search control knowledge. We present a procedure for compiling search control knowledge, expressed declaratively in a logic, into the preconditions of the plan actions (operators). We do this within the framework of the situation calculus by introducing a transformation of nonMarkovian action theories into classical Markovian situation calculus theories.
