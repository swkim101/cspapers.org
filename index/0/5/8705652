In this article we illustrate that, management of network resources can yield notably different performances leading to different restoration behaviors -- for different network topologies. In consideration towards this, we first briefly summarize our earlier work on a novel fault restoration mechanism. The proposed mechanism addresses the problem of finding the minimum bandwidth cooperative route in the backhaul of mobile network operators that is shared among multiple operators. We then present our recent results on the extended performance evaluations of the same, for four different synthetic network topologies carried out using extensive simulations. Through these evaluations, we conclude on the best topology that mobile network operators should construct in order for them to maximally benefit by the proposed cooperative routing scheme to yield optimum performance for their capital expenditure.
