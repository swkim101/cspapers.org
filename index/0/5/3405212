Smartwatch has become one of the most popular wearable computers on the market. We conduct an IRB-approved measurement study involving 27 Android smartwatch users. Using a 106-day dataset collected from our participants, we perform in-depth characterization of three key aspects of smartwatch usage "in the wild": usage patterns, energy consumption, and network traffic. Based on our findings, we identify key aspects of the smartwatch ecosystem that can be further improved, propose recommendations, and point out future research directions.
