We employ recursive autoencodersto generate tree structures of phrases with embeddingsat different levels of granularity (e.g., words, sub-phrases andphrases). Over these embeddings on the source and targetside, we introduce a bidimensional attention network to learntheir interactions encoded in a bidimensional attention matrix,from which we extract two soft attention weight distributionssimultaneously. These weight distributions enableBattRAE to generate compositive phrase representations viaconvolution. Based on the learned phrase representations, wefurther use a bilinear neural model, trained via a max-marginmethod, to measure bilingual semantic similarity. To evaluatethe effectiveness of BattRAE, we incorporate this semanticsimilarity as an additional feature into a state-of-the-art SMTsystem. Extensive experiments on NIST Chinese-English testsets show that our model achieves a substantial improvementof up to 1.63 BLEU points on average over the baseline.
