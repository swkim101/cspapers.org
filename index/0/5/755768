In this paper we argue that lexical selection plays a more important role in the generation process than has commonly been assumed. To stress the importance of lexical-semantic input to generation, we explore the distinction and treatment of generating open and closed class lexical items, and suggest an additional classification of the latter into discourse-oriented and proposition-oriented items. Finally, we discuss how lexical selection is influenced by thematic (focus) information in the input.
