This paper describes a means by which a scene can be split into named subparts, and these subparts can interact to produce an interpretation which is a description of the objects present in the scene. The procedure is in two parts - a set of labels is assigned to each element of the scene, and these sets are decreased in size by examining the allowable relationships between named elements. An application of the procedure to the domain of surfaces produced by the ranger at Edinburgh University is presented.
