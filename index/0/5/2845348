This paper studies the semantics for the class of all defeasible (inheritance) networks, including cyclic and in consistent networks using a transformation approach. First we show that defeasible networks can be translated, tractably, to default theories while preserving Horty's pathoff credulous semantics for all consistent networks. Using the existing methods in dealing with the semantics of default logic, we are able to provide a tractable skeptical semantics, the well-founded semantics^ and a new credulous semantics, the regular semantics^ both of which are defined for any defeasible network. Furthermore, we show that these semantics are based on the same principle of specificity used by Horty in defining his credulous semantics of defeasible networks.
