This paper addresses the complexity issues of extended-role based access control (E-RBAC) implemented under an embedded environment. Although E-RBAC can provide more trusted environment than the traditional trusted operating systems by prohibiting the attacks consisting of ordinary operations, it is expected that its implementation has performance overhead due to the procedural constraints of E-RBAC. An implementation of E-RBAC suggested in this paper reduces the overhead of E-RBAC, and it is also shown that the overhead is not significant compared to that of the previous Intrusion Detection System (IDS) solutions.
