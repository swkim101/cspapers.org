This paper reports on experiments with the first available Czech IR test collection. The collection consists of a continuous stream from automatic transcription of spontaneous speech (see [3] for details) and the task of the IR system is to identify appropriate replay points where the discussion about the queried topic starts. The collection thus lacks clearly defined document boundaries. Moreover, the accuracy of the transcription is limited (around 35% word error rate), mostly due to the nature of the speechâ€”interviews with Holocaust survivors, which are sometimes emotional, accented, and exhibiting age-related speech impediments. This collection therefore offers an excellent opportunity to explore both effects present in Czech (e.g., morphology) and effects that result from processing spontaneous speech. It was also used in the CL-SR track at the CLEF 2006 evaluation campaign (http://www.clef-campaign.org/).
