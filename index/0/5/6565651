Data centers must support a range of workloads with differing demands. Although existing approaches handle routine traffic smoothly, intense hotspots--even if ephemeral--cause excessive packet loss and severely degrade performance. This loss occurs even though congestion is typically highly localized, with spare buffer capacity at nearby switches. In this paper, we argue that switches should share buffer capacity to effectively handle this spot congestion without the monetary hit of deploying large buffers at individual switches. Specifically, we present detour-induced buffer sharing (DIBS), a mechanism that achieves a near lossless network without requiring additional buffers at individual switches. Using DIBS, a congested switch detours packets randomly to neighboring switches to avoid dropping the packets. We implement DIBS in hardware, on software routers in a testbed, and in simulation, and we demonstrate that it reduces the 99th percentile of delay-sensitive query completion time by up to 85%, with very little impact on other traffic.
