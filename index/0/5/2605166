Visualization of computational models is at the heart of educational software for computer science and related fields. In this paper we look at how generation of such visualizations and the visualization of the generation process itself increase exploration. Four approaches of increased exploration in formal language theory and compiler design are introduced and for each approach we discuss an educational system which implements it.
