This paper describes the RenTAL system, which enables sharing resources in LTAG and HPSG formalisms by a method of grammar conversion from an FB-LTAG grammar to a strongly equivalent HPSG-style grammar. The system is applied to the latest version of the XTAG English grammar. Experimental results show that the obtained HPSG-style grammar successfully worked with an HPSG parser, and achieved a drastic speed-up against an LTAG parser. This system enables to share not only grammars and lexicons but also parsing techniques.
