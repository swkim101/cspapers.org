A common problem with the use of tensor modeling in generating quality recommendations for large datasets is scalability. In this paper, we propose the Tensor-based Recommendation using Probabilistic Ranking method that generates the reconstructed tensor using block-striped parallel matrix multiplication and then probabilistically calculates the preferences of user to rank the recommended items. Empirical analysis on two real-world datasets shows that the proposed method is scalable for large tensor datasets and is able to outperform the benchmarking methods in terms of accuracy.
