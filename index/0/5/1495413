Online microblogging services, as exemplified by Twitter, have become immensely popular during the latest years. However, current microblogging systems severely suffer from performance bottlenecks and malicious attacks due to the centralized architecture. As a result, centralized microblogging systems may threaten the scalability, reliability as well as availability of the offered services, not to mention the high operational and maintenance cost.
 This demo presents a decentralized, socio-aware microblogging system named Cuckoo. The key aspects of Cuckoo's design is to take advantage of the inherent social relations while leveraging peer-to-peer (P2P) techniques in order to provide scalable, reliable microblogging services. The demo will show these aspects of Cuckoo and provide insights on the performance gain that decentralization and socio-awareness can bring for microblogging systems.
