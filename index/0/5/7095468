We introduce a new large-scale discriminative learning algorithm for machine translation that is capable of learning parameters in models with extremely sparse features. To ensure their reliable estimation and to prevent overfitting, we use a two-phase learning algorithm. First, the contribution of individual sparse features is estimated using large amounts of parallel data. Second, a small development corpus is used to determine the relative contributions of the sparse features and standard dense features. Not only does this two-phase learning approach prevent overfitting, the second pass optimizes corpus-level BLEU of the Viterbi translation of the decoder. We demonstrate significant improvements using sparse rule indicator features in three different translation tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale discriminative training algorithm capable of showing improvements over the MERT baseline with only rule indicator features in addition to the standard MERT features.
