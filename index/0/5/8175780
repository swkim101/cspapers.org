Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is a variant of classiication in which the classes are not known or xed in advance. Consider for example an incoming stream of news articles or email messages that are to be classiied by topic; new classes must be created as new topics arise. The problem is a challenging one for machine learning. Instances of new topics must be recognized as not belonging to any of the existing classes (detection), and instances of old topics must be correctly classiied (tracking)|often with extremely little training data per class. This paper proposes a new approach to TDT based on probabilis-tic, generative models. Strong statistical techniques are used to address the many challenges: hierarchical shrinkage for sparse data, statistical \garbage collection" for new event detection, clustering in time to separate the diierent events of a common topic, and deterministic anneal-ing for creating the hierarchy. Preliminary experimental results show promise.
