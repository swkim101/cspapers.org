The complexity closure of a computable function is defined by a set of axioms. The axioms are satisfied by complexity classes that are computation time closed and also by other complexity classes which do not have this property. It is then shown that there exist honest recursive functions whose complexity closure are setwise incomparable. Further that there exist chains of honest recursive functions whose complexity closures are densely ordered under set inclusion.
