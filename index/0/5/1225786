In this paper, we propose to use statistical methods to estimate unknown attribute values in databases, as compared to assigning possible values at usersâ€™ discretion in common practice. Regression models and classification analysis are introduced for estimating continuous and categorical unknown attribute values, respectively. Procedures for selecting relevant attributes in a relation and preliminary experimental results of the proposed models on a real life database are also presented.
