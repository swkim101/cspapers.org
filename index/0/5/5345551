Personalization of web search results as a technique for improving user satisfaction has received notable attention in the research community over the past decade. Much of this work focuses on modeling and establishing a profile for each user to aid in personalization. Our work takes a more query-centric approach. In this paper, we present a method for efficient, automatic identification of a class of queries we define as localizable from a web search engine query log. We determine a set of relevant features and use conventional machine learning techniques to classify queries. Our experiments find that our technique is able to identify localizable queries with 94% accuracy.
