Today, it is not unusual for secretaries to use computer-based word-processing systems to deal with manuscripts, correspondence, and memos. In the future, such functions as updating personal calendars, filing, and leaving messages undoubtedly will be handled by computers. For all these functions, people without a technical background are required to interact effectively with a computer system.
 A person's introduction to computers often begins with an attempt to learn how to use a text editor. Thus, knowing how to use a text editor is a requirement for a growing number of jobs. The importance of text editing is underscored by the recent psychological research devoted to understanding this skill [1,2,3,5].
