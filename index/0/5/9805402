In the Cambridge Distributed System, developed at the Computer Laboratory. Cambridge, terminals, machines and peripherals are separated by a ring network. A problem that arises is the establishment and control of suitable connexions between the individual components, so that users may use machines, machines may use peripherals or other machines, etc. in a secure manner.
 This paper describes an experimental mechanism used to control the connexions and provide security in our particular system. The solution is not restricted to the Cambridge ring, although a different architecture may suggest alternative solutions more suited to its specific features. Some possibilities are discussed.
