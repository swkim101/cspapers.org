Maintaining and updating signature databases is a tedious task that normally requires a large amount of user effort. The problem becomes harder when features can be distorted by observation noise, which we call volatility. To address this issue, we propose algorithms and models to automatically generate signatures in the presence of noise, with a focus on stack fingerprinting, which is a research area that aims to discover the operating system (OS) of remote hosts using TCP/IP packets. Armed with this framework, we construct a database with 420 network stacks, label the signatures, develop a robust classifier for this database, and fingerprint 66M visible webservers on the Internet.
