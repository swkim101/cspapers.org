This tutorial provides the framework, vehicles, and strategies for teaching data communications using a low-cost communications tool known as Commkit. It will demonstrate how Commkit can be used for instruction in point-to-point communications, wide area networks, local area networks (bus and token ring), gateways, network analysis tools, protocols, and layered architectures using personal computers and RS-232 connections. The instructor will provide the illustrations, assignments, and sample networks that he has used in a number of data communication courses as well as in a distributed systems course.
