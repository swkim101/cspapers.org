Computing with geometry is a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field involving computer science, engineering and mathematics. It has relationships to many other areas within computer science (e.g., computational geometry, graphics, information/scientific visualization and computer vision) and serves as a vehicle for engineering students to approach product design and manufacturing processes. Moreover, this is a geometric world! Unfortunately, in a typical computer science curriculum, computing with geometry is virtually missing in spite of its impact on computer science and other fields, and its importance to increase studentsâ€™ employability. Furthermore, many educators still believe computing with geometry, especially curves, surfaces and solids, belongs to engineering and is not part of computer science curricula, despite the need in graphics and computer-aided design for software engineers and programmers.
