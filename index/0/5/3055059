Despite the numerous optimization and evaluation studies that have been conducted with TLBs over the years, there is still a deficiency in an indepth understanding of TLB characteristics from an application angle. This paper presents a detailed characterization study of the TLB behavior of the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite. The contributions of this work are in identifying important application characteristics for TLB studies, quantifying the SPEC2000 application behavior for these characteristics, as well as making pronouncements and suggestions for future research based on these results.Around one-fourth of the SPEC2000 applications (ammp, apsi, galgel, lucas, mcf, twolf and vpr) have significant TLB missrates. Both capacity and associativity are influencing factors on miss-rates, though they do not necessarily go hand-in-hand. Multi-level TLBs are definitely useful for these applications in cutting down access times without significant miss rate degradation. Superpaging to combine TLB entries may not be rewarding for many of these applications. Software management of TLBs in terms of determining what entries to prefetch, what entries to replace, and what entries to pin has a lot of potential to cut down miss rates considerably. Specifically, the potential benefits of prefetching TLB entries is examined, and Distance Prefetching is shown to give good prediction accuracy for these applications.
