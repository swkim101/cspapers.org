A software product line leverages the knowledge of one or more domains in order to achieve short time-to-market, cost savings, and high quality software. The highest level of reuse comes by using domain-specific languages or visual builders to describe a member of the product line, and to generate the member from the description. Generative techniques can help us to capture the configuration knowledge for a product line and use it to generate concrete family members. This workshop focuses on technical issues of product lines, rather than economic issues.
