The paper addresses the concept of cognition starting from the role of a sensor basis in the design of robots. The field of robotics forces the discussion to be pragmatic which is considered to be advantageous. In addition, we introduce the notion of cognitive basis in order to discuss the cognitive abilities of an artificial creature. As cognition cannot be fully separated from action and acting, we present finally the notion of motor-schema basis. This basis involves actions and acting as integral parts of cognition.
