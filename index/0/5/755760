Video retargeting is the process of transforming an existing video to fit the dimensions of an arbitrary display. A compelling retargeting aims at preserving the viewers' experience by maintaining the information content of important regions in the frame, whilst keeping their aspect ratio. An efficient algorithm for video retargeting is introduced. It consists of two stages. First, the frame is analyzed to detect the importance of each region in the frame. Then, a transformation that respects the analysis shrinks less important regions more than important ones. Our analysis is fully automatic and based on local saliency, motion detection and object detectors. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on a variety of video sequences, and compared to the state of the art in image retargeting.
