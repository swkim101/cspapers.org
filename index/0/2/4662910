Gait recognition has recently gained attention as an effective approach to identify individuals at a distance from a camera. Most existing gait recognition algorithms assume that people have been tracked and silhouettes have been segmented successfully. Tacking and segmentation are, however, very difficult especially for articulated objects such as human beings. Therefore, we present an integrated algorithm for tracking and segmentation supported by gait recognition. After the tracking module produces initial results consisting of bounding boxes and foreground likelihood images, the gait recognition module searches for the optimal silhouette-based gait models corresponding to the results. Then, the segmentation module tries to segment people out using the provided gait silhouette sequence as shape priors. Experiments on real video sequences show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
