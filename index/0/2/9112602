This paper presents ongoing research involving design and evaluation of different architectures for providing knowledge-based solutions in industrial robotized automation systems. The conclusions are that distributed, cloud-based approaches offer many possibilities, in particular for knowledge exchange and reuse, and facilitate new business models for industrial solutions. However, there are many unresolved questions yet, e.g., those related to reliability, consistency, or legal responsibility. There is a definite need for further research and better infrastructure before this approach would become attractive for industrial actors.
