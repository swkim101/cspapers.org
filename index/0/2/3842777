The linkage of ImageNet WordNet synsets to Wikidata items will leverage deep learning algorithm with access to a rich multilingual knowledge graph. Here I will describe our on-going efforts in linking the two resources and issues faced in matching the Wikidata and WordNet knowledge graphs. I show an example on how the linkage can be used in a deep learning setting with real-time image classification and labeling in a non-English language and discuss what opportunities lies ahead.
