We present a collection of new techniques for designing and analyzing e cient external-memory algorithms for graph problems and illustrate how these techniques can be applied to a wide variety of speci c problems. Our results include: Proximate-neighboring. We present a simple method for deriving external-memory lower bounds via reductions from a problem we call the \proximate neighbors" problem. We use this technique to derive non-trivial lower bounds for such problems as list ranking, expression tree evaluation, and connected components. PRAM simulation. We give methods for e ciently simulating PRAM computations in external memory, even for some cases in which the PRAM algorithm is not work-optimal. We apply this to derive a number of optimal (and simple) external-memory graph algorithms. Time-forward processing. We present a general technique for evaluating circuits (or \circuit-like" computations) in external memory. We also use this in a deterministic list ranking algorithm.
