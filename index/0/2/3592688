In this paper, we explore a streaming algorithm paradigm to handle large amounts of data for NLP problems. We present an efficient low-memory method for constructing high-order approximate n-gram frequency counts. The method is based on a deterministic streaming algorithm which efficiently computes approximate frequency counts over a stream of data while employing a small memory footprint. We show that this method easily scales to billion-word monolingual corpora using a conventional (8 GB RAM) desktop machine. Statistical machine translation experimental results corroborate that the resulting high-n approximate small language model is as effective as models obtained from other count pruning methods.
