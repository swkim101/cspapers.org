In this paper we describe the salient features of a new system for reasoning about time. The system represents time primarily — though not exclusively — in terms of intervals, and performs deductions on this representation. It has a mechanism for maintaining consistency in the representation and discovering the origin of inconsistencies. Further, its deduction mechanisms for intervals are easily extended to deal with time points. Finally, it embodies a simple and elegant scheme for reasoning about absolute dates.
