We report on preliminary work in the application of low- level visual motion cues to identify potential hazards during on-road driving. In conjunction with a clinical study of hazard perception in older age drivers, we consider the detection of a range of hazardous scenarios identified as particularly challenging for older drivers in video sequences used in the clinical study. Central to our approach is the use of visual motion as a means of estimating self motion, from which we identify optical flow due to other motions in the scene.We report results obtained using the same hazard perception test used in clinical trials.
