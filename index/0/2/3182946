Graphical presentations can he used to communicate information in relational data sets suffciently and effectively However novel graphical presentations about numerous attributes and their relationships are often difficult to understand completely until explained Automatically generated graphical presenlations must therefore either be limited to simple conventional ones or risk incornprehensibility One way of alleviating this problem is to design graphical presentation systems that can work in conjunction with a natural language generator to produce explanatory captions This paper presents three strategies for generating explanatory captions to accompany information graphics based on (1) a representation of the structure of the graphical presentation (2) a framework for identifying the perceptual complexity of graphical elements and (3) the structure of the data expressed in the graphic We describe an implemented system and illustrate how it is used to generate explanatory captions for a range of graphics from a data set about real estate transactions in Pittsburgh.
