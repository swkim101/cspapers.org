We present UbiSketch, a tool for ubiquitous real-time sketch-based communication. We describe the UbiSketch system, which enables people to create doodles, drawings, and notes with digital pens and paper and publish them quickly and easily via their mobile phones to social communication channels, such as Facebook, Twitter, and email. The natural paper-based social interaction enabled by UbiSketch has the potential to enrich current mobile communication practices.
