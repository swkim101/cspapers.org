A syntactic analysis procedure is described which obtains directly the deep structure information associated with an input sentence. The implementation utilizes a state transition network characterizing those linguistic facts representable in a context free form, and a number of techniques to code and derive additional logic information and to permit the compression of the network size, thereby allowing more efficient operation of the system. By recognizing identical constituent predictions stemming from two different analysis paths, the system determines the structure of this constituent only once. When two alternative paths through the state transition network converge to a single state at some point In the analysis, subsequent analyses are carried out only once despite the earlier ambiguity. Use of flags to carry feature concordance and previous context information allows merging of a number of almost identical paths through the network.
