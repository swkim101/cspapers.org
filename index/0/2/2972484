Background modeling and subtraction to detect new or moving objects in a scene is an important component of many intelligent video applications. Compared to a single camera, the use of multiple cameras leads to better handling of shadows, specularities and illumination changes due to the utilization of geometric information. Although the result of stereo matching can be used as the feature for detection, it has been shown that the detection process can be made much faster by a simple subtraction of the intensities observed at stereo-generated conjugate pairs in the two views. The methodology however, suffers from false and missed detections due to some geometric considerations. In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of such errors. Then, we propose a sensor configuration that eliminates false detections. Algorithms are also proposed that effectively eliminate most detection errors due to missed detections, specular reflections and objects being geometrically close to the background. Experiments on several scenes illustrate the utility and enhanced performance of the proposed approach compared to existing techniques.
