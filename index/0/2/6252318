This paper presents a study of misleading intuition in the domain of algorithmic problem solving. I noticed incorrect intuitive solutions to challenging algorithmic problems and interviewed students on their solutions. The students arrived at an erroneous conviction rather rapidly and demonstrated overconfidence and reinforcement of their incorrect ideas when presented with new evidence. I present two colorful and unfamiliar algorithmic challenges posed to the students, describe and discuss my experience, and offer some suggestions for reducing the effect of misleading intuition.
