This paper describes a digital-ticket management scheme for a generalized digital-ticket circulation system. Today, there are several digital-ticket or ticket-less systems that enable users to redeem tickets or purchase goods without getting a paper ticket. There are two main approaches: account-based and smart-cardbased digital-ticket systems. Most account-based systems require the service provider to maintain accounts for their users which increases ticketing costs. Users may worry that the service provider could alter or delete tickets maliciously, since account management is left to the service provider. The smart-card-based system also has numerous problems that must be solved, i.e. who should responsible for issuing the smart card if it is shared by multiple applications, how do we achieve high-performance given the memory and CPU constraints of smart cards, and how to realize asynchronous trading. To resolve these problems, we propose a new scheme in which each account is managed not by the service provider but the user himself or someone delegated to manage the account. We introduce the ticket-token manager who is responsible for ensuring that only one user exists for each ticket.
