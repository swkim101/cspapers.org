With the capacity of communications channels increasing at the current rates and with the kinds of electronic services becoming more varied and multidimensional, there is also coming a greater tendency to store and forward sensitive, semi-private or very private information. With this tendency there is an increasing interest in protecting the privacy and security of communications channels and sensitive information. Many protocols have been devised which provide varying levels of security and which have overhead associated with them roughly proportional to the level of that security. These protocols make use of cryptosystems which may be divided roughly into two groups: private key and public key. It is generally assumed that efficient implementations of these systems are possible only in hardware or at least coded in very nonportable assembly language for particular processors. CryptoLib is a very portable and efficient library of routines necessary for the aforementioned cryptosystems. It written entirely in C and exists under UNIXï››.
