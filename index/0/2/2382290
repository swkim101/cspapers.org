XQuery and SQL/XML are powerful new languages for querying XML data. However, they contain a number of stumbling blocks that users need to be aware of to get the expected results and performance. For example, certain language features make it hard if not impossible to exploit XML indexes.The major database vendors provide XQuery and SQL/XML support in their current or upcoming product releases. In this paper, we identify common pitfalls gleaned from the experiences of early adopters of this functionality. We illustrate these pitfalls through concrete examples, explain the unexpected query behavior, and show alternative formulations of the queries that behave and perform as anticipated. As results we provide guidelines for XQuery and SQL/XML users, feedback on the language standards, and food for thought for emerging languages and APIs.
