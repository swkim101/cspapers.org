It has been known for many years that specific regions of the working cerebral cortex display periodic variations in correlated cellular activity. While the olfactory system has been the focus of much of this work, similar behavior has recently been observed in primary visual cortex. We have developed models of both the olfactory and visual cortex which replicate the observed oscillatory properties of these networks. Using these models we have examined the dependence of oscillatory behavior on single cell properties and network architectures. We discuss the idea that the oscillatory events recorded from cerebral cortex may be intrinsic to the architecture of cerebral cortex as a whole, and that these rhythmic patterns may be important in coordinating neuronal activity during sensory processing.
