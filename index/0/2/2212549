Click-down (or pull-down) menus have long been a key componentof graphical user interfaces, yet we know surprisingly little abouthow users actually interact with such menus. Nilsens [8] study onmenu selection has led to the development of a number of models ofhow users perform the task [6, 21. However, the validity of thesemodels has not been empirically assessed with respect to eyemovements (though [l] presents some interesting data that bear onthese models). The present study is an attempt to provide data thatcan help refine our understanding of how users interact with suchmenus.
