Electromigration (EM) in VLSI interconnects has become one of the major reliability issues for current and future VLSI technologies. However, existing EM modeling and analysis techniques are mainly developed for a single wire. For practical VLSI chips, the interconnects such as clock and power grid networks typically consist of multi-branch metal segments representing a continuously connected, highly conductive metal (Cu) lines within one layer of metallization, terminating at diffusion barriers. The EM effects in those branches are not independent and they have to be considered simultaneously. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, a first principle based analytic solution of this problem. We investigate the analytic expressions describing the hydrostatic stress evolution in several typical interconnect trees: the straight-line 3-terminal wires, the T-shaped 4-terminal wires and the cross-shaped 5-terminal wires. The new approach solves the stress evolution in a multi-branch tree by de-coupling the individual segments through the proper boundary conditions accounting the interactions between different branches. By using Laplace transformation technique, analytical solutions are obtained for each type of the interconnect trees. The analytical solutions in terms of a set of auxiliary basis functions using the complementary error function agree well with the numerical analysis results. Our analysis further demonstrates that using the first two dominant basis functions can lead to 0.5% error, which is sufficient for practical EM analysis.
