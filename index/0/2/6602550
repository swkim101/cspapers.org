The paper describes an implementation of Shamir secret sharing schemes based on exponentiation in Galois fields. It is shown how to generate shares so the scheme has the disenrollment capability. Next a family of conditionally secure Shamir schemes is defined and the disenrollment capability is investigated for the family. The paper also examines a problem of covert channels which are present in any secret sharing scheme.
