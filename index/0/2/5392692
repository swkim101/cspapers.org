Reasoning about causality is an interesting application area of formal nonmonotonic theories. Here we focus our attention on a certain aspect of causal reasoning, namely causal asymmetry. In order to provide a qualitative account of causal asymmetry, we present a justification-based approach that uses circumscription to obtain the minimality of causes. We define the notion of causal and evidential support in terms of a justification change with respect to a circumscriptive theory and show how the definition provides desirable interactions between causal and evidential support.
