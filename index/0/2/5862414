This paper investigates assembly planning in virtual environments. It introduces a virtual teaching pendant and develops an interactive planning algorithm. This algorithm is capable of extracting human expertise of mechanical assembly from human-computer interaction and then using it for the automatic generation and interactive evaluation of assembly sequences. Analysis shows that the proposed interactive approach has a low complexity and hence offers a valid alternative to the usual autonomous approaches of assembly planning.
