This paper presents a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) model of a scalar-controlled photovoltaic pumping system. The considered uncertainty is the temperature that affects the overall model. It is taken under an affine structure. For the control of the system, V/f strategy is chosen in a closed loop. The approach is proved to enhance good results. Stability is reached following the simulation of the adopted LPV model.
