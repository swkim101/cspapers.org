The existing approaches to fragment-based publishing, delivery and caching of web pages assume that the web pages are manually fragmented at their respective web sites. However manual fragmentation of web pages is expensive, error prone, and not scalable. This paper proposes a novel scheme to automatically detect and flag possible fragments in a web site. Our approach is based on an analysis of the web pages dynamically generated at given web sites with respect to their information sharing behavior, personalization characteristics and change patterns.
