This study investigates the effectiveness of retrieval systems and human users in generating terms for query expansion. We compare three sources of terms: system generated terms, terms users select from top-ranked sentences, and user generated terms. Results demonstrate that overall the system generated more effective expansion terms than users, but that users' selection of terms improved precision at the top of the retrieved document list.
