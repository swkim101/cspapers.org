This video presents the application of Extrinsic Dexterity to change the pose of an object in the hand, i.e., to regrasp the object. Gravity, inertia, arm motions and external contacts can be exploited to manipulate an object in the hand. As such dexterity does not depend solely on the intrinsic capability of the hand, but rather is derived from external resources, we call it as “Extrinsic Dexterity”. The video showcases a repertoire of regrasps developed for a simple gripper and presents one of the sequences regrasps designed to explore border manipulation capability by connecting different regrasps.
