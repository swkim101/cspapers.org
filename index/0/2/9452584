We present a parallel garbage compaction algorithm which does not require any additional empty heap space. Our design takes a divide-and-conquer approach to Morrisâ€™ techniques of pointer redirection and relocation. If the problem is small, we use the Morris algorithm directly. Otherwise, the heap is divided into two segments, and all inter-segment pointers are redirected in parallel; then, the local pointers in both segments are redirected by two recursive calls of our algorithm executed in parallel.
