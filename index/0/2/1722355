Describes the status of ongoing work in developing a sensory-motor robotic system, R2H, with 10 degrees of freedoms for research in active vision. To complement the R2H system, a Graphical Simulation and Animation (GSA) environment has also been developed. The objective of building the GSA system is to create a comprehensive design tool to design and study the behavior of active systems and their interactions with the environment. The GSA system will aid the researchers to develop high performance and reliable software and hardware in a most effective manner. The GSA environment integrates sensing and motor actions and features complete kinematic simulation of the R2H system, sensors and its workspace. With the aid of the GSA environment, depth-from-focus, depth-from-vergence, and depth-from-stereo modules have been implemented and tested.
