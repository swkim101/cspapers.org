The TEXNH method is an approach to undergraduate computer science education that is based on cognitive constructivisim, in the sense of Piaget, and which invokes several course design directives that include re-combining art and science, problem-based learning, problem selection from the visual problem domain, and cognitive apprenticeship. The paper describes a new TEXNH course in data structures. It includes a full comparative assessment of the realized improvement in student problem solving capability and, for the first time, cognitive authenticity in problem selection, in that the course problem is a variation on a very recent research result.
