Many problems can be expressed in terms of a numeric constraint satisfaction problem over finite or continuous domains (numeric CSP). The purpose of this paper is to show that the consistency techniques that have been developed for CSPs can be adapted to numeric CSPs. Since the numeric domains are ordered the underlying idea is to handle domains only by their bounds. The semantics that have been elaborated, plus the complexity analysis and good experimental results, confirm that these techniques can be used in real applications.
