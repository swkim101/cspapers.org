In this paper we propose CCCS, a new algorithm for classification based on association rule mining. The key innovation in CCCS is the use of a new measure, the "Complement Class Support (CCS)" whose application results in rules which are guaranteed to be positively correlated. Furthermore, the anti-monotonic property that CCS possesses has very different semantics vis-a-vis the traditional support measure. In particular, "good" rules have a low CCS value. This makes CCS an ideal measure to use in conjunction with a top-down algorithm. Finally, the nature of CCS allows the pruning of rules without the setting of any threshold parameter! To the best of our knowledge this is the first threshold-free algorithm in association rule mining for classification.
