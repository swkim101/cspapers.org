This paper presents the design and experimental validation of an anthropomorphic underactuated robotic hand with 15 degrees of freedom and a single actuator. First, the force transmission design of underactuated fingers is revisited. An optimal geometry of the tendon-driven fingers is then obtained. Then, underactuation between the fingers is addressed using differential mechanisms. Tendon routings are proposed and verified experimentally. Finally, a prototype of a 15-degree-of-freedom hand is built and tested. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a humanoid hand with many degrees of freedom and one single degree of actuation.
