Traditional public health surveillance systems would benefit from integration with knowledge created by new situation-aware realtime signals from social media, online searches, mobile/sensor networks and citizens' participatory surveillance systems. However, the challenge of threat validation, cross-verification and information integration for risk assessment has so far been largely untackled. In this paper, we propose a new system, medi+board, monitoring epidemic intelligence sources and traditional case-based surveillance to better automate early warning, cross-validation of signals for outbreak detection and visualization of results on an interactive dashboard. This enables public health professionals to see all essential information at a glance. Modular and configurable to any 'event' defined by public health experts, medi+board scans multiple data sources, detects changing patterns and uses a configurable analysis module for signal detection to identify a threat. These can be validated by an analysis module and correlated with other sources to assess the reliability of the event classified as the reliability coefficient which is a real number between zero and one. Events are reported and visualized on the medi+board dashboard which integrates all information sources and can be navigated by a timescale widget. Simulation with three datasets from the swine flu 2009 pandemic (HPA surveillance, Google news, Twitter) demonstrates the potential of medi+board to automate data processing and visualization to assist public health experts in decision making on control and response measures.
