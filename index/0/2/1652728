We propose a procedure to sequentially tighten the linear programming relaxation of a mixed O-l program by generating lift-and-project cutting planes. The cuts are found through the solution of a linear program that has at most twice the size of the current LP relaxation. We report our computational experience when using our cuts as part of a cutting plane algorithm, as well as in the context of a branch-and-cut procedure.
