Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) with the ability to provide accurate positioning and timing information have become very important for many essential applications of both military and civil purposes. Toward the objective of a high sensitivity GNSS receiver architecture capable of operating anywhere at anytime, this paper introduce a new acquisition strategy to adapt with the problem of low received signal power in indoor environments. The strategy combines the proved advantages coming from joint data/pilot acquisition strategies and differential integration technique to further improve the robustness of the acquisition process. Analytical expressions as well as Monte Carlo simulations in indoor scenarios are presented to describe and prove the strategy improvement with respect to other strategies in literatures.
