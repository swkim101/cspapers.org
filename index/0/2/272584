One important way to teach Computer Science is by getting students involved in projects that interest them. In order to demonstrate the value of music related computer projects, this paper describes some of the projects that I have advised and discusses my experience with them. These experiences show that students are very enthusiastic about music projects, enjoy working hard at them and learn a lot in the process. This paper also serves as a brief introduction to MIDI, the standard interface for electronic music.
