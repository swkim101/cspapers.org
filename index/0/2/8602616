Projects, once stranded, suffocate from their own weight. The weight of the project is the complexity that it has created, or that has been burdened upon it: complexity of the problem, of the organization, of the chosen solution, of the environment and of the team dynamics.
 While complexity cannot be avoided, it can be influenced and managed. This workshop explores how complexity arrives at a project, how it can be measured, what heuristics indicate risk, and how complexity can be managed and overcome.
