This study examines the effects of multimodal feedback on the performance of older adults with an ocular disease, Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), when completing a simple computer-based task. Visually healthy older users (n = 6) and older users with AMD (n = 6) performed a series of drag-and-drop tasks that incorporated a variety of different feedback modalities. The user groups were equivalent with respect to traditional visual function metrics and measured subject cofactors, aside from the presence or absence of AMD. Results indicate that users with AMD exhibited decreased performance, with respect to required feedback exposure time. Some non-visual and multimodal feedback forms show potential as solutions to enhance performance, for those with AMD as well as for visually healthy older adults.
