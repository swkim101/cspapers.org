The common distinction between probabilities that can be based on frequencies known to hold in a sequence of repeatable events, and probabilities that concern unique events, and that therefore must be based on subjective opinion, is argued to be misguided. All events are in some relevant sense "unique", and, more importantly, all events can in a relevant sense be placed in classes of similar events. A formal calculus is described for accomplishing this in relatively simple but useful cases.
