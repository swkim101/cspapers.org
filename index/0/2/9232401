We present HIME, a new EDF-based semi-partitioned scheduling algorithm which allows at most one migrating task per processor. In a system with m processors, this arrangement limits the migrating tasks to at most m/2 and the number of migrations per job to at most m-1. HIME has a utilisation bound of at least 74.9%, and can be configured to achieve 75%, the theoretical limit for semi-partitioned schemes with at most m/2 migrating tasks. Experiments show that the average system utilisation achieved by HIME is about 95%.
