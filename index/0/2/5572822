NAND Flash has become the most popular persistent data storage medium for mobile and embedded devices. The hardware characteristics of NAND Flash (e.g. page granularity for read/write with a block-erase-before-rewrite constraint, limited number of erase cycles) preclude in-place updates. In this paper, we propose a new indexing scheme, called PBFilter, designed from the outset to exploit the peculiarities of NAND Flash.
