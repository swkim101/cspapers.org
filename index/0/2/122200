In this paper, we present a monocular direct semi-dense SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) method that can handle both radial distortion and rolling-shutter distortion. Such distortions are common in, but not restricted to, situations when an inexpensive wide-angle lens and a CMOS sensor are used, and leads to significant inaccuracy in the map and trajectory estimates if not modeled correctly. The apparent naive solution of simply undistorting the images using pre-calibrated parameters does not apply to this case since rows in the undistorted image are no longer captured at the same time. To address this we develop an algorithm that incorporates radial distortion into an existing state-of-the-art direct semi-dense SLAM system that takes rolling-shutters into account. We propose a method for finding the generalized epipolar curve for each rolling-shutter radially distorted image. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and compare it favorably with the state-of-the-art in direct semi-dense rolling-shutter SLAM.
