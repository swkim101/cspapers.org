In this paper, we describe CoolMag, a tangible interaction tool to enable children to create different instruments collaboratively in music education. With CoolMag, children could learn the basic playing methods of different instruments. It also has the potential to inspire children's creativity, because children could adopt objects in daily life (broom, cup, pen etc.) as the carrier of their novel instruments whose appearance may differ from the traditional one.
