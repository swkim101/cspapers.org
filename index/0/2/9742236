Activity Recognition (AR), which identifies the activity that a user performs, is attracting a tremendous amount of attention, especially with the recent explosion of smart mobile devices. These ubiquitous mobile devices, most notably but not exclusively smartphones, provide the sensors, processing, and communication capabilities that enable the development of diverse and innovative activity recognition-based applications. However, although there has been a great deal of research into activity recognition, surprisingly little practical work has been done in the area of applications in mobile devices. In this paper we describe and categorize a variety of activity recognition-based applications. Our hope is that this work will encourage the development of such applications and also influence the direction of activity recognition research.
