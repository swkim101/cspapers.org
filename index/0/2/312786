Several algorithms have been proposed for finding the “best,” “optimal,” or “most interesting” rule(s) in a database according to a variety of metrics including confidence, support, gain, chi-squared value, gini, entropy gain, laplace, lift, and conviction. In this paper, we show that the best rule according to any of these metrics must reside along a support/confidence border. Further, in the case of conjunctive rule mining within categorical data, the number of rules along this border is conveniently small, and can be mined efficiently from a variety of real-world data-sets. We also show how this concept can be generalized to mine all rules that are best according to any of these criteria with respect to an arbitrary subset of the population of interest. We argue that by returning a broader set of rules than previous algorithms, our techniques allow for improved insight into the data and support more user-interaction in the optimized rule-mining process.
