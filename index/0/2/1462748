Distributed platforms are now a de facto standard in modern software and application development. Although the ACM/IEEE Curriculum 2013 introduces Parallel and Distributed Computing as a first class knowledge area for the first time, the right level of abstraction to teach these concepts is still an important question that needs to be explored. This work presents our findings in teaching cloud computing by exposing upper-level students to testbeds in use by the distributed systems research community. The possibility of giving students practical and relevant experience was explored in the context of new course assignment objectives. Furthermore, students were able to significantly contribute to a pilot class project with medium-scale computation based on satellite data. However, the software engineering challenges in these environments proved to be daunting. In particular, these challenges were exacerbated by a lack of debugging support relative to the environments students were more familiar with---requiring development practices that out-stripped typical course experiences. Our proposed set of experiments and project provide a basis for an evaluation of the trade-offs of teaching cloud and distributed systems on the wild side. We hope that these findings provide insight into some of the possibilities to consider when preparing the next generation of computer scientists to engage with software practices and paradigms that are already fundamental in today's highly distributed systems.
