On July 27, 1990 MCC’S senior management in consultation with the participating companies in MCC’S Advanced Computer Technology Program elected to terminate MCC’s Human Interface Laboratory. This decision ended a six and one–half year effort to build a large, integrated, multidisciplinary research program on user interface technology. The Lab produced numerous prototype technologies, many described in CHI conference proceedings. Nevertheless, its struggle to integrate the research disciplines, involve the participating companies, and survive changes in the structure of research funding provide a microcosm of difficult issues facing other user interface research programs.
