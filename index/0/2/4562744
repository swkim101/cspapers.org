Predictions of driver's intentions and their behaviors using the road is of great importance for planning and decision making processes of autonomous driving vehicles. In particular, relatively short-term driving intentions are the fundamental units that constitute more sophisticated driving goals, behaviors, such as overtaking the slow vehicle in front, exit or merge onto a high way, etc. While it is not uncommon that most of the time human driver can rationalize, in advance, various on-road behaviors, intentions, as well as the associated risks, aggressiveness, reciprocity characteristics, etc., such reasoning skills can be challenging and difficult for an autonomous driving system to learn. In this article, we demonstrate a disciplined methodology that can be used to build and train a predictive drive system, therefore to learn the on-road characteristics aforementioned.
