Even though current mesh networks are mostly WiFi-based, future networks are expected to be highly heterogeneous. Motivated by this expectation, CARMEN (CARrier grade MEsh Networks) project focuses on developing a heterogeneous mesh backhaul to provide carrier-grade (voice, video and data) services. This demo presents resource management and abstraction in CARMEN architecture, which allow meeting the challenges of heterogeneous radio access.
