Gamma ray activation spectra are used by nuclear physicists to identify the elemental composition of unknown substances. Neutron bombardment causes some of the atoms of the sample to change into unstable isotopes, which then decay, emitting gamma radiation at characteristic energies and intensities. By identifying the unstable isotopes, the composition of the original substance can be determined. Since the performance of such analysis relies on large amounts of various kinds of knowledge, the task seems appropriate for the techniques of knowledge engineering. An experimental system, GAMMA, has been developed, based on the generate-and-test paradigm. GAMMA's performance has been good enough that it is currently in use by practicing nuclear physicists.
