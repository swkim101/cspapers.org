People perform daily activities in many different ways. When setting a table, they might use a tray, stack plates, stack cups on plates, leave the doors of a cupboard open when taking several items out of it. Similarly flexible behavior is desired when mobile robots perform household tasks. Moreover, they should perform actions in a way that they are accepted by the people, for example by showing human-like behavior.
