The Cambridge Ring is a local communication system developed in the Computer Laboratory of the University of Cambridge. It differs in various respects from some other local communication mechanisms such as Ethernet systems (Metcalfe & Boggs, 1976), and the purpose of the present paper is to describe the way in which the properties of the ring affect the general systems aspects of its exploitation.
