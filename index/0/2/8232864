This lightning talk describes the U.S. Army's Cyber Leader Development Program (CLDP) which is a recently implemented initiative designed to increase and improve undergraduate cyber education for United States Military Academy (USMA) and Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) cadets. The CLDP takes a holistic viewpoint towards cyber education. Its methodology provides a model for all educators on how to integrate out-of-class enrichment opportunities with an in-class curriculum. CLDP is a voluntary program that has about 800 hours of required out-of-class activities. These required activities include being assigned a formal mentor, participation in a security or hacking club, attending a security conference, participating in security training, and participating in an internship. This program is in its inaugural year with ROTC and in its second year at the United States Military Academy. The focus of this lightning talk will be to highlight the central aspects of the program and to describe how such programs would improve the holistic development of any students, security or otherwise. CLDP is not just a working military program -- it is an exportable concept that presents an applicable model for the development of cyber security students destined to support corporate America as well as government agencies at federal, state, and local levels.
