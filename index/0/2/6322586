A short term goal in the forest industry is semi-automation of existing machines for the tasks of logging and harvesting. One way to assist drivers is to provide a set of predefined trajectories that can be used repeatedly in the process. In recent years much effort has been directed to the design of control strategies and task planning as part of this solution. However, commercialization of such automatic schemes requires the installation of various sensing devices, computers and most of all a redesign of the machine itself, which is currently undesired by manufacturers. Here we present an approach of implementing predefined trajectories in an open-loop fashion, which avoids the complexity of sensor and computer integration. The experimental results are carried out on a commercial hydraulic crane to demonstrate that this solution is feasible in practice.
