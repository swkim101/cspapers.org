We developed a laboratory-based course on Internet Security. The course is aimed at the senior undergraduate. This paper discusses the course and explains how others can set up their own labs to teach this course. All the laboratory work is conducted in a laboratory of PCs running Linux. We developed lecture notes for the course, and a web site to widely disseminate these materials.
