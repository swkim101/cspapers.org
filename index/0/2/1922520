Each specification is compiled into a fast, monolithic C program that accepts dags (directed acyclic graphs) annotated with intermediate code, and generates, optimizes, and emits code for the target machine. The code generators are used with a front end for ANSI C. The resulting compilers emit code similar to pcciâ€™s, but they run about twice as fast. The compilers are in use by small research groups at Bell Labs and Princeton University and by classes at Princeton.
