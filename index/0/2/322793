We present the iterative design of Momento, a tool that providesintegrated support for situated evaluation of ubiquitouscomputing applications. We derived requirements for Momento from a user-centered design process that includedinterviews, observations and field studies of early versionsof the tool. Motivated by our findings, Momento supportsremote testing of ubicomp applications, helps with participantadoption and retention by minimizing the need for newhardware, and supports mid-to-long term studies to addressinfrequently occurring data. Also, Momento can gather logdata, experience sampling, diary, and other qualitative data.
