We combine search in triple stores with full-text search into what we call \emph{semantic full-text search}. We provide a fully functional web application that allows the incremental construction of complex queries on the English Wikipedia combined with the facts from Freebase. The user is guided by context-sensitive suggestions of matching words, instances, classes, and relations after each keystroke. We also provide a powerful API, which may be used for research tasks or as a back end, e.g., for a question answering system. Our web application and public API are available under \url{http://broccoli.cs.uni-freiburg.de}.
