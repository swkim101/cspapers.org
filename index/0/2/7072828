This paper considers the design of control laws for multiple mechanical systems with parameter uncertainty such that the state of each system converges to a point which moves along a desired trajectory. Adaptive cooperative control laws are proposed with the aid of the passivity property of system dynamics and the results for graph theory. As an application, the proposed results are used to solve the cooperative control problem of multiple mobile robots with parameter uncertainty such that multiple mobile robots converge to a desired pattern which moves along a desired trajectory. To show effectiveness of the proposed results, simulation results are presented.
