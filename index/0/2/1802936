We present the boomerang technique, which makes it possible to suspend and resume drag-and-drop operations. A throwing gesture while dragging an object suspends the operation, anytime and anywhere. A drag-and-drop interaction, enhanced with our technique, allows users to switch windows, invoke commands, and even drag other objects during a drag-and-drop operation without using the keyboard or menus. We explain how a throwing gesture can suspend drag-and-drop operations, and describe other features of our technique, including grouping, copying, and deleting dragged objects. We conclude by presenting prototype implementations and initial feedback on the proposed technique.
