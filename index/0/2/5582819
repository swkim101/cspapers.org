presence of a professional may cause adverse event or lead to secondary injury. In this paper, we describe our development of a Kinect-based system - KHRD using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm and fuzzy logic for ensuring home-based rehabilitation. The KHRD allows a patient perform a prescribed exercise with the presence of a professional. The exercise performed will then be recorded as a base for evaluating the patient's rehabilitation exercise at home. The outcomes of the evaluation can be used as a reference for the patient to validate his/her exercise and to prevent adverse events. A summary report of the outcomes may also be uploaded to a cloud setting for physicians to monitor the patient's progress and adjust the prescription. B. Kinect
