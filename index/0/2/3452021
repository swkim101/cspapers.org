The use of online video in learning environments is prevalent -- serving in a variety of roles, such as multimedia textbook, video lecture, or medium for documenting student coursework. For instructors who employ video as a learning material, it is becoming increasingly important to gain a deeper understanding of the fit of video content across student cohorts, as well as the impact on student engagement, learning, and success. In order to better understand instructor interests and needs in this regard, we developed a learning analytics visualization tool that links data on student viewing and video interactions with student demographics and performance measures. Instructors can use the tool to generate and compare correlated heatmap visualizations representing student engagement across segments of the video. This paper describes an initial user study conducted with instructors in an HCI course context to understand how this kind of feedback can inform their use of video in the classroom. Results show that instructors find such feedback very useful across a variety of use cases.
