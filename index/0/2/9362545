We consider several implicit fractional packing problems and obtain faster implementations of approximation schemes based on multiplicative-weight updates. This leads to new algorithms with near-linear running times for some fundamental problems in combinatorial optimization. We highlight two concrete applications. The first is to find the maximum fractional packing of spanning trees in a capacitated graph; we obtain a (1 − ϵ)-approximation in O(m/ϵ2) time, where m is the number of edges in the graph. Second, we consider the LP relaxation of the weighted unsplittable flow problem on a path and obtain a (1 − ϵ)-approximation in O(n/ϵ2) time, where n is the number of demands.
