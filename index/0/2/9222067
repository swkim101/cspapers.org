This paper presents a new analytic model for buffered Banyan networks. The new model is the most general one in the current literature, and allows the traffic pattern, the buffer size, and the switch size as input parameters among other things. The main motivation of the development of the new model was to provide an analytical tool to evaluate the performances of buffered Banyan networks under nonuniform traffic patterns, which mostly remained unknown except for some very limited cases. With the new model, we measured network performances for several important memory access patterns occurring in the parallel loop execution in multiprocessors. The performance results and the implications of the results on data storage schemes are discussed.
