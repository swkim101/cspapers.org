We present in this paper methods to improve HMM-based part-of-speech (POS) tagging of Mandarin. We model the emission probability of an unknown word using all the characters in the word, and enrich the standard left-to-right trigram estimation of word emission probabilities with a right-to-left prediction of the word by making use of the current and next tags. In addition, we utilize the RankBoost-based reranking algorithm to rerank the N-best outputs of the HMMbased tagger using various n-gram, morphological, and dependency features. Two methods are proposed to improve the generalization performance of the reranking algorithm. Our reranking model achieves an accuracy of 94.68% using n-gram and morphological features on the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.2, and is able to further improve the accuracy to 95.11% with the addition of dependency features.
