This tutorial aims at outlining fundamental methods for studying categorical sequences on the Web. Categorical sequences can refer to any kind of transitional data between a set of states, for example human navigation (transitions) between Web sites (states). Presented methods focus on sequential pattern mining, modeling and inference aiming at better understanding the production of sequences. A core model utilized in this tutorial is the Markov chain model. We hope that this tutorial raises interest and awareness of the field at hand and provides participants with basic tools for analyzing sequential user behavior on the Web.
