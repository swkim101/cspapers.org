We present a fiber reinforced soft pneumatic actuator with integrated strain and pressure sensors. We demonstrate that combining these sensors into the same actuator enables proprioception of both actuator curvature and environmental contact forces. We describe the manufacture and integration of a simple liquid metal strain sensor, a pressure sensor, and electrical circuits used for the sensors. We derive a constant curvature model for the actuator which predicts actuator curvature from the air pressure, and other constants of manufacture. The utility of the sensor integration is demonstrated by using the actuator to distinguish successful grasps amongst a set of common cylindrical objects with varying diameter. The grasp radius is estimated from the relationship between the sensor pair. Contact forces with the environment (touch) may be inferred from sensor readings which deviate from unconstrained motion.
