This paper describes recent work on finding approximate solutions to large geometric traveling salesman problems. The primary example is the analysis and improvement of the run time of an efficient implementation of the classical two-opt algorithm. The final version of the heuristic runs in time close to linear in the number of cities in the tour. Although the case study deals with computational geometry and combinatorial optimization, the experimental techniques employed apply to many other problem domains.
