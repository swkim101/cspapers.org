Visual SLAM is an area of vivid research and bears countless applications for moving robots. In particular, micro aerial vehicles benefit from visual sensors due to their low weight. Their motion is, however, often faster and more complex than that of ground-based robots which is why systems with multiple cameras are currently evaluated and deployed. This, in turn, drives the computational demand for visual SLAM algorithms.
