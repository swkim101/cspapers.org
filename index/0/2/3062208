Communication in all-optical networks requires novel routing paradigms. The high bandwidth of the optic fiber is utilized through wavelengthdivision multiplexing: a single physical optical link can carry several logical signals, provided that they are transmitted on different wavelengths. We study the problem of routing a set of requests (each of which is a pair of nodes to be connected by a path) on sparse networks using a limited number of wavelengths, ensuring that different paths using the same wavelength never use the same physical link. The constraints on the selection of paths and wavelengths depend on the type of photonic switches used in the network. We present eflicient routing techniques for the two types of photonic switches that dominate current research in all-optical networks. Our results es*IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown.
