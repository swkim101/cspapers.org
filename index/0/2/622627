This paper is in two parts. In the first part, the outline of an emotion reasoning architecture, embodied in a simulation program called the Affective Reasoner, is presented, and a rudimentary personality representation for simulated agents is introduced. In the second part, an exercise is reviewed in which the Affective Reasoner is given the task of representing agents with different personality types in such a way as to allow the user to engage in a simulated interaction with them. Representational issues pertaining to the unique appraisal and behavioral styles of the different personality types are addressed. Conclusions are drawn about the usefulness of the Affective Reasoner in such a paradigm.
