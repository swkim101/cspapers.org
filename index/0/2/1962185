In this paper, we present two packages that simulate the multilevel feedback queue scheduling algorithm for a single CPU, and five page replacement algorithms that are used in the context of memory management. The paper gives a brief description of the interactive, self-paced packages and explains how we use them in Operating System courses. We also highlight the merits of the packages and the benefits to the students derived from our Java written simulations.
