In this paper, the motion using the dynamic effect of the neck and tail of the dinosaur-like robot called TITRUS is mentioned. TITRUS is based on the concept to realize a practical mobile working platform. The features of TITRUS are 1) realizing high dynamic stability by using the neck and tail as an active dumper when the robot walks, 2) standing with the tail to compose a stable supporting triangle so that the robot can work stably and 3) enabling it to do various tasks by applying a manipulator to the neck. Finally, the experiments with numerical model and physical model TITRUS-III are reported.
