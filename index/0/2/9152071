This paper introduces the Distributed Flight Array which is being developed at ETH Zurich. This multipropeller platform consists of autonomous single-propeller modules that are able to drive, dock with their peers, and fly in a coordinated fashion. These modules are organized as distributed computational units with minimal sensory input. This is a complex system that is rich in dynamics with plenty of room to explore various distributed estimation and control strategies. Experimental demonstrations in docking, driving, and flight have proven its feasibility.
