This paper presents a method for joint stereo matching and object segmentation. In our approach a 3D scene is represented as a collection of visually distinct and spatially coherent objects. Each object is characterized by three different aspects: a color model, a 3D plane that approximates the object's disparity distribution, and a novel 3D connectivity property. Inspired by Markov Random Field models of image segmentation, we employ object-level color models as a soft constraint, which can aid depth estimation in powerful ways. In particular, our method is able to recover the depth of regions that are fully occluded in one input view, which to our knowledge is new for stereo matching. Our model is formulated as an energy function that is optimized via fusion moves. We show high-quality disparity and object segmentation results on challenging image pairs as well as standard benchmarks. We believe our work not only demonstrates a novel synergy between the areas of image segmentation and stereo matching, but may also inspire new work in the domain of automatic and interactive object-level scene manipulation.
