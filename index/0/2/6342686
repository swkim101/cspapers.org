Landmark Routing is a set of algorithms for routing in communications networks of arbitrary size. Landmark Routing is based on a new type of hierarchy, the Landmark Hierarchy. The Landmark Hierarchy exhibits path lengths and routing table sizes similar to those found in the traditional area or cluster hierarchy. The Landmark Hierarchy, however, is easier to dynamically configure using a distributed algorithm. It can therefore be used as the basis for algorithms that dynamically configure the hierarchy on the fly, thus allowing for very large, dynamic networks. This paper describes the Landmark Hierarchy, analyzes it, and compares it with the area hierarchy.
