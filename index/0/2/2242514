In this paper we augment the Max-SAT solver of (Larrosa & Heras 2005) with three new inference rules. The three of them are special cases of Max-SAT resolution with which better lower bounds and more value pruning is achieved. Our experimental results on several domains show that the resulting algorithm can be orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art Max-SAT solvers and the best Weighted CSP solver.
