We present a user requirements study for Question Answering on meeting records that assesses the difficulty of users questions in terms of what type of knowledge is required in order to provide the correct answer. We grounded our work on the empirical analysis of elicited user queries. We found that the majority of elicited queries (around 60%) pertain to argumentative processes and outcomes. Our analysis also suggests that standard keyword-based Information Retrieval can only deal successfully with less than 20% of the queries, and that it must be complemented with other types of metadata and inference.
