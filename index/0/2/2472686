A wide range of security services may be available to applications in a heterogeneous computer network environment. Resource management systems (RMSs) responsible for assigning computing and network resources to tasks need to know the resource-utilization costs associated with the various network security services. In order to understand the range of security services all RMS needs to manage, a preliminary security service taxonomy is defined. The taxonomy is used as a framework for defining the costs associated with network security services.
