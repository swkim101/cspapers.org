Head-mounted displays are rapidly becoming popular. Field-of-view is one of the key parameters of head-mounted displays, because a wider field-of-view gives higher presence and immersion in the virtual environment. However, wider field-of-view often increase device cost and weight because it needs complicated optics or expensive modules such as multi high-resolution displays or complex lenses. This paper proposes a method that expands the field-of-view by using two kinds of lenses with different levels of magnification. The principle of the proposed method is that Fresnel lenses with high magnification surround convex lenses to fill the peripheral vision with a blurred image. The proposed method doesn't need complicated optics, and is advantageous in terms of device cost and weight, because only two additional Fresnel lenses are necessary. We implement a prototype and confirm that the Fresnel lenses fill the peripheral with a blurred image, and effectively expand the field-of-view.
