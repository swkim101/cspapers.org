We show that, for any fixed Δ > 0, the combinatorial complexity of the union of <i>n</i> triangles in the plane, each of whose angles is at least Δ, is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>2<sup>α(<i>n</i>)</sup> log* <i>n</i>), with the constant of proportionality depending on Δ. This considerably improves the twenty-year-old bound <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log log <i>n</i>), due to Matoušek <i>et al</i>. [24, 25].
