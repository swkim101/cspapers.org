Wheelchair-bound persons with upper limb motion limitations can utilize a wheelchair-mounted robotic arm (WMRA) to perform activities of daily living (ADL) tasks. In this paper, an optimized control of our 9-DoF system, consisting of a 7-DoF robotic arm and a 2-DoF power wheelchair, is achieved. For effective ADL task execution, positioning the end-effector with proper wheelchair orientation was optimized as part of the control algorithm. Separate wheelchair and end-effector trajectories were simultaneously followed to execute a “Go To and Open the Door” task. The control methodology, implementation and test results in simulation are presented in this paper.
