The paper presents (i) two similarity based methods for retrieval of pictures using indices on spatial relationships; (ii) efficient algorithms for the deduction and reduction of spatial relationships, which are used for computation of similarity values; (iii) identification of a desirable property for spatial similarity functions and the construction of such a function.
