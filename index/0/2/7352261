Recently, both Miami University of Ohio and the Rochester Institute of Technology received NSF grants to develop undergraduate software engineering laboratories. While the general goals of the labs are similar, specific hardware and software selections were driven by differing curricular emphases and educational environments at the two institutions. This paper presents the distinctive characteristics of each school's program, discusses the influence of these features on the selection process, and describes our experiences to date with the resulting labs. The goal is to provide useful information guidance to others considering such facilities.
