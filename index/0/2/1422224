In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the unique thermal behavior in monolithic 3D ICs. In particular, we study the impact of the thin inter-layer dielectric (ILD) between the device tiers on vertical thermal coupling. In addition, we develop a fast and accurate compact full-chip thermal analysis model based on non-linear regression technique. Our model is extremely fast and highly accurate with an error of less than 5%. This model is incorporated into a thermal-aware 3D-floorplanner that runs without significant runtime overhead. We observe up to 22% reduction in the maximum temperature with insignificant area and performance overhead.
