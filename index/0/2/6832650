With the increasing popularity of on-line shopping, the personalization of the front-end of Web stores has become a critical issue: these systems are accessed by customers with different backgrounds, expertise and preferences; therefore, their usability can only be improved by tailoring their interfaces to the needs of each specific user. In this paper, we present the personalization features offered by SETA, a prototype toolkit for the creation of adaptive Web stores, developed at the CS Department of the University of Torino. The Web stores created using SETA suggest the items best fitting the customersâ€™ needs and adapt the layout and the description of the store catalog to their preferences and expertise.
