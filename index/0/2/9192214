Sensor nodes in wireless sensor network are powered by batteries and thus the utilization of effective energy management techniques becomes one of the most important challenges in realistic design of WSN. This paper deals with an optimal energy management scheme in Landslide detection system deployed in Kerala. Based on the meteorological, hydrological and soil parameters, sensors will be dynamically prioritized, scheduled and selects appropriate sensors for event handling. The results of this research work shows that the life time of the network has been improved due to the implementation of this adaptive energy management scheme.
