Communication is an important component in multi-robots systems; system performance may get affected when the number of robots or communication channels increases. The Dynamic Bandwidth Management Library (DBML) was designed to provide a way of maximizing bandwidth usage in multi-robots systems. The developed system prioritizes communication channels according to environment events and offers greater bandwidth for the most important channels. The library was developed in ROS (Robot Operating System) in order to separate the functionalities into independent modules to be reused and improved in future works. This paper presents the library design as a linear optimization problem and an example of the library usage in a teleoperation application. We also show the main settings and results for the system under discussion.
