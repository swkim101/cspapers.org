We develop a flexible Conditional Random Field framework for supervised preference aggregation, which combines preferences from multiple experts over items to form a distribution over rankings. The distribution is based on an energy comprised of unary and pairwise potentials allowing us to effectively capture correlations between both items and experts. We describe procedures for learning in this modelnand demonstrate that inference can be done much more efficiently thannin analogous models. Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate significant performance gains over existing rank aggregation methods.
