We present a robust approach for linking already existing lexical/semantic hierarchies. We used a constraint satisfaction algorithm (relaxation labeling) to select - among a set of candidates- the node in a target taxonomy that bests matches each node in a source taxonomy. In particular, we use it to map the nominal part of WordNet 1.5 onto WordNet 1.6, with a very high precision and a very low remaining ambiguity.
