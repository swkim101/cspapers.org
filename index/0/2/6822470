We apply reinforcement learning methods to learn domain-specific heuristics for job shop scheduling. A repair-based scheduler starts with a critical-path schedule and incrementally repairs constraint violations with the goal of finding a short conflict-free schedule. The temporal difference algorithm TD(Î») is applied to tram a neural network to learn a heuristic evaluation function over states. This evaluation function is used by a one-step lookahead search procedure to find good solutions to new scheduling problems. We evaluate this approach on synthetic problems and on problems from a NASA space shuttle pay load processing task. The evaluation function is trained on problems involving a small number of jobs and then tested on larger problems. The TD scheduler performs better than the best known existing algorithm for this task--Zwehen's iterative repair method based on simulated annealing. The results suggest that reinforcement learning can provide a new method for constructing high-performance scheduling systems.
