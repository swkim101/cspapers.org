To be able to determine the position of a static object in 3D space by means of computer vision, it has to be seen by cameras from at least two different view points. The same applies for measuring the position of a moving object based on images captured at one single time instant. However, if the cameras are not synchronized in time, or if a moving object is not visible in all images, one can not rely on using matching pictures for making accurate position estimates of dynamical objects. This paper presents a strategy to track an object with known dynamical model, using a series of images where no pair has to be captured simultaneously. It even allows tracking of a point object in 3D space using a single static camera.
