A mixed level simulator, MIXS, is a logic verification tool which has multiple simulation capabilities. Main MIXS techniques are time wheel and selective trace algorithm for functional level simulation based on 'node' model concept and the linkage function of functional models, described in different detail, with network information. The mixed level simulation for large digital systems can be achieved very efficiently by using the above techniques.
