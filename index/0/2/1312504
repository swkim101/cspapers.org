Dyadzc data refers to a domain with two finite sets of objects in which observations are made for dyads, i.e., pairs with one element from either set. This type of data arises naturally in many application ranging from computational linguistics and information retrieval to preference analysis and computer vision. In this paper, we present a systematic, domain-independent framework of learning from dyadic data by statistical mixture models. Our approach covers different models with fiat and hierarchical latent class structures. We propose an annealed version of the standard EM algorithm for model fitting which is empirically evaluated on a variety of data sets from different domains.
