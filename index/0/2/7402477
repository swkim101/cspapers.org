Details the design and construction of a full sized robotic humanoid whose body is made entirely from lightweight polyurethane plastic and whose total size and weight are that of a typical human adult. The design of this robot was conceived with research in the conventional human environment in mind, incorporating all aspects of human mobility and sensory capabilities. Plastic components for the robot are easily and quickly manufactured, and are easy and cost effective to replace if damaged or broken. The substantial saving in weight that is possible through the use of plastics significantly affects other aspects of the design including motor and cabling capacities as well as battery life.
