A soft wearable robot, which is an emerging type of wearable robot, can take advantage of tendon-driven mechanisms with a Bowden cable. These tendon-driven mechanisms benefits soft wearable robots because the actuator can be remotely placed and the transmission is very compact. However, it is difficult to compensate the friction along the Bowden cable which makes it hard to control. This study proposes the use of a position-based impedance controller, which is robust to the nonlinear dynamics of the system and provides compliant interaction between robot, human, and environment. Additionally, to eliminate disturbances from unexpected tension of the antagonistic wire arising from friction, this study proposes a new type of slack enabling tendon actuator. It can eliminate friction force along the antagonistic wire by actively pushing the wire while preventing derailment of the wire from the spool.
