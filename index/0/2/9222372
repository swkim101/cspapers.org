Average-case algorithm analysis is usually viewed as a tough subject by students in the first courses in Computer Science. Traditionally, these topics are fully developed in advanced courses with a clear mathematical orientation. The work presented here is not an alternative to this, but, it presents the analysis of algorithms (and average-case in particular) adapted to the mathematical background of students in an elementary course on Algorithms or Programming by using some specially selected examples.
