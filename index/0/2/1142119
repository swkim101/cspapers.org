This is an experimental study of algorithms for the cut tree problem. We study the Gomory-Hu and Gusfield’s algorithms as well as heuristics aimed to make the former algorithm faster. We develop an efficient implementation of the Gomory-Hu algorithm. We also develop problem families for testing cut tree algorithms. In our tests, the GomoryHu algorithm with a right combination of heuristics was significantly more robust than Gusfield’s algorithm.
