This paper describes an experiment designed to evaluate the development of a Statistical Transfer-based Brazilian Portuguese to English Machine Translation system. We compare the performance of the system with the inclusion of new syntactic written rules concerning verbal tense between the Brazilian Portuguese and English languages. Results indicate that the system performance improved compared with an initial version of the system. However significant adjustments remain to be done.
