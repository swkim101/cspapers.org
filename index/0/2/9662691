Presence of duplicate documents in the World Wide Web adversely affects crawling, indexing and relevance, which are the core building blocks of web search. In this paper, we present a set of techniques to mine rules from URLs and utilize these learnt rules for de-duplication using just URL strings without fetching the content explicitly. Our technique is composed of mining the crawl logs and utilizing clusters of similar pages to extract specific rules from URLs belonging to each cluster. Preserving each mined rules for de-duplication is not efficient due to the large number of specific rules. We present a machine learning technique to generalize the set of rules, which reduces the resource footprint to be usable at web-scale. The rule extraction techniques are robust against web-site specific URL conventions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques through experimental evaluation.
