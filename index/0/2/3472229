The workshop is intended for CS educators who would like to get an overview of some of the major techniques used in bioinformatics and a hands-on experience with some of its most popular algorithms. Attendees will be exposed to topics, examples, and problems that can be added to their repertoire of projects for CS1/CS2, data structures and algorithms, and other CS courses, including bioinformatics. No prior knowledge of biology is needed. Whether in an elective bioinformatics course, or in introductory or data structures and algorithm classes, the attendees will be able to incorporate the topics presented in the workshop. We consider interdisciplinary problems drawn from the field of biology. After formulating them as computational problems, we use traditional algorithmic techniques to solve them. The workshop may also be appropriate for high school teachers who want to use bioinformatics as a domain for their programming assignments. All material, including lecture notes, sample programs, hands-on exercises, and links to visualization packages, will be available to the attendees, before the workshop, through our university/s web page. The hands-on exercises using online publicly available tools will enhance the understanding of the common bioinformatics tasks.
