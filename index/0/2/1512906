We present a novel motion planning algorithm for pouring a liquid body from a source to a target container. Our approach uses a receding-horizon optimization strategy that considers liquid dynamics and various other constraints. To handle liquid dynamics without costly fluid simulations, we use a neural network to infer a set of key liquid-related parameters from the observation of the current liquid configuration. To train the neural network, we generate a dataset of successful pouring examples using stochastic optimization in a problem-specific search space. These parameters are then used in the objective function for trajectory optimization. Our feedback motion planner achieves real-time performance, and we observe a high success rate in our simulated 2D and 3D liquid pouring benchmarks.
