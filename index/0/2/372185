This paper presents the application of WordNet-based semantic relatedness measures to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in multi-party meetings. Different word-utterance context relatedness measures and utterance-coherence measures are defined and applied to the rescoring of N-best lists. No significant improvements in terms of Word-Error-Rate (WER) are achieved compared to a large word-based n-gram baseline model. We discuss our results and the relation to other work that achieved an improvement with such models for simpler tasks.
