This paper presents major findings Corn a large research project designed to carefully characterize what “life in LambdaMOO” (a classic social MUD) is lie for many of its members. A “convergent methodologies” approach embracing qualitative and quantitative, subjective and objective procedures was used. A rich, extensive database was produced, Corn which robust patterns could emerge, be considered in context and assessed with some confidence. Results are discussed in terms of four broad categories of interest: 1) users and use, 2) identity 3) sociality and 4) spatiality. These data should help inform the discourse on, and design of, online communities in the future.
