NeverMind is an interface and application designed to support human memory. We combine the memory palace memorization method with augmented reality technology to create a tool to help anyone memorize more effectively. Preliminary experiments show that content memorized with NeverMind remains longer in memory compared to general memorization techniques. With this project, we hope to make the memory palace method accessible to novices and demonstrate one way augmented reality can support learning.
