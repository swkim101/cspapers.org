IP address lookup is a challenging problem due to the increasing routing table size, and higher line rate. This paper investigates a new way to build an efficient IP lookup scheme using graphics processor units(GPU). Our contribution here is to design a basic architecture for high-performance IP lookup engine with GPU, and to develop efficient algorithms for routing prefix operations such as lookup, deletion, insertion, and modification. In particular, the IP lookup scheme can achieve O(1) time complexity. Our experimental results on real-world route traces show promising 6x gains in IP lookup throughput.
