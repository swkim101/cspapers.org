In this paper we present a hybrid model for real-time query processing over data stream collected by mobile air quality sensors. First, we introduce a novel indexing scheme for representing air quality and use it for generating and evaluating a static model over a yearly dataset. Then, this model is combined with a dynamic nearest-neighbor approach for real-time updates, and implemented into the Global Sensor Network (GSN) middleware, with added support for model queries.
