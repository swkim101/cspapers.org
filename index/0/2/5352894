This paper presents a goal-based analysis of human personality traits. A process model for automated understanding and interpretation of personality traits is developed. The model is based on the goal-tree and planning/counterplanning strategies developed to represent subjective beliefs In the POLITICS system. The automated analysis of personality traits plays an integral role in natural-language story-understanding processes and in computer models of human social interactions.
