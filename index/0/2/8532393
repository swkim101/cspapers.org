In this thesis a powerful new approximation technique called semi-local optimization is introduced. It provides very natural heuristics that are distinctly more effective than those based on local optimization. With an appropriate metric, semi-local optimization can still be viewed as a local optimization, but it has the advantage of making global changes to an approximate solution in polynomial time. Semi-local optimization generalizes recent heuristics of Halldorsson for the 3-Set Cover problem, the Color Saving problem, and the k-Set Cover problem. Greatly improved performance ratios of 4/3 for the 3-Set Cover problem and 6/5 for the Color Saving problem in graphs without independent sets of size 4 are obtained and shown to be the best possible with semi-local optimization. Also, based on the result for the 3-Set Cover problem and a restricted greedy phase for big sets, the performance ratio, for the k-Set Cover problem is correspondingly improved to ${\cal H}\sb{k}-1/2$. This result is also tight with the semi-local optimization technique. For larger values of k, further improvement better than ${\cal H}\sb{k}-1/2$ are also possible when the greedy selection of big sets is replaced by a local optimization selection. In the Color Saving problem, when larger independent sets exist, an improvement of the performance ratio to ${240}\over{193}$ for general graphs can be obtained.
