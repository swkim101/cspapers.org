We propose a novel method for the multi-view reconstruction problem. Surfaces which do not have direct support in the input 3D point cloud and hence need not be photo-consistent but represent real parts of the scene (e.g. low-textured walls, windows, cars) are important for achieving complete reconstructions. We augmented the existing Labatut CGF 2009 method with the ability to cope with these difficult surfaces just by changing the t-edge weights in the construction of surfaces by a minimal s-t cut. Our method uses Visual-Hull to reconstruct the difficult surfaces which are not sampled densely enough by the input 3D point cloud. We demonstrate importance of these surfaces on several real-world data sets. We compare our improvement to our implementation of the Labatut CGF 2009 method and show that our method can considerably better reconstruct difficult surfaces while preserving thin structures and details in the same quality and computational time.
