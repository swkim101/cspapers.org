Most of the traffic in today's Internet is controlled by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Hence, the performance of TCP has a significant impact on the performance of the overall Internet. TCP is a complex protocol with many user-configurable parameters and a range of different implementations. In addition, research continues to produce new developments in congestion control mechanisms and TCP options, and it is useful to trace the deployment of these new mechanisms in the Internet. As a final concern, the stability and fairness of the current Internet relies on the voluntary use of congestion control mechanisms by end hosts. Therefore it is important to test TCP implementations for conformant end-to-end congestion control. Since web traffic forms the majority of the TCP traffic, TCP implementations in today's web servers are of particular interest. We have developed a tool called TCP Behavior Inference Tool (TBIT) to characterize the TCP behavior of a remote web server. In this paper, we describe TBIT, and present results about the TCP behaviors of major web servers, obtained using this tool. We also describe the use of TBIT to detect bugs and non-compliance in TCP implementations deployed in public web servers.
