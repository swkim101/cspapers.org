Nowadays, detecting objects in 3D scenes like point clouds has become an emerging challenge with various applications. However, it retains as an open problem due to the deficiency of labeling 3D training data. To deploy an accurate detection algorithm typically resorts to investigating both RGB and depth modalities, which have distinct statistics while correlated with each other. Previous research mainly focus on detecting objects using only one modality, which ignores exploiting the cross-modality cues. In this work, we propose a cross-modality deep learning framework based on deep Boltzmann Machines for 3D Scenes object detection. In particular, we demonstrate that by learning cross-modality feature from RGBD data, it is possible to capture their joint information to reinforce detector trainings in individual modalities. In particular, we slide a 3D detection window in the 3D point cloud to match the exemplar shape, which the lack of training data in 3D domain is conquered via (1) We collect 3D CAD models and 2D positive samples from Internet. (2) adopt pretrained R-CNNs [2] to extract raw feature from both RGB and Depth domains. Experiments on RMRC dataset demonstrate that the bimodal based deep feature learning framework helps 3D scene object detection.
