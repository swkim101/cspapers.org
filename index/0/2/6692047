SUNDR is a network file system designed to store data securely on untrusted servers. SUNDR lets clients detect any attempts at unauthorized file modification by malicious server operators or users. SUNDR's protocol achieves a property called fork consistency, which guarantees that clients can detect any integrity or consistency failures as long as they see each other's file modifications. An implementation is described that performs comparably with NFS (sometimes better and sometimes worse), while offering significantly stronger security.
