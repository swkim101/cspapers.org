Aspect-oriented programming has introduced new possibilities for developing frameworks, but it also brought complexity to aspect-oriented framework reuse. Therefore, if an aspect-oriented framework does not have well documented extension points and reuse steps, it becomes very difficult for the application developer to reuse it. This work presents AFR (Aspect-oriented Framework Reuse), an approach to facilitate the aspect-oriented framework reuse. The AFR assists application developer when placing application specific needs into frameworks extension points.
