As SNS become ubiquitous, users are exploiting SNS content to enrich in-person gatherings. In this paper we present the results of a 26-weeks deployment study of an interactive display involving a lightweight Facebook client, and a movement-based social exergame, to explore how this technology impact in-person interactions with one extended family. Our results indicate that the use of the display is semi-public, and catalyzed opportunistic gatherings. We close discussing how the social implications of our results contribute to the use of public social displays, and its social implications for encouraging people to be socially engaged.
