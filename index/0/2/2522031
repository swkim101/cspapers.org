A simple but powerful modification of the standard Gaussian distribution is studied. The variables of the rectified Gaussian are constrained to be nonnegative, enabling the use of nonconvex energy functions. Two multimodal examples, the competitive and cooperative distributions, illustrate the representational power of the rectified Gaussian. Since the cooperative distribution can represent the translations of a pattern, it demonstrates the potential of the rectified Gaussian for modeling pattern manifolds.
