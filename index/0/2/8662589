One of the major problems in utilizing origami structures is ensuring variable stiffness; a deployable structure needs to become stiff or flexible according to the requirements of its use in an application. In this study, we present a self-deploying tubular origami mechanism that switches between two distinctive states: small and flexible at its normal state and rigid and stiffened at a locked state. By embedding compact torsional SMA actuators into the mechanism in a novel way through stitching, the process of deploying from the normal to the locked state proceeds in a simple and low-profile manner. With global heating, the torsional SMA wires activate a buckling effect that draws a radical change of folding line from one diagonal to another in every unit tile of the tube, creating axial stiffness. The activated structure, which weighs only 2.9 g, can endure a load of 2.7 kg or more. Additionally, since it does not require bulky actuators, this origami structure can be highly mobile and small in size. This novel origami mechanism is expected to be useful in a wide variety of applications, such as aerospace equipment, mobile architecture, and medical devices, especially those used in minimally invasive surgery (MIS).
