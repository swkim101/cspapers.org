A current joint project between three institutions in Switzerland has as its goal to create Artificial Intelligence (AI) software in teaching principles of AI at the University level. The modules of this project, the Portable AI Lab (PAIL), illustrate basic concepts of Artificial Intelligence in a uniform and self-contained manner. This paper discusses the design considerations that were adopted in order to make the presentation of this material easier for novice students.
