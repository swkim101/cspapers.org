We present a fast quantum Byzantine Agreement protocol that can reach agreement in <i>O</i>(1) expected communication rounds against a strong full information, dynamic adversary, tolerating up to the optimal <i>t</i>‹<i>n</i>3 faulty players in the synchronous setting, and up to <i>t</i>‹<i>n</i>4 faulty players for asynchronous systems. This should be contrasted with the known classical synchronous lower bound of Ω(√ <i>n</i>log <i>n</i>) [3] when <i>t</i>=(<i>n</i>).
