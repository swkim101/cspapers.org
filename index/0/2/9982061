Sentiment analysis in various languages has been a research hotspot with many applications. However, sentiment resources (e.g., labeled corpora, sentiment lexicons) of different languages are unbalanced in terms of quality and quantity, which arouses interests in cross-lingual sentiment analysis aiming at using the resources in a source language to improve sentiment analysis in a target language. Nevertheless, many existing cross-lingual related works rely on a certain machine translation system to directly adapt the labeled data from the source language to the target language, which usually suffers from inaccurate results generated by the machine translation system. On the other hand, most sentiment analysis studies focus on document-level sentiment classification that cannot solve the aspect dependency problem of sentiment words. For instance, in the reviews on a cell phone, long is positive for the lifespan of its battery, but negative for the response time of its operating system. To solve these problems, this paper develops a novel Cross-Lingual Joint Aspect/Sentiment (CLJAS) model to carry out aspect-specific sentiment analysis in a target language using the knowledge learned from a source language. Specifically, the CLJAS model jointly detects aspects and sentiments of two languages simultaneously by incorporating sentiments into a cross-lingual topic model framework. Extensive experiments on different domains and different languages demonstrate that the proposed model can significantly improve the accuracy of sentiment classification in the target language.
