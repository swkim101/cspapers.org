Homes are rich with information about people's energy consumption, medical health, and personal or family functions. In this paper, we present our experiences deploying large-scale residential sensing systems in over 20 homes. Deploying small-scale systems in homes can be deceptively easy, but in our deployments we encountered a phase transition in which deployment effort increases dramatically as residential deployments scale up in terms of 1) the number of nodes, 2) the length of time, and 3) the number of houses. In this paper, we distill our experiences down to a set of guidelines and design principles to help future deployments avoid the potential pitfalls of large-scale sensing in homes.
