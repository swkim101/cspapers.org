In this paper, we present the design, simulation and experimental validation of a control architecture for an unmanned aerial vehicle endowed with a manipulation system and interacting with a remote environment. The goal of this work is to show that the interaction control allows the manipulator to track a desired force, normal to a vertical wall, while still maintaining the possibility of moving on the wall. The control strategy has been implemented and validated in simulations and experiments on the manipulator standalone, i.e., attached to a fixed base, and on the manipulator attached to the aerial vehicle.
