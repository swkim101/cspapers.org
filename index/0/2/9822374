Identifying a speaker's role (anchor, reporter, or guest speaker) is important for finding the structural information in broadcast news speech. We present an HMM-based approach and a maximum entropy model for speaker role labeling using Mandarin broadcast news speech. The algorithms achieve classification accuracy of about 80% (compared to the baseline of around 50%) using the human transcriptions and manually labeled speaker turns. We found that the maximum entropy model performs slightly better than the HMM, and that the combination of them outperforms any model alone. The impact of the contextual role information is also examined in this study.
