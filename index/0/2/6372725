The Gomory-Hu cut tree is a compact and efficiently computed representation of selected minimum edge cuts in a weighted undirected graph G=(V,E) with n nodes. It represents (y) minimum cuts, one for each pair of nodes in G, and can be constructed with only n 1 flow computations. In this paper we generalize the types of cut trees that can be efficiently constructed. We solve the open problem, posed by T-C. Hu [HI, of constructing with n 1 flows a cut-tree for minimum node weighted cuts in an undirected graph. We then show how to build cut-trees that compactly represent the minimum edge cuts in directed graphs, partially solving the open problem of constructing cuttrees for weighted edge cuts in directed graphs. We also briefly discuss a generalization of the above cut trees to efficiently represent all minimum cuts between any pair of nodes. * Computer Science Division, University of California, Davis, CA. 95616. + Research partially supported by a grant CCR-8803704 from the National Science Foundation.
