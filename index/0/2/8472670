ABsTRAcr.. The purpose of this paper is to compare self-contained and embedded database languages. An overview is presented, summarising the differences between the two types. It is observed that the principle differences stem from the fact that many things are prespecified in the self-contained languages. It is then argued, that these prespecifications can be carried over to the embedded languages, thereby improving compactness. These embedded languages should also contain the possibility of overriding the prespecifications so that the flexibility of them is preserved. Finally, two examples of such improved embedded query languages are given and illustrated with examples.
