We present a novel implementation of compressed suffix arrays exhibiting new tradeoffs between search time and space occupancy for a given text (or sequence) of <i>n</i> symbols over an alphabet σ, where each symbol is encoded by lg|σ| bits. We show that compressed suffix arrays use just nH<inf>h</inf> + σ bits, while retaining full text indexing functionalities, such as searching any pattern sequence of length <i>m</i> in <i>O</i>(<i>m</i> lg |σ| + polylog(<i>n</i>)) time. The term H<inf>h</inf> ≤ lg |σ| denotes the hth-order empirical entropy of the text, which means that our index is nearly optimal in space apart from lower-order terms, achieving asymptotically the empirical entropy of the text (with a multiplicative constant 1). If the text is highly compressible so that H<inf>n</inf> = o(1) and the alphabet size is small, we obtain a text index with o(m) search time that requires only o(n) bits. Further results and tradeoffs are reported in the paper.
