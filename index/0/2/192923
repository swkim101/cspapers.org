Connecting words with senses, namely, sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch, to comprehend the sensorial information in language is a straightforward task for humans by using commonsense knowledge. With this in mind, a lexicon associating words with senses would be crucial for the computational tasks aiming at interpretation of language. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic attempt in the literature to build such a resource. In this paper, we present a sensorial lexicon that associates English words with senses. To obtain this resource, we apply a computational method based on bootstrapping and corpus statistics. The quality of the resulting lexicon is evaluated with a gold standard created via crowdsourcing. The results show that a simple classifier relying on the lexicon outperforms two baselines on a sensory classification task, both at word and sentence level, and confirm the soundness of the proposed approach for the construction of the lexicon and the usefulness of the resource for computational applications.
