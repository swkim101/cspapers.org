A framework for specification-based testing is demonstrated on a symbol table case study, specified using the Z notation. Test derivation and structuring is discussed, as well as applications of the framework in deriving test oracles and aiding regressing testing during maintenance. Areas for further research and discussion are comparison of heuristics with regard to generated test suites and usability, formalising testing heuristics, and the discrepancy between functional testing and robustness testing.
