The noisy channel model has been applied to a wide range of problems, including spelling correction. These models consist of two components: a source model and a channel model. Very little research has gone into improving the channel model for spelling correction. This paper describes a new channel model for spelling correction, based on generic string to string edits. Using this model gives significant performance improvements compared to previously proposed models.
