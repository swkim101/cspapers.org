As computers begin to move away from screen-based interfaces and become cheaper and more pervasive, their systems will inevitably become more intricate and difficult to understand. Our current modes of communication may become insufficient. Human beings utilize emotions to transform intelligence into appropriate action, to consider circumstances and relationships with others. If our computers can develop stronger emotional connections to their users, our interactions with them will become more meaningful and will develop along with the progress of technology.
 Emoti-bots are a line of prototypical products for future homes that simulate and stimulate emotion. They are experiments developed in an effort to transform common everyday objects into potential interfaces for computing. They look to the affordances and current uses of those objects to develop more natural, instinctive and emotional methods of human-computer interaction.
