The authors have been developing anthropomorphic head robots in order to develop a new head mechanisms and functions for a humanoid robot having the ability to communicate naturally with a human by expressing human like emotion. We developed the anthropomorphic head-eye robot "WE-3RIV" (Waseda Eye No.3 Refined IV) which has four sensations and facially expresses emotions in 2000. We have recently added the olfactory sensation and the facial color expression function to its previous model, WE-3RIII, and we improved and rebuilt its artificial psychological model that consists of a 3D mental space having pleasantness, activation and certainty axes. When the robot senses the stimulus, a mental vector moves in the mental space based upon a set of differential equations in the mathematical formulation. We named it "equations of emotion. " We also introduced the robot personality, which consists of the sensing personality and the expression personality. WE-3RIV was realized to express the mental state affected by various stimuli based on the equations of emotion and the robot personality.
