Ruby - an Object-Oriented scripting language - is used world-wide because of its ease of use. However, the current interpreter is slow. To solve this problem, some virtual machines were developed, but none with adequate performance or functionality. To fill this gap, I have developed a Ruby interpreter called YARV (Yet Another Ruby VM). YARV is based on a stack machine architecture and features optimizations for high speed execution of Ruby programs. In this poster, I introduce the Ruby programming language, discuss certain characteristics of Ruby from the aspect of a Ruby interpreter implementer, and explain methods of implementation and optimization. Benchmark results are given at the end.
