Overlay networks as the communication medium in parallel and distributed applications have gained prominence, especially in Grid environments. However, providing both throughput performance and reliable communication on overlays have been given little attention. The core of this problem is that intermediate nodes have limited buffer memory, while the forwarding throughput must yield Gbps. Yet, implementing a naive flow control can deadlock the overlay. Thus, high performance flow control on overlays is a critical concern in heterogeneous wide-area networks, where input/output link throughput can vary significantly. We propose an overlay scheme that couples TCP connections and fixed intermediate buffer memory while adapting deadlock-free routing for our overlay routing in heterogeneous wide-area networks. Our scheme eliminates memory overflows at forwarding nodes by fixed buffer memory and deadlocks via a deadlock-free routing algorithm that resolves adaptation challenges for heterogeneous wide-area networks. Our overlay construction and routing optimizations account for underlying network latency and bandwidth information. Simulation on 13 clusters (515 nodes) and evaluation on 7 clusters (170 nodes) show that our deadlock-free routing poses negligible overhead in comparison to deadlock-unaware routing, and comparably with direct communication. We further demonstrate that for certain collective communications, our overlay even out-performs direct communication by mitigating or completely avoiding network contention. We show this on systems ranging from a single-switch cluster with 36 nodes to a Grid environment with 4 clusters and 291 nodes.
