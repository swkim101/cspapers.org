A common representation used in text categorization is the bag of words model (aka. unigram model). Learning with this particular representation involves typically some preprocessing, e.g. stopwords-removal, stemming. This results in one explicit tokenization of the corpus. In this work, we introduce a logistic regression approach where learning involves automatic tokenization. This allows us to weaken the a-priori required knowledge about the corpus and results in a tokenization with variable-length (word or character) n-grams as basic tokens. We accomplish this by solving logistic regression using gradient ascent in the space of all ngrams. We show that this can be done very efficiently using a branch and bound approach which chooses the maximum gradient ascent direction projected onto a single dimension (i.e., candidate feature). Although the space is very large, our method allows us to investigate variable-length n-gram learning. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach compared to state-of-the-art classifiers used for text categorization such as cyclic coordinate descent logistic regression and support vector machines.
