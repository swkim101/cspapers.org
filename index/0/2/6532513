For over 40 years, the ACM and IEEE-Computer Society have sponsored the creation of international curricular guidelines for undergraduate programs in computing. These Computing Curricula volumes are updated approximately every 10-year cycle, with the aim of keeping curricula modern and relevant. The next volume in the series, Computer Science 2013 (CS2013), is currently in progress. This panel seeks to update and engage the SIGCSE community in providing feedback on a complete draft of the CS2013 report (called the Ironman report), which will be released shortly before SIGCSE. Since the Ironman report is the penultimate draft of the CS2013 report, this panel is an especially important venue for starting the last round of feedback that will impact the final CS2013 curricular guidelines.
