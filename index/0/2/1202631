In this paper, we show how existing notions of temporal data have to be modified because of the transition from the relational to the object model. In particular, we focus on the semantics of time in the context of object databases, and on the identification and definition of a set of generic temporal modeling concepts to capture aspects of temporal object database design, that are not amenable to description by current object database models. These notions provide a richer and more flexible framework for defining temporal objects with roles and for developing temporal object models. As such, they may be regarded as a set of proposed temporal requirements for a temporal object model.
