In this paper we introduce a method for semiautomatic registration of 3D deformable models using 2D shape outlines (silhouettes) extracted from a monocular camera view. Our framework is based on the combination of a biomechanical model of the organ with a set of projective constraints influencing the deformation of the model. To enforce convergence towards a global minimum for this ill-posed problem we interactively provide a rough (rigid) estimation of the pose. We show that our approach allows for the estimation of the non-rigid 3D pose while relying only on 2D information. The method is evaluated experimentally on a soft silicone gel model of a liver, as well as on real surgical data, providing augmented reality of the liver and the kidney using a monocular laparoscopic camera. Results show that the final elastic registration can be obtained in just a few seconds, thus remaining compatible with clinical constraints. We also evaluate the sensitivity of our approach according to both the initial alignment of the model and the silhouette length and shape.
