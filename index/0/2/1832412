This paper describes a new approach to predicting the aspectual class of verbs in context, i.e., whether a verb is used in a stative or dynamic sense. We identify two challenging cases of this problem: when the verb is unseen in training data, and when the verb is ambiguous for aspectual class. A semi-supervised approach using linguistically-motivated features and a novel set of distributional features based on representative verb types allows us to predict classes accurately, even for unseen verbs. Many frequent verbs can be either stative or dynamic in different contexts, which has not been modeled by previous work; we use contextual features to resolve this ambiguity. In addition, we introduce two new datasets of clauses marked for aspectual class.
