This paper discusses recognizing and producing contradictions. After illustrating the phenomena of contradiction, the paper presents conceptual classes of contradiction and gives an overview of the how they can be recognized. The next part discusses the construction of contradictions, in particular with respect to contradicting historic events. The object of this paper is to examine the computational logic of contradictions, using contradictions as an example of how reasoning processes can and must exploit semantic knowledge and episodic memory, and to illustrate the kind of metaknowledge needed to use certain reasoning devices correctly and effectively.
