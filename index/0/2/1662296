We propose SecNav, a new protocol for securing wireless navigation systems. This protocol secures localization and time synchronization in wireless networks by relying on devices' awareness of presence in the power-range (coverage area) of navigation stations. We perform a detailed security analysis of SecNav and show that, compared to existing secure navigation approaches, it prevents the widest range of attacks on navigation. Our implementation of SecNav, using 802.11b devices, shows that this scheme can be efficiently implemented with existing technologies.
