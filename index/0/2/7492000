Mock trials are an effective and fun way of eliciting thoughtful dialogue from students, and encouraging them to produce incisive analyses of current ethical dilemmas related to computers and society. This paper describes our experience using mock trials in two computer ethics courses. Each trial was centered on a specific
 controversial and ethically or legally ambiguous topic related to current computer usage in society. Students participated in a series of mock trials during the term, alternating their role in each trial between jury, proponent, and opponent. Class participation was nearly 100% for every trial, with many students electing to
 define their own sub-role within their assigned major role. The logistics of the trials were initially difficult to administer and monitor; however, they quickly became manageable as we gained more experience with the opportunities and pitfalls associated with the mock-trial system, and as students volunteered suggestions for improvements.
