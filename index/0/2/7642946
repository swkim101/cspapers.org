The conventional boolean retrieval system does not provide ranked retrieval output because it cannot compute similarity coefficients between queries and documents. Extended boolean models such as fuzzy set, Waller-Kraft, Paice, P-Norm and Infinite-One have been proposed in the past to support ranking facility for the boolean retrieval system. In this paper, we analyze the behavioural aspects of the previous extended boolean models and address important mathematical properties to affect retrieval effectiveness. We concentrate our description on evaluation formulas for AND and OR operations and query weights. Our analyses show that P-Norm is the most suitable for achieving high retrieval effectiveness.
