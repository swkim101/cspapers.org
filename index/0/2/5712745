We address a question that has been somewhat overlooked throughout the transition from classical ad hoc retrieval to Web search: how is the performance of classical retrieval approaches affected by the presence of content manipulation? Our initial experiments have shown that the relative performance patterns of some classical retrieval strategies might change in the transition from non-manipulated to manipulated corpora. A natural future venue to explore is how to mix these strategies and make (some of) them more robust under presumed content manipulation conditions.
