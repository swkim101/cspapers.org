In this paper we present a modular and distributed control architecture in order to achieve natural interaction and mobile manipulation task goals for a humanoid robot. We propose a hierarchically organized architecture with three levels and introduce the mapping of the functional features in this architecture into hardware and software modules. We also describe different functional features which have been realized and integrated into the whole control architecture.
