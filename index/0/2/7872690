The idea of a virtual university, making use of the world-wide-web as an instructional medium, has taken hold as the "wave of the future" in higher education. We have in mind a model that taps one of the most under-utilized yet most skilled of the U.S. intellectual resources, its retired professors. It is anticipated that a sizeable fraction of these individuals would welcome the opportunity to participate part-time in a challenging and most ambitious venture -- a Retired Professors University (RPU), based in the world-wide-web of cyberspace. In its functionality, RPU would replicate the traditional university in all important aspects, a full range of academic departments, Deans, baccalaureate programs, registrar, bookstore, etc., all accessible from the student's internet browser. The structure of such a university is described as a three-tiered (student-faculty-administration) distributed computing network in a client/server architecture. Critical issues relating to security and privacy are addressed.
