A generalization of a known class of parallel sorting algorithms is presented, together with a new interconnection to execute them. A VLSI implementation is also proposed, and its area-time performance is discussed. It is shown that an algorithm in the class is executable in O(logn) time by a chip occupying O(n<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>) area. The design is a typical instance of a “hybrid architecture”, resulting from the combination of well-known VLSI networks as the orthogonal trees and the cube-connected-cycles; it also provably meets the AT<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>&equil;omegan<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>log<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>n) lower bound for sorters of n words of length (1+\epsilon)logn(\epsilon > O).
