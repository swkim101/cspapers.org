Intelligent transportation systems and the advent of smart cities have created a renewed research interest in vehicular networks (VANET). These ad-hoc networks are the key technology for new collaborative approaches to increase the efficiency and safety of our roads. In effect, city-scale field trials are being conducted by major high-tech companies to explore the capabilities and limitations of vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Initial advances have led to safety enhancing applications like the electronic emergency brake light, cooperative collision avoidance and cooperative adaptive cruise control. In IEEE standard 1609.2, security measures to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of VANET messages are specified. However, physical properties like spatial proximity and driving direction are not considered. These become notably important when vehicles make decisions that concern the safety of users for example to avoid a collision. We propose a novel approach to verify the ongoing copresence of two vehicles. Our method is based on the observation that the trajectory through a road network can be used to uniquely define a vehicle's location as well as its driving direction. Our system provides a protocol to authenticate VANET messages for a group of vehicles driving in succession and to de-authenticate vehicles that have left the formation. To demonstrate the feasibility of trajectories as proof for co-presence, we implemented a smartphone application and conducted driving experiments under real-world conditions. We analyze the road network of several major cities from different continents to show the generalizability of our approach. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the security properties of our system by performing city-scale simulations under realistic conditions.
