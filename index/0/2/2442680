Security evaluation according to ISO 15408 (Common Criteria) is a resource and time demanding activity, as well as being costly. For this reason, only few companies take their products through a Common Criteria evaluation. To support security evaluation, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has developed a threat, vulnerability, risk analysis (eTVRA) method for the Telecommunication (Telco) domain. eTVRA builds on the security risk management methodology CORAS and is structured in such a way that it provides output that can be directly fed into a Common Criteria security evaluation. In this paper, we evaluate the time and resource efficiency of parts of eTVRA and the quality of the result produced by following eTVRA compared to a more pragmatic approach (Protection Profile-based checklists). We use both approaches to identify and analyze risks of a new SIM card currently under joint development by a small hardware company and a large Telco provider.
