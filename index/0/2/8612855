Let ℬ be a set ofn arbitrary (possibly intersecting) convex obstacles in ℝd. It is shown that any two points which can be connected by a path avoiding the obstacles can also be connected by a path consisting ofO(n(d−1)[d/2+1]) segments. The bound cannot be improved below Ω(nd); thus, in ℝ3, the answer is betweenn3 andn4. For open disjoint convex obstacles, a Θ(n) bound is proved. By a well-known reduction, the general case result also upper bounds the complexity for a translational motion of an arbitrary convex robot among convex obstacles. Asymptotically tight bounds and efficient algorithms are given in the planar case.
