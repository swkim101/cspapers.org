Using extensions of linear algebra concepts to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), we define a unifying framework for random walk kernels on graphs. Reduction to a Sylvester equation allows us to compute many of these kernels in O(n3) worst-case time. This includes kernels whose previous worst-case time complexity was O(n6), such as the geometric kernels of Gartner et al. [1] and the marginal graph kernels of Kashima et al. [2]. Our algebra in RKHS allow us to exploit sparsity in directed and undirected graphs more effectively than previous methods, yielding sub-cubic computational complexity when combined with conjugate gradient solvers or fixed-point iterations. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that our algorithms are often more than 1000 times faster than existing approaches.
