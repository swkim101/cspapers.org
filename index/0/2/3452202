One method of increasing accessibility to computer science education is through massive open online courses (MOOCs). The Beauty and Joy of Computing MOOC (BJCx) on edX is an introductory computer science course aimed to reach a broad audience of learners and designed to fulfill the AP CS Principles curriculum. However, like most MOOCs, BJCx faces high rates of student attrition. Some of this can be attributed to variance in student intentions; there are students who enroll only to browse the material with no plan of completing the course. On the other hand, the attrition of those students who intend to finish but drop out along the way is a point of concern. It could be reduced if course staff could predict it using the students' behavior and intervene. In this project, I explore how patterns of student engagement with course material can predict attrition. Using a recurrent neural network, I model student behavior over time. I am then able to analyze the behavioral patterns which are likely to precede dropping out. Furthermore, I explore which topics in the course curriculum most often immediately precede students dropping out. I visualize the time-series trends overlaid with the curriculum in order to gain insights into correlations between introductory computer science topics and student attrition. This information, along with the predictive student engagement model, can potentially allow teachers to design interventions at MOOC scale, something that is otherwise lacking in comparison to traditional classroom settings where the teacher can directly gauge student behavior.
