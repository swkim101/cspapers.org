Reachability querying is a basic graph operation with numerous important applications in databases, network analysis, computational biology, software engineering, etc. Although many indexes have been proposed to answer reachability queries, most of them are only efficient for handling relatively small graphs. We propose TF-label, an efficient and scalable labeling scheme for processing reachability queries. TF-label is constructed based on a novel topological folding (TF) that recursively folds an input graph into half so as to reduce the label size, thus improving query efficiency. We show that TF-label is efficient to construct and propose efficient algorithms and optimization schemes. Our experiments verify that TF-label is significantly more scalable and efficient than the state-of-the-art methods in both index construction and query processing.
