We solve an open problem posed by Eppstein in 1995 [14, 15] and re-enforced by Grohe [16, 17] concerning locally bounded treewidth in minor-closed families of graphs. A graph has <i>bounded local treewidth</i> if the subgraph induced by vertices within distance <i>r</i> of any vertex has treewidth bounded by a function of <i>r</i> (not <i>n</i>). Eppstein characterized minor-closed families of graphs with bounded local treewidth as precisely minor-closed families that minor-exclude an apex graph, where an <i>apex graph</i> has one vertex whose removal leaves a planar graph. In particular, Eppstein showed that all apex-minor-free graphs have bounded local treewidth, but his bound is doubly exponential in <i>r</i>, leaving open whether a tighter bound could be obtained. We improve this doubly exponential bound to a linear bound, which is optimal. In particular, any minor-closed graph family with bounded local treewidth has linear local treewidth. Our bound generalizes previously known linear bounds for special classes of graphs proved by several authors. As a consequence of our result, we obtain substantially faster polynomial-time approximation schemes for a broad class of problems in apex-minor-free graphs, improving the running time from 2<sup>2</sup><sup>2<sup><i>O</i>(1/ε)</sup></sup> <i>n</i><sup><i>O</i>(1)</sup> to 2<sup><i>O</i>(1/ε)</sup><i>n</i><sup><i>O</i>(1)</sup>.
