This paper deals with the problem of describing the behaviour of LSI components for a three-valued functional simulation. The proposed functional description uses a set of predefined functional modules, named primitives, for handling data signals, and test blocks for handling control signals. Some primitives with relative algorithms are described and a procedure for test blocks management with three-valued control signals is proposed.
