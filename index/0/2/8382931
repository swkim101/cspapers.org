This paper introduces a new robotic gripper for flat surfaces based on a novel electrostatic/gecko-like adhesive. This unique gripping solution overcomes the shortcomings of vacuum grippers for part-handling by eliminating the need for a compressed air system and offering more rapid actuation, thus achieving significant potential cost savings and throughput improvements in manufacturing processes. Results demonstrate the gripper's performance on a variety of both smooth and rough surfaces, including fabrics, as well as show that the gripper is able to successfully pick up and release glass and carbon fiber sheets for over 100 cycles.
