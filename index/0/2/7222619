The idea of only-knowing a collection of sentences has been previously shown to have a close connection with autoepistemic logic. Here we propose a more general account of only-knowing that captures not only autoepistemic logic but default logic as well. This allows us not only to study the properties of default logic in terms of an underlying model of belief, but also the relationship among different forms of nonmonotonic reasoning, all within a classical monotonic logic characterized semantically in terms of possible worlds.
