A language <i>L</i> has a property tester if there exists a probabilistic algorithm that given an input <i>x</i> only asks a small number of bits of <i>x</i> and distinguishes the cases as to whether <i>x</i> is in <i>L</i> and <i>x</i> has large Hamming distance from all <i>y</i> in <i>L</i>. We define a similar notion of quantum property testing and show that there exist languages with quantum property testers but no good classical testers. We also show there exist languages which require a large number of queries even for quantumly testing.
