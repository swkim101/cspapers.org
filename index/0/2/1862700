An Adaptive Object-Model is a system that represents classes, attributes, relationships, and behavior as metadata. Consequently, the object model is adaptable; when the descriptive information is modified, the system immediately reflects those changes. This architectural style makes a heavy use of patterns and all the attempts to document it have been done using patterns. Nevertheless, the patterns used to document AOMs are written using different templates and styles. Also many of the patterns have not been written yet or are incomplete. This poster session will present a more comprehensive and homogeneous pattern language for describing this kind of architectural style with the ultimate goal being to facilitate the creation of these types of systems.
