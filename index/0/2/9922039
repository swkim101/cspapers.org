In early 2011, the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE/CS) created the CE2004 Review Task Force (RTF) and charged it with the task of reviewing and determining the extent to which the document "Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Engineering," produced 2004 December 12 and known as CE2004 [1] required revisions. The RTF submitted a report to both societies in July of 2011. The report summarized a survey of academic and industry constituents conducted by the RTF. It recommended keeping the structure and the vast majority of the content of the original CE2004 document. However, it also recommended that contemporary topics should be strengthened or added while de-emphasizing other topics that appeared to be waning from the curricular mainstream of computer engineering. Additionally, the RTF recommended that the two societies form a joint special-purpose committee to update and edit the earlier document and to seek input and review from the computer engineering industrial and academic communities through presentations and workshops co-located at major conferences. The presenters of this special session were members of the 2011 RTF and two presenters were members of the original curricular task force from 2004. The presentation will provide insights in the RTF findings and thoughts on how a future computer engineering report might evolve.
