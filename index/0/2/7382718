This paper describes a mobile Web application that allows browsing conference publications, their authors, authors' organizations, and even authors' other publications or publications related to the same keywords. It queries a main SPARQL endpoint that serves the conference metadata set, as well as other endpoints to enrich and explore data. It provides extra functions, such as flashing a publication QR code from the Web browser, accessing external resources about the publications, and it can be linked to external Web services. This application exploits the Linked Data paradigm and performs client-side reasoning. It follows recent W3C technical advances and as a mashup, requires few server resources. It can easily be deployed for any conference with available metadata on the Web.
