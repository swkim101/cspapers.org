In 2001, the ACM and the IEEE-CS published Computing Curricula 2001 which contains curriculum recommendations for undergraduate programs in computer science. That report also called for additional discipline-specific volumes for each of computer engineering, information systems, and software engineering. In addition, it called for an Overview Volume to provide a synthesis of the various volumes. The Computing Curricula 2004 Task Force has undertaken a two-pronged strategy to fulfill the latter charge. The purpose of this session is to present an overview of the Task Force's work and to generate feedback from the SIGCSE membership to the Task Force about the direction and plans we have undertaken.
