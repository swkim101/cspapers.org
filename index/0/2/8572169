The Seldon model combines concepts from agent-based modeling and social network analysis to create a computation model of social dynamics for terrorist recruitment. The underlying recruitment model is based on a unique hybrid agent-based architecture that contains simple agents (individuals such as expatriates) and abstract agents (conceptual entities such as society and mosques). Interactions between agents are determined by multiple social networks which form and dissipate according to the actions of the individual. We have implemented a Java-based toolkit to evaluate the dynamics of social behavior and the specific dynamics associated with terrorist recruitment described by expert social scientists, creating an architecture for simple adaptation to other group phenomenon.
