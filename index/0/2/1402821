The paper presents a novel approach based on Bogor for the accurate verification of applications based on Publish- Subscribe infrastructures. Previous efforts adopted standard model checking techniques to verify the application behavior, but they introduce strong simplifications on the underlying infrastructure to cope with the state space explosion problem and make automatic verification feasible. Instead of building on top of existing model checkers, our proposal embeds the asynchronous communication mechanisms of Publish-Subscribe infrastructures within Bogor. This way, Publish-Subscribe primitives become part of the specification language as additional, domain-specific, constructs. Accurate models become feasible without incurring in state space explosion problems, thus enabling the automated verification of applications on top of realistic communication infrastructures.
