Thii paper describes the design and performance of a hybrid ARQ scheme with the concatenated FEC for wireless ATM networks. The wireless channel is characterized by burstier error patterns, and a higher and time-varying error rate when compared with the fiber-based network for which ATM was designed. The purpose of the hybrid ARQ scheme with the concatenated FEC is to provide a capability to dynamically support survivable ATM-based communications on a wireless channel by using a combination of ARQ and FEC schemes. The key ideas of the proposed hybrid scheme are the adaptation of the code rate to the channel conditions using incremental redundancy and the increase of the starting code rate as high as possible with the concatenated FEC to maximize the throughput efficiency. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms other hybrid ARQ schemes for all SNR values.
