We present a novel surface model and reconstruction method for man-made environments that take prior knowledge about topology and geometry into account. The model favors but is not limited to horizontal and vertical planes that are pairwise orthogonal. The reconstruction method does not require one particular class of sensors, as long as a triangulated point cloud is available. It delivers a complete 3D segmentation, parametrization and classification for both surface regions and inter-plane relations. By working on a pre-segmentation we reduce the computational cost and increase robustness to noise and outliers. All reasoning is statistically motivated, based on a few decision variables with meaningful interpretation in measurement space. We demonstrate our reconstruction method for visual reconstructions and laser range data.
