The objective is to relate the effectiveness of retrieval, the fuzzy set concept and the processing of Boolean query. The use of a probabilistic retrieval scheme is motivated. It is found that there is a correspondence between probabilistic retrieval schmes and fuzzy sets. A fuzzy set corresponding to a potentially optimal probabilistic retrieval scheme is obtained. Then the retrieval scheme for the fuzzy set is constructed.
