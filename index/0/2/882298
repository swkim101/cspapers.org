It is widely agreed that recursive types are inherent in the static typing of the essential mechanisms of object-oriented programming: encapsulation, message passing, subtyping, and inheritance. We demonstrate here that modeling object encapsulation in terms of existential types yields a substantially more straightforward explanation of these features in a simpler calculus without recursive types.
