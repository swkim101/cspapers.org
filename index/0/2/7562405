The service concept has acquired an increasing level of recognition by protocol designers. Being an architectural concept, the service concept influences the methodology applied to service and protocol definition. Since the protocol is seen as the logical implementation of the service, one can ask the question whether it is possible to formally derive the specification of a protocol providing a given service. This paper addresses this question and presents an algorithm for deriving a protocol specification from a given service specification. It is assumed that services are described by expressions including operators for sequence, parallelism and alternatives and primitive service interactions. The expression defining the service is the basis for the protocol derivation process. The presented algorithm fully automates the derivation process. Future work focuses on the inclusion of parameters and the optimization of traffic between protocol entities.
