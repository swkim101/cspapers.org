We provide a generalization of discriminative lexicalized shift reduce parsing techniques for phrase structure grammar to a wide range of morphologically rich languages. The model is efficient and outperforms recent strong baselines on almost all languages considered. It takes advantage of a dependency based modelling of morphology and a shallow modelling of constituency boundaries.
