Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) promote energy-efficiency as the main design criterion. This introduces rather conflicting requirements for the hardware adaptation layer. Maximizing the efficiency requires that the presentation must closely mimic the underlying hardware model. On the other hand, increasing the level of abstraction simplifies the development, but at the cost of lowered efficiency because it obstructs the link between the application and the hardware. As new microcontrollers and radios are introduced for use in WSNs, applications must be able to effectively use new low power features and peripherals. The MSP430 family of microcontrollers by Texas Instruments is specifically designed for ultra-low-power applications. It incorporates a 16-Bit RISC CPU, peripherals and a clock system. The MSP430F149 is one of the most popular members of the family. As shown in Fig. 1, it has 60 KB Flash, 2 KB of RAM and a flexible clock system sourced by an internal digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) and/or two external oscillators. It also contains a 12-Bit A/D Converter, two independent timers and two USARTs.
