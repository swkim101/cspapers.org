We study the problem of determining the geographic location of an Internet host knowing only its IP address. We have developed three distinct techniques, GeoTrack, GeoPing, and GeoCluster, to address this problem. These techniques exploit information derived from the DNS, network delay measurements, and inter-domain routing. We have evaluated our techniques using extensive and varied datasets.
