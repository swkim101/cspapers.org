Smart Cities have emerged as a global concept that argues for the effective exploitation of digital technologies to drive sustainable innovation and well-being for citizens. Despite the large investments being placed on Smart City infrastructure, however, there is still very scarce attention on the new learning approaches that will be needed for cultivating Digital Smart Citizenship competences, namely the competences which will be needed by the citizens and workforce of such cities for exploiting the digital technologies in creative and innovative ways for driving financial and societal sustainability. In this context, this paper introduces cyberphysical learning as an overarching model of cultivating Digital Smart Citizenship competences by exploiting the potential of Internet of Things technologies and social media, in order to create authentic blended and augmented learning experiences.
