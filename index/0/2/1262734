WordNet is a rich source of world knowledge from which formal axioms can be derived. In this paper we present a method for transforming the WordNet glosses into logic forms and further into axioms. The transformation of WordNet glosses into logic forms is useful for theorem proving and other applications. The paper demonstrates the utility of the WordNet axioms in a question answering system to rank and extract answers.
