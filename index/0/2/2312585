Searching for people by exploration of social networks structure is an interesting problem which has recently gathered a lot of attention. Expert recommendation is an important but also extensively researched problem. In contrast, the generalized problem of team recommendation has not been studied a lot. The purpose of this demo is to show a multidisciplinary team search and recommendation prototype. While the current demo uses specific (NTU academic) data-set, the framework is generic, and can be extended for other domains subject to availability of suitable information.
