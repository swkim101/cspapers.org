Open Platform for Robotic Services (OPRoS) is an open source robot software platform funded by the Korean government. Its research results are released on its homepage. OPRoS supplies several IDEs working with its framework for easy and fast development. The Component Editor, Component Composer, and Simulator are core development tools for ubiquitous robot. Robot-in-the-loop-Simulation (RILS) is an additional simulation based development tool. This paper explains these core tools used with a reference robot.
