Markov Random Field is now ubiquitous in many formulations of various vision problems. Recently, optimization of higher-order potentials became practical using higher-order graph cuts: the combination of i) the fusion move algorithm, ii) the reduction of higher-order binary energy minimization to first-order, and iii) the QPBO algorithm. In the fusion move, it is crucial for the success and efficiency of the optimization to provide proposals that fits the energies being optimized. For higher-order energies, it is even more so because they have richer class of null potentials. In this paper, we focus on the efficiency of the higher-order graph cuts and present a simple technique for generating proposal labelings that makes the algorithm much more efficient, which we empirically show using examples in stereo and image denoising.
