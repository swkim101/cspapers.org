In outsourced spatial databases, the location-based service (LBS) provides query services to the clients on behalf of the data owner. However, if the LBS is not trustworthy, it may return incorrect or incomplete query results. Thus, authentication is needed to verify the soundness and completeness of query results. In this paper, we study the authentication problem for location-based skyline queries, which have recently been receiving increasing attention in LBS applications. We propose two authentication methods: one based on the traditional MR-tree index and the other based on a newly developed MR-Sky-tree. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods in terms of the authentication cost.
