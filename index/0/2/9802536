Previous anti-spamming algorithms based on link structure suffer from either the weakness of the page value metric or the vagueness of the seed selection. In this paper, we propose two page value metrics, AVRank and HVRank. These two "values" of all the web pages can be well assessed by using the bidirectional links' information. Moreover, with the help of bidirectional links, it becomes easier to enlarge the propagation coverage of seed sets. We further discuss the effectiveness of the combination of these two metrics, such as the quadratic mean of them. Our experimental results show that with such two metrics, our method can filter out spam sites and identify reputable ones more effectively than previous algorithms such as TrustRank.
