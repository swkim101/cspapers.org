This paper describes the radix-64 folded-Clos network of the Cray BlackWidow scalable vector multiprocessor. We describe the BlackWidow network which scales to 32Kprocessors with a worst-case diameter of seven hops, and the underlying high-radix router micro architecture and its implementation. By using a high-radix router with many narrow channels we are able to take advantage of the higher pin density and faster signaling rates available in modern ASIC technology. The BlackWidow router is an 800 MHz ASIC with 64 18.75Gb/s bidirectional ports for an aggregate off-chip bandwidth of 2.4Tb/s. Each port consists of three 6.25Gb/s differential signals in each direction. The router supports deterministic and adaptive packet routing with separate buffering for request and reply virtual channels. The router is organized hierarchically (Kim et al., 2005) as an 8times8 array of tiles which simplifies arbitration by avoiding long wires in the arbiters. Each tile of the array contains a router port, its associated buffering, and an 8times8 router subswitch. The router ASIC is implemented in a 90nm CMOS standard cell ASIC technology and went from concept to tapeout in 17 months
