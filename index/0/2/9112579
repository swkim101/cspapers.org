Location-based services have experienced substantial growth in the last decade. However, despite extensive research efforts, sub-meter location accuracy with low-cost infrastructure continues to be elusive. In this paper, we propose IDyLL -- an indoor localization system using inertial measurement units (IMU) and photodiode sensors on smartphones. Using a novel illumination peak detection algorithm, IDyLL augments IMU-based pedestrian dead reckoning with location fixes. We devise a robust particle filter framework to mitigate identity ambiguity due to the lack of communication capability of conventional luminaries and sensing errors. Experimental study using data collected from smartphones shows that IDyLL is able to achieve high localization accuracy at low costs. Mean location errors of 0.38 m, 0.42 m, and 0.74 m are reported from multiple walks in three buildings with different luminary arrangements, respectively.
