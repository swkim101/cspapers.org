Recently proposed high-radix interconnection networks [10] require global adaptive routing to achieve optimum performance. Existing direct adaptive routing methods are slow to sense congestion remote from the source router and hence misroute many packets before such congestion is detected. This paper introduces indirect global adaptive routing (IAR) in which the adaptive routing decision uses information that is not directly available at the source router. We describe four IAR routing methods: credit round trip (CRT) [10], progressive adaptive routing (PAR), piggyback routing (PB), and reservation routing (RES). We evaluate each of these methods on the dragonfly topology under both steady-state and transient loads. Our results show that PB, PAR, and CRT all achieve good performance. PB provides the best absolute performance, with 2-7% lower latency on steady-state uniform random traffic at 70% load, while PAR provides the fastest response on transient loads. We also evaluate the implementation costs of the indirect adaptive routing methods and show that PB has the lowest implementation cost requiring <1% increase in the total storage of a typical high-radix router.
