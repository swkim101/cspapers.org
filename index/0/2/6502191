As interest grows in the use of linguistically annotated corpora in research and teaching of foreign languages and literature, treebanks of various historical texts have been developed. We introduce the first large-scale dependency treebank for Classical Chinese literature. Derived from the Stanford dependency types, it consists of over 32K characters drawn from a collection of poems written in the 8th century CE. We report on the design of new dependency relations, discuss aspects of the annotation process and evaluation, and illustrate its use in a study of parallelism in Classical Chinese poetry.
