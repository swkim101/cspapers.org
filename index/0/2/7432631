Recent publications indicate the importance of software engineering in the computer science curriculum. In this paper, we present the final part of software engineering education at University of Groningen in the Netherlands and Vaxjo University in Sweden, where student teams perform an industrial software development project. It furthermore presents the main educational problems encountered in such real-life projects and explains how this international course addresses these problems. The main contribution of this paper is a set of seven good practices for project based software engineering education.
