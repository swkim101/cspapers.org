Recently, Zhang-Liu-Wong introduced Toeplitz codes and showed that Toeplitz codes achieve full diversity when a linear receiver, zero-forcing (ZF) or minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver, is used. Unfortunately, Toeplitz codes suffer from large numbers of zeros. The zeros in the design result in high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and also impose a severe constraint on hardware implementation of the code when turning off some of the transmitting antennas whenever a zero is transmitted. This motivates us to design full diversity STBCs having all its entries non-zero for linear receivers. As a result, our proposed codes not only have lower PAPR, but also easier implementation than Toeplitz codes. Moreover, simulation results also show that our codes outperform Toeplitz codes under peak power constraint while performing the same under average power constraint.
