The RExtractor system is an information extractor that processes input documents by natural language processing tools and consequently queries the parsed sentences to extract a knowledge base of entities and their relations. The extraction queries are designed manually using a tool that enables natural graphical representation of queries over dependency trees. A workflow of the system is designed to be language and domain independent. We demonstrate RExtractor on Czech and English legal documents.
