The last few years have witnessed a flurry of research in the field of query processing for networks of sensors and actuators. It is widely accepted that query processing is the method of choice for acquiring data from a sensor field. Although query processing offers a very good computational model for a variety of applications such as environmental monitoring, it is a poor match for application scenarios where a timely response to an event is required by the system. With this in mind, we propose a mature database technology, namely active rules, that provides a natural computational paradigm for sensor network applications that require reactive behavior, such as rapid forest fire response and security management.
 For the remainder of this paper we will outline the implications of active rules for sensor networks and contrast these against query processing. We will then proceed to discuss work in progress carried out by project <i>Asene</i> (Active SEnsor NEtworks) that aims to address these implications. We conclude by introducing our architecture for a decentralised event broker based on the publish/subscribe paradigm and our early design of an Event-Condition-Action (ECA) language for sensor networks.
