This session is being organized by ACM SIGCAS (Computers and Society) for those with an interest in addressing the social and ethical consequences of computing in our society within their curricula. This year we will share case studies as a means to teaching a variety of issues resulting from the impact of computing in our society. Our discussion leaders will introduce briefly favorite case studies in their fields of interest and will encourage all participants to share examples of their own. Ways for dealing and solving current problems will be tackled. We will provide a plan of how to incorporate the case studies presented into our classes along with a handout of how to do so. Topics of interest include legal issues, social media, privacy, and sustainability.
