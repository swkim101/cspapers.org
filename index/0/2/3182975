A discriminative method is proposed for learning monotonic transformations of the training data while jointly estimating a large-margin classifier. In many domains such as document classification, image histogram classification and gene microarray experiments, fixed monotonic transformations can be useful as a preprocessing step. However, most classifiers only explore these transformations through manual trial and error or via prior domain knowledge. The proposed method learns monotonic transformations automatically while training a large-margin classifier without any prior knowledge of the domain. A monotonic piecewise linear function is learned which transforms data for subsequent processing by a linear hyperplane classifier. Two algorithmic implementations of the method are formalized. The first solves a convergent alternating sequence of quadratic and linear programs until it obtains a locally optimal solution. An improved algorithm is then derived using a convex semidefinite relaxation that overcomes initialization issues in the greedy optimization problem. The effectiveness of these learned transformations on synthetic problems, text data and image data is demonstrated.
