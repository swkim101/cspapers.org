The k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, for k _> 1, is a natural and simple combinatorial algorithm at tempt ing to decide whether two given graphs are isomorphic. In this paper, we show that for every surface S (orientable or non-orientable) there is a k _> 1 such that the k-dimensional WL-algori thm succeeds to decide isomorphism of graphs embeddable in S. To prove this, we use a close connection between the WL-algori thm and definability in certain finite variable logics that has been established by Cai, Ffirer, and Immerman [7].
