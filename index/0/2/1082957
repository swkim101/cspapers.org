CloudBrowser is a web application framework that supports the development of rich Internet applications whose entire user interface and application logic resides on the server, while all client/server communication is provided by the framework. CloudBrowser thus hides the distributed nature of these applications from the developer, creating an environment similar to that provided by a desktop user interface library. CloudBrowser preserves the user interface state in a server-side virtual browser that is maintained across visits. Unlike other server-centric frameworks, CloudBrowser's exclusive use of the HTML document model and associated JavaScript execution environment allows it to exploit existing client-side user interface libraries and toolkits while transparently providing access to other application tiers. We have implemented a prototype of CloudBrowser as well as several example applications to demonstrate the benefits of its server-centric design.
