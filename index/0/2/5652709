Ontology mapping is the task of finding semantic relationships between entities (i.e. concept, attribute and relation) of two ontologies. In the existing literatures, many (semi-)automatic approaches have found considerable interest by combining several mapping strategies (namely multi-strategy mapping). However, experiments show that multi-strategy based mapping does not always outperform its single-strategy counterpart. We here mainly consider the following questions: For a new, unseen mapping task, should one use a multi-strategy or a single-strategy? And if the task is suitable for multi-strategy, then which strategies should be selected in the combined scenario? This paper proposes an approach of multiple strategies detection for ontology mapping. The results obtained so far show that multi-strategy detection improves both on precision and recall significantly.
