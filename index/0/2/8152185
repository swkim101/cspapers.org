The panel will examine a variety of issues. What can computer science offer to the non-major? What material should anon-majors’ course contain and how should the material be presented? Even better, how should the material be learned? Should we teach non-majors to use word processors and spreadsheets? Can we give them something more than spreadsheetsand databaseswithout losing their interest? What’s the best use of laboratory time for a non-major? How do we get the most educational value out of limited laboratory budgets?
