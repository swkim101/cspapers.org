With the flourishing of community-based question answering (cQA) services like Yahoo! Answers, more and more web users seek their information need from these sites. Understanding user's information need expressed through their search questions is crucial to information providers. Question classification in cQA is studied for this purpose. However, there are two main difficulties in applying traditional methods (question classification in TREC QA and text classification) to cQA: (1) Traditional methods confine themselves to classify a text or question into two or a few predefined categories. While in cQA, the number of categories is much larger, such as Yahoo! Answers, there contains 1,263 categories. Our empirical results show that with the increasing of the number of categories to moderate size, the performance of the classification accuracy dramatically decreases. (2) Unlike the normal texts, questions in cQA are very short, which cannot provide sufficient word co-occurrence or shared information for a good similarity measure due to the data sparseness. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach for question classification in cQA that can tackle the difficulties of the traditional methods. In the first stage, we preform a search process to prune the large-scale categories to focus our classification effort on a small subset. In the second stage, we enrich questions by leveraging Wikipedia semantic knowledge to tackle the data sparseness. As a result, the classification model is trained on the enriched small subset. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method on Yahoo! Answers with 1,263 categories. The experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline method (with error reductions of 23.21%).
