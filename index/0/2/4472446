We show that quantum circuits cannot be made fault-tolerant against a depolarizing noise level of thetas = (6 - 2radic2)/7 ap 45%, thereby improving on a previous bound of 50% (due to Razborov, 2004). More precisely, the circuit model for which we prove this bound contains perfect gates from the Clifford group (CNOT, Hadamard, S, X, Y, Z) and arbitrary additional one-qubit gates that are subject to depolarizing noise thetas. We prove that this set of gates cannot be universal for arbitrary (even classical) computation, from which the upper bound on the noise threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation follows
