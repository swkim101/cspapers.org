We consider the problem of configuring a system in software and design database domains, where a system comprises a version for each of its constituent objects. We present a syntactic characterization of a correct configuration, tied to a transaction model, that makes it possible to generate automatically all correct configurations of a system. One can also generate configurations that satisfy some selection criteria such as the absence and presence of specified features, or check whether a user-specified configuration is correct.
