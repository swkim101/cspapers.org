In this paper, we propose new ideas for local search for PMS, which mainly rely on the distinction between hard and soft clauses. We use these ideas to develop a local search PMS algorithm called {\it Dist}. Experimental results on PMS benchmarks from MaxSAT Evaluation 2013 show that {\it Dist} significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PMS algorithms, including both local search algorithms and complete ones, on random and crafted benchmarks. For the industrial benchmark, {\it Dist} dramatically outperforms previous local search algorithms and is comparable with complete algorithms.
