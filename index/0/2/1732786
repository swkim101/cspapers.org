We present an entirely novel concept of retrieving social media data, called sigSocial. It integrates social media data of various sources, using a semantic classifier. Nowadays, people use multiple social media simultaneously, acquiring information with ease. However, accessing numerous services to reach different channels is bothersome. Also, the volume of information one can process is limited. Our aim is to reduce this burden, providing easiness and efficiency. In other words, we attempt to build a single service that integrates information from various platforms. The application has three main features. First, it enables users to explore multiple social media without accessing them separately. Second, it organizes information retrieved from social medias into well-defined classes. Finally, it works as a stand-alone application, the mechanism of which is internal to the device, not relying on any external servers or networks. This method respects user privacy, which has recently gained much attention.
