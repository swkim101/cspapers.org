This paper proposes that two significant and emerging problems facing our connected, data-driven 
society may be more effectively solved by being framed as sensemaking challenges. The first is in 
empowering individuals to take control of their privacy, in device-rich information environments 
where personal information is fed transparently to complex networks of information brokers. Although 
sensemaking is often framed as an analytical activity undertaken by experts, due to the fact that 
non-specialist end-users are now being forced to make expert-like decisions in complex information 
environments, we argue that it is both appropriate and important to consider sensemaking challenges 
in this context. The second is in supporting human-in-the-loop algorithmic decision-making, in which 
important decisions bringing direct consequences for individuals, or indirect consequences for groups, 
are made with the support of data-driven algorithmic systems. In both privacy and algorithmic decision-making, framing the problems as sensemaking challenges acknowledges complex and illdefined 
problem structures, and affords the opportunity to view these activities as both building up 
relevant expertise schemas over time, and being driven potentially by recognition-primed decision 
making.
