Semantic web search involves retrieval of user-specific web artifacts by utilizing their semantic descriptions. A very specific web artifact that has evolved in recent times is web services. Web services can be semantically described in languages like OWL-S. However, such languages are limited with respect to their expressivity of context. They also lack a formal ontological framework where efficient web service retrieval can be conducted. In this paper we model a service request scenario within the web as an event-driven system. Services as well as user requests are modeled as events. We propose an ontological framework called Context-Aware Ontology Framework for Events and Services (CAOFES) where such event-driven web service retrieval can be efficiently executed by a novel reasoning technique.
