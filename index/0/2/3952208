Spectrum scarcity has been driving cellular operators to utilize unlicensed spectrum in conjunction with licensed bands to deliver mobile data to its Long-Term Evolution (LTE) users, offloading the fully allocated LTE bands. However, the use of LTE in unlicensed spectrum creates numerous challenges as the fair coexistence with other technologies. A myriad of experimental works tackles the problems involved in the coexistence of different radio access technologies (RAT) in unlicensed spectrum, however, they do not cover all aspects of the problem and fail to provide the framework adopted in the experiments for reproducible research. Therefore, in this demo we present a highly configurable packetized-LTE PHY open-source framework for coexistence experiments. The framework allows the evaluation and comparison of different coexistence techniques.
