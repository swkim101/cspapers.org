Lack of accountability makes the Internet vulnerable to numerous attacks, including prefix hijacking, route forgery, source address spoofing, and DoS flooding attacks. This paper aims to bring accountability to the Internet with low-cost and deployable enhancements. We present IPA, a design that uses the readily available top-level DNSSEC infrastructure and BGP to bootstrap accountability. We show how IPA enables a suite of security modules that can combat various network-layer attacks. Our evaluation shows that IPA introduces modest overhead and is gradually deployable. We also discuss how the design incentivizes early adoption.
