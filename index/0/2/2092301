This paper gives a first look at slides2wiki, a new scheme for easily providing collaborative lecture notes. Unlike previous web-based courseware schemes, the slides2wiki approach integrates with existing techniques that computer-science course instructors already use to prepare their classes. This tool is used to create a site where students may collaborate to create their own notes, using the lecture slides as a starting point. Adopting a surprisingly low-tech approach that uses familiar tools and paradigms, slides2wiki avoids many of the stumbling blocks of previous approaches to web-based course support.
