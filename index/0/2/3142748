We describe an algorithm that finds a minimum cost schedule, including spili code, for a register-constrained machine that can issue up to one arithmetic operation and one memory access operation at a time, under the restrictions that the dependence graph is a full binary tree, and all operations have unit processing times. This problem is a generalization of two problems whose efficient solutions are well understood: optimal dual-issue scheduling without spills, solved by ,Bernstein, J&e and Rodeh (1987), and optimal single-issue scheduling with spill code, solved by Sethi and Ullman (1970), both assuming a binary dependence graph and a fixed number of registers. We show that the algorithm’s complexity is O(nk) where n is the number of operations to be scheduled and k is the number of spills in the schedule. The cost of an optimal schedule (i.e. its length) is p + 2k + (Al where p is the number of registers used! k is the number of spills and IAl is the number of arithmetic operations. We show that this is the cost of all schedules that are in “contiguous form” and therefore that all minimum-spill contiguous form schedules have minimum cost.
