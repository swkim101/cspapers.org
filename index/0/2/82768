Since the minimally invasive surgery has significant benefits for the patient, special equipment and techniques are constantly enhanced in this relatively new surgical field, so that more challenging surgical applications can be achieved. Thereby, the major aim is to enable the surgeon to manipulate instruments inside the human body intuitively, despite restricted access to the operating field and limited workspace. With our spine like overtube system for use with standard endoscopes and standard endoscopic instruments, we provide a system facilitating tissue manipulation with sufficient triangulation. In this paper we describe our 3D-printed manipulator system for minimally invasive applications and its pure mechanical control and actuation concepts. Following our aim of an individualized disposable system, in a first step we demonstrate the feasibility of a 3D-printed surgical robotic system by laboratory experiments and a clinical evaluation on a porcine model.
