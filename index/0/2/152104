Aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) is a technique to separate concerns that crosscut the modularity boundaries of a modeling hierarchy. AOM is traditionally supported by manual editing or writing model transformation rules that refine a base model. However, traditional model weaving approaches present challenges to those who are unfamiliar with a model transformation language or metamodel definitions. This poster describes an approach to weave aspect models by recording and analyzing demonstrated operations by end-users.
