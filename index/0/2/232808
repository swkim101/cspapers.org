Some linguistic constraints cannot be effectively resolved during parsing at the location in which they are most naturally introduced. This paper shows how constraints can be propagated in a memoizing parser (such as a chart parser) in much the same way that variable bindings are, providing a general treatment of constraint coroutining in memoization. Prolog code for a simple application of our technique to Bouma and van Noord's (1994) categorial grammar analysis of Dutch is provided.
