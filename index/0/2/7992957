Many algorithms have been developed to harvest lexical semantic resources, however few have linked the mined knowledge into formal knowledge repositories. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for automatically ontologizing (attaching) semantic relations into WordNet. We present an empirical evaluation on the task of attaching part-of and causation relations, showing an improvement on F-score over a baseline model.
