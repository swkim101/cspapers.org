We present a technique which complements Hidden Markov Models by incorporating some lexicalized states representing syntactically uncommon words. Our approach examines the distribution of transitions, selects the uncommon words, and makes lexicalized states for the words. We performed a part-of-speech tagging experiment on the Brown corpus to evaluate the resultant language model and discovered that this technique improved the tagging accuracy by 0.21% at the 95% level of confidence.
