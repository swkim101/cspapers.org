Mining bilingual data (including bilingual sentences and terms) from the Web can benefit many NLP applications, such as machine translation and cross language information retrieval. In this paper, based on the observation that bilingual data in many web pages appear collectively following similar patterns, an adaptive pattern-based bilingual data mining method is proposed. Specifically, given a web page, the method contains four steps: 1) preprocessing: parse the web page into a DOM tree and segment the inner text of each node into snippets; 2) seed mining: identify potential translation pairs (seeds) using a word based alignment model which takes both translation and transliteration into consideration; 3) pattern learning: learn generalized patterns with the identified seeds; 4) pattern based mining: extract all bilingual data in the page using the learned patterns. Our experiments on Chinese web pages produced more than 7.5 million pairs of bilingual sentences and more than 5 million pairs of bilingual terms, both with over 80% accuracy.
