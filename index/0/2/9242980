We demonstrate that a supervised annotation learning approach using structured features derived from tokens and prior annotations performs better than a bag of words approach. We present a general graph representation for automatically deriving these features from labeled data. Automatic feature selection based on class association scores requires a large amount of labeled data and direct voting can be difficult and error-prone for structured features, even for language specialists. We show that highlighted rationales from the user can be used for indirect feature voting and same performance can be achieved with less labeled data. We present our results on two annotation learning tasks for opinion mining from product and movie reviews.
