This paper presents the major limitations to the interconnect technology scaling at future technology generations and demonstrates both evolutionary and radical potential solutions to the BEOL scaling problem. To address the local interconnect challenges, a novel hybrid Al-Cu interconnect technology is introduced. Performances of carbon-based interconnects are evaluated as a more radical solution. The impact of interconnects and the optimal interconnect options are investigated for emerging next generation devices. Interconnects for new state variables, namely spintronic interconnects, are studied and their potential performances in an all-spin logic system are evaluated.
