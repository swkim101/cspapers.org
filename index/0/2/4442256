We present an unsupervised method for resolving word sense ambiguities in one language by using statistical evidence assembled from other languages. It is crucial for this approach that texts are mapped into a language-independent interlingual representation. We also show that the coverage and accuracy resulting from multilingual sources outperform analyses where only monolingual training data is taken into account.
