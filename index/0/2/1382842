This presentation demonstrates the early results from the French ANR project RT-Simex. RT-Simex proposes a set of tools to analyze parallel embedded code and trace the simulation results back to the initial models from which the code was generated. The whole tool-set relies on standard formats (UML MARTE, Open Trace Format) to ensure a perennial use. The main difficulty is to reconcile different execution traces extracted from codes running concurrently on different unsynchronized platforms. This is achieved through the polychronous logical time model of MARTE.
