Large amounts of unverified and at times contradictory information often appear on social media following natural disasters. Timely verification of this information can be crucial to saving lives and for coordinating relief efforts. Our goal is to enable this verification by developing an online platform that involves ordinary citizens in the evidence gathering and evaluation process. The output of this platform will provide reliable information to humanitarian organizations, journalists, and decision makers involved in relief efforts.
