The planar augmentation problem is the problem of adding a minimum number of edges to a given planar graph such that the resulting graph is biconnected and still planar. This problem is NP-hard [15]. We present a new $approximation algorithm for the planar augmentation problem. The best approximation factor achieved so far is 2 [15]. Furthermore, we ran extensive computational experiments on ‘real world’ graphs. The outcome is surprising: The solution of our new algorithm is very often optimum and in almost all cases the solution found by our algorithm contains at most one more edge than in an optimum solution.
