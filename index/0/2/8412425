In recent years, autonomous miniature airships have gained increased interest in the robotics community. This is due to their ability to move safely and hover for extended periods of time. The major constraints of miniature airships come from their limited payload which introduces substantial constraints on their perceptional capabilities. In this paper, we consider the problem of localizing a miniature blimp with lightweight ultrasound sensors. Since the opening angle of the sound cone emitted by a sonar sensor depends on the diameter of the membrane, small-size sonar devices introduce the problem of high uncertainty about which object has been perceived. We present a novel sensor model for ultrasound sensors with large opening angles that allows an autonomous blimp to robustly localize itself in a known environment using Monte Carlo localization. As we demonstrate in experiments with a real blimp, our novel sensor model outperforms a popular sensor model that has in the past been shown to work reliably on wheeled platforms.
