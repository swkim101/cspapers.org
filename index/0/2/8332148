We describe a model of document citation that learns to identify hubs and authorities in a set of linked documents, such as pages retrieved from the world wide web, or papers retrieved from a research paper archive. Unlike the popular HITS algorithm, which relies on dubious statistical assumptions, our model provides probabilistic estimates that have clear semantics. We also (cid:12)nd that in general, the identi(cid:12)ed authoritative documents correspond better to human intuition.
