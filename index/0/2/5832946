This tutorial aims to provide attendees with a clear notion of the linguistic and distributional characteristics of multiword expressions (MWEs), their relevance for robust automated natural language processing and language technology, what methods and resources are available to support their use, and what more could be done in the future. Our target audience are researchers and practitioners in language technology, not necessarily experts in MWEs, who are interested in tasks that involve or could benefit from considering MWEs as a pervasive phenomenon in human language and communication.
