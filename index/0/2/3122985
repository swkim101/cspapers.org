This paper presents methods for performing graph-based semantic classification using kernel functions defined on the WordNet lexical hierarchy. These functions are evaluated on the SemEval Task 4 relation classification dataset and their performance is shown to be competitive with that of more complex systems. A number of possible future developments are suggested to illustrate the flexibility of the approach.
