In this paper we present a new synthesis and layout approach that avoids the normal iterations between synthesis, technology mapping and layout, and increases routing by abutment. It produces shorter and more predictable delays, and sometimes even layouts with reduced areas. This scheme equalizes delays along different paths, which makes low granularity pipelining a reality, and hence we can clock these circuits at much higher frequencies, compared to what is possible in a conventionally designed circuit. Since any circuit can be clocked at a fixed rate, this method does not require timing-driven synthesis. We propose the logic and layout synthesis schemes and algorithms, discuss the physical layout part of the process, and support our methodology with simulation results.
