We increase the lexical coverage of FrameNet through automatic paraphrasing. We use crowdsourcing to manually filter out bad paraphrases in order to ensure a high-precision resource. Our expanded FrameNet contains an additional 22K lexical units, a 3-fold increase over the current FrameNet, and achieves 40% better coverage when evaluated in a practical setting on New York Times data.
