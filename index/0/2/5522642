The QUIZIT system has been developed to support adaptive as well as standard testing, along with automatic grading and record keeping, using the WWW as a delivery vehicle. In connection with our Interactive Learning with a Digital Library in Computer Science project, we have applied QUIZIT to help with a master's level course as well as a large freshman level service course. Preliminary testing has led to various improvements, and it appears that QUIZIT will be well received by both instructors and students. It should port easily to a variety of environments and so could be widely used at other institutions as well.
