We study a wide range of online graph and network optimization problems, focusing on problems that arise in the study of connectivity and cuts in graphs. In a general online network design problem, we have a communication network known to the algorithm in advance. What is not known in advance are the bandwidth or cut demands between nodes in the network. Our results include an <i>O</i>(log <i>m</i> log <i>n</i>) competitive randomized algorithm for the online non-metric facility location and for a generalization of the problem called themulticast problem. In the non-metric facility location <i>m</i> is the number of facilities and <i>n</i> is the number of clients. The competitive ratio is nearly tight. We also present an<i>O</i>(log<sup>2</sup> <i>n</i> log <i>k</i>) competitive randomized algorithm for the on-line group Steiner problem in trees and an <i>O</i>(log<sup>3</sup> <i>n</i> log <i>k</i>)competitive randomized algorithm for the problem in general graphs, where <i>n</i> is the number of vertices in the graph and <i>k</i> is the number of groups. Finally, we design a deterministic <i>O</i>(log<sup>3</sup> <i>n</i> log log <i>n</i>) competitive algorithm for the online multi-cut problem. Our algorithms are based on a unified framework for designing online algorithms for problems involving connectivity and cuts. We first present a general <i>O</i>(log <i>m</i>)-deterministic algorithm for generating fractional solution that satisfies the online connectivity or cut demands, where <i>m</i> is the number of edges in the graph.
