As processors seek more resource efficiency, they increasingly need to target multiple goals at the same time, such as a level of performance, power consumption, and average utilization. Robust control solutions cannot come from heuristic-based controllers or even from formal approaches that combine multiple single-parameter controllers. Such controllers may end-up working against each other. What is needed is control-theoretical MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) controllers, which actuate on multiple inputs and control multiple outputs in a coordinated manner. In this paper, we use MIMO control-theory techniques to develop controllers to dynamically tune architectural parameters in processors. To our knowledge, this is the first work in this area. We discuss three ways in which a MIMO controller can be used. We develop an example of MIMO controller and show that it is substantially more effective than controllers based on heuristics or built by combining single-parameter formal controllers. The general approach discussed here is likely to be increasingly relevant as future processors become more resource-constrained and adaptive.
