The complexity lower bound (log N) is proved for randomized computation trees (over reals with branching signs f ; >g) for recognizing an arrangement or a polyhedron with N faces. A similar lower bound is proved for randomized computation trees over any zero-characteristic eld with branching signs f=; 6 =g for recognizing an arrangement. As consequences, this provides in particular, the randomized lower bound (n 2) for the KNAPSACK problem (which was proved in case of the randomized computation trees over reals in 11]) and also the randomized lower bound (n log n)
