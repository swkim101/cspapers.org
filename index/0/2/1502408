Explanation is an interactive process requiring a dialogue between advice-giver and advice-seeker. In this paper, we argue that in order to participate in a dialogue with its users, a generation system must be capable of reasoning about its own utterances and therefore must maintain a rich representation of the responses it produces. We present a text planner that constructs a detailed text plan, containing the intentional, attentional, and rhetorical structures of the text it generates.
