We present iAppraise : an open-source framework that enables the use of eye-tracking for MT evaluation. It connects Appraise, an open-source toolkit for MT evaluation, to a low-cost eye-tracking device, to make its usage accessible to a broader audience. It also provides a set of tools for extracting and exploiting gaze data, which facilitate eye-tracking analysis. In this paper, we describe different modules of the framework, and explain how the tool can be used in a MT evaluation scenario. During the demonstration, the users will be able to perform an evaluation task, observe their own reading behavior during a replay of the session, and export and extract features from the data.
