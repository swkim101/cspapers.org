In this paper, we propose a framework, called XAR-Miner, for mining ARs from XML documents efficiently. In XAR-Miner, raw data in the XML document are first preprocessed to transform to either an Indexed Content Tree (IX-tree) or Multi-relational databases (Multi-DB), depending on the size of XML document and memory constraint of the system, for efficient data selection and AR mining. Task-relevant concepts are generalized to produce generalized meta-patterns, based on which the large ARs that meet the support and confidence levels are generated.
