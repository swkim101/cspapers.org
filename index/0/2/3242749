In this panel we discuss graduate software engineering education and software engineering research. In the last decade, software engineering has tentatively been accepted as a formal field of study in academe. Software engineering education is maturing from specialized courses in computer science, to Master's programs, and more recently undergraduate degrees. What about Ph.D. degrees in software engineering? How are good software engineering researchers created? Panel members will address questions such as: x How can the need for preparing software engineering researchers and educators be taken seriously? x Should Ph.D. degrees in software engineering be developed? Where should they be housed, in the engineering school, the business school, the sciences? Should this be an inter-disciplinary degree? x Should traditional computing education be reformed to accommodate for software engineering? Are these changes necessary anyway? What will these changes be? x A Ph.D. in software engineering, should focus on unsolved, fundamental problems of software engineering. What are these problems? x Are there any lessons learned from other engineering disciplines? x What should a software engineering research laboratory look like? Should the focus be in gathering process data or in obtaining measurements of the artifacts?
