In joint work with Eva Tardos in 1995, we asked whether it was possible to obtain a polynomial-time, polylogarithmic approximation algorithm for the disjoint paths problem in the class of all even-degree planar graphs. This paper answers the question in the affirmative, by providing such an algorithm. The algorithm builds on recent work of C. Chekuri et al. (2004, 2005), who considered muting problems in planar graphs where each edge can carry up to two paths.
