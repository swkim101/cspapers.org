Given two polygonal curves in the plane, there are many ways to define a notion of similarity between them. One measure that is extremely popular is the Frechet distance. Since it has been proposed by Alt and Godau in 1992, many variants and extensions have been studied. Nonetheless, even more than 20 years later, the original O(n2 log n) algorithm by Alt and Godau for computing the Frechet distance remains the state of the art (here n denotes the number of vertices on each curve). This has led Helmut Alt to conjecture that the associated decision problem is 3SUM-hard. 
 
In recent work, Agarwal et al. show how to break the quadratic barrier for the discrete version of the Frechet distance, where one considers sequences of points instead of polygonal curves. Building on their work, we give a randomized algorithm to compute the Frechet distance between two polygonal curves in time [EQUATION] on a pointer machine and in time O(n2(log log n)2) on a word RAM. Furthermore, we show that there exists an algebraic decision tree for the decision problem of depth O(n2-e), for some e > 0. This provides evidence that the decision problem may not be 3SUM-hard after all and reveals an intriguing new aspect of this well-studied problem.
