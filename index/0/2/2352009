We present a data-driven optimal control framework that is derived using the path integral (PI) control approach. We find iterative control laws analytically without a priori policy parameterization based on probabilistic representation of the learned dynamics model. The proposed algorithm operates in a forward-backward manner which differentiate it from other PI-related methods that perform forward sampling to find optimal controls. Our method uses significantly less samples to find analytic control laws compared to other approaches within the PI control family that rely on extensive sampling from given dynamics models or trials on physical systems in a model-free fashion. In addition, the learned controllers can be generalized to new tasks without re-sampling based on the compositionality theory for the linearly-solvable optimal control framework. We provide experimental results on three different tasks and comparisons with state-of-the-art model-based methods to demonstrate the efficiency and generalizability of the proposed framework.
