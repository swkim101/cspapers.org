The Android platform lacks tools for assessing and monitoring apps in a systematic way. This lack of tools is particularly problematic when combined with the open nature of Google Play, the main app distribution channel. As our key contribution, we design and implement ProfileDroid, a comprehensive, multi-layer system for monitoring and profiling apps. Our approach is arguably the first to profile apps at four layers: (a) static, or app specification, (b) user interaction, (c) operating system, and (d) network. We evaluate 27 free and paid Android apps and make several observations: (a) we identify discrepancies between the app specification and app execution, (b) free versions of apps could end up costing more than their paid counterparts, due to an order of magnitude increase in traffic, (c) most network traffic is not encrypted, (d) apps communicate with many more sources than users might expect---as many as 13, and (e) we find that 22 out of 27 apps communicate with Google during execution. ProfileDroid is the first step towards a systematic approach for (a) generating cost-effective but comprehensive app profiles, and (b) identifying inconsistencies and surprising behaviors.
