Abstract: Current verification technology provides tools for the verification of programs written in a high-level language. Even verified high-level programs may not satisfy their specifications when executed, due to errors in tower-level software and hardware. We discuss an attempt at eliminating this problem with the design of an execution environment consisting of a compiler, operating system, and processor, each of which has been mechanically verified.
