Generating diverse questions for given images is an important task for computational education, entertainment and AI assistants. Different from many conventional prediction techniques is the need for algorithms to generate a diverse set of plausible questions, which we refer to as creativity. In this paper we propose a creative algorithm for visual question generation which combines the advantages of variational autoencoders with long short-term memory networks. We demonstrate that our framework is able to generate a large set of varying questions given a single input image.
