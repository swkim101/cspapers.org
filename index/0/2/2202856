During the past several decades, full screen interactive programming has become essential in data processing. However, it is impossible or difficult to teach full screen interactive programs on IBM mainframes at universities because of the enormous cost of CICS and the lack of flexibility with the MUSIC PANEL utility. This article describes our solution to the need described in [4] for an inexpensive utility which will allow COBOL programmers to do interactive programming on mainframes utilizing full screen techniques.
At Southeast Missouri State University, we have addressed these problems with a utility program which facilitate full screen interactive programming. This program has been developed by Dr. Hilton C. Chen with comments and suggestions by Dr. Wayne C. Summers. The utility program is friendlier and easier to use and considerably more useful than MUSIC's PANEL. More importantly, it gives our students experience in full screen interactive programming on mainframes.
