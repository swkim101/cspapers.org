The NTCIR INTENT task comprises two subtasks: {\em Subtopic Mining}, where systems are required to return a ranked list of {\em subtopic strings} for each given query; and {\em Document Ranking}, where systems are required to return a diversified web search result for each given query. This paper summarises the novel features of the Second INTENT task at NTCIR-10 and its main findings, and poses some questions for future diversified search evaluation.
