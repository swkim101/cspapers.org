This paper describes the development of a human-like multi-modal soft finger and its ability to sense the texture of objects. This fingertip has two silicon rubber layers of different hardness; strain gauges and PVDF films are randomly distributed as tactile sensors. Owing to the dynamics of the silicon between sensors, the fingertip is supposed to have several sensor modalities. Preliminary experiments show that the fingertip can detect the difference between the textures of objects (paper and wood).
