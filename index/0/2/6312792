Left-to-right (LR) decoding (Watanabe et al., 2006b) is a promising decoding algorithm for hierarchical phrase-based translation (Hiero). It generates the target sentence by extending the hypotheses only on the right edge. LR decoding has complexity O(n 2 b) for input of n words and beam sizeb, compared toO(n 3 ) for the CKY algorithm. It requires a single language model (LM) history for each target hypothesis rather than two LM histories per hypothesis as in CKY. In this paper we present an augmented LR decoding algorithm that builds on the original algorithm in (Watanabe et al., 2006b). Unlike that algorithm, using experiments over multiple language pairs we show two new results: our LR decoding algorithm provides demonstrably more efficient decoding than CKY Hiero, four times faster; and by introducing new distortion and reordering features for LR decoding, it maintains the same translation quality (as in BLEU scores) obtained phrase-based and CKY Hiero with the same translation model.
