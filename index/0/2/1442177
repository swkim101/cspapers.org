The Tutte polynomial of a graph G is a two-variable polynomial T(G;x,y) that encodes many interesting properties of the graph. We study the complexityof the following problem, for rationals x and y: take as input a graph G, and output a value which is a good approximation to T(G;x,y). We are interested in determining for which points (x,y) there is a fullypolynomial randomised approximation scheme (FPRAS) for T(G;x,y). Our main contribution is a substantial widening of the region known to benon-FPRASable.
