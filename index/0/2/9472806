RoboBuilder is a blocks-based, program-to-play game designed to introduce students to core aspects of computational thinking in a fun and engaging environment. The game employs a constructionist design to challenge players to invent and implement strategies to control an on-screen robot using a specially designed visual programming language. During the game, players' robots compete against a series of progressively more challenging opponents in one-on-one battles. Through playing the game, players construct working programs, providing learners with the experience of reifying their own ideas using a computational medium, a practice central to our notion of computational thinking. This poster presents the design rationale for RoboBuilder and discusses key aspects of the game that contribute to giving learners a positive, hands-on introduction to core computational thinking skills including computationally expressing ideas, algorithmic thinking, and debugging.
