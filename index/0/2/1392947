This paper proposes to leverage the mathematical means of game theory to analyze on-board social crew dynamics. We describe how game theory facilitates capturing the essence of interactive decision making, thereby raising the potential for a fully automated and unintrusive monitoring and diagnosis tool. Finally, we present preliminary findings based on the base-line data collection and the first phase of the ground based Mars-500 isolation experiment.
