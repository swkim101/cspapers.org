A set of programs used in the design of custom hand packed and standard cell MOS circuits is described. The programs cover logic simulation, filter analysis, circuit simulation, timing simulation, circuit extraction from layout, design tolerance checking, connectivity checking and user interface facilities. A cell documentation system is used to tie together the various design support packages.
