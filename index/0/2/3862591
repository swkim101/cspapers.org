*** The rapid development of mobile internet abstracts many non-professional persons to creating mobile applications. Traditional development process cannot meet their needs. In this paper, we present a cross-platform mobile development environment based on OSGi framework, EasyApp. It provides a highly-integrated, UI-friendly and easily-operating environment. Applications are comprehensively developed with web techniques. Users could create mobile applications with draggable widgets. Native APIs of mobile phone can be invoked with abundant plugins. After designing, users could package and download applications of multiple platforms. ***
