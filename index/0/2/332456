Recently [Manning et al., 2007] resorted the Permuterm indexof Garfield (1976) as a time-efficient and elegant solution to the string dictionary problem in which pattern queries may possibly include one wild-card symbol (called, Tolerant Retrieval problem). Unfortunately the Permuterm index is space inefficient because its quadruples the dictionary size. In this paper we propose the Compressed Permuterm Index which solves the Tolerant Retrieval problem in optimal query time, i.e. time proportional to the length of the searched pattern, and space close to the k-th order empirical entropy of the indexed dictionary. Our index can be used to solve also more sophisticated queries which involve several wild-card symbols, or require to prefix-match multiple fields in a database of records.The result is based on an elegant variant of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform defined on a dictionary of strings of variable length, which allows to easily adapt known compressed indexes [Makinen-Navarro, 2007] to solve the Tolerant Retrieval problem. Experiments show that our index supports fast queries within a space occupancy that is close to the one achievable by compressing the string dictionary via gzip, bzip or ppmdi. This improves known approaches based on front-coding by more than 50% in absolute space occupancy, still guaranteeing comparable query time.
