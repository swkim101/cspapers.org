Most previous studies in computerized deception detection have relied only on shallow lexico-syntactic patterns. This paper investigates syntactic stylometry for deception detection, adding a somewhat unconventional angle to prior literature. Over four different datasets spanning from the product review to the essay domain, we demonstrate that features driven from Context Free Grammar (CFG) parse trees consistently improve the detection performance over several baselines that are based only on shallow lexico-syntactic features. Our results improve the best published result on the hotel review data (Ott et al., 2011) reaching 91.2% accuracy with 14% error reduction.
