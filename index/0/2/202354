We consider the problem of finding a set of k vertices of maximum total influence in a given undirected network, under the independent cascade (IC) model of influence spread. It is known that influence is monotone and submodular in the IC model, and hence a greedy algorithm achieves a (1--1/e) approximation to this problem. Moreover, it is known to be NP-hard to achieve a better approximation factor in directed networks. 
 
We show that for undirected networks, this approximation barrier can be overcome: the greedy algorithm obtains an (1--1/e + c) approximation to the set of optimal influence, for some constant c > 0. Our proof proceeds via probabilistic analysis of bond percolation in arbitrary finite networks. We also show that the influence maximization problems remains APX-hard in undirected networks.
