A model for computer science courseware development within universities is proposed. This model asserts that masters level graduate and undergraduate students are a valuable software development resource that can be utilized to design, prototype, field test, and refine quality courseware. To support this contention four prototype courseware packages are used to briefly describe the Visible Algorithms project at Northridge. These packages provide tutorials on, and graphic animations of: linked list, binary tree, B-tree, and memory management algorithms.
