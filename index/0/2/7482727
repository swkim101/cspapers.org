Skyline queries compute the set of Pareto-optimal tuples in a relation, ie those tuples that are not dominated by any other tuple in the same relation. Although several algorithms have been proposed for efficiently evaluating skyline queries, they either require to extend the relational server with specialized access methods (which is not always feasible) or have to perform the dominance tests on all the tuples in order to determine the result. In this paper we introduce SaLSa (Sort and Limit Skyline algorithm), which exploits the sorting machinery of a relational engine to order tuples so that only a subset of them needs to be examined for computing the skyline result. This makes SaLSa particularly attractive when skyline queries are executed on top of systems that do not understand skyline semantics or when the skyline logic runs on clients with limited power and/or bandwidth.
