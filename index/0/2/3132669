To determine some spatial characteristic, such as size or shape, of an object, the object is viewed with a television camera that employs an image sensor such as a CCD device. An image is formed on a television screen and a set of measurement markers (or cursors) are superimposed on the image at desired positions. The CCD timing signals are used to accurately determine the position of the cursors and hence the desired spatial characteristic.
