The authors present an optimal algorithm for solving the simultaneous technology mapping and linear placement problem for tree-structured circuits with the objective of minimizing the post-layout area. The proposed algorithm relies on the generation of gate-area versus cut-width curves using a dynamic programming approach. A novel design flow which extends this algorithm to minimize the circuit delay and handle general DAG structures is also presented. Experimental results on MCNC benchmarks are reported.
