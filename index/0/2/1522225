To learn about users’ experiences in using network applications, we present a lightweight, non-intrusive, and efficient framework called OneClick. The framework only requires a subject to click a dedicated key whenever he/she feels dissatisfied with the quality of application in use. By aligning the collected traffic trace and the click process, we apply Poisson regression to analyze the relationship between click events and network QoS factors. The result shows that OneClick can be used to assess the effect of network factors on users’ perceptions and compare the users’ experiences with different types of design or applications.
