This paper describes a system able to synthesize functions and predicates from examples taken in an arithmetical domain. Numbers are represented as characters strings. They are not represented as bags as in Lenat or Knapman's works. The representations of functions and predicates are sets of Horn clauses and the synthesis lies in the construction of new clauses or in the debugging of the existent ones. The paper describes the concepts which are used in the system and the synthesis process.
