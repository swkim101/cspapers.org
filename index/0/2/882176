Testing accounts for 50% of the cost of software, yet it receives little treatment in most curricula. This paper presents some approaches to giving all students multiple, incremental exposures to software testing throughout the curriculum. A unifying framework is presented which identifies a minimal set of test experiences, skills and concepts students should accumulate. The integrated approach combines common test experiences in core courses, an elective course in software testing, and volunteer participation in a test laboratory.
