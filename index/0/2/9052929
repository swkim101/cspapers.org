MOS charge storage has been demonstrated as an effective method to store the weights in VLSI implementations of neural network models by several workers. However, to achieve the full power of a VLSI implementation of an adaptive algorithm, the learning operation must built into the circuit. We have fabricated and tested a circuit ideal for this purpose by connecting a pair of capacitors with a CCD like structure, allowing for variable size weight changes as well as a weight decay operation. A 2.5µ CMOS version achieves better than 10 bits of dynamic range in a 140µ × 350µ area. A 1.25µ chip based upon the same cell has 1104 weights on a 3.5mm × 6.0mm die and is capable of peak learning rates of at least 2 × 109 weight changes per second.
