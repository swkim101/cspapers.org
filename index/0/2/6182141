This paper presents a corpus study that explores the extent to which captions contribute to recognizing the intended message of an information graphic. It then presents an implemented graphic interpretation system that takes into account a variety of communicative signals, and an evaluation study showing that evidence obtained from shallow processing of the graphic's caption has a significant impact on the system's success. This work is part of a larger project whose goal is to provide sight-impaired users with effective access to information graphics.
