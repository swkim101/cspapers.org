Equality is an Important relation and many theorems can be easily symbolized through it's use. A proposed Inference rule called HL-resolution is intended to have the benefits of hyper steps while controlling the application of paramodulation. It generates a resolvent by building a paramodulation and demodulation link between two terms using a pre proceased plan as a guide. The rule is complete for E-unsatisfiable Horn sets. The linking process makes use of an equality graph which is constructed once at the beginning of the run. Once a pair of candidate terms for HL-resolutlon is chosen in the search, potential linkages can be found and tested for compatibility efficiently by looking at the paths in the graph. The method was implemented on an existing theorem-proving system. A number of experiments were conducted on problems in abstract algebra and a comparison with set-of-support paramodulation was made.
