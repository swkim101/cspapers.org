Standard bundle adjustment techniques for Euclidean reconstruction consider camera intrinsic parameters as unknowns in the optimization process. Obviously, the speed of an optimization process is directly related to the number of unknowns and to the form of the cost function. The scheme proposed in this paper differs from previous standard techniques since unknown camera intrinsic parameters are not considered in the optimization process. Considering fewer unknowns in the optimization process produces a faster algorithm, which is more adapted to time-dependent applications such as robotics. Computationally expensive metric reconstruction, using for example several zooming cameras, considerably benefits from an intrinsics-free bundle adjustment.
