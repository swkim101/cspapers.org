Previous work has treated test case selection as a single objective optimisation problem. This paper introduces the concept of Pareto efficiency to test case selection. The Pareto efficient approach takes multiple objectives such as code coverage, past fault-detection history and execution cost, and constructs a group of non-dominating, equivalently optimal test case subsets. The paper describes the potential bene?ts of Pareto efficient multi-objective test case selection, illustrating with empirical studies of two and three objective formulations.
