In this paper, we consider new priority assignment and load control policies for real-time transactions. We assume that execution histories of transactions under different load conditions are available, and propose a number of priority assignment techniques based on execution histories and evaluate them through simulation. A widely used priority assignment technique, Earliest Deadline First, is shown to be biased towards scheduling short transactions favorably. We introduce the notion of “fair scheduling” of transactions in which the goal is to have “similar”success ratios for at1 transaction classes (short to long in sizes).
