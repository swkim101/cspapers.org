This paper presents a system (DanVideo) that is implemented using J2SE and JMF to annotate manually the macro and micro features of the dance videos by the dance experts. As MPEG-7 has reached a matured state for the description of the multimedia structure and semantics through the Descriptors and Description Schemes, DanVideo generates a MPEG-7 instance that conforms to the MPEG-7 schema, semi-automatically and effortlessly from the dance annotations.
