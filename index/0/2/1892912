In this paper we describe an event-driven data collection facility, and a general-purpose program to perform a set of analyses on the collected data. There are several features which distinguish this facility from others. First, the system being monitored is a network of loosely-coupled computers. Although there are just two computers in the network, the facility could be readily extended to larger networks. Second, the main purpose of the facility is to monitor the execution of interactive graphics application programs whose processing and data are distributed between the network's computers. Third, the data collector and analyzer are readily extendible to treat new kinds of data. This is accomplished by a data and event independent collector, and a table-driven data analyzer.
