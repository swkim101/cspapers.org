We describe a simple variant of the interpolated Markov model with non-emitting state transitions and prove that it is strictly more powerful than any Markov model. Empirical results demonstrate that the non-emitting model outperforms the interpolated model on the Brown corpus and on the Wall Street Journal under a wide range of experimental conditions. The non-emitting model is also much less prone to overtraining.
