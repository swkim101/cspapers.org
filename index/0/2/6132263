This paper presents a new method for image compression by neural networks. First, we show that we can use neural networks in a pyramidal framework, yielding the so-called PCA pyramids. Then we present an image compression method based on the PCA pyramid, which is similar to the Laplace pyramid and wavelet transform. Some experimental results with real images are reported. Finally, we present a method to combine the quantization step with the learning of the PCA pyramid.
