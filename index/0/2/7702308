Running efficiency is an important factor to consider in order to avoid injury. In particular, foot pronation, the angle of the foot as it hits the ground, is a common cause for many types of injuries among runners. Though pronation is common, diagnosing pronation is difficult and imprecise. Currently there is no method of diagonsis which can quantify the severity of pronation. In this paper we propose using WISP (Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform) sensors to help identify and quantify foot pronation.
