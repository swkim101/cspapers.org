With the increasing cost of developing robust HPC software, precise data-flow analysis for MPI programs -- the mainstay of HPC programming -- are essential. The knowledge of communication is essential for precise data-flow analysis and the difficulty of statically determining it makes the conventional techniques insufficient. Hybrid methods combining static and dynamic techniques are needed and in this work we demonstrate one such approach in building the parallel control-flow graph which can then be used to leverage the precision of data-flow analyses for MPI programs.
