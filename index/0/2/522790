There are many applications where robots have to operate in environments that other agents can change. In such cases, it is desirable for the robot to achieve a given high-level task despite interference. Ideally, the robot must decide its next action as it observes the changes in the world, i.e. act reactively. In this paper, we consider a reactive planning problem for finite robotic tasks with resource constraints. The task is represented using a temporal logic for finite behaviors and the robot must achieve the task using limited resources under all possible finite sequences of moves of other agents. We present a formulation for this problem and an approach based on quantitative games. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through a manipulation case study.
