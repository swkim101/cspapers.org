Problems may consist of constraints distributed among several agents. Some problems are naturally distributed. Others were originally centralized but the distribution is expected to help for their resolution. Among naturally distributed problems we focus on those where the distribution is reinforced by privacy requirements. Privacy, robustness against timing variations and robustness against hard failures are improved by asynchronism. The tractability of centralized problems can often be ameliorated using abstractions. No sustained research work for integrating abstraction schemas in asynchronous search has been done. The existing techniques suffered from the reduced propagation In this work we show how a high degree of asynchronism in search can accommodate abstraction schemas for distributed problems. Three abstraction techniques, as well as possible extensions are discussed in the framework of asynchronous complete distributed techniques with polynomial space requirements and asynchronous maintenance of consistency with asynchronous reordering. The new framework can deal even with “continuous” domains for numerical constraints.
