We propose an architecture of four complimentary technologies increasingly relevant to a growing number of home users and organizations: cryptography, separation kernels, formal verification, and rapidly improving techniques relevant to software defect density estimation. Cryptographic separation protects information in transmission and storage. Formally proven properties of separation kernel based secure virtualization can bound risk for information in processing. Then, within each strongly separated domain, risk can be measured as a function of people and technology within that domain. Where hardware, software, and their interactions are proven to behave as and only as desired under all circumstances, such hardware and software can be considered to not substantially increase risk. Where the size or complexity of software is beyond such formal proofs, we discuss estimating risk related to software defect densities, and emerging work related to binary analysis with potential for improving software defect density estimation.
