Many parallel programs are written in SPMD style i.e. by running the same sequential program on all processes. SPMD programs include synchronization, but it is easy to write incorrect synchronization patterns. We propose a system that verifies a program's synchronization pattern. We also propose language features to make the synchronization pattern more explicit and easily checked. We have implemented a prototype of our system for Split-C and successfully verified the synchronization structure of realistic programs.
