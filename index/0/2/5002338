This workshop showcases an engaging way to attract students who typically avoid a traditional introductory Computer Science course (CS1), with fully developed, classroom-tested course materials. This workshop has been successful at SIGCSE and other venues in the past. This year we highlight our successful approach in pre-AP courses, as well as continued refinement of curriculum for college-level CS1. Our courses focus on essential CS1 principles, but show applications of these principles with contemporary, diverse examples of computing in a modern context, including advanced areas typically not accessible in CS1 such as: physics-based simulations, fractals and L-systems, image processing, emergent systems, cellular automata and data visualization. Students produce dynamic visual work using the programming language Processing, which is fully compatible with Java. We aim to inspire the Computer Science community to use innovative and creative approaches to attract a broader audience to their classes. Participants will be introduced to the Processing language as well as its lightweight IDE through a series of on-the-fly coding examples. Additionally, course materials and handouts detailing the software, curricula and teaching resources will be given to the participants. Instructors of all levels are welcome; high school computer science teachers are particularly encouraged to attend. All participants will need to bring their own laptops.
