In this paper, we show how traditional physical interface components such as switches, levers, knobs and touch screens can be easily modified to identify who is activating each control. This allows us to change the function per-formed by the control, and the sensory feedback provided by the control itself, dependent upon the user. An auditing function is also available that logs each user's actions. We describe a number of example usage scenarios for our tech-nique, and present two sample implementations.
