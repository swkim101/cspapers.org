A parameter called as distance degradation (dd) has been proposed for the nonlinearity of HPA (High Power Amplifier) in M-QAM (M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) systems and some empirical fomulae using this parameter to calculate approximately the signal-to-noise degradation (SNRD) caused by nonlinear transmit HPA and the optimum additional phase shift (OAPS) of the carrier at the receiver for compensating the effect of the nonlinear distortion in 16- and 64-QAM systems have been found. The usability of dd as well as the influence of pulse shaping on the SNRD in 256-QAM systems are presented in this paper for 256-QAM.
