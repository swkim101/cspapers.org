S = 5 x,. y,., has been identified as the chief culprit in i=l many numerical problems where the cumulative loss of information due to rounding and “catastrophic cancellation” may yield results which are accurate to only one or two decimal places despite having been computed to as much as 16-digit precision. The symposium edited by Kulisch and Miranker (19831 argues convincingly that an optimal inner product is necessary, and in many cases sufficient (assuming intelligent programming of the rest of the application) to guarantee reliable results in many numerical codes.
