<i>In this paper we show an equivalence relationship between additively weighted Voronoi cells in R<sup>d</sup>, power diagrams in R<sup>d</sup> and convex hulls of spheres in R<sup>d</sup>. An immediate consequence of this equivalence relationship is a tight bound on the complexity of: (1) a single additively weighted Voronoi cell in dimension d; (2) the convex hull of a set of d-dimensional spheres. In particular, given a set of n spheres in dimension d, we show that the worst case complexity of both a single additively weighted Voronoi cell and the convex hull of the set of spheres is Î˜</i>(<i>n</i><sup>[<i>d</i>/2]</sup>). <i>The equivalence between additively weighted Voronoi cells and convex hulls of spheres permits us to compute a single additively weighted Voronoi cel1 in dimension d in worst case optimal time</i> <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>+<i>n</i><sup>[<i>d</i>/2]</sup>).
