Important nodes are individuals who have huge influence on social network. Finding important nodes in social networks is of great significance for research on the structure of the social networks. Based on the core idea of Pagerank, a new ranking method is proposed by considering the link similarity between the nodes. The key concept of the method is the use of the link vector which records the contact times between nodes. Then the link similarity is computed based on the vectors through the similarity function. The proposed method incorporates the link similarity into original Pagerank. The experiment results show that the proposed method can get better performance.
