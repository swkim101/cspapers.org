Over the last two decades or so, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has developed powerful methods for low-level syntactic and semantic text processing tasks such as parsing, semantic role labeling, and text categorization. Over the same period, the fields of machine learning and probabilistic reasoning have yielded important breakthroughs as well. It is now time to investigate how to leverage these advances to understand text.
