In this paper we consider modeling data lying on multiple continuous manifolds. In particular, we model the shape manifold of a person performing a motion observed from different view points along a view circle at fixed camera height. We introduce a model that ties together the body configuration (kinematics) manifold and the visual manifold (observations) in a way that facilitates tracking the 3D configuration with continuous relative view variability. The model exploits the low dimensionality nature of both the body configuration manifold and the view manifold where each of them are represented separately.
