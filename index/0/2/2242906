Non-linear error minimization methods became widespread approaches for solving the simultaneous localization and mapping problem. If the initial guess is far away from the global minimum, converging to the correct solution and not to a local one can be challenging and sometimes even impossible. This paper presents an experimental analysis of dynamic covariance scaling, a recently proposed method for robust optimization of SLAM graphs, in the context of a poor initialization. Our evaluation shows that dynamic covariance scaling is able to mitigate the effects of poor initializations. In contrast to other methods that first aim at finding a good initial guess to seed the optimization, our method is more elegant because it does not require an additional method for initialization. Furthermore, it can robustly handle data association outliers. Experiments performed with real world and simulated datasets show that dynamic covariance scaling outperforms existing methods, both in the presence and absence of data association outliers.
