Although many methods perform well in single camera tracking, multi-camera tracking remains a challenging problem with less attention. DukeMTMC is a large-scale, well-annotated multi-camera tracking benchmark which makes great progress in this field. This report is dedicated to briefly introduce our method on DukeMTMC and show that simple hierarchical clustering with well-trained person re-identification features can get good results on this dataset.
