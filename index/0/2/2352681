In this paper we discuss the need for corpora with a variety of annotations to provide suitable resources to evaluate different Natural Language Processing systems and to compare them. A supervised machine learning technique is presented for translating corpora between syntactic formalisms and is applied to the task of translating the Penn Treebank annotation into a Categorial Grammar annotation. It is compared with a current alternative approach and results indicate annotation of broader coverage using a more compact grammar.
