We present a method for the fast 3D face reconstruction of people wearing glasses. Our method explicitly and robustly models the case in which a face to be reconstructed is partially occluded by glasses. We propose a simple and generic model for glasses that copes with a wide variety of different shapes, colors and styles, without the need for any database or learning. Our algorithm is simple, fast and requires only small amounts of both memory and runtime resources, allowing for a fast interactive 3D reconstruction on commodity mobile phones. The thorough evaluation of our approach on synthetic and real data demonstrates superior reconstruction results due to the explicit modeling of glasses.
