We have developed an underwater vehicle that offers significant performance improvements over existing subsea elevators. Our Vertical Glider Robot falls under its own weight to a precise location on the seafloor, employing streamlining, active steering, and basic navigation instrumentation. We examine typical at-sea mission requirements, mention several key governing parameters, and outline our design approach. We then describe a prototype device, and present results from model-scale experiments.
