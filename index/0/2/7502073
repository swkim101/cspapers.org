We show how to compute the edit distance between two strings of length n up to a factor of 2<sup>(O-tilde(sqrt(log n)))</sup> in n<sup>(1+o(1))</sup> time. This is the first sub-polynomial approximation algorithm for this problem that runs in near-linear time, improving on the state-of-the-art n<sup>(1/3+o(1))</sup> approximation. Previously, approximation of 2<sup>Õ √log n)</sup> was known only for embedding edit distance into l<sub>1</sub>, and it is not known if that embedding can be computed in less than a quadratic time.
