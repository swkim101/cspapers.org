Emerging highly-parallel and big data applications have renewed the research interest in Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architectures. However, moving powerful processing unit into the CMOS-incompatible DRAM chips is not cost-effective for large capacity memory. In this work, we observe that Non-Volatile Memory is often naturally incorporated with basic logics like Data Comparison Write or Flip-n-Write modules that are essential for cell SET/REST operation. In contrast to other conventional PIM or Near Data Computing (NDC) architectures, ProPRAM, as a typical Active NVM, abandons the design approach of moving accelerators or customized processors into memory devices, but begins with exploiting the existing resources inside the memory chips to accelerate the key non-compute-intensive functions for emerging big data applications. With slight hardware and architectural modification, we succeed to expose the transparent peripheral logics to the application layer through instruction set extension and exploit them for in-field bulk data processing with limited hardware cost. Compared to conventional CPU-centric systems, ProPRAM achieves an excellent optimization on energy-efficiency (15Ã—) for important data-intensive micro-benchmarks and kernels.
