Robotic teleoperation constitutes a key technique for networked manufacturing system. Since Internet is noisy and performance of telerobotic systems strongly depends on communication conditions, control strategies which could be used to distribute computation and communication resource properly and require less data transmission are required. Motion description language (MDL) is an appropriate solution. In this paper, comparison study between MDL-based and the traditional direct control method under randomly varying time-delay condition has been pursued which show that the MDL-based method has the ability to guarantee the stability of the whole telerobotic system under randomly varying time-delay condition. Furthermore, MDL-based method provides an uniform mathematical description on discrete control on the master site and continuous execution on the slave site. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method is promising for Networked Manufacturing development.
