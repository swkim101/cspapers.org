The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) allows BGP routers to verify the origin AS of an IP prefix. In this demo, we present a software extension which performs prefix origin validation in the web browser of end users. The browser extension shows the RPKI validation outcome of the web server infrastructure for the requested web domain. It follows the common plug-in concepts and does not require special modifications of the browser software. It operates on live data and helps end users as well as operators to gain better insight into the Internet security landscape.
