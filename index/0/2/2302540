In order to facilitate and improve robots social acceptance, they must be equipped with behaviors similar to those of humans. It is therefore necessary to study and model the phenomenon to be reproduce. This paper studies and analyzes the physical parameters of the handshake in order to have its characteristic features (frequency, duration, strength, synchronization, etc.) used to model this interaction. Features that would later help to develop bio-inspired adaptive controllers, which will allow humanoid robots to better interact with humans according to simple social contexts.
