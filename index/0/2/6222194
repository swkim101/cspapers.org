Many and diverse combinatorial problems have been solved successfully using finite-domain constraint programming. However, to apply constraint programming to a particular domain, the problem must first be modelled as a constraint satisfaction or optimisation problem. Since constraints provide a rich language, typically many alternative models exist. Formulating a good model therefore requires a great deal of expertise. This paper describes CONJURE, a system that refines a specification of a problem in the abstract constraint specification language ESSENCE into a set of alternative constraint models. Refinement is compositional: alternative constraint models are generated by composing refinements of the components of the specification. Experimental results demonstrate that CONJURE is able to generate a variety of models for practical problems from their ESSENCE specifications.
