With ever increasing clock frequencies, accurate 3-D interconnect analysis in chips and packages is becoming a necessity. The retarded partial element equivalent circuit (rPEEC) method has been successfully applied to 3-D analysis but for large problems it becomes expensive in CPU and memory usage, and in time domain it sometimes has numerical problems. Complex frequency hopping (CFH), a new multi-point moment-matching technique, is expanded to handle retarded networks. CFH speeds up rPEEC frequency domain analysis of large frequency bands significantly. It also allows the efficient calculation of resonances and - most importantly - enables time domain modeling of rPEEC networks that have so far resisted analysis by any other method.
