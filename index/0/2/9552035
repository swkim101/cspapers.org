Reliability analysis of SRAM core-cells requires statistical methods with very high accuracy to cope with very low failure probabilities. Although new statistical methods have been recently proposed, to the best of our knowledge, there is no method able to evaluate the joint failure probability (the probability that at least one failure mechanism occurs) of an SRAM core-cell with enough accuracy in a reasonable time. We propose a statistical simulation method based on the analytical integration of the multivariate Gaussian distribution function.
