In this paper, we relate the iterative fabrication of a physical Bertin Matrix. Jacques Bertin designed and refined such devices over 10 years (1970–1980) and five iterations of what he called Dominos 1–5. For the purpose of an exhibit dedicated to Bertin's work during VIS 2014 in Paris, we designed an improved version of such device by leveraging modern fabrication possibilities and in particular a laser cutter. We describe the process, iterations and improvements of our matrix, and report lessons we learnt.
