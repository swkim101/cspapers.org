The importance of the new textual genres such as blogs or forum entries is growing in parallel with the evolution of the Social Web. This paper presents two corpora of blog posts in English and in Spanish, annotated according to the EmotiBlog annotation scheme. Furthermore, we created 20 factual and opinionated questions for each language and also the Gold Standard for their answers in the corpus. The purpose of our work is to study the challenges involved in a mixed fact and opinion question answering setting by comparing the performance of two Question Answering (QA) systems as far as mixed opinion and factual setting is concerned. The first one is open domain, while the second one is opinion-oriented. We evaluate separately the two systems in both languages and propose possible solutions to improve QA systems that have to process mixed questions.
