Regression problems assume every instanceisannotated(labeled)witharealvalue, aformof annotation we call strong guidance. In order for these annotations to be accurate, they must be the result of a precise experiment or measurement. However, in some cases additional weak guidance might be given by imprecise measurements, a domain expert or even crowd sourcing. Current formulations of regression are unable to use both types of guidance. We propose a regression framework that can also incorporate weak guidance based on relative orderings, bounds, neighboring and similarity relations. Consider learning to predict ages from portrait images, these new types of guidanceallowweakerformsofguidancesuchasstating a person is in their 20s or two people are similar in age. These types of annotations can be easier to generate than strong guidance. We introduce a probabilistic formulation for these forms of weak guidance and show that the resulting optimization problems are convex. Our experimental results show the benefits of these formulations on several data sets.
