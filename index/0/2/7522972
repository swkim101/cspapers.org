We propose an approach to generate natural language questions from knowledge graphs such as DBpedia and YAGO. We stage this in the setting of a quiz game. Our approach, though, is general enough to be applicable in other settings. Given a topic of interest (e.g., Soccer) and a difficulty (e.g., hard), our approach selects a query answer, generates a SPARQL query having the answer as its sole result, before verbalizing the question.
