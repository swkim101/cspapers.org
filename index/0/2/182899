Blogs have become an important medium for people to express opinions and share information on the web. Predicting the interests of bloggers can be beneficial for information retrieval and knowledge discovery in the blogosphere. In this paper, we propose a two-layer classification model to categorize the interests of bloggers based on a set of short snippets collected from their blog posts. Experiments were conducted on a list of bloggers collected from blog directories, with their snippets collected from Google Blog Search. The results show that the proposed method is robust to errors in the lower level and achieve satisfactory performance in categorizing blogger's interests.
