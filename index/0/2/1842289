Programmable Logic Arrays (PLA) are finding increasing use as a cost-effective means to utilize LSI electronics. In this paper, three classes of faults, namely stuck faults, shorts and cross-point defects are defined and characterized in a PLA. The relationship between the test sets and their faults among all three classes are discussed. Finally, an algorithm for generating a test set for all three classes of faults is presented.
