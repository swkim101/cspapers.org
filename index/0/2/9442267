Replicating data across multiple data centers allows using data closer to the client, reducing latency for applications, and increases the availability in the event of a data center failure. MDCC (Multi-Data Center Consistency) is an optimistic commit protocol for geo-replicated transactions, that does not require a master or static partitioning, and is strongly consistent at a cost similar to eventually consistent protocols. MDCC takes advantage of Generalized Paxos for transaction processing and exploits commutative updates with value constraints in a quorum-based system. Our experiments show that MDCC outperforms existing synchronous transactional replication protocols, such as Megastore, by requiring only a single message round-trip in the normal operational case independent of the master-location and by scaling linearly with the number of machines as long as transaction conflict rates permit.
