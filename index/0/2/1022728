The workspace of a robotic system is characterized to determine the actuator inputs required to achieve a desired level of dynamic performance over a chosen percentage of configurations. The dynamic capability equations (DCE) allow designers to predict the dynamic performance of a robotic system for a particular configuration and reference point on the end-effector (i.e.,point design). Here the DCE are used in conjunction with a reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) strategy in order to obtain designs that can meet dynamic performance requirements. The method is illustrated on a robot design problem.
