This paper reports on our experience in achieving reusability and using component-based software engineering in the Algorithma 99 (Algorithm Animation) Project. We show how we extended and reused Algorithma 98 [2] into Algorithma 99 and how we prepared Algorithma 99 to be reused in Algorithma 2000 (to be implemented in Winter 2000). Component-based software engineering is not only confined to binary components, such as COM and CORBA, but is also applicable to software processes, architectures and design, and object-oriented libraries.
