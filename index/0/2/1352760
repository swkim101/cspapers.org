We consider the problem of information retrieval evaluation and the methods and metrics used for such evaluations. We propose a probabilistic framework for evaluation which we use to develop new information-theoretic evaluation metrics. We demonstrate that these new metrics are powerful and generalizable, enabling evaluations heretofore not possible. We introduce four preliminary uses of our framework: (1) a measure of conditional rank correlation, information tau, a powerful meta-evaluation tool whose use we demonstrate on understanding novelty and diversity evaluation; (2) a new evaluation measure, relevance information correlation, which is correlated with traditional evaluation measures and can be used to (3) evaluate a collection of systems simultaneously, which provides a natural upper bound on metasearch performance; and (4) a measure of the similarity between rankers on judged documents, information difference, which allows us to determine whether systems with similar performance are in fact different.
