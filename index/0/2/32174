Smartphone sensing for large data set collection of potholes is useful for monitoring transportation system intelligently. Collecting large data set of different information sources such as frequency of taking brakes, honks, potholes,black-spots etc becomes gigantic task by manual method. We have developed smartphone sensing based method which uses crowdsourcing to collect real large data set of pothole data from the field. In this work the method to locate and sense potholes using sensors in smartphones is discussed along with its implimentation results.We have shown how we have used crowdsourcing techniques to collect large data set on potholes efficiently using sensors available in smartphones and processing the data obtained as required for our purpose.
