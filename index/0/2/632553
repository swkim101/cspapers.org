Wireless data broadcast is an efficient and scalable means to provide information access for a large population of clients in mobile environments. With Location-Based Services (LBSs) deployed upon a broadcast channel, mobile clients can collect data from the channel to answer their location-dependent spatial queries (LDSQs). Since the results of LDSQs would become invalid when mobile client moves to new locations, the knowledge of valid scopes for LDSQ results is necessary to assist clients to determine if their previous LDSQ results can be reused after they moved. This effectively improves query response time and client energy consumption. In this paper, we devise efficient algorithms to determine valid scopes for various LDSQs including range, window and nearest neighbor queries along with LDSQ processing over a broadcast channel. We conduct an extensive set of experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms. While the proposed valid scope algorithm incurs only little extra processing overhead, unnecessary LDSQ reevaluation is significantly eliminated, thus providing faster query response and saving client energy.
