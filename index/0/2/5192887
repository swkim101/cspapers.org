Two new geometrical algorithms for design centering are presented. In each case, the feasible region is first approximated by a convex polytope. The first algorithm inscribes the largest Hessian ellipsoid within the approximating polytope. The second assumes Gaussian parameter distributions, formulates the problem as a convex programming problem, and uses an efficient algorithm to perform the optimization.
