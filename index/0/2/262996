We de(cid:12)ne and describe the related problems of new event detection and event tracking within a stream of broadcast news stories. We focus on a strict on-line setting|i.e., the system must make decisions about one story before looking at any subsequent stories. Our approach to detection uses a single pass clustering algo-rithm and a novel thresholding model that incorporates the properties of events as a major component. Our approach to tracking is similar to typical information (cid:12)lter-ing methods. We discuss the value of \surprising" features that have unusual occurrence characteristics, and brie(cid:13)y explore on-line adaptive (cid:12)ltering to handle evolving events in the news. New event detection and event tracking are part of the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) initiative.
