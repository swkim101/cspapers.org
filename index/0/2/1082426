Data uncertainty is inherent in emerging applications such as location-based services, sensor monitoring systems, and data integration. To handle a large amount of imprecise information, uncertain databases have been recently developed. In this paper, we study how to efficiently discover frequent itemsets from large uncertain databases, interpreted under the Possible World Semantics. This is technically challenging, since an uncertain database induces an exponential number of possible worlds. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method to capture the itemset mining process as a Poisson binomial distribution. This model-based approach extracts frequent itemsets with a high degree of accuracy, and supports large databases. We apply our techniques to improve the performance of the algorithms for: (1) finding itemsets whose frequentness probabilities are larger than some threshold; and (2) mining itemsets with the k highest frequentness probabilities. Our approaches support both tuple and attribute uncertainty models, which are commonly used to represent uncertain databases. Extensive evaluation on real and synthetic datasets shows that our methods are highly accurate. Moreover, they are orders of magnitudes faster than previous approaches.
