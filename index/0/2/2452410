Today, most popular software applications are deployed in the cloud, interact with many users, and run on multiple platforms from Web browsers to mobile operating systems. While these applications confer a number of benefits to their users, building them brings many challenges: manually managing state between asynchronous user actions, creating and maintaining separate code bases for each desired client platform and gracefully scaling to handle a large number of concurrent users. Dog is a new programming language that provides a solution to these challenges and others through a unique runtime model that allows developers to model scalable cross-client applications as an imperative control-flow --- simplifying many development tasks. In this paper we describe the key features of Dog and show its utility through several applications that are difficult and time-consuming to write in existing languages, but are simple and easily written in Dog in a few lines of code.
