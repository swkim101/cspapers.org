For fine-grained sentiment analysis, we need to go beyond zero-one polarity and find a way to compare adjectives that share a common semantic property. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised approach to assign intensity levels to adjectives, viz. high, medium and low, where adjectives are compared when they belong to the same semantic category. For example, in the semantic category of EXPERTISE, expert, experienced and familiar are respectively of level high, medium and low. We obtain an overall accuracy of 77% for intensity assignment. We show the significance of considering intensity information of adjectives in predicting star-rating of reviews. Our intensity based prediction system results in an accuracy of 59% for a 5-star rated movie review corpus.
