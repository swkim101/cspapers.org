The pyloric Central Pattern Generator of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion is a well-defined biological neural network. This 14-neuron network is modulated by many inputs. These inputs reconfigure the network to produce multiple output patterns by three simple mechanisms: 1) determining which cells are active; 2) modulating the synaptic efficacy; 3) changing the intrinsic response properties of individual neurons. The importance of modifiable intrinsic response properties of neurons for network function and modulation is discussed.
