We present a novel method for analyzing reflections on arbitrary surfaces. We model reflections using a broader than usual class of imaging models, which include both perspective and multiperspective camera types. We provide an analytical framework to locally model reflections as specific multiperspective cameras around every ray based on a new theory of general linear cameras. Our framework better characterizes the complicated image distortions seen on irregular mirror surfaces as well as the conventional catadioptric mirrors. We show the connection between multiperspective camera models and caustic surfaces of reflections and demonstrate how they reveal important surface rulings of the caustics. Finally, we show how to use our analysis to assist mirror design and characterize distortions seen in catadioptric imaging systems.
