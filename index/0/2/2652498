A vision-controlled robot conveyor tracking system is presented here. The vision system utilizes a constant in-time sensing field. In its normal mode of operation, this system takes a picture, analyses the image, recognises the object, extracts position information from it. Utilising this information along with the velocity information from the conveyor belt, the robot maneuvers to track and grasp the recognised object.<<ETX>>
