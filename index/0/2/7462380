In the present position paper, I formulate some (in part critical) remarks related to some techniques which are successfully used in contemporary live dense reconstruction approaches. Main issues are feature based correspondence vs. image-based matching, the generalization of the brightness constancy assumption, and the handling of featureless regions which do not allow direct determination of correspondence.
