Many problems for beginning programming students relate to program comprehension, that is, the ability to conceptualize the abstraction of a given algorithm with the flow of the program code. PS was developed to aid in this conceptualization process by providing the student a means to observe program execution via simulation. Program functions built into PS allow the user to halt or adjust the execution speed, switch to another algorithm, or prematurely exit the simulator. PS was programmed in the language C and implemented on a GIGI terminal. PS was designed with the idea that it be easy to reimplement on a microcomputer. The package was designed primarily as a demonstration tool for supplementing material presented in an algorithm course. The application of PS reported on here offers the student a choice of five sorting algorithms to view in two modes of execution and three execution speeds. The system has not yet been evaluated in a classroom setting.
