An LR-based parser generator for arbitrary context-free grammars is described, which generates parsers by need and processes grammar modifications by updating already existing parsers. We motivate the need for these techniques in the context of interactive language definition environments, present all required algorithms, and give measurements comparing their performance with that of conventional techniques.
