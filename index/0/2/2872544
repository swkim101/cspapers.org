We offer the first large-scale analysis of Web traffic based on network flow data. Using data collected on the Internet2 network, we constructed a weighted bipartite client-server host graph containing more than 18 x 106 vertices and 68 x 106 edges valued by relative traffic flows. When considered as a traffic map of the World-Wide Web, the generated graph provides valuable information on the statistical patterns that characterize the global information flow on the Web. Statistical analysis shows that client-server connections and traffic flows exhibit heavy-tailed probability distributions lacking any typical scale. In particular, the absence of an intrinsic average in some of the distributions implies the absence of a prototypical scale appropriate for server design, Web-centric network design, or traffic modeling. The inspection of the amount of traffic handled by clients and servers and their number of connections highlights non-trivial correlations between information flow and patterns of connectivity as well as the presence of anomalous statistical patterns related to the behavior of users on the Web. The results presented here may impact considerably the modeling, scalability analysis, and behavioral study of Web applications.
