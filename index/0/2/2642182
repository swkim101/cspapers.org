We present an evaluation of mudibo, a prototype system for determining the position of dialog boxes in a multiple-monitor system. The analysis shows that, when compared to a standard approach, mudibo offered a 24% decrease in time needed to begin interaction in a dialog box. Analysis of participant behavior in the evaluation provides insight into the way users perceive and act in multiple-monitor environments. Specifically, the notion of consistency changes for multiple-monitor systems and the prospect of adaptive algorithms becomes further complicated and intricate, especially for window management.
