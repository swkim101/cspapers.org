This paper reports on a study of semantic role tagging in Chinese in the absence of a parser. We tackle the task by identifying the relevant headwords in a sentence as a first step to partially locate the corresponding constituents to be labelled. We also explore the effect of data homogeneity by experimenting with a textbook corpus and a news corpus, representing simple data and complex data respectively. Results suggest that while the headword location method remains to be improved, the homogeneity between the training and testing data is important especially in view of the characteristic syntax-semantics interface in Chinese. We also plan to explore some class-based techniques for the task with reference to existing semantic lexicons, and to modify the method and augment the feature set with more linguistic input.
