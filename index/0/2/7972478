While sensor-enabled devices have greatly enriched human interactions in our daily life, discovering the essential knowledge behind sensing data is a critical issue to connect the cyber world and the physical world. This motivates us to design an innovative sensor-aided social network system, termed cyber-physical handshake. It allows two users to naturally exchange personal information with each other after detecting and authenticating the handshaking patterns between them. This work describes our design of detection and authentication mechanisms to achieve this purpose and our prototype system to facilitate handshake social behavior.
