Describes an interactive dynamic simulator for virtual environments which allows user interaction via a haptic interface. The interactive simulation is performed in our testbed dynamic simulator I-GMS (Interactive Generalized Motion Simulator), which has been developed in an object-oriented framework for simulating motions of free bodies and complex linkages such as those needed for robotic systems or human body simulation. User interaction is achieved by performing push and pull operations via the PHANToM haptic device which runs as on integrated part of I-GMS. We demonstrate the user interaction capability of I-GMS through online editing of trajectories for a 6-DOF robot manipulator.
