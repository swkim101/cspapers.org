Machine translation (MT) has recently been formulated in terms of constraint-based knowledge representation and unification theories, but it is becoming more and more evident that it is not possible to design a practical MT system without an adequate method of handling mismatches between semantic representations in the source and target languages. In this paper, we introduce the idea of "information-based" MT, which is considerably more flexible than interlingual MT or the conventional transfer-based MT.
