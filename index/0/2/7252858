The second conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work has provided focus on use of computers for supporting workers that are at various levels of geographic dispersion. The participants in this panel reported case studies at that conference on group work (1) in face-to-face meetings, (2) in the same building, and (3) distributed across a number of sites. Each panelist therefore brings insight about the communication needs of their research subjects and both the value and limitations of particular technologies for supporting the communication that ties the members of the groups together as geographic distance varies.
Each of the panelists will address the following two questions:What are the preferred types of communication (visual, written, spoken) for people working together at particular geographic distances?
What are the benefits and shortcomings of available technologies (video, electronic-mail, telephone/voice mail) for supporting these types of communication?
