Continuous media servers that provide support for the storage and retrieval of continuous media data (e.g., video, audio) at guaranteed rates are becoming increasingly important. Such servers, typically, rely on several disks to service a large number of clients, and are thus highly susceptible to disk failures. We have developed two fault-tolerant approaches that rely on admission control in order to meet rate guarantees for continuous media requests. The schemes enable data to be retrieved from disks at the required rate even if a certain disk were to fail. For both approaches, we present data placement strategies and admission control algorithms. We also present design techniques for maximizing the number of clients that can be supported by a continuous media server. Finally, through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our schemes.
