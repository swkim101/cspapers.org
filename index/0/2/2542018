This work describes an online application that uses Natural Language Generation (NLG) methods to generate walking directions in combination with dynamic 2D visualisation. We make use of third party resources, which provide for a given query (geographic) routes and landmarks along the way. We present a statistical model that can be used for generating natural language directions. This model is trained on a corpus of walking directions annotated with POS, grammatical information, frame-semantics and markup for temporal structure.
