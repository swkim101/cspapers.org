The first task controller that we have implemented simulates a herding task in which a group of virtual agents leave a central, static herd at random time intervals and must be collected and returned to the group by the physical agents. Since realistic herd simulations are not our main interest, the herding dynamics are greatly simplified by allowing a single physical agent to capture and herd any single loose virtual agent.
