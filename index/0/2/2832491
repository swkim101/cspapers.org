TCP performance degrades significantly in mobile ad hoc networks because most of packet losses occur as a result of route failures. Prior work proposed to provide link failure feedback to TCP so that TCP can avoid responding to route failures as if congestion had occurred. However, after a link failure is detected, several packets will be dropped from the network interface queue; TCP will time out because of these losses. It will also time out for ACK losses caused by route failures. In this paper, we propose to make routing protocols aware of lost data packets and ACKs and help reduce TCP timeouts for mobility-induced losses. Toward this end, we present two mechanisms: early packet loss notification (EPLN) and best-effort ACK delivery (BEAD). EPLN seeks to notify TCP senders about lost data packets. For lost ACKs, BEAD attempts to retransmit ACKs at either intermediate nodes or TCP receivers. Both mechanisms extensively use cached routes, without initiating route discoveries at any intermediate node. We evaluate TCP-ELFN enhanced with the two mechanisms using two caching strategies for DSR, path caches and a distributed cache update algorithm proposed in our prior work. We show that TCP-ELFN with EPLN and BEAD significantly outperforms TCP-ELFN under both caching strategies. We conclude that cross-layer information awareness is key to making TCP efficient in the presence of mobility.
