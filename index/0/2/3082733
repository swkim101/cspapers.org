Embedded systems, with their tight technology integration, and multiple requirements and stakeholders, are characterized by tightly interrelated processes, information and tools. Embedded systems will as a consequence be described by multiple, heterogeneous and interrelated descriptions such as for example requirements documents, design and analysis models, software and hardware descriptions. We refer to a system designed this way as a multi-view (MV) system. The main contribution of this paper is a characterization of model-based approaches to MV systems. The characterization takes three main perspectives for the relations between viewpoints: semantic relations (content), relations over time (process), and manipulation of views (operations). We complement these perspectives by investigating MV system challenges and by a survey of related approaches. The characterization aims to provide a basis for a better understanding, design and implementation of MV systems, and thereby to overcome the current fragmented points of view on integrated multi-view modeling (MVM).
