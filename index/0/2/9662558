Some recent memory technologies, including phase change memory (PCM), have lifetime reliabilities that are affected by write operations. We propose the use of coset coding to extend the lifetimes of these memories. The key idea of coset coding is that it performs a one-to-many mapping from each dataword to a coset of vectors, and having multiple possible vectors provides the flexibility to choose the vector to write that optimizes lifetime. Our technique, FlipMin, uses coset coding and, for each write, selects the vector that minimizes the number of bits that must flip. We also show how FlipMin can be synergistically combined with the ability to tolerate bit erasures. Thus, our techniques help to prevent bits from wearing out and can then tolerate those bits that do wear out.
