This poster presents Condorcet, a domain-specific prototype indexing system for tens of thousands of documents covering two scientific domains: engineering ceramics and epilepsy. The development corpus consists of 300 documents taken from one year volumes of two scientific journals. Condorcet takes a controlled-term approach to indexing: title and abstract of a document are mapped to concepts and relations, defined in modern versions of classical thesauri, i.e. structured ontologies. The index process makes intensive use of linguistic knowledge. The poster focuses on the linguistic principles that form the conceptual basis of the index process.
