In this paper we study the problem of synthesizing correct-by-construction Behavior Trees (BTs) controlling agents in adversarial environments. The proposed approach combines the modularity and reactivity of BTs with the formal guarantees of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) methods. Given a set of admissible environment specifications, an agent model in form of a Finite Transition System and the desired task in form of an LTL formula, we synthesize a BT in polynomial time, that is guaranteed to correctly execute the desired task. To illustrate the approach, we present three examples of increasing complexity.
