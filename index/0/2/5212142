The Ada programming language is an excellent vehicle for teaching concurrent programming because support for concurrency has been designed into the language. The paper shows how primitives from other concurrent programming languages (occam, Linda, Joyce) can be simulated within Ada. This enables students to study other constructs without the overhead of learning a new language and programming environment. The simulations use inheritance which was introduced into the new Ada 95 standard. They can also be used as examples of inheritance when teaching object-oriented programming.
