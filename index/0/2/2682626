Problems related to the evaluation of computational speeds of supercomputers are discussed. Measurements of sequential speeds, vector speeds, and asynchronous parallel processing speeds are presented. A simple model is developed that allows us to evaluate the workload-dependent effective speed of current systems such as vector computers and asynchronous parallel processing systems. Results indicate that the effective speed of a supercomputer is severely limited by its slowest processing mode unless the fraction of the workload that has to be processed in this mode is negligibly small.
