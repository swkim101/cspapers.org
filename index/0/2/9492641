Our project is part of the Adventures in Alice Programming project at Duke University. In particular, our project is integrating computer science into middle school math using Alice. We show several ways for students to improve their math skills while engaging their interest in programming. First, we have created Alice worlds for students to interact with to practice math concepts. Second, we have created tutorials to guide students on building such worlds. Third, we have created short challenge problems for students to focus on the math and the programming statements to complete a mostly built world. To encourage the use of Alice with projects we have developed many sample math projects. To encourage teachers to use Alice with math and computer science, we have been mapping our free curriculum materials to both the Commmon Core Math standards and the CSTA CS standards. Our curriculum materials are available at www.cs.duke.edu/csed/alice/aliceInSchools
