In this paper we apply the cryptographic flnite state machine approach as introduced in (1) to the design of symmetric key block ci- phers. Key words in the design approach are simplicity, uniformity, par- allelism, distributed nonlinearity and high difiusion. 3-Way is a block cipher with a block and key length of 96 bits. Key components in the construction of 3-Way are a 3-bit nonlinear S-box and a linear mapping that can be described by modular polynomial multiplication in Z Z 12 . The arrangement of the components allows software implementations in the range of 10 Mbit/s on a modern PC and dedicated hardware implemen- tations above 1 Gbit/s using standard technology (1:2" CMOS). The cipher structure of 3-Way is shown to be surprisingly strong with respect to both linear and difierential cryptanalysis.
