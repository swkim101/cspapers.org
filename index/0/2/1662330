Unsupervised or unlabeled learning approaches for network anomaly detection have been recently proposed. In particular, recent work on unlabeled anomaly detection focused on high speed classification based on simple payload statistics. For example, PAYL, an anomaly IDS, measures the occurrence frequency in the payload of n-grams. A simple model of normal traffic is then constructed according to this description of the packets' content. It has been demonstrated that anomaly detectors based on payload statistics can be "evaded" by mimicry attacks using byte substitution and padding techniques. In this paper we propose a new approach to construct high speed payload-based anomaly IDS intended to be accurate and hard to evade. We propose a new technique to extract the features from the payload. We use a feature clustering algorithm originally proposed for text classification problems to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. Accuracy and hardness of evasion are obtained by constructing our anomaly-based IDS using an ensemble of one-class SVM classifiers that work on different feature spaces.
