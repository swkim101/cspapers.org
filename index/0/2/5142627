How do experts navigate the huge space of implementations for a given specification to find an efficient choice with minimal searching? Answer: They use "heuristics" -- rules of thumb that are more street wisdom than scientific fact. We provide a scientific justification for Dense Linear Algebra (DLA) heuristics by showing that only a few decisions (out of many possible) are critical to performance; once these decisions are made, the die is cast and only relatively minor performance improvements are possible. The (implementation x performance) space of DLA is stair-stepped. Each stair is a set of implementations with very similar performance and (surprisingly) share key design decision(s). High-performance stairs align with heuristics that prescribe certain decisions in a particular context. Stairs also tell us how to tailor the search engine of a DLA code generator to reduce the time it needs to find implementations that are as good or better than those crafted by experts.
