We design and build ObliviStore, a high performance, distributed ORAM-based cloud data store secure in the malicious model. To the best of our knowledge, ObliviStore is the fastest ORAM implementation known to date, and is faster by 10X or more in comparison with the best known ORAM implementation. ObliviStore achieves high throughput by making I/O operations asynchronous. Asynchrony introduces security challenges, i.e., we must prevent information leakage not only through access patterns, but also through timing of I/O events. We propose various practical optimizations which are key to achieving high performance, as well as techniques for a data center to dynamically scale up a distributed ORAM. We show that with 11 trusted machines (each with a modern CPU), and 20 Solid State Drives, ObliviStore achieves a throughput of 31.5MB/s with a block size of 4KB.
