We study the problem of minimizing the time to accurately localize a target using radio-based telemetry. The directional nature of the antenna allows us to obtain bearing-to-target sensor measurements. There are two critical attributes that separate our setup from the majority of bearing-only tracking literature: sensing ambiguity and long measurement time. We provide a sensing strategy which mitigates the effect of ambiguity, and prove that the time required to localize a target is less than a constant times that of any bearing-based localization strategy which uses an Extended Kalman Filter.
