In this paper we describe the design and implementation of MuST, a multilingual information retrieval, summarization, and translation system. MuST integrates machine translation and other text processing services to enable users to perform cross-language information retrieval using available search services such as commercial Internet search engines. To handle non-standard languages, a new Internet indexing agent can be deployed, specialized local search services can be built, and shallow MT can be added to provide useful functionality. A case study of augmenting MuST with Indonesian is included. MuST adopts ubiquitous web browsers as its primary user interface, and provides tightly integrated automated shallow translation and user biased summarization to help users quickly judge the relevance of documents.
