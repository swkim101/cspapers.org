This paper investigates the parallax error, which is a common problem of many video-based monocular mobile gaze trackers. The parallax error is defined and described using the epipolar geometry in a stereo camera setup. The main parameters that change the error are introduced and it is shown how each parameter affects the error. The optimum distribution of the error (magnitude and direction) in the field of view varies for different applications. However, the results can be used for finding the optimum parameters that are needed for designing a head-mounted gaze tracker. It has been shown that the difference between the visual and optical axes does not have a significant effect on the parallax error, and the epipolar geometry can be used for describing the parallax error in the HMGT.
