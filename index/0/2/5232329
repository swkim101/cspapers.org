In this article, we present the kinematic calibration of H4 parallel robot using vision-based measuring device. Calibration is performed according to the inverse kinematic model method, using first the design model then a model developed for calibration purpose. With a precision of the order of magnitude of 0.2 mm and 0.03/spl deg/, our vision system allowed us to obtain a final positioning accuracy of the end-effector lower than 0.5 mm. Conclusions are given for the calibration of this class of mechanisms.
