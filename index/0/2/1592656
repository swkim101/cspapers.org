This paper presents experimental results of preliminary research into multi-robot coordination for construction tasks. Experiments demonstrate that an autonomous "roving eye" robot can provide feedback to a manipulator to align targets from a wider variety of situations than is possible with fixed cameras, without sacrificing the accuracy provided by cameras at close range. The roving eye changes its location autonomously based on current images of the manipulated object and target, always striving for the best view of the task.
