The ability to locate network bottlenecks along end-to-end paths on the Internet is of great interest to both network operators and researchers. For example, knowing where bottleneck links are, network operators can apply traffic engineering either at the interdomain or intradomain level to improve routing. Existing tools either fail to identify the location of bottlenecks, or generate a large amount of probing packets. In addition, they often require access to both end points. In this paper we present Pathneck, a tool that allows end users to efficiently and accurately locate the bottleneck link on an Internet path. Pathneck is based on a novel probing technique called Recursive Packet Train (RPT) and does not require access to the destination. We evaluate Pathneck using wide area Internet experiments and trace-driven emulation. In addition, we present the results of an extensive study on bottlenecks in the Internet using carefully selected, geographically diverse probing sources and destinations. We found that Pathneck can successfully detect bottlenecks for almost 80% of the Internet paths we probed. We also report our success in using the bottleneck location and bandwidth bounds provided by Pathneck to infer bottlenecks and to avoid bottlenecks in multihoming and overlay routing.
