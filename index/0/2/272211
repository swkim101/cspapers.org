Connecting people to required resources efficiently, effectively and promptly is one of the most important challenges for our society. Disasters make it the challenge for life and death. During disasters many normal sources of information to assess situations as well as distributing vital information to individuals break down. Unfortunately, during disastrous situations, most current practices are forced to follow bureaucratic processes and procedures that may delay help in critical life and death moments. Social media brings together different media as well as modes of distribution - focused, narrowcast, and broadcast -- and has revolutionized communication among people. Mobile phones, equipped with myriads of sensors are bringing the next generation of social networks not only to connect people with other people, but also to connect people with other people and essential life resources based on the disaster situation and personal context. We believe that such Social Life Networks (SLN) may play very important role for solving some essential human problems, including providing vital help to people during disasters. We will present early design of such systems and use a few examples of such systems explored in our group during disasters. Focused Micro Blogs (FMBs) will be discussed as an alternative to less noisy and more direct versions of current microblogs, such as Tweets and Status Updates. An important part of our discussion will be to list challenges and opportunities in this area.
