In this paper we consider deformable objects in haptic simulations. The physical simulation that drives haptic perception requires a good dynamic behavior. The inputs of the deformable model come from the treatment of the collision. We propose to focus on the contact restitution between deformable objects to guarantee "physical and perceptual realisms" of the haptic feedback. Signorini, in 1933, proposed a physical model of contact for deformable objects interacting with rigid static bodies (Signorini, S, 1933). This paper shows that the Signorini's model extents to contacts between two deformable objects using Gauss-Seidel resolution of complementarity problems. An interactive resolution of the overall formulation is presented and experienced on deformable objects using the finite linear-elements method.
