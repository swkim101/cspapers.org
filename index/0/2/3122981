This paper discusses the design and control methods of a thrust-vectored tailsitter that combines the advantages of both fixed wing and rotary wing systems. Separable takeoff bracket and controllable forward landing are implemented to reduce the flight weight and mitigate the effects of crosswinds. A six-degrees-of-freedom model especially for this tailsitter is then proposed to describe the dynamics of the whole system. Attitude representation based on horizontal /vertical Euler angles is presented to avoid the problem of singularity. Attitude and altitude controllers that switch between horizontal and vertical modes are used. In these controllers linear/constant acceleration approximation and filtered feed-forward acceleration algorithm are implemented. Effectiveness and reliability of the proposed control methods are demonstrated and evaluated by experimental results of the whole flight envelope.
