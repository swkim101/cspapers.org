The domain of inquiry of this research is the collection, organization, integration, distribution and consumption of knowledge derived from urban open data, and how it can be best offered to application cities' stakeholders through a software middleware. We argue that the extensive investigation proposed in this research will contribute to a growing body of knowledge about data integration and application in smart cities, and offer opportunities to re-think an integrated urban infrastructure.
