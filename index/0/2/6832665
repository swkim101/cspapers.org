With a growing awareness of the importance of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience (UX) Design and Research in industry, many departments are examining ways to integrate this topic into their curriculum. What are the best ways to do this? Should HCI and UX be integrated into existing courses such as event-driven programming or mobile computing? Or should it be a separate course that integrates visual design, psychology and ergonomics? How important is this topic to students looking for internships and entry-level jobs? At what levels should these topics be taught in the curriculum? This is important as there is a growing demand in industry for User Experience specialists due to an increased focus on software quality and product success. A major complaint of employers is that this skill is lacking in many college graduates. Teaching computing students how to incorporate UX into the design and development process helps to address this critical need. This BOF will let participants share their ideas and learn from their peers. Some of the discussion leaders led a similar lively and enthusiastic discussion at SIGCSE 2013. Discussion spanned the role of HCI in the participants? various curricula; modules versus dedicated courses; projects versus standalone assignments; and textbooks, tools, and other pedagogical materials. Bringing together new and previous participants will bring new insights and expansion of these, including discussions of our recent experiences and lessons learned, as well as the broaching of new topics such as the roles of non-computing courses in HCI education.
