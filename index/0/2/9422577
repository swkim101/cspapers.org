This study describes the design and implementation of several bioinspired algorithms for providing guidance to an ultra-lightweight micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) using a 2.6 g omnidirectional vision sensor. Using this visual guidance system we demonstrate autonomous speed control, centring, and heading stabilisation on board a 30 g MAV flying in a corridor-like environment. In addition to the computation of wide-field optic flow, the comparatively high-resolution omnidirectional imagery provided by this sensor also offers the potential for image-based algorithms such as landmark recognition to be implemented in the future.
