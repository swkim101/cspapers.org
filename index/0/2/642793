Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm aimed to offer users pay-per-use computing resources, while leaving the burden of managing the computing infrastructure to the cloud provider. We present a new programming and pricing model that gives the cloud user the flexibility of trading execution speed and price on a per-job basis. We discuss the scheduling and resource management challenges for the cloud provider that arise in the implementation of this model. We argue that techniques from real-time and embedded software can be useful in this context.
