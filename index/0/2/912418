The problem of specifying, constructing, and understanding specialized, limited inference systems arises in many areas of AI. As a first step towards solving this problem this paper recommends the development of an inference engine that is limited by its inability to chain together two pieces of a representation in order to derive a third. A method for using model theory to specify limited inference is introduced and then used to specify an inference engine via a three valued logic. This inference engine is proved to be the strongest one that does no chaining, modulo the way that it divides the representation into pieces. Thus, the specification captures the set of all inferences that require no chaining. This paper also surveys and compares a number of systems that do no chaining as well as some that allow only selected forms of chaining.
