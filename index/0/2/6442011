This paper presents the application of the Null-Space based Behavioral (NSB) approach to the motion control of a non-holonomic mobile robot with velocity saturated actuators. In particular, the proposed solution aims at managing actuator velocity saturations by dynamically scaling task velocity commands so that the hierarchy of task priorities is preserved in spite of actuator velocity saturations. The approach is tested on a specific case study where the NSB approach elaborates the motion directives for a mobile robot that has to reach a target while avoiding a punctual obstacle. The approach is validated by numerical simulations and by experimental results with a non-holonomic mobile robot.
