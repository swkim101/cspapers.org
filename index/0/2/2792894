Algorithms for Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems fall into two categories: distributed complete search (DisCS) and distributed local search (DisLS). The advantage of DisCS is that it guarantees to find a solution or proves problem infeasibility. DisCS is good at solving tight problems with complex constraints, but suffers from false commitments early in the search tree, leading to exhaustive search and redundant communication when exploring infeasible subproblem spaces. DisLS in comparison does not commit to assignments and is excellent at solving large problems with constraints of local scope. DisLS however, is incomplete and has difficulties to deal with tightly-/ overconstrained problems and complex constraints, where the algorithm often gets caught in infinite cycles without finding a solution or proving problem infeasibility. In this paper we combine a DisLS algorithm with a DisCS algorithm, and profit from their complementary advantages. We present a new, hybrid search scheme and show that it outperforms both methods.
