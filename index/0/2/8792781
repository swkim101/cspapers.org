This paper describes FrameNet (Lowe et al., 1997; Baker et al., 1998; Fillmore et al., 2002), an online lexical resource for English based on the principles of frame semantics (Fillmore, 1977a; Fillmore, 1982; Fillmore and Atkins, 1992), and considers the FrameNet database in reference to the proposed ISO model for linguistic annotation of language resources (ISO TC37 SC4 )(ISO, 2002; Ide and Romary, 2001b). We provide a data category specification for frame semantics and FrameNet annotations in an RDF-based language. More specifically, we provide a DAML+OIL markup for lexical units, defined as a relation between a lemma and a semantic frame, and frame-to-frame relations, namely Inheritance and Subframes. The paper includes simple examples of FrameNet annotated sentences in an XML/RDF format that references the project-specific data category specification.
