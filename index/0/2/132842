This paper describes a method of motion pattern generation for biped humanoid robot to walk like humans or walk with various kind of motions. To realize biped walking avoiding singularity at stretching leg, pattern generation uses predetermined knee joint trajectories. Reduction of DOF by predetermination is complemented by waist motion. The effectiveness of generated dynamic walking patterns is confirmed by using a 16-DOF biped robot WABIAN-2/LL.
