This paper presents a novel approach for human-robot cooperation in tasks with dynamic uncertainties. The essential element of the proposed method is a multi-modal interface that provides the robot with the feedback about the human motor behaviour in real-time. The human muscle activity measurements and the arm force manipulability properties encode the information about the motion and impedance, and the intended configuration of the task frame, respectively. Through this human-in-the-loop framework, the developed hybrid controller of the robot can adapt its actions to provide the desired motion and impedance regulation in different phases of the cooperative task. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach in a two-person sawing task that requires an appropriate complementary behaviour from the two agents.
