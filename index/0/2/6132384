Over the last several years, enrollments in Computer Science have been dropping and, at the same time, it has become increasingly important for students in other disciplines to become computer savvy, not merely computer literate. This combination of facts has led to the development of new kinds of introductory courses for non-majors that would enable them to be more expert at using computers in their own discipline and possibly entice them to become interested in pursuing a major or minor program in Computer Science or Information Science or Information Technology. Panelists will describe a range of courses that provide a variety of interesting alternatives for introducing computing.
