In the light of image retrieval evolving from text annotation to content-based and from standalone applications to web-based search engines, we foresee the need for deploying content-based image retrieval (CBIR) into Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture. By doing so, we not only distribute the tasks of feature extraction, indexing and storage of image data into peers, we also introduce another aspect of searching in addition to lename-based method in prevalent P2P applications. Through the deployment of DISCOVIR, we introduce a model to improve query eciency targeting on content-based search. Current P2P applications require installing special purpose software and proprietary protocols for information retrieval, which limit the number of audience. To make use of the WWW to increase popularity of P2P, we propose DISCOVIR Everywhere to bridge the two dieren t worlds, P2P and WWW. We outline the process of accessing DISCOVIR network through web browsers or mobile devices, by the coordination of a light weighted gateway, with reduced workload compared to existing methodology.
