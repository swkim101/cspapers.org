We present an accelerated proximity query algorithm between moving convex polyhedra. The algorithm combines Voronoi-based feature tracking with a multi-level-of-detail representation, in order to adapt to the variation in levels of coherence and speed up the computation. It provides a progressive refinement framework for collision detection and distance queries. We have implemented our algorithm and have observed significant performance improvements in our experiments, especially on scenarios where the coherence is low.
