Fully automated trading, such as e-procurement, using the Internet is virtually unheard of today. Three core technologies are needed to fully automate the trading process: data mining, intelligent trading agents and virtual institutions in which informed trading agents can trade securely both with each other and with human agents in a natural way. This paper describes a demonstrable prototype e-trading system that integrates these three technologies and is available on the World Wide Web. This is part of a larger project that aims to make informed automated trading a reality.
