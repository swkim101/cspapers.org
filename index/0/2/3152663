We motivate a prototyping platform for ad hoc networking research showing some requirements and constraints. The architecture of the BTnodes, each of which can store information, compute and communicate, is explained in conjunction with some demo applications that have been implemented. Important requirements and design trade-offs to be able to support multiple, compatible communication interfaces, to handle limited resources, for power-aware operation and for efficient testbed deployment are discussed.
