While looking in ecstasy at the new horizons of computer technology, developing countries often underestimate the computer's dependency upon man. Computers are unlike any other machine.
 Not unlike many developing countries, the vast petroleum and mineral resources of Saudi Arabia pose complex and challenging problems at all levels of education. The physical resources of the Kingdom far outstrip the human resources. For a country with some 3,000 college graduates as of 1975, the rapid technical and economic developments could easily become too burdensome.
 Saudi Arabia has few trained personnel for the development and management of modern computer systems, even though the first unit record equipment was installed by the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) in 1952. The requirements for data processing services has rapidly increased.
