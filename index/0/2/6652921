The intricacy of high performance computing applications has been growing very
 fast in the last years. Only skilled analysts are able to determine the factors that are undermining the performance of up-to-date applications. Analyst time is a very expensive resource and, for that reason, a strong effort to develop automatic performance analysis methodologies has been made by the scientific community. In this paper, we propose a methodology that is able to automatically detect the main performance problems of applications. This methodology is based on, first, a size reduction of the performance data obtained from the executions and, second, an analytical model obtained from this performance data which fits the speedup of the applications in terms of several parameters related to several performance issues. The paper also shows results obtained from real up-to-date applications and validates the conclusions automatically derived from the methodology.
