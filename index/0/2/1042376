In this paper we describe a new algorithm to prevent fault attacks on RSA signature algorithms using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT-RSA). This variant of the RSA signature algorithm is widely used on smartcards. Smartcards on the other hand are particularly susceptible to fault attacks like the one described in [7]. Recent results have shown that fault attacks are practical and easy to accomplish ([21], [17]).Therefore, they establish a practical need for fault attack protected CRT-RSA schemes. Starting from a careful derivation and classification of fault models, we describe a new variant of the CRT-RSA algorithm. For the most realistic fault model described, we rigorously analyze the success probability of an adversary against our new CRT-RSA algorithm. Thereby, we prove that our new algorithm is secure against the Bellcore attack.
