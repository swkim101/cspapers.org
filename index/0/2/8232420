In this paper we present several extensions of MARIE, a freely available N-gram-based statistical machine translation (SMT) decoder. The extensions mainly consist of the ability to accept and generate word graphs and the introduction of two new N-gram models in the loglinear combination of feature functions the decoder implements. Additionally, the decoder is enhanced with a caching strategy that reduces the number of N-gram calls improving the overall search efficiency. Experiments are carried out over the Eurpoean Parliament Spanish-English translation task.
