We present an efficient realization of the following interactive search engine feature: as the user is typing the query, words that are related to the last query word and that would lead to good hits are suggested, as well as selected such hits. The realization has three parts: (i) building clusters of related terms, (ii) adding this information as artificial words to the index such that (iii) the described feature reduces to an instance of prefix search and completion. An efficient solution for the latter is provided by the CompleteSearch engine, with which we have integrated the proposed feature. For building the clusters of related terms we propose a variant of latent semantic indexing that, unlike standard approaches, is completely transparent to the user. By experiments on two large test-collections, we demonstrate that the feature is provided at only a slight increase in query processing time and index size.
