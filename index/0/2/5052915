New techniques are described for some of the important computations in the automatic determination of image-to-database correspondences. In particular, a technique to predict a region in the image within which a feature is expected to appear, a set of techniques to verify feature matches, and a technique to extend the refinement process to include a new type of match based on linear features, such as roads, are discussed. These techniques are demonstrated in an example in which the system reduces the uncertainties from approximately plus or minus 200 feet on the ground to approximately plus or minus two feet.
