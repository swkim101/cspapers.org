To alleviate the error propagation in the traditional pipelined models for Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing, we formulate AMR parsing as a joint task that performs the two subtasks: concept identiﬁcation and relation identiﬁcation simultaneously. To this end, we ﬁrst develop a novel component-wise beam search algorithm for relation iden-tiﬁcation in an incremental fashion, and then incorporate the decoder into a uniﬁed framework based on multiple-beam search, which allows for the bi-directional information ﬂow between the two subtasks in a single incremental model. Experiments on the public datasets demonstrate that our joint model sig-niﬁcantly outperforms the previous pipelined counterparts, and also achieves better or comparable performance than other approaches to AMR parsing, without utilizing external semantic resources.
