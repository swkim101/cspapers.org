Numerous approaches have been proposed for path planning in dynamic current fields, for a fixed departure time. However, in many applications, the departure time is not necessarily known in advance, but can vary in a time window. In this context, the choice of a good departure time is a critical issue. That is why we introduce in this paper a new approach, called symbolic wavefront expansion, determining both the path and the departure time minimizing the travel time of the vehicle. The key idea of this approach is to propagate and compose functions instead of numerical values, with appropriate operators.
