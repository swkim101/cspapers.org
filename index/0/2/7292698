In this paper we argue that research into ubiquitous computing for sustainability must move its focus beyond designing for individual consumer behaviours. Urban grassroots food-growing communities offer opportunities to learn about the role of participation, community, citizenship and collective action, where sustainability encompasses environmental, social and economic factors. We report on fieldwork at an urban community farm in east London, and initial trial of the Talking Plants Sale prototype, to support the values of the farm.
