However, for fine-grained image classification, the contribution of context may vary over different images, and sometimes the context even confuses the classification result. To alleviate this problem, in our work, we develop a novel approach, two-stream contextualized Convolutional Neural Network, which provides a simple but efficient context-content joint classification model under deep learning framework. The network merely requires the raw image and a coarse segmentation as input to extract both content and context features without need of human interaction. Moreover, our network adopts a weighted fusion scheme to combine the content and the context classifiers, while a subnetwork is introduced to adaptively determine the weight for each image. According to our experiments on public datasets, our approach achieves considerable high recognition accuracy without any tedious human's involvements, as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.
