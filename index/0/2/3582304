This paper presents the modelling and the control architecture of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for Intervention (I-AUV). Autonomous underwater manipulation with free-floating base is still an open topic of research, far from reaching an industrial product. Dynamic manipulation tasks, where relevant vehicle velocities are required during manipulation, over an additional challenge. In this paper, the accurate modelling of an I-AUV is described, not neglecting the interaction with the fluid. A grasp planning strategy is proposed and integrated in the control of the whole system. The performances of the I-AUV have been analysed by means of simulations of a dynamic manipulation task.
