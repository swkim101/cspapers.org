With initiatives like CS Ed Week, Code.org, and the AP CS Principles course, many educators are designing new and engaging ways to introduce students to computer science. But are we doing a good enough job presenting computer science as a field? Is it sufficient for prospective students to understand that CS is about creativity, abstraction, data, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and impact? Or should they also learn something about computer architecture, operating systems, networking and security, programming languages, software engineering, database systems, and so forth? This BOF will discuss how survey courses can meet the learning objectives of AP CS Principles, while providing a wealth of content knowledge that maps directly to undergraduate computer science programs.
