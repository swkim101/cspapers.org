We handle a special category of Web queries, queries containing numeric terms. We call them numeric queries. Motivated by some issues in ranking of numeric queries, we detect numeric sensitive queries by mining from retrieved documents using phrase operator. We also propose features based on numeric terms by extracting reliable numeric terms for each document. Finally, a ranking model is trained for numeric sensitive queries, combining proposed numeric-related features and traditional features. Experiments show that our model can significantly improve relevance for numeric sensitive queries.
