This paper presents the EV2-Pen which leverages electrovibration technology and vibration technology in pen interaction. Electrovibration technology can produce multisensory feedback when the pen is in motion (sliding/moving on the screen), and vibration technology can provide vibrative feedback when the pen is stationary (pointing/resting on the screen). We conducted an experiment to investigate user performance with the EV2-Pen. The results indicated that the EV2-Pen outperformed the EV-Pen [18, 19] in pointing-steering tasks. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of the EV2-Pen, and explore some possible applications and scenarios.
