In recent years, many high-level synchronization constructs have been proposed. Each claims to satisfy criteria such as expressive power, ease of use, and modifiability. Because these terms are so imprecise, we have no good methods for evaluating how well these mechanisms actually meet such requirements. This paper presents a methodology for performing such an evaluation. Synchronization problems are categorized according to some basic properties, and this categorization is used in formulating more precise definitions of the criteria mentioned, and in devising techniques for assessing how well those criteria are met.
