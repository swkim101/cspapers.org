Popular online rental services such as Netflix and MoviePilot often manage household accounts. A household account is usually shared by various users who live in the same house, but in general does not provide a mechanism by which current active users are identified, and thus leads to considerable difficulties for making effective personalized recommendations. The identification of the active household members, defined as the discrimination of the users from a given household who are interacting with a system (e.g. an on-demand video service), is thus an interesting challenge for the recommender systems research community. In this paper, we formulate the above task as a classification problem, and address it by means of global and local feature selection methods and classifiers that only exploit time features from past item consumption records. The results obtained from a series of experiments on a real dataset show that some of the proposed methods are able to select relevant time features, which allow simple classifiers to accurately identify active members of household accounts.
