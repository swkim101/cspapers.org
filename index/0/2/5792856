A three-step method for function approximation with a fuzzy system is proposed. First, the membership functions and an initial rule representation are learned; second, the rules are compressed as much as possible using information theory; and finally, a computational network is constructed to compute the function value. This system is applied to two control examples: learning the truck and trailer backer-upper control system, and learning a cruise control system for a radio-controlled model car.
