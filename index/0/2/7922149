We consider the problem of predicting measurable responses to scientiﬁc articles based primarily on their text content. Specifically, we consider papers in two ﬁelds (economics and computational linguistics) and make predictions about downloads and within-community citations. Our approach is based on generalized linear models, allowing interpretability; a novel extension that captures ﬁrst-order temporal effects is also presented. We demonstrate that text features signiﬁcantly improve accuracy of predictions over metadata features like authors, topical categories, and publication venues.
