Biologically active material is immobilized by forming a gel precursor containing the biologically active material, a polymerizable material and a viscosity enhancing agent, applying the gel precursor to a support material and gelling the gel precursor by polymerization to form a hydrogel containing the biologically active material on the support material. A least some of the hydrogel is enmeshed with the support material. By use of the viscosity enhancing agent, the gel precursor is provided with preferred rheological properties.
