We have designed a neural network which detects the direction of egomotion from optic flow in the presence of eye movements (Lappe and Rauschecker, 1993). The performance of the network is consistent with human psychophysical data, and its output neurons show great similarity to "triple component" cells in area MSTd of monkey visual cortex. We now show that by using assumptions about the kind of eye movements that the observer is likely to perform, our model can generate various other cell types found in MSTd as well.
