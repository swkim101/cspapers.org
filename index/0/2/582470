"Privacy by design" (PbD) represents a distinct philosophical movement and a shift away from the dominant legal-oriented approach to privacy and toward an approach that is more proactive, technical, and embedded. However, it suffers from the general absence of organized systematic techniques for carrying it out. In part, this gap reflects a failure to appropriately leverage and organize existing ideas and methods, but it also reflects the need to develop new methods capable of addressing the complexities of new socio-technical systems. This tutorial aims to survey the state of PbD and what will be required to move it into the realm of actionable and structured techniques.
