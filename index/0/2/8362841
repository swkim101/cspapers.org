Annotated corpora are valuable resources for developing Natural Language Processing applications. This work focuses on acquiring annotated data for multilingual processing applications. We present an annotation environment that supports a web-based user-interface for acquiring word alignments between English and Chinese as well as a visualization tool for researchers to explore the annotated data.
