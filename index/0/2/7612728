The DARPA IXO mission is to develop "systems for real-time sensing, exploitation, and decision making in a rich tactical environment". The mission includes the development of individual technologies for sensors, sensor exploitation and command/control as well as the technology of information integration. Our research focuses on how to integrate distributed services in a dynamic networked environment to support IXO applications. This dynamic networked environment should include the following capabilities (DARPA, 2002):• Information users should have scalable dynamically changing subscription services to heterogeneous information services;• Information providers should have scalable publishing services for their dynamically changing information products;• Scalable intelligent middleware to dynamically broker, compose, and manage the intermediate services necessary to connect information users to the right information products at the right time.
