This paper presents a new scan matching method for mobile robot localization. The proposed method is based on a spectral technique, which finds consistent correspondences between two range scans without any initial alignment while considering how well their associated pairwise geometric relationships are satisfied. Based on the scan matching method, we also suggest a strategy for global localization in indoor environments, which is applicable to both grid maps and topological maps having metric information. The feasibility of the proposed methods is demonstrated by experimental results.
