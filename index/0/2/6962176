Recent trends in computer technology and design favor the development of computer systems with low levels of multiprogramming. Performance measures such as throughput can be improved under these circumstances by overlapping computation and input/output requests (CPU: I/O overlap). A computationally efficient model is presented which determines accurate bounds on the expected improvement which CPU: I/O overlap may introduce. This model can represent a wide range of multiprogrammed multiprocessor systems. The model is applied to a parametric analysis over a range of multiprocessor systems. CPU: I/O overlap appears to be promising for high speed computers with low levels of multiprogramming and for multiprocessor systems with a large number of processors.
