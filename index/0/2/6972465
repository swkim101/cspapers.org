This paper describes research on new methods and architectures that enable the synergistic combination of <sc>IP</sc> and <sc>ATM</sc> technologies. We have designed a highly scalable gigabit <sc>IP</sc> router based on an <sc>ATM</sc> core and a set of tightly coupled general-purpose processors. This a<sup>I</sup>t<sup>P</sup>m (pronounced "<sc>IP</sc> on <sc>ATM</sc>" or, if you prefer, "ip-attem") architecture provides flexibility in congestion control, routing, resource management, and packet scheduling.The a<sup>I</sup>t<sup>P</sup>m architecture is designed to allow experimentation with, and fine tuning of, the protocols and algorithms that are expected to form the core of the next generation <sc>IP</sc> in the context of a gigabit environment. The underlying multi-<sc>CPU</sc> embedded system will ensure that there are enough <sc>CPU</sc> and memory cycles to perform all <sc>IP</sc> packet processing at gigabit rates. We believe that the a<sup>I</sup>t<sup>P</sup>m architecture will not only lead to a scalable high-performance gigabit <sc>IP</sc> router technology, but will also demonstrate that <sc>IP</sc> and <sc>ATM</sc> technologies can be mutually supportive.
