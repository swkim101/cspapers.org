The Cornell Jaguar Project is exploring a variety of issues related to mobility and query processing. One broad theme is to break down the traditional client and server boundaries, leading to ubiquitous query processing. Another theme is to extend database and query processing techniques to small-scale and mobile devices. The project builds on and extends the Cornell PREDATOR database engine.
