In a work by Wang and Tang (2004), three popular subspace face recognition methods, PCA, Bayes, and LDA were analyzed under the same framework and an unified subspace analysis was proposed. However, since they are all based on a single Gaussian model, a global linear subspace often fails to deliver good performance on the data set with complex intrapersonal variation. They also have to face the problem caused by high dimensional face feature vector and the difficulty in finding optimal parameters for subspace analysis. In this paper, we develop a random mixture model to improve Bayes and LDA subspace analysis. By clustering the intrapersonal difference, the complex intrapersonal variation manifold is learned by a set of local linear intrapersonal subspaces. To boost the system performance, we construct multiple low dimensional subspaces by randomly sampling on the high dimensional feature vector and randomly selecting the parameters for subspace analysis. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by experiments on the AR face database containing 2340 face images.
