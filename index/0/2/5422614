Previous work in knowledge transfer in machine learning has been restricted to tasks in a single domain. However, evidence from psychology and neuroscience suggests that humans are capable of transferring knowledge across domains. We present here a novel learning method, based on neuroevolution, for transferring knowledge across domains. We use many-layered, sparsely-connected neural networks in order to learn a structural representation of tasks. Then we mine frequent sub-graphs in order to discover sub-networks that are useful for multiple tasks. These sub-networks are then used as primitives for speeding up the learning of subsequent related tasks, which may be in different domains.
