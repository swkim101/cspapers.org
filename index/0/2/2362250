We describe a simple unsupervised technique for learning morphology by identifying hubs in an automaton. For our purposes, a hub is a node in a graph with in-degree greater than one and out-degree greater than one. We create a word-trie, transform it into a minimal DFA, then identify hubs. Those hubs mark the boundary between root and suffix, achieving similar performance to more complex mixtures of techniques.
