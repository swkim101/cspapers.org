A class of synchronization protocols for dense, large-scale sensor networks is presented. The protocols build on the recent work of Hong, Cheow, and Scaglione [5, 6] in which the synchronization update rules are modeled by a system of pulse-coupled oscillators. In the present work, we define a class of models that converge to a synchronized state based on the local communication topology of the sensor network only, thereby lifting the all-to-all communication requirement implicit in [5, 6]. Under some rather mild assumptions of the connectivity of the network over time, these protocols still converge to a synchronized state when the communication topology is time varying.
