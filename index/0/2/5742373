In this paper we discuss a piece of work which intends to provide some insights regarding the resolution of the hard problem of multiple identities detection. Based on hypothesis that each person is unique and identifiable whether in its writing style or social behavior, we propose a Framework relying on machine learning models and a deep analysis of social interactions, towards such detection.
