A large number of tools that attempt to estimate network capacity and available bandwidth use algorithms that are based on measuring packet inter-arrival time. However in recent years network bandwidth has become faster than system input/output (I/O) bandwidth. This means that it is getting harder and harder to estimate capacity and available bandwidth using these techniques. This paper examines the current bandwidth measurement and estimation algorithms, and presents an analysis of how these algorithms might work in a high-speed network environment. This paper also discusses the system resource (hardware and software) issues that affect each of these algorithms, especially running on generic platforms built from off-the-shelf components.
