In presentation recording special effort is usually put into the automation of the production process, that is in automatically creating high quality data files without much or any need for manual recording and post-editing [5]. With the advent of such systems and their usage in classroom teaching, at conferences, etc., there is an increasing need for techniques and abilities which enable users to search in those documents and to localize some specific information. In this paper we describe how we integrated information retrieval techniques into the Authoring on the Fly (AOF) system, an approach for automatic presentation recording. We have chosen the AOF system for two reasons. On the one hand, it is a well-established way for presentation recording, used by various universities and institutions1. On the other hand it is general enough to illustrate typical problems and challenges a developer is facing when designing a system for information retrieval from multimedia data streams which occur in the presentation recording scenario.
