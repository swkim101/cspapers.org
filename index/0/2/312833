Dynamic movement primitives prove to be a useful and effective way to represent a movement of a given agent. However, the original DMP formulation does not take the interaction among multiple agents into the consideration. Thus, many researchers focus on the development of a coupling term for the underlying dynamical system and its associated learning strategies. The result is highly dependent on the quality of the learning methods. In this paper, we present a new way to formulate and realize interactive movement primitive in a leader-follower configuration, where the relationship between the follower and the leader is explicitly represented via the new formulation. This new formulation does not only simplify the learning process, but it also meets the requirements of several applications. We separately tested our new formulation in the context of the handover task and the wiping task. The results prove the flexibility and simplicity of the new formulation.
