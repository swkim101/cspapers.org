In this paper we present a convolution algorithm for the full class of closed, separable queueing networks. In particular, the algorithm represents an alternative method to those already known for the solution of networks with class changes, and is the first efficient algorithm to deal with Lam-type networks [11].
 As an application of the algorithm, we study a simple queueing network with disk I/O devices connected to a single CPU through a single channel. The algorithm is then used to develop a simple, accurate approximation for the blocking of disk devices that takes place when a customer using a disk is waiting for or in service at the channel.
