Virtual machine introspection, which provides tamperresistant, high-fidelity “out of the box” monitoring of virtual machines, has many prominent security applications including VM-based intrusion detection, malware analysis and memory forensic analysis. However, prior approaches are either intrusive in stopping the world to avoid race conditions between introspection tools and the guest VM, or providing no guarantee of getting a consistent state of the guest VM. Further, there is currently no effective means for timely examining the VM states in question. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called TxIntro, which retrofits hardware transactional memory (HTM) for concurrent, timely and consistent introspection of guest VMs. Specifically, TxIntro leverages the strong atomicity of HTM to actively monitor updates to critical kernel data structures. Then TxIntro can mount introspection to timely detect malicious tampering. To avoid fetching inconsistent kernel states for introspection, TxIntro uses HTM to add related synchronization states into the read set of the monitoring core and thus can easily detect potential inflight concurrent kernel updates. We have implemented and evaluated TxIntro based on Xen VMM on a commodity Intel Haswell machine that provides restricted transactional memory (RTM) support. To demonstrate the effectiveness of TxIntro, we implemented a set of kernel rootkit detectors using TxIntro. Evaluation results show that TxIntro is effective in detecting these rootkits, and is efficient in adding negligible performance overhead.
