The Steiner packing problem is to find the maximum number of edge-disjoint subgraphs of a given graph G that connect a given set of required points S. This problem is motivated by practical applications in VLSI- layout and broadcasting, as well as theoretical reasons. In this paper, we study this problem and present an algorithm with an asymptotic approximation factor of |S|/4. This gives a sufficient condition for the existence of k edge-disjoint Steiner trees in a graph in terms of the edge-connectivity of the graph. We will show that this condition is the best possible if the number of terminals is 3. At the end, we consider the fractional version of this problem, and observe that it can be reduced to the minimum Steiner tree problem via the ellipsoid algorithm.
