We show that the STEINER TREE problem and TRAVELING SALESMAN problem for points in the plane are NP-complete when distances are measured either by the rectilinear (Manhattan) metric or by a natural discretized version of the Euclidean metric. Our proofs also indicate that the problems are NP-hard if the distance measure is the (unmodified) Euclidean metric. However, for reasons we discuss, there is some question as to whether these problems, or even the well-solved MINIMUM SPANNING TREE problem, are in NP when the distance measure is the Euclidean metric.
