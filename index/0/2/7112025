This paper describes the Array Manipulation Language (AML), an algebra for multidimensional array data. AML is generic, in the sense that it can be customized to support a wide variety of domain-specific operations on arrays. AML expressions can be treated declaratively and subjected to rewrite optimizations. To illustrate this, several rewrite rules that exploit the structural properties of the AML operations are presented. Some techniques for eflâ€™icient evaluation of AML expressions are also discussed.
