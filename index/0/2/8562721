Two methods for detecting intersections among three dimensional objects are described. The first method involves detecting overlap among the projections of the objects on a given set of planes. The second method uses a three dimensional octree representation of the objects. Intersections are detected by traversing the trees for the obstacles and the moving objects. Application of the methods to collision avoidance is discussed.
