In this demo, we propose the self-trustworthy and secure Internet protocol (T-IP) for authenticated and encrypted network layer communications. T-IP has the following advantages: 1) Self-Trustworthy IP address. 2) Low connection latency and transmission overhead. 3) Reserving to be stateless (an important merit of IP). 4) Compatible with the existing TCP/IP architecture. We have implemented the protocol and deployed it in our campus network. Compared with IPsec, the evaluation shows that T-IP has a much lower transmission overhead and connection latency.
