Auto face annotation is an important technique for many real-world applications, such as online photo album management, new video summarization, and so on. It aims to automatically detect human faces from a photo image and further name the faces with the corresponding human names. Recently, mining web facial images on the internet has emerged as a promising paradigm towards auto face annotation. In this paper, we present a demonstration system of search-based face annotation: FANS - Face ANnotation by Searching large-scale web facial images. Given a query facial image for annotation, we first retrieve a short list of the most similar facial images from a web facial image database, and then annotate the query facial image by mining the top-ranking facial images and their corresponding labels with sparse representation techniques. Our demo system was built upon a large-scale real-world web facial image database with a total of 6,025 persons and about 1 million facial images. This paper demonstrates the potential of searching and mining web-scale weakly labeled facial images on the internet to tackle the challenging face annotation problem, and addresses some open problems for future exploration by researchers in web community.
