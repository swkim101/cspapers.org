We demonstrate the capabilities of Bolt, an ultra-low-power processor interconnect for the composable construction of new multi-processor wireless embedded platforms. Bolt provides asynchronous bidirectional communication between two processors with predictable message transfer times. In this way, Bolt solves the resource interference problem inherent in today's wireless embedded platforms, enabling simpler and more robust system designs with minimal resource overhead. Using our Bolt prototype implemented on a state-of-the-art microcontroller, we demonstrate Bolt's composability and decoupling in time, power, and clock domains.
