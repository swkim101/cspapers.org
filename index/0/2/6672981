This paper presents a novel microarchitecture technique for accurately predicting control flow reconvergence dynamically. A reconvergence point is the earliest dynamic instruction in the program where we can expect program paths to reconverge regardless of the outcome or target of the current branch. Thus, even if the immediate control flow after a branch is uncertain, execution following the reconvergence point is certain. This paper proposes a novel hardware re-convergence predictor which is both implementable and accurate, with a 4KB predictor achieving more than 95% accuracy for SPEC INT, and larger implementations achieving greater than 99% accuracy. The information provided from reconvergence prediction can increase the effectiveness of a range of previously proposed performance optimizations, including speculative multithreading, control independence, and squash reuse. This paper also demonstrates a new technique that takes advantage of the dynamic reconvergence prediction information in order to predict a wrong path excursion ahead of branch resolution. On average, 34% of wrong path fetches are eliminated.
