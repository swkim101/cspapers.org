Participants in this Birds-of-Feather session will share thoughts and experiences in offering an introductory course in this exploding field. It will be the third consecutive year that these facilitators will conduct a SIGCSE session on a first course in Data Science. The interest in the field has increased greatly over the years, and attendees of varying backgrounds, points of view and experience are welcome. Whether the course will serve as an outreach vehicle to students of all majors, including non-technical ones, or as a first course in a formal program of some sort, we will be exchanging points of view regarding both topic coverage and pedagogical approaches. Regarding topics, we'll raise questions on the relative emphases of statistics, programming (should R be the vehicle? how about Python? other languages?), machine learning (which algorithms?), other tools, and appropriate data sets. Participants who have taught such a course will be invited to describe some of their approaches, especially if they've used such active learning methods as flipped classrooms. The facilitators, PI's on an NSF IUSE grant now winding down, bring experience from two institutions and three departments, including one interdisciplinary course. They hope to expand the community begun through the grant and these sessions, hosted at http://computingportal.org/DataScienceCommunity.
