It typically maps high-dimensional data points to binary codes, where data similarity can be efficiently computed via rapid Hamming distance. Most existing unsupervised hashing schemes pursue binary codes by reducing the quantization error from an original real-valued data space to a resulting Hamming space. On the other hand, most existing supervised hashing schemes constrain binary code learning to correlate with pairwise similarity labels. However, few methods consider ordinal relations in the binary code learning process, which serve as a very significant cue to learn the optimal binary codes for similarity search. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing scheme, dubbed Ordinal Embedding Hashing (OEH), which embeds given ordinal relations among data points to learn the ranking-preserving binary codes. The core idea is to construct a directed unweighted graph to capture the ordinal relations, and then train the hash functions using this ordinal graph to preserve the permutation relations in the Hamming space. To learn such hash functions effectively, we further relax the discrete constraints and design a stochastic gradient decent algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. Experimental results on two large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed OEH method can achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-arts approaches.At last, the evaluation on query by humming dataset demonstrates the OEH also has good performance for music retrieval by using user's humming or singing.
