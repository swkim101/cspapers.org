Most learning methods with rank or sparsity constraints use convex relaxations, which lead to optimization with the nuclear norm or the l1-norm. However, several important learning applications cannot benefit from this approach as they feature these convex norms as constraints in addition to the nonconvex rank and sparsity constraints. In this setting, we derive efficient sparse projections onto the simplex and its extension, and illustrate how to use them to solve high-dimensional learning problems in quantum tomography, sparse density estimation and portfolio selection with non-convex constraints.
