In current vehicles, a large number of control units are connected by several automotive specific communication buses, facilitating innovative distributed applications. At the same time, computers and entertainment devices use IP and commodity communications technology like Ethernet to connect to the Internet, allowing for innovative solutions and maintaining fast innovation cycles. Today, one can see first applications of Ethernet for in-vehicle communication in contemporary cars. In next generation vehicles, many innovative applications could benefit from the increased bandwidth Ethernet can offer. Therefore, a examination of Ethernet usage for additional in-vehicle communication use cases is needed. In this paper, we show simulation results of promising use cases for in-car Ethernet, while looking at different realistic topologies, types of traffic, and configurations.
