The design and implementation of a paraphrase component for a natural language question-answer system (CO-OP) is presented. A major point made is the role of given and new information in formulating a paraphrase that differs in a meaningful way from the user's question. A description is also given of the transformational grammar used by the paraphraser to generate questions.
