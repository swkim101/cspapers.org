This study investigates the effect of update rate on the perceived quality of haptic virtual textures, focusing on one type of perceived instability called "buzzing." Buzzing refers to the high-frequency noises that may emanate from a force-feedback device during haptic texture rendering. We first present a simulation of a haptic texture rendering system that explicitly models the sampled-data nature of the system. The simulation shows that a slow haptic update rate can significantly increase the high-frequency noise in the reconstructed force command sent to the haptic interface. This noise may excite the structural resonance of the haptic interface and result in a high-frequency buzzing at the interaction tool that a user holds. A subsequent psychophysical experiment, conducted over a wide range of update rate (250 Hz - 40 kHz), has confirmed the simulation results. The results show a 278% increase in the maximum stiffness (0.325 - 0.904 N/mm over the update rates tested) that could be used for rendering perceptually "clean" virtual haptic textures. These results argue for haptic update rates that are much higher than the widely-accepted value of 1 kHz. Considering that an application requiring hard surface rendering needs a stiffness value of at least 0.8 - 1.0 N/mm, we recommend a haptic update rate in the range 5-10 kHz for perceptually stable haptic texture rendering.
