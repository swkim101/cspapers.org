We present in this paper the development of a new kind of force sensing manipulator and use it to design a teleoperated micromanipulation station. The micromanipulation tasks are the two-dimensional positioning and forces interaction measurement of micrometer-size particles (50 /spl mu/m radius) in ambient condition. The manipulator used consists of a levitated glass probe with a tip of 20 /spl mu/m size. Since the levitation is achieved with totally passive approach, no control loop is then needed. Passive levitation is possible, under suitable conditions, using permanent magnets and diamagnetic materials. The established model of both magnetic and diamagnetic forces allows to calculate the applied force on the end-effector of the levitating device after measuring the position of the levitating part. The absence of friction forces and design configuration make the manipulator highly sensitive and forces around nN can be measured. This paper reports the description of the levitated sensing manipulator, model force calculation and experimental results of micromanipulation tasks.
