In this paper we describe a solution for incorporating background knowledge into the OntoGen system for semi-automatic ontology construction. This makes it easier for different users to construct different and more personalized ontologies for the same domain. To achieve this we introduce a word weighting schema to be used in the document representation. The weighting schema is learned based on the background knowledge provided by user. It is than used by OntoGen's machine learning and text mining algorithms.
