Motion segmentation is an inevitable component for mobile robotic systems such as the case with robots performing SLAM and collision avoidance in dynamic worlds. This paper proposes an incremental motion segmentation system that efficiently segments multiple moving objects and simultaneously build the map of the environment using visual SLAM modules. Multiple cues based on optical flow and two view geometry are integrated to achieve this segmentation. A dense optical flow algorithm is used for dense tracking of features. Motion potentials based on geometry are computed for each of these dense tracks. These geometric potentials along with the optical flow potentials are used to form a graph like structure. A graph based segmentation algorithm then clusters together nodes of similar potentials to form the eventual motion segments. Experimental results of high quality segmentation on different publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
