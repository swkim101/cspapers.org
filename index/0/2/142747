To maintain a mobile form factor, the screen real estate of a mobile device canIn this paper we present SurfacePhone; a novel configuration of a projector phone which aligns the projector to project onto a physical surface to allow tabletop-like interaction in a mobile setup. The projection is created behind the upright standing phone and is touch and gesture-enabled. Multiple projections can be merged to create shared spaces for multi-user collaboration. We investigate this new setup, starting with the concept that we evaluated with a concept prototype. Furthermore we present our technical prototype, a mobile phone case with integrated projector that allows for the aforementioned interaction. We discuss its technical requirements and evaluate the accuracy of interaction in a second user study. We conclude with lessons learned and design guidelines.
