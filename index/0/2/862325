In this work we present a fast kinodynamic RRT-planner that uses dynamic nonprehensile actions to rearrange cluttered environments. In contrast to many previous works, the presented planner is not restricted to quasi-static interactions and monotonicity. Instead the results of dynamic robot actions are predicted using a black box physics model. Given a general set of primitive actions and a physics model, the planner randomly explores the configuration space of the environment to find a sequence of actions that transform the environment into some goal configuration. In contrast to a naive kinodynamic RRT-planner we show that we can exploit the physical fact that in an environment with friction any object eventually comes to rest. This allows a search on the configuration space rather than the state space, reducing the dimension of the search space by a factor of two without restricting us to non-dynamic interactions. We compare our algorithm against a naive kinodynamic RRT-planner and show that on a variety of environments we can achieve a higher planning success rate given a restricted time budget for planning.
