Data management and knowledge engineering have long been important research fields in computer science, and rapid progress in recent years have increasingly seen these technologies successfully applied to solve complex biomedical challenges and support health services professionals in the course of their intellectually-demanding clinical duties, such as through the use of decision-support or expert systems. Yet, as the biomedical knowledge available in the modern digital world grows exponentially, there is a pressing need for a focused forum to promote technology and knowledge transfer from basic research to biomedical applications as well as allowing for implementers of healthcare systems to share their experiences with the research community. The Managing Interoperability and Complexity in Health Systems, MIXHS workshops are designed for such a purpose with the view that multi-disciplinary approaches within a holistic forum is essential to rise to the ever new challenges of biomedical knowledge complexity and interoperability of health systems and services.
