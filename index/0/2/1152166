For more than 30 years Davis-Putnam-style exponential-time backtracking algorithms have been the most common tools used for finding exact solutions of NP-hard problems. Despite of that, the way to analyze such recursive algorithms is still far from producing tight worst case running time bounds.The "Measure and Conquer" approach is one of the recent attempts to step beyond such limitations. The approach is based on the choice of the measure of the subproblems recursively generated by the algorithm considered; this measure is used to lower bound the progress made by the algorithm at each branching step. A good choice of the measure can lead to a significantly better worst case time analysis.In this paper we apply "Measure and Conquer" to the analysis of a very simple backtracking algorithm solving the well-studied maximum independent set problem. The result of the analysis is striking: the running time of the algorithm is O(20.288n), which is competitive with the current best time bounds obtained with far more complicated algorithms (and naive analysis).Our example shows that a good choice of the measure, made in the very first stages of exact algorithms design, can have a tremendous impact on the running time bounds achievable.
