The idea behind this proposal is to investigate the possibility of utilizing NLP tools, statistical topic modeling techniques and freely available online resources to pro-pose a system able to provide dialogue contribution suggestions which are relevant to the context, yet out of the main activity of the dialogue (i.e. off-activity talk ). The aim is to evaluate the effects of a tool that automatically suggests off-activity talk s in form of some sentences relevant to the dialogue context. The evaluation is to be done over two test-sets of open domain and closed-domain in a conversational quiz-like setting. The outcome of this work will be a satisfactory point of entry to investigate the hypothesis that adding automatically generated off-activity talks feature to a conversational agent can lead to building up engagement of the dialogue partner(s).
