An increasing number of institutions require software engineering as part of their computing curriculum. Technical managers and hiring personnel of many software development companies cite familiarity with software engineering principles among the top skills required for entry-level computing positions. Furthermore, technical managers and hiring personnel often consider experience with real-world group projects to be a necessary part of the computing background of prospective new hires. These conclusions are based on systematic discussions with technical and human resources personnel at 13 large Midwestern companies (50+ developers) over the past seven years (J. Beck, unpublished data, 2001â€“2008). Unfortunately, many computing students never benefit from the experience of a real project during their undergraduate studies. The experiences of many students are limited to toy textbook problems assigned to small groups, which means they miss out on a vitally important part of their computing education. Three areas of particular concern for providing students with class projects that incorporate real-world hurdles within the classroom are:
