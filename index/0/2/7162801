For input x, let F(x) denote the set of outputs that are the “legal” answers for a co mputational problem F . Suppose x and members of F(x) are so large that there is not time to read them in their entirety. We propose a model of local computation algorithmswhich for a given input x, support queries by a user to values of specified locations yi in a legal output y ∈ F(x). When more than one legal output y exists for a given x, the local computation algorithm should output in a way that is consistent with at least one such y. Local computation algorithms are intended to distill the c ommon features of several concepts that have appeared in various algorithmic subfield s, including local distributed computation, local algorithms, locally decodable codes, and local reconstruction. We develop a technique, based on known constructions of small sample spaces ofk-wise independent random variables and Beck’s analysis in his algorithmic app roach to the Lovasz Local Lemma, which under certain conditions can be applied to construct local computation algorithms that run in polylogarithmic time and space. We apply this technique to maximal independent set computations, scheduling radio network broadcasts, hypergraph coloring and satisfying k-SAT formulas.
