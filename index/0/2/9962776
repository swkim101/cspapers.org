The Semantic Web seeks integrate data from many different sources. Since different sources often use different names for the same object, we need to map between these names. We first consider the use of keys to do this mapping and discuss some of the associated problems. We introduce the concept of bootstrapping from some shared names to more shared names and discuss some conditions under which this process is guaranteed to be correct. We describe a probabilistic approach to matching and propose approximations to address the issue of requiring a combinatorially large number of joint probabilities. We report on empirical studies for validating this approach in two interesting domains. Finally, we discuss the implications of better matching techniques for privacy.
