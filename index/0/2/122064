I report on my experiences with Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) in two systems courses and two design courses as a new instructor at a small liberal arts college. My purposes are threefold: to further raise awareness of JiTT in the computer science education community, to show instructors can achieve JiTT's goals with simple technology and preparation on the fly, and to consider strengths and limitations of the approach, particularly for new faculty. My experience has been very positive: classes have been fun, engaging, and conversational. Students have reported that they come to class better prepared and appreciate the opportunity to ask and discuss questions before class. Where others have warned of the high workload with this approach, my experience is that the workload is reasonable compared to preparing a new course from scratch; the approach discourages some types of overpreparation. For these reasons, I would recommend the approach for other new instructors.
