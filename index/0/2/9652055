Automatic document classification (DC) is essential for the management of information and knowledge. This paper explores two practical issues in DC: (1) each document has its context of discussion, and (2) both the content and vocabulary of the document database is intrinsically evolving. The issues call for adaptive document classification (ADC) that adapts a DC system to the evolving contextual requirement of each document category, so that input documents may be classified based on their contexts of discussion. We present an incremental context mining technique to tackle the challenges of ADC. Theoretical analyses and empirical results show that, given a text hierarchy, the mining technique is efficient in incrementally maintaining the evolving contextual requirement of each category. Based on the contextual requirements mined by the system, higher-precision DC may be achieved with better efficiency.
