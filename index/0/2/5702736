In this paper we present the design and the evaluation of a framework MagnoTricorder, a system that utilizes the magnetic sensor in smartphones to detect the running devices at home thru a singlepoint sensing. MagnoTricorder leverages the effect of Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) generated by the AC current in the main power-line at home. This EMI induces a magnetic field that highly fluctuates the reading of the magnetic sensor in smartphones. In this paper, we utilize this characteristic for detecting and identifying the running devices at home thru the Circuit Breaker Panel. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the developed framework. Results show that MangoTricorder can detect and identify individual devices with 93%-98% accuracy.
