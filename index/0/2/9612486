The mapping of agricultural crops by capturing images obtained with UAVs enables fast environmental monitoring and diagnosis in large areas. Airborne monitoring in agriculture can a substantially impacts on the identification of diseases and produce accurate information on affected areas. The problem can be formulated as a classification task on aerial images with significant opportunities to impact other fields. This paper presents an active learning method through route planning for improvements in the knowledge on visited areas and minimization uncertainties about the classification of diseases in crops. Binary Logistic Regression and Gaussian Process were used for the detection of pathologies and map interpolation, respectively. A Bayesian optimization strategy is also proposed for the planning of an informative trajectory, which resulted in a maximized search for affected areas in an initially unknown environment.
