The memristor, known as “the fourth fundamental passive circuit element”, was predicted theoretically in 1971 by Prof. Leon Chua. It has attracted the scientist's attention since the physical implementation demonstrated in 2008 by HP Labs research team. However, at the nanoscale, due to its diversified modeling methods, SPICE memristor models are getting a considerable attention due to their simplicity and flexibility. For its reliable implementation, a simple model will be discussed in this paper. This model not only possesses the general memristor properties but also catches the dynamic characteristics including the pinched hysteresis loop, which is covered with a consistent way. Simulation results of the SPICE memristor model demonstrate its dynamics for different types of excitation. The analysis of the implemented parameters provided to discuss the switching behavior of such device. This SPICE model proves the ability and flexibility to adapt the changing behavior with different input polarization.
