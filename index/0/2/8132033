This paper describes a system for pedestrian detection in stereo infrared images. The system is based on three different underlying approaches: warm area detection, edgebased detection, and v-disparity computation. Stereo is also used for computing the distance and size of detected objects. A final validation process is performed using head morphological and thermal characteristics. Neither temporal correlation, nor motion cues are used in this processing. The developed system has been implemented on an experimental vehicle equipped with two infrared camera and preliminarily tested in different situations.
