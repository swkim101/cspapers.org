The widespread adoption of machine learning has created a pressing need for data efficient, interpretable models with efficient inference schemes. At the same time, a profusion of data sources demands an accounting for relationships between, often heterogeneous, data both within and across datasets. These challenges are particularly faced in the context of unsupervised learning; we would like to derive a (latent) description of the observed data that is both generative (recreates the data) and efficient (shares information between the observations).
