The Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) of ABET has proposed changes in the structure of the criteria used to accredit computer science and information systems programs. The new structure combines, into so-called "general criteria," components of criteria that apply to any computing program accredited by CAC. Individual program areas will supply criteria that only apply to that specific program area, to supplement the general criteria. The new criteria format allows CAC to accredit additional program areas, such as information technology. In fact, program criteria for information technology also have been proposed. This session will discuss the new criteria structure, including the proposed general and program criteria, changes to existing criteria, and the timetable for implementation of the new structure.
