In large scale software development projects, in particular in the field of Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE), different kinds of a project's artifacts are used and related information is spread over the different artifacts. E.g., the transaction attributes ("Require", "Requires-New",etc.) of methods of an Enterprise Java Bean are defined in the deployment descriptor while the method bodies are defined in a Java class. If we want to put these information into relation, e.g., to find all methods with a specific transaction attribute, we have to use different search engines and have to map the information manually. It is not possible to execute "one query" that returns the desired result.
 XIRC is a platform that enables to define queries over a uniform representation of all artifacts of a software project. XIRC maps all artifacts of a project to XML representations and stores the documents in a database. The database can be queried using XQuery, a functional query language for XML documents. XIRC can be used as a sophisticated search engine, as a tool to check implementation restrictions, to find errors or as a basis for further tools for code generation and visualization.
