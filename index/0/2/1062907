Spectral clustering is one of the most prominent clustering approaches. However, it is highly sensitive to noisy input data. In this work, we propose a robust spectral clustering technique able to handle such scenarios. To achieve this goal, we propose a sparse and latent decomposition of the similarity graph used in spectral clustering. In our model, we jointly learn the spectral embedding as well as the corrupted data - thus, enhancing the clustering performance overall. We propose algorithmic solutions to all three established variants of spectral clustering, each showing linear complexity in the number of edges. Our experimental analysis confirms the significant potential of our approach for robust spectral clustering. Supplementary material is available at www.kdd.in.tum.de/RSC.
