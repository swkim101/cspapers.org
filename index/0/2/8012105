Students are introduced to the object-oriented paradigm at the beginning of this implementation of CS 1. A number of window objects are available and are incorporated in the first laboratory assignments. These window objects communicate through the standmd input and output mechanisms of the operating system. These operating system mechanisms allow piping among objects and the simultaneous execution of multiple objects. Some assignments are threaded throughout the term to become sizable culminations, Although the emphasis is primarily on the objects involved in the solution designs, there is some amount of algorithm development. The window objects used provide some exposure to graphical user interfaces and scientific visualization, and give visuat feedback on the performance of the algorithms.
