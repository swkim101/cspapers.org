This paper presents an efficient fully dynamic graph algorithm for maintaining the transitive closure of a directed graph. The algorithm updates the adjacency matrix of the transitive closure with each update to the graph; hence, each reachability query of the form "Is there a directed path from i to j?" can be answered in O(1) time. The algorithm is randomized and has a one-sided error; it is correct when answering yes, but has O(1/nc) probability of error when answering no, for any constant c. In acyclic graphs, worst case update time is O(n2). In general graphs, the update time is O(n2.26). The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n2).
