Real-time transit tracking is gaining popularity as a means for transit agencies to improve the rider experience. However, many transit agencies lack either the funding or initiative to provide such tracking services. In this paper, we describe a crowd-sourced alternative to official transit tracking, which we call cooperative transit tracking.
 Participating users install an application on their smart-phone. With the help of built-in sensors, such as GPS, WiFi, and accelerometer, the application automatically detects when the user is riding in a transit vehicle. On these occasions (and only these), it sends periodic, anonymized, location updates to a central tracking server.
 Our technical contributions include (a) an accelerometer-based activity classification algorithm for determining whether or not the user is riding in a vehicle, (b) a memory and time-efficient route matching algorithm for determining whether the user is in a bus vs. another vehicle, (c) a method for tracking underground vehicles, and an evaluation of the above on real-world data.
 By simulating the Chicago transit network, we find that the proposed system would shorten expected wait times by 2 minutes with only 5% of transit riders using the system. At a 20% penetration level, the mean wait time is reduced from 9 to 3 minutes.
