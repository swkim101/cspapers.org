In this demo, we show examples of a novel class of mobile games called Phone-to-Phone Mobile Motion Games (MMG), in which position, location, orientation, or movement of the phone is an integral part of game play. Consider for example the following SwordFight game: two players wield their phones as imaginary swords, and try to attack each other. Relative positions and orientations of the two phones are combined to determine whether one is Attacking or Blocking [1]. MMG games represent a class of highly interactive games in which gameplay directly involves the user’s physical activity – just as the Kinect and Wii do for console gaming. Such MMG games are a marked departure from the vast majority of today’s mobile games. Rather than requiring players to conduct game actions via the screen, MMG games enable players to translate real-world motion into virtual gameplay. Yet MMG games require no external infrastructure and are played purely phone-to-phone. The enabling technology for a game like SwordFight is the ability to conduct very fast, accurate, and robust distance measurements between the phones without any external infrastructure. Previous studies have shown that measurement lag lower than 100ms is needed to support action games without impacting user satisfaction. Additionally, the distance measurement should be accurate to within centimeters, and robust even when the players move fast or are in noisy environments. Our system described in [1] utilizes acoustic sound for distance measurement. Previous studies have shown that acoustic localization can achieve accurate ranging in static
