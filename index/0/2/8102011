Secret sharing schemes in which the secret is a composition of a quorum function evaluations each evaluated at secret shares have been a useful tool in cryptography. Previous proposals for such schemes, called multiplicative threshold schemes, had superpolynomial share expansion when performed over general groups; thus leaving open the problem of obtaining such a scheme over general (i.e., non-Abelian) groups and with polynomial share expansion. In this paper we show the existence of a perfectly secure multiplicative threshold scheme having polynomial share expansion.
