Motivated by product detection in supermarkets, this paper studies the problem of object proposal generation in supermarket images and other natural images. We argue that estimation of object scales in images is helpful for generating object proposals, especially for supermarket images where object scales are usually within a small range. Therefore, we propose to estimate object scales of images before generating object proposals. The proposed method for predicting object scales is called ScaleNet. To validate the effectiveness of ScaleNet, we build three supermarket datasets, two of which are real-world datasets used for testing and the other one is a synthetic dataset used for training. In short, we extend the previous state-of-the-art object proposal methods by adding a scale prediction phase. The resulted method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the supermarket datasets by a large margin. We also show that the approach works for object proposal on other natural images and it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art object proposal methods on the MS COCO dataset. The supermarket datasets, the virtual supermarkets, and the tools for creating more synthetic datasets will be made public.
