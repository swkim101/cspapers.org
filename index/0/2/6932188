We obtain the first approximation algorithm for finding the <i>k</i>-<b>simple</b> shortest paths connecting a pair of vertices in a weighted directed graph. Our algorithm is deterministic and has a running time of <i>O</i>(<i>k</i>(<i>m</i>√<i>n</i> + <i>n</i><sup>3/2</sup> log <i>n</i>)) where <i>m</i> is the number of edges in the graph and <i>n</i> is the number of vertices. Let <i>s, t</i> ε <i>V</i>; the length of the <i>i</i>-th simple path from <i>s</i> to <i>t</i> computed by our algorithm is at most 3/2 times the length of the <i>i</i>-th shortest simple path from <i>s</i> to <i>t</i>. The best algorithms for computing the exact <i>k</i>-simple shortest paths connecting a pair of vertices in a weighted directed graph are due to Yen [19] and Lawler [13]. The running time of their algorithms, using modern data structures, is <i>O</i>(<i>k</i>(<i>mn</i> + <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> log <i>n</i>)). Both algorithms are from the early 70's. Although this problem and other variants of the <i>k</i>-shortest path problem drew a lot of attention during the last three and a half decades, the <i>O</i>(<i>k</i>(<i>mn</i> + <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> log <i>n</i>)) bound is still unbeaten.
