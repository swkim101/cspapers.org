We introduce a general study of routing mediators. A routing mediator can act in a given multi-agent encounter on behalf of the agents that give it the right of play. Routing mediators differ from one another according to the information they may have. Our study concentrates on the use of routing mediators in order to reach correlated strong equilibrium, a multi-agent behavior which is stable against deviations by coalitions. We study the relationships between the power of different routing mediators in establishing correlated strong equilibrium. Surprisingly, our main result shows a natural class of routing mediators that allow to implement fair and efficient outcomes as a correlated super-strong equilibrium in a very wide class of games.
