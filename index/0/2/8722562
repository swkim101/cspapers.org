For this, it develops a hybrid knowledge base that lets most of heuristics be represented in a simple and structured manner. As knowledge is usually categorized by domain independent and domain dependent one, it separates the store of the knowledge into two bases: domain independent knowledge base (Ibase) and domain dependent knowledge base (Dbase). Ibase is used as a graph-based thesaurus that permits “ is-a” relation between
