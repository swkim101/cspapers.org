This paper describes a new principle for the control of data transmission within real time parallel systems. Control is effected by a number of identical units which are uniformly distributed among sender-receivers. When senders desire a transmission channel, their units try to capture the channel. The unit having the highest priority captures the channel. We describe a procedure for assigning and changing unit priorities under the constraint that customer service indices remain above given levels. The suggested procedure can be used to assign priorities in real time systems. indices. Such indices describe the level of customer service. Their values should not exceed the limits specified by the conditions under which customers operate. Examples of service indices are: average time between arrival and fulfillment of customer requirements for service, average number of customer requirements awaiting service more than a fixed limit. Such problems are important in real time computer systems. Their solution can have a strong influence on the structure of those hardware and software components which interact among the subsystems.
