Business processes encapsulate the knowledge of operations and services provided by organizations. Due to the changing nature of business processes, the design and implementation of e-commerce applications, such as workplace applications, could not be evolved consistently to support changing business requirements. E-commerce workplaces suffer from design and usability problems and may not conform to updated and constantly changing business processes. In this research demonstration, we present a framework that automatically generates business workplaces using workflow specifications. The generated workplaces can easily adapt to the changing business needs and reflect better the interaction within complex business processes in organizations.
