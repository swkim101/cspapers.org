In this paper, we propose a novel robot hand called uGRIPP (Underactuated Gripper for Power and Precision Grasp) which has underactuated fingers for dual-arm manipulation tasks. A newly designed underactuated linkage enables the robot hand to achieve not only an adaptive grasp and a pinch grasp, but also manipulation by a palm of the hand. We introduce performance of the proposed linkage by a static analysis. A prototype of the robot hand which has the proposed linkage as fingers was developed. We conducted handling experiments by using the robot hand.
