More and more of the discussion that happens now takes place on the web, whether it be for work, communities of interest, political and civic discourse, or education. However, little has changed in the design of online discussion systems, such as email, forums, and chat, in the decades they have been available, even as discussions grow in size and scope. As a result, online communities continue to struggle with issues stemming from growing participation, a diversity of participants, and new application domains. To solve these problems, my research is on building novel online discussion systems that give members of a community direct control over their experiences and information within these systems. Specifically, I focus on: 1) tools to make sense of large discussions and extract usable knowledge from them, 2) tools to situate conversations in the context what is being discussed, as well as 3) tools to give users more fine-grained control over the delivery of content, so that messages only go to those who wish to receive it.
