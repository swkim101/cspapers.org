Location-Based Services (LBS) have been widely accepted by mobile users recently. Existing LBS-based systems require users to type in complete keywords. However for mobile users it is rather difficult to type in complete keywords on mobile devices. To alleviate this problem, in this paper we study the location-aware instant search problem, which returns users location-aware answers as users type in queries letter by letter. The main challenge is to achieve high interactive speed. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel index structure, prefix-region tree (called PR-Tree), to efficiently support location-aware instant search. PR-Tree is a tree-based index structure which seamlessly integrates the textual description and spatial information to index the spatial data. Using the PR-Tree, we develop efficient algorithms to support single prefix queries and multi-keyword queries. Experiments show that our method achieves high performance and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
