When rules of transfer-based machine translation (MT) are automatically acquired from bilingual corpora, incorrect/redundant rules are generated due to acquisition errors or translation variety in the corpora. As a new countermeasure to this problem, we propose a feedback cleaning method using automatic evaluation of MT quality, which removes incorrect/redundant rules as a way to increase the evaluation score. BLEU is utilized for the automatic evaluation. The hill-climbing algorithm, which involves features of this task, is applied to searching for the optimal combination of rules. Our experiments show that the MT quality improves by 10% in test sentences according to a subjective evaluation. This is considerable improvement over previous methods.
