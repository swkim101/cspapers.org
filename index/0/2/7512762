Users often quit an information retrieval system (IR system) very frustrated, because they cannot find the information matching their information needs. We have identified the following two main reasons: too high expectations and wrong use of the system. Our approach which addresses both issues is based on the transfer of the concept of Quality of Service to IR systems: The user first negotiates the retrieval success rates with the IR system, so he knows what to expect from the system in advance. Second, by dynamic adaptation to the retrieval context, the IR system tries to improve the user's queries and thereby tries to exploit the underlying information source as best as possible.
