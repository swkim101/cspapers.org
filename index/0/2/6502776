In this paper, we present a novel multi-webpage summarization algorithm. It adds the graph based ranking algorithm into the framework of Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) method, to not only capture the main topic of the web pages but also eliminate the redundancy existing in the sentences of the summary result. The experiment result indicates that the new approach has the better performance than the previous methods.
