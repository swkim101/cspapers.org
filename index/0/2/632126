In this demonstration, we present a working prototype that uses an Anisotropic Magnetoresistive (AMR) sensor array to estimate the electricity usage on individual branches of an electricity panel. Our design enables the general public to retrofit an electricity panel: one simply needs to attach a compact AMR sensor array onto the panel. Our system can then exploit the inherent power patterns of electric loads to automatically infer the system parameters and estimate the per-branch currents accurately. Even for branches carrying small loads (e.g., a 30W fan), the estimation error of our system is below 10%.
