We simplify and improve upon recent lower bounds on the minimum distortion of embedding certain finite metric spaces into <i>l</i><inf>1</inf>. In particular, we show that for infinitely many values of <i>n</i> there are <i>n</i>-point metric spaces of negative type that require a distortion of Ω(log log <i>n</i>) for such an embedding, implying the same lower bound on the integrality gap of a well-known SDP relaxation for SPARSEST-CUT. This result builds upon and improves the recent lower bound of (log log <i>n</i>)<sup>1/6---o(1)</sup> due to Khot and Vishnoi [STOC 2005]. We also show that embedding the edit distance on {O, 1}<sup><i>n</i></sup> into <i>L<inf>1</inf></i> requires a distortion of Ω(log <i>n</i>). This result simplifies and improves a very recent lower bound due to Khot and Naor [FOCS 2005].
