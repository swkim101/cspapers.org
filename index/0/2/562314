The <italic>Context Interchange</italic> strategy presents a novel approach for mediated data access in which semantic conflicts among heterogeneous systems are not identified a priori, but are detected and reconciled by a <italic>context mediator</italic> through comparison of <italic>contexts</italic>. This paper reports on the implementation of a Context Interchange Prototype which provides a concrete demonstration of the features and benefits of this integration strategy.
