Human-computer interaction (HCI) is undergoing a paradigm change towards interaction that is contextually adapted to rich use situations taking place "beyond the desktop". Currently, however, there are only few successful applications of context-adapted HCI, arguably because use scenarios have not been based on holistic understanding of the society, users, and use situations. A humanistic research strategy, utilized at the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology, aims to structure the innovation and evaluation of scenarios for future technologies. Population trends and motivational needs are analyzed to recognize psycho-socially relevant design opportunities. Ethnography, ethnomethodology, bodystorming, and computer simulations of use situations are conducted to understand use situations. The goal of design is to empower users by supporting their autonomy and control. Three design cases illustrate the approach. The paper showcases an emerging framework for informed innovation of use potentials.
