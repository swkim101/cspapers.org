This paper presents a timing optimization algorithm SDLR (acronym of SYLON-DREAM Level-Reduction), which is used in the SYLON-DREAM logic synthesizer for speeding up combinational multi-level networks. In SDLR, gates on critical paths are identified and their level numbers counted from the inputs of the network are maximally reduced by a level-reduction procedure. Gates which are not on the critical paths are processed by an area reduction procedure to reduce network area without increasing its maximum depth. SDLR uses the concept of permissible functions in both level and area reduction procedures, and it can directly process networks consisting of simple gates or negative gates (i.e., MOS cells). Experimental results obtained for benchmark functions show that SDLR is an effective algorithm which can reduce network delay with no or minimal area increase.
