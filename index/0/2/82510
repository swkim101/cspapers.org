We present a new interaction paradigm for digital cameras aimed at making interactive imaging algorithms accessible on these devices. In our system, the user creates visual cues in front of the lens during the live preview frames that are continuously processed before the snapshot is taken. These cues are recognized by the camera's image processor to control the lens or other settings. We design and analyze vision-based camera interactions, including focus and zoom controls, and argue that the vision-based paradigm offers a new level of photographer control needed for the next generation of digital cameras.
