We propose a method of compiling circumscription into Extended Logic Programs which is widely applicable to a class of parallel circumscription as well as a class of prioritized circumscription. In this paper, we show theoretically that any circumscription whose theory contains both the domain closure axiom and the uniqueness of names axioms can always be compiled into an extended logic program II, so that, whether a ground literal is provable from circumscription or not, can always be evaluated by deciding whether the literal is true in all answer sets of II, which can be computed by running II under the existing logic programming interpreter.
