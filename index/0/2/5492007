This paper presents the settings and the results of the ROMIP 2013 MT shared task for the English!Russian language direction. The quality of generated translations was assessed using automatic metrics and human evaluation. We also discuss ways to reduce human evaluation efforts using pairwise sentence comparisons by human judges to simulate sort operations.
