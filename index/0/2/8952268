The use of abstract data types as a basis for designing experimental knowledge representation systems is discussed. Abstract data types are shown to have features in common with severel diverse representation formalisms (e.g. semantic networks, frames and KLONE). For example, abstract data types have notions analogous to concept, subconcept and inheritance. The relatively small conceptual distance between abstraect data types and knowledge representation formalisms make them an ideal vehicle for implementing such formalisms.
