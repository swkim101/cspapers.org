Browser security as an important and relatively new area is yet not part of existing IA curriculum or National Security Agency (NSA) knowledge units. Browser security incorporate threats, vulnerabilities, risks, and countermeasures faced by browsers and browser-based applications ranging from design principles, security architecture to applications. Our effort contributes to courseware development and IA education in terms of browser security. Hands-on labs are effective to improve student learning in IA and sharpen their skills in real-world settings. We develop hands-on labs to help students to build necessary skills on developing secure browser and browser-based applications. Our developed hands-on labs can be adopted in various levels of undergraduate Computer Science (CS) and Information Assurance (IA) courses.
