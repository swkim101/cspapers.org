Many emerging semantic web applications include ontologies from one set of authors and instance data from another (often much larger) set of authors. Often ontologies are reused and instance data is integrated in manners unanticipated by their authors. Not surprisingly, many instance data rich applications encounter instance data that is not compatible with the expectations of the original ontology author(s). This line of work focuses on issues related to semantic expectation mismatches in instance data. Our initial results include a customizable and extensible service-oriented evaluation architecture, and a domain implementation called PmlValidator, which checks instance data using the corresponding ontologies and additional style requirements.
