The structure of a document refers to the role and hierarchy of subdocument references. Many online documents are similarly structured, though not identically structured. We study the problem of discovering “typical” structures of a collection of such documents, where the user specifies the minimum frequency of a typical structure. We will consider structural features of subdocument references such as labeling, nesting, ordering, cyclicity, and wild-card references, like those found on the Web and digital libraries. Typical structures can be used to serve the following purposes. (a) The “table-ofcontent” for gaining the general information of a source. (b) A road map for browsing and querying a source. (c) A basis for clustering documents. (d) Partial schemas for building structured layers to provide standard database access methods. (e) User/customer’s interests and browsing patterns. We present a solution to the discovery problem.
