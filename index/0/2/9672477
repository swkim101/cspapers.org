This paper describes the exploration component of MOBOT-IV, an autonomous mobile robot for indoor-applications. MOBOT-IV has no preloaded world-model, but builds up an internal map while exploring the environment using its optical range finder. A method is presented for the autonomous and systematic construction of a 2D-map of the vehicles environment. Besides a line based geometric representation of the obstacles a topological abstraction of the robots environment is generated representing the room structure.<<ETX>>
