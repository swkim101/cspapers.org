In January 2004, we organized the second SIGCSE Committee ("Expanding the Women-in-Computing Community"). Our 14th Annual Town Meeting provides dissemination of information concerning successful gender issues projects, along with group discussion and brainstorming. We select projects to highlight through listserv communication and through our connections with ABI, ACM-W, CDC, CRA-W, NCWIT. The forum provides an important annual meeting for a large group of people, who work to increase the representation of women in computing in their separate organizations and who do not customarily have an opportunity to share ideas face-to-face.
