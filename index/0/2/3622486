This session proposal is part of the recognition of 40 years of SIGCSE. We will look at the organization itself, how it came to be and where it might be going. It will be an interactive session with the participation of the audience informing the SIGCSE leadership of appropriate directions for the future of this group that has been so important to computing education.
