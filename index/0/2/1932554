This paper presents the semantics of TRIO*, an object oriented language devoted to specify realtime systems referring to different time granularities. Time granularity allows to describe the behavior and the properties of a system and its environment with respect to different time scales. TRIO* semantics is expressed by translation into a logical framework supporting the notion of time granularity. Such a semantics provides the executability of object oriented specifications.
