Numerous devices that either track hand gestures or provide haptic feedback have been developed with the aim of manipulating objects within Virtual Reality(VR) and Augmented Reality(AR) environments. However, these devices implement lengthy calibration processes to ease out individual differences. In this research, a wearable device that simultaneously recognizes hand gestures and outputs haptic feedback: UnlimitedHand is suggested. Photo-reflectors are placed over specific muscle groups on the forearm to read in hand gestures. For output, electrodes are placed over the same muscles to control the user's hand movements. Both sensors and electrodes target main muscle groups responsible for moving the hand. Since the positions of these muscle groups are common between humans, UnlimitedHand is able to reduce the time spent on performing calibration.
