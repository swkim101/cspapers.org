Clarkson University was the first university to issue incoming freshmen a desktop computer system. The program has been in place for three years; now all incoming undergraduates receive a desktop system. Last year, the university did a study to determine its computing needs for the next five years. Students were surveyed for their remarks regarding the computing facilities â€” including the desktop program. This paper notes some of those findings as well as some comments made by the faculty who were surveyed.
