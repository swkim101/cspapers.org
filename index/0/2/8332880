This paper describes a low power analogue VLSI neural network called Wattle. Wattle is a 10:6:4 three layer perceptron with multiplying DAC synapses and on chip switched capacitor neurons fabricated in 1.2Âµm CMOS. The on chip neurons facillitate variable gain per neuron and lower energy/connection than for previous designs. The intended application of this chip is Intra Cardiac Electrogram classification as part of an implantable pacemaker/defibrillator system. Measurements of the chip indicate that 10pJ per connection is achievable as part of an integrated system. Wattle has been successfully trained in loop on parity 4 and ICEG morphology classification problems.
