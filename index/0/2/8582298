We present an interactive and stable multi-contact dynamic simulation algorithm for rigid bodies. Our approach is based on fast frictional dynamics (FFD) [14], which is designed for large sets of non-convex rigid bodies. We use a new friction model that performs velocity-level multi-contact simulation using impulse decomposition. Moreover, we accurately handle friction at each contact point using contact distribution and frictional impulse solvers, which also account for relative motion. We evaluate our algorithm's performance on many complex multi-body benchmarks with thousands of contacts. In practice, our dynamics simulation algorithm takes a few milliseconds per timestep and exhibits more stable behaviors.
