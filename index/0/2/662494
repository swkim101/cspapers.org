Focused informational electronic mail lists, where end users as well as help staff members read and respond to messages, enable the users of a product or service to get timely answers to questions, while requiring fewer paid staff-hours than customer help desks. However, such lists can be plagued by (a) knowledge loss through user and staff turnover and absences, (b) frequently-asked or RTFM questions, and (c) misdirected administrative messages. This paper describes an approach to building a knowledge-based automated list moderator that partially solves these problems, filtering list traffic so that users with frequently asked or administrative questions can get answers without bothering the rest of the list members. INFO MOD employs an expandable base of question-answering knowledge about the product or service, providing tools to help maintain the knowledge.
