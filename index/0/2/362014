All the people have their own individual force ranges to feel the sense of touch and its minimum value is called light touch threshold (in short LTT). For instance, if a touching force is very weak, people do not know whether the object is contacted to their skin, even though it is pushing the skin already. This paper presents a novel apparatus to measure the LTT felt by each subject, which is referred to as Active von Frey (AvF) in this paper. As far as the authors know, the LTT measurement device is for the first time proposed in this paper. It is possible for the AvF to provide the touching force ranges from 1[mgf] to 400[mgf]. In order to provide an accurate touching force for the subject, D'Arsonval movement is chosen as an actuator to rotate a touching AvF pin. Both an electric current applied to the D'Arsonval movement and a rotational angle of AvF pin are utilized to calculate the touching force by the electro-mechanical statics. In addition, the image processing technique is used to measure the rotational angle of AvF pin. Finally we show that the LTTs are very different from individual to individual through the experimental results of 10 participants. We hope that the personalized parameters is used to design or control haptic or tele-operation devices for various applications.
