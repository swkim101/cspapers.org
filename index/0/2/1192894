This year ICSE is offering a mix of half-day and full day tutorials in addition to shorter technical briefings in selected domains. Whereas tutorials cover a wide range of mature topics of both academic and practical interest, technical briefings are intended to provide a compact introduction to the state-of-the-art in an emerging area.
