We introduce HandSCAPE, an orientation-aware digital tape measure, as an input device for digitizing field measurements, and visualizing the volume of the resulting vectors with computer graphics. Using embedded orientation-sensing hardware, HandSCAPE captures relevant vectors on each linear measurements and transmits this data wirelessly to a remote computer in real-time. To guide us in design, we have closely studied the intended users, their tasks, and the physical workplaces to extract the needs from real worlds. In this paper, we first describe the potential utility of HandSCAPE for three on-site application areas: archeological surveys, interior design, and storage space allocation. We then describe the overall system which includes orientation sensing, vector calculation, and primitive modeling. With exploratory usage results, we conclude our paper for interface design issues and future developments.
