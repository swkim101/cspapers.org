Applications that analyze, mine, and visualize large datasets are considered an important class of applications in many areas of science, engineering, and business. Queries commonly executed in data analysis applications often involve user-defined processing of data and application-specific data structures. If data analysis is employed in a collaborative environment, the data server should execute multiple such queries simultaneously to minimize the response time to clients. In this paper we present the design of a runtime system for executing multiple query workloads on a shared-memory machine. We describe experimental results using an application for browsing digitized microscopy images.
