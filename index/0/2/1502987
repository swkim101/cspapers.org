Online forums are becoming a popular resource in the state of the art question answering (QA) systems. Because of its nature as an online community, it contains more updated knowledge than other places. However, going through tedious and redundant posts to look for answers could be very time consuming. Most prior work focused on extracting only question answering sentences from user conversations. In this paper, we introduce the task of sentence dependency tagging. Finding dependency structure can not only help find answer quickly but also allow users to trace back how the answer is concluded through user conversations. We use linear-chain conditional random fields (CRF) for sentence type tagging, and a 2D CRF to label the dependency relation between sentences. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach performs well for sentence dependency tagging. This dependency information can benefit other tasks such as thread ranking and answer summarization in online forums.
