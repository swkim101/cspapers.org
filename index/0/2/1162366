This paper presents a new architecture that fully integrates local and global database management in a transparent for the user fashion. The architecture utilizes the workstationâ€™s local processing and uses the global mainframe for sharing and maintenance of consistency. Two access path distribution protocols distribute data and processing by localizing uncommon paths to their requesting workstations while avoiding repetition of globally shared paths in workstations. A new concurrency control protocol is used which has its foundation on the deferred update strategy, the concept of differential files, and a new lock for derived objects.
