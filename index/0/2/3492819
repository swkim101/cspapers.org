Parsons Problems is an effective Introductory Programming teaching tool that allows students to arrange code to form a functional program, reducing their cognitive load so they can focus on programming concepts. This demonstration shows how Parsons Problems can be used as a pedagogical strategy in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for introductory programming. A MOOC is a learning platform, where compilers and IDEs have already been embedded for CS students to immerse themselves in a single learning environment. The Parsons Problems package, js-parsons, available at https://github.com/js-parsons/js-parsons has been successfully integrated into the University of Adelaide's edX's MOOC platform as a component that can potentially be made available for other edX platforms. The demonstration presents the educators' interface to add new questions and receive students' results, along with students' perspective, including subgoals. The demonstration prototypes new feedback models when students encounter Parsons Problems errors, opening discussion up to the audience for opinions and input. This demonstration is intended for anyone wanting to know how to use Parsons Problems within MOOCs as a pedagogical approach; those seeking to incorporate MOOCs into their coursework with focused exercises; and those wanting to contribute to future Parsons Problems enhancements. Laptops are recommended, since participants will have the hands-on opportunity to evaluate the package during the demonstration.
