We show that the coverability problem in ν-Petri nets is complete for ‘double Ackermann’ time, thus closing an open complexity gap between an Ackermann lower bound and a hyper-Ackermann upper bound. The coverability problem captures the verification of safety properties in this nominal extension of Petri nets with name management and fresh name creation. Our completeness result establishes ν-Petri nets as a model of intermediate power among the formalisms of nets enriched with data, and relies on new algorithmic insights brought by the use of well-quasi-order ideals.Categories and Subject Descriptors F.2.2 [Analysis of Algorithms and Problem Complexity]: Nonnumerical Algorithms and Problems
