In this paper, an omni-directional steer-by-wire interface for four wheel independent steering vehicle is presented. The proposed steering interface is an extension of a traditional steering interface that provides three steering inputs. By combination of which, driver can control the vehicle in traditional way or omni-directionally without any mode switching operation. The reservation of the conventional steering behavior makes driver easy to adapt the novel steering interface. The force feedback controller is designed to synchronize the extended steering interface and the orientations of wheels so as to improve vehicle handling. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations are conducted to verify the hardware prototype and examine the proposed algorithms.
