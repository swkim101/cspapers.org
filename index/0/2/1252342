Within Valiantâ€™s model of learning as formalized by Kearns, we show that computable total predicates for two formally uncomputable problems (the classical Halting Problem, and the Halting Problem relative to a speci(cid:12)ed oracle) are formally learnable from examples, to arbitrarily high accuracy with arbitrarily high con(cid:12)dence, under any probability distribution. The Halting Problem relative to the oracle is learnable in time polynomial in the measures of accuracy, con(cid:12)dence, and the length of the learned predicate. The classical Halting Problem is learnable in expected time polynomialin the measures of accuracy, con(cid:12)dence, and the (1 (cid:0) (cid:15)=16) th percentile length and run-time of programs which do halt on their inputs (these quantities are always (cid:12)nite). Equivalently, the mean length and run-time may be substituted for the percentile values in the time complexity statement. The proofs are constructive. While the problems are learnable, they are not poly-nomially learnable, even though we do derive polynomial time bounds on the learning algo-rithm.
