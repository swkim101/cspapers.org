Inferring interests of users in social network is important for many applications such as personalized search, recommender systems and online advertising. Most previous studies inferred users' interests based on text posted in social network, which is usually not related to their interests. In this paper, we propose a modified topic model, Bi-Labeled LDA with a term weighting scheme, to extract interest tags for users in social network. The proposed model utilize only users' relationship information without requirement for text information, and incorporates supervision into traditional LDA. Specifically, we introduce method to extract tags for non-famous user through their relationship with famous users in Twitter, and study why a non-famous user follows famous users simultaneously. Comparison with state-of-the-art methods on real dataset shows that our method is far more superior in terms of precision and recall of the extracted tag set, and also more applicable for many personalized applications. Besides, we find that a reasonable term weighting scheme can actually improve the performance further.
