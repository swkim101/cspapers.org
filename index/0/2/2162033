This paper outlines our approach to the creation of annotated corpora for the purposes of Web Information Extraction, and presents the Web Annotation tool. This tool enables the annotation of Web pages from different domains and for different information extraction tasks providing a user-friendly interface to human annotators. Annotated information is stored in a representation format that can easily be exploited.
