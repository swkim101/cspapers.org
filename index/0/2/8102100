With the advent of newer power supply technologies, power sources with differing energy storage densities and recycling capabilities are becoming available. Combining the power supplies in a hierarchical way would create a unique opportunity for better matching the underlying resources to fluctuating application demands. Such a heterogeneous hybrid network of power supply components could address a variety of power needs and serve a much broader range of system loads with a high efficiency.
