With memory prices dropping and memory sizes increasing accordingly, a number of researchers are addressing the problem of designing high-performance database systems for managing memory-resident data. In this paper we address the recovery problem in the context of such a system. We argue that existing database recovery schemes fall short of meeting the requirements of such a system, and we present a new recovery mechanism which is designed to overcome their shortcomings. The proposed mechanism takes advantage of a few megabytes of reliable memory in order to organize recovery information on a per “object” basis. As a result, it is able to amortize the cost of checkpoints over a controllable number of updates, and it is also able to separate post-crash recovery into two phases—high-speed recovery of data which is needed immediately by transactions, and background recovery of the remaining portions of the database. A simple performance analysis is undertaken, and the results suggest our mechanism should perform well in a high-performance, memory-resident database environment.
