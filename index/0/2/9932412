This paper describes a new methodology for specifying and constructing complex interaction dialogs for the design of user interfaces. The method is new in that it promotes a decomposition of the interaction in terms of events in AND/OR graphs called Event-Decomposition Graphs (EDG). These Event-Decomposition Graphs can be progressively refined to capture the detailed semantics of the dialog. Multithreaded interaction can be composed by joining several Event-Decomposition Graphs together in a systematic way. In this paper we present a design tool for specifying and analyzing Event-Decomposition Graphs, and show that the combination of the notation and tool combines many of the capabilities of Context-Free Grammar- and Event-Notations while still providing the graphical view of Transition Network diagrams.
