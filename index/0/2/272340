Software adaptation has been proposed as a solution to mismatch between components through the generation of software pieces called adaptors. We propose a new behavioral adaptation approach for the generation of adaptor protocols. Compared to related work, it is fully automated and addresses the adaptor computation complexity thanks to process algebra encodings and on-the-fly techniques.
