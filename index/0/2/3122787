A novel autonomic communication framework is proposed for two-tiered heterogeneous sensor networks. The framework consists of an autonomic data-link protocol, LADD, and a communication scheduler. Networks consist of both sensing nodes and more powerful relaying nodes. LADD is able to adapt to time varying and asymmetric wireless links with minimal energy consumption. The distributed scheduling scheme provides fair and efficient co-ordination of communication streams over multiple radio hops.
