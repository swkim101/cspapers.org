This research aims to create a framework of transporting an object by multiple humanoid robots. In this work, a symmetric hybrid position/force control is adapted to two humanoid robots. The reference object position and attitude are given by an operator online, and the two humanoid robots generate its whole body motion to follow the reference object position properly. The result of proposed method is verified with a dynamics simulation.
