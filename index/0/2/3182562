Textbook discussions of synchronization seldom go beyond a brief introduction in terms of classical problems. This paper presents a simulator for the monitor solution of the dining philosophers problem that students can use to experimentally explore how such a solution might behave in practice. The simulator, which can be run remotely from a browser or can be downloaded for running locally, is written in Java so that it can be run on almost any system.
