VEEP, a VEctor Editor and Preparer, is an intelligent, interactive editor for the entry and update of test vectors which are the inputs to logic simulation. Since being introduced in Bell Laboratories and Western Electric in February 1981, VEEP has been able to increase the productivity of vector writers more than 25% by providing users a powerful system that reduces much of the job's drudgery, and allows for quick specification and updating of tests.
