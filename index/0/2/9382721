Expressive DLs usually have very high worst case complexity while tractable DLs are restricted in terms of expressive power. This brings a new challenge: can users use expressive DLs to build their ontologies and still enjoy the efficient services as in tractable languages. In this paper, we present a soundness preserving approximate reasoning framework for TBox reasoning in OWL2-DL. The ontologies are encoded into EL++ with additional data structures. A tractable algorithm is presented to classify such approximation by realizing more and more inference patterns. Preliminary evaluation shows that our approach can classify existing benchmarks in large scale efficiently with a high recall.
