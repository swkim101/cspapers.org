The real time computation of motion from real images using a single chip with integrated sensors is a hard problem. We present two analog VLSI schemes that use pulse domain neuromorphic circuits to compute motion. Pulses of variable width, rather than graded potentials, represent a natural medium for evaluating temporal relationships. Both algorithms measure speed by timing a moving edge in the image. Our first model is inspired by Reichardt's algorithm in the fly and yields a non-monotonic response vs. velocity curve. We present data from a chip that implements this model. Our second algorithm yields a monotonic response vs. velocity curve and is currently being translated into silicon.
