Many Computer Science programs are mainly concerned with hardware and software theory. Computer Software especially is studied with very little application.
 American Technological University has attempted to breach the gap in the area of qualified software computer science graduates by tailoring the courses to allow students to study or write, and/or modify operating systems. This is accomplished by selected course work and “hands on” use of the 370/145. Junior, senior and graduate level students are allowed to sign up for blocks of time between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Monday through Friday when available and on most week-ends. A description of courses, the philosophy of teaching, the computer facilities, and a critique of our former students is presented.
