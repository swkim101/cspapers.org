This paper will discuss the current state of multi-gigabit wireless communications for very high bandwidth, short haul connectivity for education, research, and government deployments. It will address spectrum availability and suitability for multi-gigabit services, including the 1 to 10 Gbps GigaBeam has committed to and the 100 Gbps possibility the company is now exploring. The talk will include the technology evolution that has enabled these wireless data rates allowing fiber-like throughput particularly where it serves the difficulties presented by "last mile" fiber connectivity. There will be a focus on current and soon to be implemented applications and a look at models of how the university, military, government and related IT enterprises are using this technology today. Special attention will be paid to NAS, SAN, remote computing, grid computing and other similar applications.
