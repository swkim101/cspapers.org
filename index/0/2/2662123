We describe an "unplugged" activity that exposes data structures and algorithms involved in image representation and compression, using multi-colored Post-It NotesÂ®. We use Post-It's to illustrate how color images can be encoded and decoded so they can be stored efficiently on a computer and/or transmitted efficiently across a network. This provides an intuitive illustration of bitmaps and the GIF (Graphics Interchange Format), optimized with Lempel-Ziv compression. The algorithms are simple to explain and comprehend, and simultaneously appeal to the participants' sense of art and creativity while demystifying advanced computing concepts and computer graphics. We describe two sample exercises which make use of these concepts. In one exercise, teams of participants create messages with Post-It's, encode them and send them to other teams for decoding. In another exercise, a larger image is encoded and broken into letter paper-sized smaller images to be decoded and reassembled by a group. This activity has proven to engage participants with a wide variety of backgrounds, and provides the background needed for further exploration and discussion of Computer Science Principles, specifically the Big Ideas of Creativity, Abstraction, Data and Information, and Algorithms.
