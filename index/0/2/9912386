We propose an online domain adaptation method for the deformable part-based model (DPM). The online domain adaptation is based on a two-level hierarchical adaptation tree, which consists of instance models in the leaf nodes and a category model at the root node. Moreover, combined with a multiple object tracking procedure (MOT), our proposal neither requires target-domain annotated data nor revisiting the source-domain data for performing the source-to-target domain adaptation of the DPM. From a practical point of view this means that, given a source-domain DPM and new video for training on a new domain without object annotations, our procedure outputs a new DPM adapted to the domain represented by the video. As proof-of-concept we apply our proposal to the challenging task of pedestrian detection. In this case, each instance model is an exemplar classifier trained online with only one pedestrian per frame. The pedestrian instances are collected by MOT and the hierarchical model is constructed dynamically according to the pedestrian trajectories. Our experimental results show that the adapted model achieves the accuracy of recent supervised domain adaptation methods (i.e., requiring manually annotated target-domain data), and improves the source model more than 10 percentage points.
