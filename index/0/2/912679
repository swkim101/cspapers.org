Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) are increasingly used as data collectors for Wireless Sensors Networks (WSN) on the ground. Most of current research proposes optimizations for itinerary creation for a single UAV. Contrary to this, our work proposes a distributed algorithm for collecting WSN data using a dynamic set of UAVs, that takes into account that UAVs leave or join the group due to recharging or malfunctions. In our work, we consider that the UAVs only have medium-range communication capability (a few meters) to deliver collected data, similar to the assumptions in related work. Compared to the costly and non-real-time Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)-approach our algorithm delivers approximately 3% more efficient sensor visiting on certain scenarios without using the optimized tour.
