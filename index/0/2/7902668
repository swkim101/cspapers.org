The current work adapts the optimal tree pruning algorithm(BFOS) introduced by Breiman et al.(1984) and extended by Chou et al.(1989) to the multi-document summarization task. BFOS algorithm is used to eliminate redundancy which is one of the main issues in multi-document summarization. Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithm(HAC) is employed to detect the redundancy. The tree designed by HAC algorithm is successively pruned with the optimal tree pruning algorithm to optimize the distortion vs. rate cost of the resultant tree. Rate parameter is defined to be the number of the sentences in the leaves of the tree. Distortion is the sum of the distances between the representative sentence of the cluster at each node and the other sentences in the same cluster. The sentences assigned to the leaves of the resultant tree are included in the summary. The performance of the proposed system assessed with the Rouge-1 metric is seen to be better than the performance of the DUC-2002 winners on DUC-2002 data set.
