Given the popularity of PHP frameworks used in developing web-based applications, a comparative study is conducted to determine which framework is best suited for incorporation into the curriculum of an undergraduate software engineering course that uses project-based learning. The top six PHP frameworks (Zend, Yii, CakePHP, CodeIgniter, PRADO, and Symphony) were initially considered and then narrowed down to two (CakePHP and CodeIgniter) based on their alignment with common functionality in previous class projects, framework complexity for those new to frameworks (learning curve), and developer friendliness (availability of documentation and online resources). An in-depth comparative study is conducted by developing a functionally-equivalent web application using each of the two frameworks as well as plain PHP (no framework). This work was motivated by the difficulties that were encountered in an evolving, content-rich software engineering course and discusses the educational changes that were made to align student learning with sound software engineering principles and current software development practices used in the computing industry.
