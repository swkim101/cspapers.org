A mobile stationless multi-hop packet radio network consists of a set of mobile and geographically distributed nodes (e.g., computers, terminals, etc., equipped with radio units), called packet radio units (PRUs), which communicate using a shared broadcast radio channel without a central station control. In this paper we consider the routing in highly mobile stationless multi-hop packet radio networks, We provide a validation of the use of the tier-ring architecture, and we present a scheme for handling mobile packet radio units in stationless environment by the use of a link-traversal approach when a node (packet radio unit) is no longer in possession of an outgoing link to communicate with the rest of the network.
