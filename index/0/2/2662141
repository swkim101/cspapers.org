This paper introduces a new security problem in which individuals movement traces (in terms of accurate routes) can be inferred from just a series of mutual contact records and the map of the area in which they roam around. Such contact records may be obtained through the bluetooth communication on mobile phones. We present an approach that solve the trace inference problem in reasonable time, and analyze some properties of the inference algorithm.
