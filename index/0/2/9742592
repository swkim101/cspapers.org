Complexity, cost, and power requirements for actuation of individual robots are large factors in limiting the size of robotic swarms. Here we present a prototype robotic system that allows for externally powered motion in 2D without sacrificing individual autonomy, which simplifies the robot hardware, possibly enabling larger swarm sizes. This is accomplished using a table surface that is moving in an orbital fashion, and where robots can move to any point on the table surface simply through a series of carefully timed attachment and detachment steps. We present a model for the robot's motion, and use this model to create a motion controller that allows the robot to move from its current position to any other position on the table in approximately a straight line. We show this controller working in simulation as well as on an experimental hardware system.
