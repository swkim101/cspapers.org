Recently with a push towards "IoTification", the world foresees a sharp rise in the number of devices with wireless networking capabilities. It is inevitable to anticipate an enormous increase in both self and cross-technology interference leaving a very challenging wireless communication medium at one's disposal. Maintaining robust data transmission in this increasingly hostile 2.4GHz band without incurring significant additional energy consumption is a basic concern. Towards this end we propose a suite of protocols (Syncast and Oppcast) exploiting capture effect over multi-channels and a careful knit of spatio-temporal and channel diversity to provide robust data transmission for multiple communication paradigms (Collection and Dissemination).
