This paper describes an initial investigation of how different conditions for conducting a team programming exercise impact learning. We conducted a series of in-depth case studies on the use of various communication technologies and compared them with face-to-face case studies of team programming. We explored how these communication technologies can help improve students' learning. We summarize the findings from these studies and give guidance to instructors and to tool designers on how future tools can be improved to support collaborative learning in team programming.
