Semiconductor industry faces a continuous challenge to decrease the transistor size as well as to increase the yield by eliminating defect sources. One of the sources of particle defects is ultra pure water used in different production tools at different stages of processing. In this paper, particle count data measured in ultra pure water is related to the yield of two large size products. An impact of nanoparticle present in ultra pure water on yield of up to 4-6 % has been found in two different products.
