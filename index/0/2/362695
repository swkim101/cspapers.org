A star schema is very popular for modeling data warehouses and data marts. Therefore, it is important that a database system which is used for implementing such a data warehouse or data mart is able to efficiently handle operations on such a schema. In this paper we will describe how one of these operations, the join operation --- probably the most important operation --- is implemented in the IBM Informix Extended Parallel Server (XPS).
