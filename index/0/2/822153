Rialto is a design framework that allows separating the description of a control application for wireless sensor networks from its physical network implementation. The methodology supported by Rialto consists of two steps: An application is described in a Rialto Model in terms of logical components queries and commands. The description is translated into an internal format called RialtoNet that is used to explore all the possible sequence of queries and commands that the application may lead to. The RialtoNet is executed and a set of constraints on the communication and sensing infrastructure is generated.The semantics of RialtoNet is based on a MoC that takes inspiration from Kahn Process Networks, but blocking rules are conveniently modified to exploit the domain specificity.Our approach offers a clear interface to the application designer as Rialto automatically bridges the gap between application and implementation. Hence, Rialto facilitates the adoption of wireless sensor networks technology in application domains, such as industrial control, where the application designer is not a communication engineer.
