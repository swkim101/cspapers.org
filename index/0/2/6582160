In this paper, we propose a new shape-shifting system. Shape-shifting is achieved by the integration of arranged identical transformable units. These are self-folding origami modules that transform their shape from a cubic to a flat shape, and vice versa, similarly to a three-dimensional (3D) morphing pixel. By changing the shape of individual modules, the system can generate desired shapes. Each module is based on a modified Kresling pattern, which has bi-stability during deployment so that it can maintain its shape in both states without any actuator force. Also, it can rapidly and reversibly transform its shape via folding and unfolding motions that are generated by a low-profile torsional SMA wire actuator positioned at fold lines. This approach is a hybrid of the modular and folding approaches so that the system can generate shape-shifting without complicated communication methodology between modules and bulky infrastructure, and has fast, compact and lightweight hardware. We demonstrate performance with a 3Ã—3 matrix form of this module (40 mm side length) that can make five different shapes and it required only 15 seconds per transformation. This new shape-shifting system could be applied to design multi-functional self-folding origami such as a morphing 3D map.
