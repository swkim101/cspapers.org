Technical support contributes 17% of the total cost of ownership of today's desktop PCs [25]. An important element of technical support is troubleshooting miscon-figured applications. Misconfiguration troubleshooting is particularly challenging, because configuration information is shared and altered by multiple applications. 
 
In this paper, we present a novel troubleshooting system: PeerPressure, which uses statistics from a set of sample machines to diagnose the root-cause misconfigurations on a sick machine. This is in contrast with methods that require manual identification on a healthy machine for diagnosing misconfigurations [30]. The elimination of this manual operation makes a significant step towards automated misconfiguration troubleshooting. 
 
In PeerPressure, we introduce a ranking metric for misconfiguration candidates. This metric is based on empirical Bayesian estimation. We have prototyped a PeerPressure troubleshooting system and used a database of 87 machine configuration snapshots to evaluate its performance. With 20 real-world troubleshooting cases, PeerPressure can effectively pinpoint the root-cause misconfigurations for 12 of these cases. For the remaining cases, PeerPressure significantly narrows down the number of root-cause candidates by three orders of magnitude.
