This paper presents a statistical characterization of one Human Body Communication (HBC) channel model based on empirical data. The measurements which were conducted on a considerable amount of people guarantee the precision of the model. An adequate evaluation about the path loss, delay spread is convenience and appropriate to design the advanced wideband HBC system.
