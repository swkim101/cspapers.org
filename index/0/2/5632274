We prove that for every prime <i>p</i> there exists a (0, 1)-matrix <i>M</i> of size <i>t</i><sub><i>p</i></sub>(<i>n, m</i>) x <i>n</i>, where

 such that every <i>m</i> columns of <i>M</i> are linearly independent over Z<sub><i>p</i></sub>, the field of integers modulo <i>p</i> (and therefore over any field of characteristic <i>p</i> and over the real numbers field R). In coding theory this matrix is a parity-check (0, 1)-matrix over Z<sub><i>p</i></sub> of a linear code of minimal distance <i>m</i> + 1. Using the Hamming bound (for <i>p</i> < <i>m</i>) and information theoretic argument (for <i>p</i> ≥ <i>m</i>) it can be shown that the above bound is tight.
 We show that a random <i>t</i><sub><i>p</i></sub>(<i>n, m</i>) x <i>n</i> (0, 1)-matrix over Z<sub><i>p</i></sub> satisfies the above with a high probability. This requires <i>n</i>·<i>t</i><sub><i>p</i></sub>(<i>n, m</i>) random bits. To reduce the number of random bits, one can use <i>n</i> random variables that are <i>m</i>-wise independent. This gives a construction with <i>O</i>((<i>m</i><sup>2</sup> log<sup>2</sup> <i>n</i>)/log <i>m</i>) random bits. In this paper we use a new technique that gives for any <i>m</i> = <i>n</i><sup><i>c</i></sup> where <i>c</i> is a constant, a construction that uses <i>O</i>(<i>m</i><sup>1+∈</sup>) random bits for any constant <i>c</i>. Each row in the constructed matrix is a tensor product of a (constant) <i>d</i> (0, 1)-vectors of size <i>n</i><sup>1/<i>d</i></sup>.
 This solves the following open problems:
 • <b>Coin Weighing Problem:</b> Suppose that <i>n</i> coins are given among which there are at most <i>m</i> counterfeit coins of arbitrary weights. There is a non-adaptive algorithm that finds the counterfeit coins and their weights in <i>t</i>(<i>n, m</i>) = <i>O</i>((<i>m</i> log <i>n</i>)/log <i>m</i>) weighings.
 Previous algorithm, [CK08], solves the problem (with the same number of weighings) only for weights between <i>n</i><sup>−<i>a</i></sup> and <i>n</i><sup><i>b</i></sup> for constants <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> and finds the counterfeit coins but not their weights.
 • <b>Reconstructing Graph from Additive Queries:</b> Suppose that <i>G</i> is an unknown weighted graph with <i>n</i> vertices and <i>m</i> edges. There exists a non-adaptive algorithm that finds the edges of <i>G</i> and their weights in <i>O</i>(<i>t</i>(<i>n, m</i>)) additive queries.
 Previous algorithms, [CK08, BM09], solve the problem only for weights between <i>n</i><sup>−<i>a</i></sup> and <i>n</i><sup><i>b</i></sup> for constants <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> and find the edges but not their weights.
 • <b>Signature Coding Problem:</b> Consider <i>n</i> stations and at most <i>m</i> of them want to send messages from Z<sub><i>p</i></sub> through an adder channel, that is, a channel that its output is the sum of the messages. Then all messages can be sent (encoded and decoded) with <i>O</i>(<i>t</i>(<i>n, m</i>)) transmissions. Previous algorithms, [BG07], run with the same number of transmissions only for messages in {0, 1}.
 Simple information theoretic arguments show that all the above bounds are tight.
