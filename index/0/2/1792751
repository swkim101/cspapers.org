Contemporary parser research is, to a large extent, focused on statistical parsers and deep-unification-based parsers. This paper describes an alternative, hybrid architecture in which an ATN-like parser, augmented by many preference tests, builds on the results of a fast chunker. The combination is as efficient as most stochastic parsers, and accuracy is close and continues to improve. These results raise questions about the practicality of deep unification for symbolic parsing.
