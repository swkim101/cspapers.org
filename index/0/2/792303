We propose a new transductive label propagation method, termed Adaptive Neighborhood Propagation (Adaptive-NP) by joint L2,1-norm regularized sparse coding, for semi-supervised classification. To make the predicted soft labels more accurate for predicting the labels of samples and to avoid the tricky process of choosing the optimal neighborhood size or kernel width for graph construction, Adaptive-NP seamlessly integrates sparse coding and neighborhood propagation into a unified framework. That is, the sparse reconstruction error and classification error are combined for joint minimization, which clearly differs from traditional methods that explicitly separate graph construction and label propagation into independent steps, which may result in inaccurate predictions. Note that our Adaptive-NP alternately optimize the sparse codes and soft labels matrices, where the sparse codes are used as adaptive weights for neighborhood propagation at each iteration, so the tricky process of determining neighborhood size or kernel width is avoided. Besides, for enhancing sparse coding, we use the L2,1-norm constraint on the sparse coding coefficients and the reconstruction error at the same time for delivering more accurate and robust representations. Extensive simulations show that our model can deliver state-of-the-art performances on several public datasets for classification.
