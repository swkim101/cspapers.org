Recent advances in computer and wireless communication technologies have increased interest in push-based information systems in which a server repeatedly broadcasts data to clients through a broadband channel. In this paper, assuming an environment where clients in push-based information systems construct ad hoc networks, we propose three caching strategies in which clients cooperatively cache broadcast data items. These strategies shorten the average response time for data access by replacing cached items based on their access frequencies, the network topology, and the time remaining until each item is broadcast next. We also show the results of simulation experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed strategies.
