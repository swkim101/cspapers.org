This interactive presentation describes LexNet, a graphical environment for graph-based NLP developed at the University of Michigan. LexNet includes LexRank (for text summarization), biased LexRank (for passage retrieval), and TUMBL (for binary classification). All tools in the collection are based on random walks on lexical graphs, that is graphs where different NLP objects (e.g., sentences or phrases) are represented as nodes linked by edges proportional to the lexical similarity between the two nodes. We will demonstrate these tools on a variety of NLP tasks including summarization, question answering, and prepositional phrase attachment.
