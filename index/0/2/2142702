Zero-shot learning for visual recognition has received much interest in the most recent years. However, the semantic gap across visual features and their underlying semantics is still the biggest obstacle in zero-shot learning. To fight off this hurdle, we propose an effective Low-rank Embedded Semantic Dictionary learning (LESD) through ensemble strategy. Specifically, we formulate a novel framework to jointly seek a low-rank embedding and semantic dictionary to link visual features with their semantic representations, which manages to capture shared features across different observed classes. Moreover, ensemble strategy is adopted to learn multiple semantic dictionaries to constitute the latent basis for the unseen classes. Consequently, our model could extract a variety of visual characteristics within objects, which can be well generalized to unknown categories. Extensive experiments on several zero-shot benchmarks verify that the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches.
