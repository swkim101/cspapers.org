This paper proposes a distributed shared memory, Window Real-Object (WROL which facilitates the construction of GUI applications with a set of cooperating parallel units running on multiple machines. To support unit cooperation, the WRO provides a shared data structure storing interaction objects displayed in a window among multiple machines. It also provides an event mechanism called absfrac[ everm to support control transfer among these units. Abstract events are generated when the shared data structure is updated, and invoke the units sharing the WRo. Both the function and mechanism of the WRO are tailored for GUI applications. The WRO provides spatia~ addressing to the data structure, which is implemented efficiently using an R-tree. It also adopts aflli-replication algorithm as a shared-memory coherenee scheme. Consequently, the WRO can be implemented with adequate performance on a usual workstation environment.
