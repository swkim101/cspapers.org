In their "Generation: CS" report this past year, The Computing Research Association detailed the explosive growth of computer science majors across both large and small institutions calling it "larger today than any time previously". Using data from The Taulbee Survey they show a 500% increase in the number of majors in computer science, but only a 50% increase in full-time faculty. Unfortunately, this growth has major consequences outside the classroom setting. The ability for faculty to engage in meaningful advising relationships with students has been severely impacted by this record growth. One solution could be to hire staff to assist students in course selection and degree requirements, but meaningful mentorship is much more than checking boxes and exemptions. Can we be effective advisors when advising loads have skyrocketed? In 2004, The CRA, lists effective mentoring as one of the challenges faced by broadening participation in computer science. In particular, they advocate for better training for mentors. Now faced with extreme ratios the need for creative mentoring practices is paramount. This BOF will provide a platform to discuss and share solutions from a variety of institutions. Questions such as: "How can we identify students who would like to do research and continue to graduate school?", "How do we expose students to independent learning in large classes?", "Can we leverage peer mentoring?" "How can we make advising better?" "What processes can be automated?".
