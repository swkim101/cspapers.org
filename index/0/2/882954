In the development of disciplines addressing dynamics, a major role was played by the assumption that processes can be modelled by introducing state properties, called potentialities, anticipating in which respect a next state will be different. A second assumption often made is that these state properties can be related to other state properties, called reducers. The current paper proposes a philosophical framework in terms of potentialities and their reducers to obtain a common philosophical foundation for methods in AI and Cognitive Science to model dynamics. This framework provides a unified philosophical foundation for numerical, symbolic, and hybrid approaches.
