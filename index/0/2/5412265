Uncertain data widely exists in various applications due to several reasons. First, data generated by automated information extraction and data analysis tools is error-prone [5]. Second, data integrated from various sources is often uncertain or even conflicting, depending on the trustworthiness of its sources and the quality of the data mapping procedures [9]. Furthermore, experimental results and sensor data are observed in conditions that may be subject to a range of variability in natural environment, mechanical defects, contaminated samples, etc. [3]. The abundance of uncertain data demands an effective database management system that records our confidence about the data as probabilities, supports efficient query evaluation, and provides confidence indicators for query results. Toward this goal, a lot of work has been done to manage uncertain data in relational databases. Recently, there is a growing interest in designing XML-based models to represent uncertain data due to the following reasons [8, 9]. First, XML can represent data uncertainty of different levels more naturally and succinctly compared with the relational data models. Second, the semi-structure and flexibility of XML data model fits well in applications such as information extraction and data integration where data is often uncertain. Several XML-based probabilistic data models of different expressiveness have been proposed [8, 4, 9]. One common feature of those models is that the probability of a node is assigned conditioned on the existence of its parent node. Naturally, a node may exist only if its parent node exists, therefore these models present a good conceptual representation for uncertain data. However, as we will see, this intuitive model may incur big overhead on query processing performance.
