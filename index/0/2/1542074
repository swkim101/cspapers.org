This paper presents a method that integrates MATLAB into a distributed behavioral robotics architecture. The architecture is written in Java and uses the Jini platform for distributed object registration, lookup and remote method invocation. The method described here can be used to integrate MATLAB into any Java-based behavioral architecture. The form of the integration allows a running MATLAB workspace to be accessed as a distributed object within the larger Java/Jini-based architecture. This is beneficial because MATLAB scripts and functions may be called in interpreted form and can make full use of MATLAB tool boxes and have access to the MATLAB workspace environment. This is not possible when MATLAB scripts are compiled into stand-alone C++, Java or p-code. The use of the architecture is demonstrated on an iRobot ATRV-JR robot and remote computer workstation. Experiments have been conducted to quantify GPS and odometry errors in outdoor environments using automated methods supported by the distributed architecture.
