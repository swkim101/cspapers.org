Problem We study the following maximization prob lem called the Independent subset of Rectangles IR problem We are a given a set S ofN positively weighted axis parallel rectangles such that for each axis the pro jection of a rectangle on this axis does not enclose that of another De ne two rectangles to be independent if for each axis the projection of one rectangle does not overlap that of another The goal of the IR problem is to select a subset S S of independent rectangles of total maximum weight Motivation A fundamental problem in Computa tional Molecular Biology is to elucidate similarities be tween sequences See for detailed case A corner stone result in this area is that given two strings of length n and m there are local alignment algorithms that will score pairs of substrings for similarity ac cording to various biologically meaningful scoring func tions and we can pull out all similar or high scor ing substring pairs Having found the high scoring substring pairs a global description of the similarity be tween two sequences is obtained by choosing the disjoint subset of these pairs of highest total score This prob lem was formulated as the IR problem by Bafna et al with each output substring pair being represented as a rectangle Previous Results Bafna et al proved this problem to be NP Hard and presented an N time approx imation algorithm with a performance ratio of The current best approximation algorithm for the IR problem is due to Berman which has a performance ratio of for any constant and takes N running time Construct the con ict graph of the input
