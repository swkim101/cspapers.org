With the extension of spatial database applications, field oriented systems emerge as an important research issue in order to deal with continuous natural phenomena during the last years. It however has a large volume of data and efficient indexing methods for field data are necessary to overcome the performance obstacle. In special, we introduce indexing methods for field value queries (i.e. searching some regions where the temperature is more 20 degrees). We introduce the concept of subfield and show how we make use of this concept to index field values in field oriented systems. We present two implementation methods based on Quadtree space subdivision. We modify traditional linear quadtree implementation method for field value query processing using subfields. We analyze the performance of our methods. Experimentation with real terrain data shows that proposed indexing methods improve the query processing time of field value queries in comparison with the case of no indexing method.
