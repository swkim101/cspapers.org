This paper presents a wake-up receiver (WuRx) for wireless sensor networks, which can wake up devices connected to WuRx when it receives RF signals. The proposed WuRx consists of a LC passive voltage booster at 920 MHz, a voltage multiplier and a Schmitt trigger comparator. In the simulation, the sensitivity is -30 dBm and the power consumption is 6.7 nW of the comparator. The voltage multiplier is designed for 65 nm SOTB (Silicon on Thin Buried Oxide) technology for low voltage operation.
