This paper explores a novel associative low power operation where instructions govern the operation of on-chip regulators in real time. Based on explicit association between long delay instruction patterns and hardware performance, an instruction based power management scheme is developed with energy models formulated for deriving the energy efficiency of the associative operation. The proposed system scheme is demonstrated using a low power microprocessor design with an integrated switched capacitor regulator in 45nm CMOS technology. Simulations on benchmark programs show a power saving of around 14% from the proposed scheme. A novel compiler optimization strategy is also proposed to further improve the energy efficiency.
