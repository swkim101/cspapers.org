There are a large number of projects that aim to use mobile computing technologies to help address transport related issues such as proving better travel information. These projects can often benefit from experience sampling in which mobile devices are used to collect in-situ user feedback on either the mobile computing application or the journey itself. In this demonstration we show elements of the Reflect toolkit, an experience sampling toolkit designed to help survey traveller experiences in-situ using mobile smartphones. The Reflect experience sampling toolkit differs from previous experience sampling research such as MyExperience [1] by specifically focusing on supporting behavioral researchers in the transportation research domain. It enables simple and rapid configuration and deployment of surveys on modern mobile platforms to crowd-source new forms of travel experience data.
