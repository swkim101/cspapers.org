In this paper we propose a novel computational method to infer visual saliency in images. The method is based on the idea that salient objects should have local characteristics that are different than the rest of the scene, being edges, color or shape. By using a novel operator, these characteristics are combined to infer global information. The obtained information is used as a weighting for the output of a segmentation algorithm so that the salient object in the scene can easily be distinguished from the background. The proposed approach is fast and it does not require any learning. The experimentation shows that the system can enhance interesting objects in images and it is able to correctly locate the same object annotated by humans with an F-measure of 85.61% when the object size is known, and 79.19% when the object size is unknown, improving the state of the art performance on a public dataset.
