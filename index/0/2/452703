Autonet is a switch-based local area network using 100 Mbit/s full-duplex point-to-point links. Crossbar switches are interconnected to other switches and to host controllers in an arbitrary pattern. Switch hardware uses the destination address in each packet to determine the proper outgoing link for the next step in the path from source to destination. Autonet automatically recalculates these forwarding paths in response to failures and additions of network components. This automatic reconfiguration allows the network to continue normal operation without need of human intervention. Reconfiguration occurs quickly enough that higher-level protocols are not disrupted. This paper describes the fault monitoring and topology acquisition mechanisms that are central to automatic reconfiguration in Autonet.
