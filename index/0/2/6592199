Additive manufacturing (AM) processes based on mask image projection such as digital micro-mirror devices (DMD) have the potential to be fast and inexpensive. More and more research and commercial systems have been developed based on such digital devices. However, a digital micro-mirror device such as a digital light processing (DLP) projector has limited accuracy and resolution. Based on the principle of pixel blending, we present a novel AM process by using multiple DMDs to significantly improve the accuracy and resolution of built components. In order to achieve the desired pixel blending result for a given layer, it is critical to plan the mask images that will be used by the multiple projectors. In addition, the mask image planning needs to compensate the calibrated light intensity in a projection image that is usually non-uniform and non-linear. We present a general optimized pixel blending method based on direct discrete search (DDS). Its mathematic model and computing method for the mask image planning are presented. Various test cases have been performed to verify its effectiveness and efficiency.Copyright Â© 2010 by ASME
