Manipulation planning from high-level task specifications, even though highly desirable, is a challenging problem. The large dimensionality of manipulators and complexity of task specifications make the problem computationally intractable. This work introduces a manipulation planning framework with linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. The use of LTL as the specification language allows the expression of rich and complex manipulation tasks. The framework deals with the state-explosion problem through a novel abstraction technique. Given a robotic system, a workspace consisting of obstacles, manipulable objects, and locations of interest, and a co-safe LTL specification over the objects and locations, the framework computes a motion plan to achieve the task through a synergistic multi-layered planning architecture. The power of the framework is demonstrated through case studies, in which the planner efficiently computes plans for complex tasks. The case studies also illustrate the ability of the framework in intelligently moving away objects that block desired executions without requiring backtracking.
