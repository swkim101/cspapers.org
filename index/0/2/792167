A new Robotic Assembly Skill (RAS) modeling framework is proposed. An assembly skill is a primitive that encapsulates the capabilities to coordinate, control and supervise an elementary robot task. To gain reusability of a primitive in alike robot tasks, the primitives are represented as generic templates that are parametrized for each situation with data from an assembly specification. A skill is represented in two ways, namely as a trajectory describing compliant motions in pose-wrench space and as a finite state machine. This approach comes with the potential to simplify robot programming and to improve robustness in robotic assembly due to inherent quality checking. The approach is implemented on an ABB YuMi robot performing the assembly of a programmable logic controller (PLC) I/O module.
