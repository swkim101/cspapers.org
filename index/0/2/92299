Computing the least common subsumer (lcs) has proved to be useful in a variety of different applications. Previous work on the lcs has concentrated on description logics that either allow for number restrictions or for existential restrictions. Many applications, however, require to combine these constructors. In this work, we present an lcs algorithm for the description logic ALEN, which allows for both constructors, thereby correcting previous algorithms proposed in the literature.
