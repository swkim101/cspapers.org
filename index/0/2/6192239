We show that every weighted connected graph <i>G</i> contains as a subgraph a spanning tree into which the edges of <i>G</i> can be embedded with average stretch <i>O</i> (log<sup>2</sup> <i>n</i> log log <i>n</i>). Moreover, we show that this tree can be constructed in time <i>O</i> (<i>m</i> log<sup>2</sup><i>n</i>) in general, and in time <i>O</i> (<i>m</i>log <i>n</i>) if the input graph is unweighted. The main ingredient in our construction is a novel graph decomposition technique.Our new algorithm can be immediately used to improve the running time of the recent solver for symmetric diagonally dominant linear systems of Spielman and Teng from <i>m</i>2<sup>(<i>O</i>âˆšlog<i>n</i>log log <i>n</i>)</sup> to <i>m</i> log <sup><i>O</i>(1)</sup><i>n</i> and to <i>O</i> (<i>n</i> log<sup>2</sup><i>n</i> log log <i>n</i>) when the system is planar. Our result can also be used to improve several earlier approximation algorithms that use low-stretch spanning trees.
