This workshop is an extension and continuation of a series of SC APART workshops. It is designed to bring together people working on performance analysis and optimization for parallel systems and grids. The interests in performance evaluation as well as in performance analysis tools are high among SC attendees. The workshop will complement the SC conference to gather experts in the field and provide a mean to meet the demand. The speakers are invited only. Attendance is free for all Supercomputing participants. In the past years, the APART workshop was always held on the last day of the SC conferences and usually had about 40 participants. The previous SC conferences provided us with a room and beamer for free. We will focus performance issues on both supercomputers and Grid, and invite speakers from related projects all over the world. The program of previous APART workshops can be found at www.fz-juelich.de/apart.
