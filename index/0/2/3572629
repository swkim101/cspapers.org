Now more than ever, students with disabilities are participating in computer science (CS) education. As CS increasingly becomes a part of the general curriculum in grades K-8, ensuring that these learning experiences are equitable and accessible for a wide range of learners may help broaden the diversity of individuals who choose to engage in computing experiences throughout their schooling and into their professional lives (Qualls & Sherrell, 2010). Therefore, it is essential to identify pedagogical approaches that lower barriers for students with disabilities and give teachers new tools to help those students succeed. Initial findings will be presented from a National Science Foundation STEM+C project derived from a series of qualitative case studies about challenges faced by K-8 students with disabilities in CS education. These findings have been converted to practitioner-oriented pedagogy briefs, written in the form of vignettes, and grounded in our own research findings as well as special education best practice. These pedagogy briefs are disseminated to practitioners and used for professional development and intervention work. Current topics include: Universal Design for Learning, project planning, co-teaching, working with paraeducators, and promoting student collaboration. Pedagogy briefs will be available and can be found on the Creative Technology Research Lab (CTRL) website: http://ctrl.illinois.education.edu
