We focus on a heterogeneous robotic system of decentralized autonomous agents with a leader, which we call "super-mechano-colony (SMC)". It has characteristics of both hierarchical and distributed control systems. This paper explains the basic concept and a physical test bed of SMC, and discusses an example, specifically planetary rovers, for SMC.
