This paper is concerned with the problem of generalization heuristics, which are incorporated into our verification system for Prolog programs. Two kinds of generalization are discussed, that is, a mechanical generalisation and an intelligent generalization. We show that the mechanical generalization used in Boyer-Moore*s theorem prover (BMTP) can be performed by the simplification rule of our verification system, as well as in the case of cross-fertilization. To the intelligent generalization heuristic, which is not employed in BMTP, we give a generalization scheme which is naturally incorporated into our inference system of the extended-execution style of the Prolog interpreter, and which proves to be effective also for flawed induction schemes.
