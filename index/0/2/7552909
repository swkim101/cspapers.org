This paper introduces an intuitive search environment for casual and novice Chinese users over Internet. The system consists of four components, a concept network, a query reformulation model, a standard search engine, and an automatic summarizer. When the user enters one or more fairly general and vague terms, the search engine returns an initial answer set, and at the same time pipes the query to the concept network that connects thousands of conceptual nodes, each referring to a specific concept for a given domain and pointing to a number of associated conceptual terms. If the concept is located in the network, the related conceptual terms are displayed. The user has the option of using one or more of these specific terms to reformulate the next round of searches. Such search iterations continue until the user' s ultimate information seeking goal is reached. For each search iteration, auto summarizer presents the main theme of the document retrieved and an optional text-to-speech engine can read out the output summary if the user prefers.
