The increasing popularity of resource exchange through peer-to-peer networks has encouraged the development of ways to support more complex commercial transactions over these networks. Unfortunately, the prospect of higher volume and higher value transactions attracts agents seeking to exploit or weaken the network by propagating bad information and services. This paper presents advantages and disadvantages of resource selection techniques based on peer reputation. We evaluate the effect of limited reputation information sharing on the efficiency and load distribution of a peer-to-peer system. We show that limited reputation sharing can reduce the number of failed transactions by a factor of 20.
