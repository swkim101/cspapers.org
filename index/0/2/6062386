A detailed quantitative study of program behaviour is described. Reference strings from a representative set of programs were decomposed into phases and transitions. Referencing behaviour is studied at both the macro level (program-wide) and the micro level (within the phases and transitions). Quantitative data, suitable for the parameterization of program behaviour models, is presented.
