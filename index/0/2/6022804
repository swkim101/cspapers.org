Adhesion quality sensing is critical to the performance of any robot that utilizes gecko-inspired dry adhesives for climbing, perching, or grasping. We present a 3-axis tactile sensor designed for this application that demonstrates performance on par with a large commercial load cell while being compact enough to integrate into a robot foot. The sensor can measure spatially distributed force loads and demonstrates high sensitivity in both shear and normal components. Results showcase the sensor's ability to detect a variety of unreliable contact and loading conditions before the onset of adhesion failure.
