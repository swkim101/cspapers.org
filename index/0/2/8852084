Multiple robotic agents, autonomous or teleoperated, can be employed to synergise and cooperate to achieve a common objective more effectively. Tasks using robotic manipulators can be eased and improved in terms of reliability, adaptability and ergonomics via robot cooperation. In spite of visual and haptic feedback, cooperative telemanipulation of multiple robots by distant operators can still be challenging due to practical limitations in synchronisation and supervision. This paper presents a new control approach for haptic intention augmentation between two human operators handling objects via teleoperation in a cooperative manner. The force feedback to each operator is enhanced by information on the motion intention of the other operator observed by a force sensor at the input devices. Besides on-ground experiments, an experiment is presented that involves the cooperative teleoperation of an on-ground robot by a cosmonaut on the International Space Station and another distant operator on ground.
