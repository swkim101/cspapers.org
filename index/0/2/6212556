Comprehensive VLSI fault models are proposed for three broad classes of interconnection networks between multiple processors and multiple memory modules. System-level algorithms are given for concurrent detection of errors produced by these faults during the normal use of the networks. The proposed algorithms are shown to be applicable to the three classes of interconnection networks with minimal changes in their classical design. The algorithms are appropriate for the broad classes of permanent and transient faults predominant in dense VLSI and wafer-scale integration with a minimal amount of network redundancy required for implementation.
