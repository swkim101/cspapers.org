Authorities such as the European Commission have recognized the need to offer a unified access to the data gathered by a wide variety of providers, such as the European Statistical Organization (Eurostat) or the European Environment Agency. Its EU Open Data Portal serves as a gateway to numerical data, statistical reports, and visualization tools. While making the data available to the users from all member states and concentrating efforts on bridging the language gap, the portal still focuses on a primarily statistical perspective. That is, numerical data are explained with general terms, only. However, the related events, people, or organizations ``causing'' or being ``affected'' by the statistical observation remain concealed to the user. In order to make statistical data better understandable, we present the SESAME system (Statistics Explored via Semantic AlignMEnt). It relies on a novel method for identifying background information and relating it with event descriptions in Wikipedia. Using SESAME, users can jointly browse numerical statistics, their explanation in general terms and - now - also directly relate it to associated Wikipedia articles.
