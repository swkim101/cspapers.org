In this paper we propose a distributed message-passing algorithm for inference in large scale graphical models. Our method can handle large problems efficiently by distributing and parallelizing the computation and memory requirements. The convergence and optimality guarantees of recently developed message-passing algorithms are preserved by introducing new types of consistency messages, sent between the distributed computers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the task of stereo reconstruction from high-resolution imagery, and show that inference is possible with more than 200 labels in images larger than 10 MPixels.
