This paper describes the annotation process and linguistic properties of the Persian syntactic dependency treebank. The treebank consists of approximately 30,000 sentences annotated with syntactic roles in addition to morpho-syntactic features. One of the unique features of this treebank is that there are almost 4800 distinct verb lemmas in its sentences making it a valuable resource for educational goals. The treebank is constructed with a bootstrapping approach by means of available tagging and parsing tools and manually correcting the annotations. The data is splitted into standard train, development and test set in the CoNLL dependency format and is freely available to researchers.
