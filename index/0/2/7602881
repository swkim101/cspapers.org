In this paper, we prove lower bounds on the competitive ratio of randomized algorithms for two on-line problems: the k-server problem, suggested by [MMS], and an on-line motion-planning problem due to [PY]. We prove, against an oblivious adversary, 1. an Ω(log k) lower bound on the competitive ratio of any randomized on-line k-server algorithm in any sufficiently large metric space; 2. an Ω(log log k) lower bound on the competitive ratio of any randomized on-line k-server algorithm in any metric space with at least k + 1 points; and 3. an Ω(log log n) lower bound on the competitive ratio of any online motion-planning algorithm for a scene with n obstacles. Previously, no superconstant lower bound on the competitive ratio of randomized on-line algorithms was known for any of these problems.
