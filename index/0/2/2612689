In this paper we employ probabilistic relational affordance models in a robotic manipulation task. Such affordance models capture the interdependencies between properties of multiple objects, executed actions, and effects of those actions on objects. Recently it was shown how to learn such models from observed video demonstrations of actions manipulating several objects. This paper extends that work and employs those models for sequential tasks. Our approach consists of two parts. First, we employ affordance models sequentially in order to recognize the individual actions making up a demonstrated sequential skill or high level concept. Second, we utilize the models of concepts to plan a suitable course of action to replicate the observed consequences of a demonstration. For this we adopt the framework of relational Markov decision processes. Empirical results show the viability of the affordance models for sequential manipulation skills for object placement.
