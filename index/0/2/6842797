W. C. Rounds and G.-Q. Zhang have recently proposed to study a form of resolution on algebraic domains [Rounds and Zhang, 2001]. This framework allows reasoning with knowledge which is hierarchically structured and forms a (suitable) domain, more precisely, a coherent algebraic cpo as studied in domain theory. In this paper, we give conditions under which a resolution theorem -- in a form underlying resolution-based logic programming systems -- can be obtained. The investigations bear potential for engineering new knowledge representation and reasoning systems on a firm domain-theoretic background.
