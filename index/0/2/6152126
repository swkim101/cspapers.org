Due to the large success of wireless networks and handheld devices, the ambient intelligence (AmI) paradigm is becoming a reality. One of the most challenging objectives to achieve in AmI environments is to enable a user to perform a task by composing on the fly networked services available at a specific time and place. Towards this goal, we propose a solution based on semantic Web services, and we show how service capabilities described as conversations can be integrated to perform a user task that is also described as a conversation, further meeting the QoS requirements of the user task. Experimental results show that the runtime overhead of our algorithm is reasonable, and further, that QoS-awareness improves its performance.
