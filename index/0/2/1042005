This paper presents wideband beamforming techniques for reducing co-channel interference in broadband wireless communication systems by combination of the frequency-domain frequency-invariant beamforming with traditional narrowband beamforming techniques. These resulting wideband beamforming techniques can be applied for fixed wireless communications (with tapered wideband beamforming and LCMV wideband beamforming) and mobile communications (with LMS wideband beamforming). Numerical results show that the resulting beamforming techniques are applicable for truly wideband signal while they still control the beams for reducing co-channel interference in the same manner as the traditional narrowband beamforming techniques.
