Learning computer science requires deliberate and incremental exposure to the fundamental ideas of the discipline. This paper will describe our initial experience teaching an introductory computer science sequence using the programming language Python. We will present our position and then use specific examples to show how Python can provide an exceptional environment for teaching computer science.
