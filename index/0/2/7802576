There is currently a huge potential for eLearning in several new online learning initiatives like Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Open Educational Resources (OERs). These initiatives enable learners to self-regulate their learning by providing them with an abundant amount of free learning materials of high quality. This paper presents FORGE, a new European initiative for online learning using Future Internet Research and Experimentation (FIRE) facilities. FORGE is a step towards turning FIRE into a pan-European educational platform for Future Internet through Linked Data. This will benefit learners and educators by giving them both access to world class facilities in order to carry out experiments on e.g. new internet protocols. In turn, this supports constructivist and self-regulated learning approaches, through the use of interactive learning resources, such as eBooks.
