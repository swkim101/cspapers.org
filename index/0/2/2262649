We consider the problem of ray shooting in a 3dimensional scene consisting of m (possibly intersecting) convex polyhedra with a total of n faces, i.e., we want to preprocess them into a data structure, so that the first intersection point of a query ray and the given polyhedra can be determined quickly. We present a technique that requires O((mn)2t’) preprocessing time and storage, and can answer ray shooting queries in O(logn) time. This is a significant improvement over previously known techniques (which require O(n4+‘) space and preprocessing) if m is much smaller than n, which is often the case in practice. We also present a variant of the technique that requires O(nl+‘) space and preprocessing, and answers queries in time O(m1~4n1~2+e), again a significant improvement over previous techniques when m << n. Our algorithms also work when the given polyhedra intersect, and also apply to a collection of (possibly intersecting) polyhedral terrains.
