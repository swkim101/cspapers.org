We propose the product quantization table (PQTable), a product quantization-based hash table that is fast and requires neither parameter tuning nor training steps. The PQTable produces exactly the same results as a linear PQ search, and is 102 to 105 times faster when tested on the SIFT1B data. In addition, although state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by previous inverted-indexing-based approaches, such methods do require manually designed parameter setting and much training, whereas our method is free from them. Therefore, PQTable offers a practical and useful solution for real-world problems.
