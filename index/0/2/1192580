In this paper, we discuss about micro teleoperation with haptic interfaces. We developed the micro teleoperation systems for micro tasks, such as assembly or manufacturing. We show about structure of master/slave manipulators, its control and experimental results of teleoperation with the manipulators in this paper. We introduce the haptic interface that provides operators the sense as if he/she touches the expanded micro objects with his/her fingers. This micro tele-manipulation system is a new tool, which enables human operators to touch and feel the expanded micro objects with their fingers.
