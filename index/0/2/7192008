The problem of incremental semantics ]I] is to modify a description of the semantics of a computer program P in some minimal way so that it describes the semantics of some slightly different program Pâ€™. The main motivation for studying incremental semantics is the design and implementation of LanguageBased Editors (2,3,4,5,6,7]. In a language-based editor, many functions normally reserved to compiler8 are incorporated into a text editor. Every time the user modifies a program that he or she is editing, the editor manipulates an internal representation of the program, performs syntactic and static semantic checks, and somehow reports on the state of correctness of the modified program. The use of attribute grammars allows a particularly convenient representation of the static semantics of a program in an LBE.
