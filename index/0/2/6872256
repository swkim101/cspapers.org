While significant strides have been made on efficient association rule mining, the usability of mining systems woefully lags behind. In particular, the usability of rule mining systems is limited by the lack of support for interactive exploration of the relationships among rule results produced with various parameter settings. Based on a novel parameter space-driven approach, our proposed Framework for Interactive Rule Exploration (FIRE) addresses the usability shortcoming. FIRE features innovative visual displays and effective interactions that enable analysts to conduct rule exploration at the speed of thought. Particularly, the parameter space view (PSpace) displays the distribution of rules produced for diverse parameter settings. This not only facilitates user parameter selection but also empowers analyst's to understand rule relationships in the parameter space context. Our user study with 22 subjects establishes the usability and effectiveness of the proposed features and interactions of FIRE using benchmark datasets. Overall, this research encompasses significant contributions at the intersection of data mining, knowledge management and visual analytics.
