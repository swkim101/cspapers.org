Large systems have special problems. Cross reference by large numbers of different objects from different classes can lead to “spaghetti structure.” There is a need to put classes into major groups that are well architected and supported with special documents giving the philosophy as well as cookbook examples of how classes in the group are used. It is wise to try to integrate large systems early, to identify performance and other usability problems. Intelligent memory and storage management is not well developed and has significantly hurt the performance of large CAD systems that a number of major CAD houses have built.
