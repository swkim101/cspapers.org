In this paper we examine the effect that the choice of support and confidence thresholds has on the accuracy of classifiers obtained by classification association rule mining. We show that accuracy can almost always be improved by a suitable choice of threshold values, and we describe a method for finding the best values. We present results that demonstrate this approach can obtain higher accuracy without the need for coverage analysis of the training data.
