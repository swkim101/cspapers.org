With the high powered rendering systems and recording equipment available today, 4k video streams are now within the reach of several scientific communities. A resolution of 4096x3072, with 24-bit color, running at 30 frames per second, produces just under 10Gbs of network traffic. Existing tiled displays are being used to show such media, and these high resolution streams are being sent across the country. Because of the data throughput required for 4k video streams, pulling stored video off storage systems in real time is not possible. So current systems providing 4k video streams either use a live source, such as a high-definition camera, or use lossy compression to store the video and transmit it using 1Gb networks. We propose the construction of a system to stream stored media (either recorded video or rendered graphics) at full non-compressed resolution to tiled displays.
