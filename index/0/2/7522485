Query ambiguity is a generally recognized problem, particularly in Web environments where queries are commonly only one or two words in length. In this study, we explore one technique that finds commonly occurring patterns of parts of speech near a one-word query and allows them to be transformed into clarification questions. We use a technique derived from statistical language modeling to show that the clarification queries will reduce ambiguity much of the time, and often quite substantially.
