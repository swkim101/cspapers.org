This paper describes the design and implementation of a parallel iterative linear system solver for distributed memory multicomputers and workstation clusters. It is capable of applying heterogeneous data distribution and dynamic load balancing within an iterative solver routine at matrix level. Matrices as well as vectors are distributed heterogeneously according to the available performances of the processors,
