Machine transliteration is defined as automatic phonetic translation of names across languages. In this paper, we propose synchronous adaptor grammar, a novel nonpara-metric Bayesian learning approach, for machine transliteration. This model provides a general framework without heuristic or restriction to automatically learn syllable equivalents between languages. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art EM-based model in the English to Chinese transliteration task.
