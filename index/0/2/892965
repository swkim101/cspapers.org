Finding similar entities is a fundamental problem in graph data analysis. Similarity search algorithms usually leverage the structural properties of the database to quantify the degree of similarity between entities. However, the same information can be represented in different structures and the structural properties observed over particular representations may not hold for the alternatives. These algorithms are effective on some representations and ineffective on others. We define the property of representation independence for similarity search algorithms as their robustness against transformations that modify the structure of databases but preserve the information content. We introduce a widespread group of such transformations called relationship reorganizing. We propose an algorithm called R-PathSim, which is provably robust under relationship reorganizing. Our empirical results show that current algorithms except R-PathSim are highly sensitive to the data representation and R-PathSim is as efficient and effective as other algorithms.
