VISION is an object-oriented database system currently used commercially to develop investment analysis and other large statistical applications. Characteristic of these applications, beside the standard issues of structural and computational richness, is the need to handle time, versions, and concurrency control in a manner that does not produce combinatoric complexity in object protocol. This paper describes the approach taken by VISION in addressing these issues.
