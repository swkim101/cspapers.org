We present the design and evaluation of a translatorâ€™s amenuensis that uses comparable corpora to propose and rank nonliteral solutions to the translation of expressions from the general lexicon. Using distributional similarity and bilingual dictionaries, the method outperforms established techniques for extracting translation equivalents from parallel corpora. The interface to the system is available at: http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/assist/v05/
