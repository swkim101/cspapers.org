Given two testable properties P1 and P2, under what conditions are the union, intersection or set-difierence of these two properties also testable? We initiate a systematic study of these basic set-theoretic operations in the context of property testing. As an application, we give a conceptually difierent proof that linearity is testable, albeit with much worse query complexity. Furthermore, for the problem of testing disjunc- tion of linear functions, which was previously known to be one-sided testable with a super-polynomial query complexity, we give an improved analysis and show it has query complexity O(1=† 2 ), where † is the distance parameter.
