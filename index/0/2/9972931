As the number of customer reviews grows very rapidly, it is essential to summarize useful opinions for buyers, sellers and producers. One key step of opinion mining is feature extraction. Most existing research focus on finding explicit features, only a few attempts have been made to extract implicit features. Nearly all existing research only concentrate on product features, few has paid attention to other features that relates to sellers, services and logistics. Therefore in this paper, we propose a novel co-occurrence association-based method, which aims to extract implicit features in customer reviews and provide more comprehensive and fine-grained mining results.
