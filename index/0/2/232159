Students are spread out over approximately 20 European U.S. military installations.
 The objective of the course of study is the Data Processing Core and Advanced Certificates awarded after 12 and 24 semester hours of course work, respectively.
 Instruction is provided by U.S. military and civilian personnel qualified in data processing and the language being taught.
 Purpose: To give students the fundamentals of programming in several of the most common programming languages in use today. They are not expected to become full fledged programmers. In the introductory courses, an important objective is to provide a general appreciation of data processing and how it is affecting the lives of everyone. In addition, it is hoped that students will apply this understanding so that data processing is seen as a tool to make jobs more meaningful—as opposed to the threat people feel as their job is “automated.”
