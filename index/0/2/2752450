Recently Web search engines have built knowledge graphs to support entity search and to provide structural summaries called \emph{knowledge cards} for entities mentioned in queries. Different knowledge cards might be complementary or even have conflicts on values of the equivalent property. Thus, it is essential to achieve a more comprehensive fused card from those individual cards representing the same entity. In this paper, we present a system with technical details of card disambiguation, property alignment, value deduplication and card ranking to fuse knowledge cards from various search engines. We further develop a Javascript library called KCF.js based on the card fusion engine and demonstrates its usability via three possible applications.
