Web applications exemplify the need for generative programming techniques in part due to the many languages, artifacts, and groups of developers involved. Some problems remain, including those that that arise from the interplay with versioning. This paper proposes addressing these problems with structured program transformations, and explores a framework for the co-evolution of platform artifacts and the models that generate them.
