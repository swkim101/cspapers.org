We consider the problem of estimating expectations of vector-valued feature functions; a special case of which includes estimating the covariance matrix of a random vector. We are interested in recovery under high-dimensional settings, where the number of features p is potentially larger than the number of samples n, and where we need to impose structural constraints. In a natural distributional setting for this problem, the feature functions comprise the sufficient statistics of an exponential family, so that the problem would entail estimating structured moments of exponential family distributions. For instance, in the special case of covariance estimation, the natural distributional setting would correspond to the multivariate Gaussian distribution. Unlike the inverse covariance estimation case, we show that the regularized MLEs for covariance estimation, as well as natural Dantzig variants, are non-convex, even when the regularization functions themselves are convex; with the same holding for the general structured moment case. We propose a class of elementary convex estimators, that in many cases are available in closed-form, for estimating general structured moments. We then provide a unified statistical analysis of our class of estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our class of estimators via simulation and on real-world climatology and biology datasets.
