A unified procedure to find test patterns for detection and location of stuck-at-type single faults in the combinational circuits is described. A reduction algorithm to obtain a minimal set of detection patterns and a location algorithm to obtain complete location information obtainable by external observation; are presented. The circuit may consider AND, OR, NOT, NOR, NAND, EXCLUSIVE OR and LOGICAL EQUIVALENCE gates.
 A basis for the article are the single and multi-dimensional path sensitization (1,2) and the graph theoretical approach for system diagnosis (3). The main parts of this work is the construction of sensitization functions and the path analysis table, and the development of the reduction and location algorithms. The procedure is illustrated in detail by two examples.
