Semantic Web Services (SWS), a new generation WWW technology, will facilitate the automation of Web service tasks, including automated Web service discovery, execution, composition and mediation by using XML based metadata and ontology. There have been several efforts to build knowledge representation languages for Web Services. However, only few attempts have so far been made to develop applications based on SWS. Especially, front-end agent systems for users are one of the urgent research areas. The purpose of this paper is to introduce our new integrated front-end agent system for ontology management and SWS management.
