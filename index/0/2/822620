This study aims to measure the variation between writers in their choices of referential form by collecting and analysing a new and publicly available corpus of referring expressions. The corpus is composed of referring expressions produced by different participants in identical situations. Results, measured in terms of normalized entropy, reveal substantial individual variation. We discuss the problems and prospects of this finding for automatic text generation applications.
