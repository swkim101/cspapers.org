We are going to present an implementation of an AI system, CaBMA, built on top of a commercial project management tool, MS Project™. Project planning is a business process for successfully delivering one-of-a kind products and services under real-world time and resource constraints. CaBMA (for: Case-Based Project Management Assistant) provides the following functionalities: • It captures cases from project plans • It reuses captured cases to refine project plans and generate project plans from the scratch • It maintains consistency of pieces of a project plan obtained by case reuse • It refines the case base to cope with inconsistencies resulting from capturing cases over a period of time CaBMA adds a knowledge layer on top of MS Project™ to assist the user with his project management tasks.
