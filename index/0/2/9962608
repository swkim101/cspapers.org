Automating of mechanical engineering design, drafting, structural modelling and analyses is being implemented at EOSC with interactive graphic time share terminals. It was recognized that for reducing costs in mechanical engineering tasks and to stay competitive in the industry, these tasks had to be automated. Previously these tasks used labor intensive manual design and drafting methods, and structural modelling with batch processing. Trade-off evaluations and vendor surveys were conducted of several automated drafting and structural modelling systems. The decisions made after the evaluations was to use currently available soft-ware and Tektronix terminal equipment for inter-active communications with host computers. This paper discusses how mechanical design, and structural modelling and analyses have been automated at EOSC using inter-active graphics and time-share terminals.
