User's examination of search results is a key concept involved in all the click models. However, most studies assumed that eye fixation means examination and no further study has been carried out to better understand user's examination behavior. In this study, we design an experimental search engine to collect both the user's feedback on their examinations and the eye-tracking/click-through data. To our surprise, a large proportion (45.8%) of the results fixated by users are not recognized as being "read". Looking into the tracking data, we found that before the user actually "reads" the result, there is often a "skimming" step in which the user quickly looks at the result without reading it. We thus propose a two-stage examination model which composes of a first "from skimming to reading" stage (Stage 1) and a second "from reading to clicking" stage (Stage 2). We found that the biases (e.g. position bias, domain bias, attractiveness bias) considered in many studies impact in different ways in Stage 1 and Stage 2, which suggests that users make judgments according to different signals in different stages. We also show that the two-stage examination behaviors can be predicted with mouse movement behavior, which can be collected at large scale. Relevance estimation with the two-stage examination model also outperforms that with a single-stage examination model. This study shows that the user's examination of search results is a complex cognitive process that needs to be investigated in greater depth and this may have a significant impact on Web search.
