Several statistical problems encountered in real world applications appear to be speci c instances of a general framework based on hybrid Poisson models. Restating these problem in this framework allows us to draw upon a large number of statistical analysis techniques and suggests a variety of algorithms which provide new and more robust methods for analysis. In particular, we dev elop a new method for detecting behavioral c hanges of a class of stochastic process.
