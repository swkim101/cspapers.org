We give simple and easy-to-analyze randomized approximation algorithms for several well-studied NP-hard network design problems. Our algorithms improve over the previously best known approximation ratios. Our main results are the following.We give a randomized 3.55-approximation algorithm for the connected facility location problem. The algorithm requires three lines to state, one page to analyze, and improves the best-known performance guarantee for the problem.We give a 5.55-approximation algorithm for virtual private network design. Previously, constant-factor approximation algorithms were known only for special cases of this problem.We give a simple constant-factor approximation algorithm for the single-sink buy-at-bulk network design problem. Our performance guarantee improves over what was previously known, and is an order of magnitude improvement over previous combinatorial approximation algorithms for the problem.
