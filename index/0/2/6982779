The wide adoption of location-based services provide the potential to understand people's mobility pattern at an unprecedented level, which can also enable food-service industry to accurately predict consumers' dining behavior. In this paper, based on users' dining implicit feedbacks (restaurant visit via check-ins), explicit feedbacks (restaurant reviews) as well as some meta data (e.g., location, user demographics, restaurant attributes), we aim at recommending each user a list of restaurants for his next dining. Implicit and Explicit feedbacks of dining behavior exhibit different characteristics of user preference. Therefore, in our work, user's dining preference mainly contains two parts: implicit preference coming from check-in data (implicit feedbacks) and explicit preference coming from rating and review data (explicit feedbacks). For implicit preference, we first apply a probabilistic tensor factorization model (PTF) to capture preference in a latent subspace. Then, in order to incorporate contextual signals from meta data, we extend PTF by proposing an Implicit Preference Model (IPM), which can simultaneously capture users'/restaurants'/time' preference in the collaborative filtering and dining preference in a specific context (e.g., spatial distance preference, environmental preference). For explicit preference, we propose Explicit Preference Model (EPM) by combining matrix factorization with topic modeling to discover the user preference embedded both in rating score and text content. Finally, we design a unified model termed as Collective Implicit Explicit Preference Model (CIEPM) to combine implicit and explicit preference together for restaurant recommendation. To evaluate the performance of our system, we conduct extensive experiments with large-scale datasets covering hundreds of thousands of users and restaurants. The results reveal that our system is effective for restaurant recommendation.
