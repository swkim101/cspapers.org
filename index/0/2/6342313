Recent work on compiling Bayesian networks has reduced the problem to that of factoring CNF encodings of these networks, providing an expressive framework for exploiting local structure. For networks that have local structure, large CPTs, yet no excessive determinism, the quality of the CNF encodings and the amount of local structure they capture can have a significant effect on both the offline compile time and online inference time. We examine the encoding of such Bayesian networks in this paper and report on new findings that allow us to significantly scale this compilation approach. In particular, we obtain order-of-magnitude improvements in compile time, compile some networks successfully for the first time, and obtain ordersof-magnitude improvements in online inference for some networks with local structure, as compared to baseline jointree inference, which does not exploit local structure.
