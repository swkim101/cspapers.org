A new decomposition algorithm for training regression Support Vector Machines (SVM) is presented. The algorithm builds on the basic principles of decomposition proposed by Osuna et. al., and addresses the issue of optimal working set selection. The new criteria for testing optimality of a working set are derived. Based on these criteria, the principle of "maximal inconsistency" is proposed to form (approximately) optimal working sets. Experimental results show superior performance of the new algorithm in comparison with traditional training of regression SVM without decomposition. Similar results have been previously reported on decomposition algorithms for pattern recognition SVM. The new algorithm is also applicable to advanced SVM formulations based on regression, such as density estimation and integral equation SVM.
