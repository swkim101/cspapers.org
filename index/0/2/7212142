The accuracy of reconfigurable robot manipulators is a critical aspect which prevents their diffused industrial adoption. This work presents a novel model for designing joint motion profiles, particularly suitable for the motion planning of modular robots with high accuracy requirements. The model generates smooth motion profiles, without sacrificing execution time and taking into account the different characteristics of each joint and the requirements of each production task. The proposed method has been tested across the most performing motion planning approaches found in the literature, providing up to 39% faster jerk-bounded trajectories. Moreover, the model is flexible to the generation of adapted trajectories when degrading phenomena occur over the time.
