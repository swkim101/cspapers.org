As scientific research becomes more data intensive, there is an increasing need for scalable, reliable, and high performance storage systems. Such data repositories must provide both data archival services and rich metadata, and cleanly integrate with large scale computing resources. ROARS is a hybrid approach to distributed storage that provides both large, robust, scalable storage and efficient rich metadata queries for scientific applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that ROARS is capable of importing and exporting large quantities of data, migrating data to new storage nodes, providing robust fault tolerance, and generating materialized views based on metadata queries. Our experimental results demonstrate that ROARS' aggregate throughput scales with the number of concurrent clients while providing fault-tolerant data access. ROARS is currently being used to store 5.1TB of data in our local biometrics repository.
