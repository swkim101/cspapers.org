2.5D building reconstruction aims at creating building models composed of complex roofs and vertical walls. In this paper, we define 2.5D building topology as a set of roof features, wall features, and point features; together with the associations between them. Based on this definition, we extend 2.5D dual contouring into a 2.5D modeling method with topology control. Comparing with the previous method, we put less restrictions on the adaptive simplification process. We show results under intense geometry simplifications. Our results preserve significant topology structures while the number of triangles is comparable to that of manually created models or primitive-based models.
