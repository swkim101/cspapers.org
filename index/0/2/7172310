We are currently developing a translation aid system specially designed for English-to-Japanese volunteer translators working mainly online. In this paper we introduce the stratified reference lookup interface that has been incorporated into the source text area of the system, which distinguishes three user awareness levels depending on the type and nature of the reference unit. The different awareness levels are assigned to reference units from a variety of reference sources, according to the criteria of "composition", "difficulty", "speciality" and "resource type".
