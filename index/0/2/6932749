To answer user queries efficiently, a stream management system must handle continuous, high-volume, possibly noisy, and time-varying data streams. One major research area in stream management seeks to allocate resources (such as network bandwidth and memory) to query plans, either to minimize resource usage under a precision requirement, or to maximize precision of results under resource constraints. To date, many solutions have been proposed; however, most solutions are ad hoc with hard-coded heuristics to generate query plans. In contrast, we perceive stream resource management as fundamentally a filtering problem, in which the objective is to filter out as much data as possible to conserve resources, provided that the precision standards can be met. We select the Kalman Filter as a general and adaptive filtering solution for conserving resources. The Kalman Filter has the ability to adapt to various stream characteristics, sensor noise, and time variance. Furthermore, we realize a significant performance boost by switching from traditional methods of caching static data (which can soon become stale) to our method of caching dynamic procedures that can predict data reliably at the server without the clients' involvement. In this work we focus on minimization of communication overhead for both synthetic and real-world streams. Through examples and empirical studies, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of using the Kalman Filter as a solution for managing trade-offs between precision of results and resources in satisfying stream queries.
