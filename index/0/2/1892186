In the Densest k-Subgraph (DkS) problem, given an undirected graph G and an integer k, the goal is to find a subgraph of G on k vertices that contains maximum number of edges. Even though Bhaskara et al.'s state-of-the-art algorithm for the problem achieves only O(n1/4 + ϵ) approximation ratio, previous attempts at proving hardness of approximation, including those under average case assumptions, fail to achieve a polynomial ratio; the best ratios ruled out under any worst case assumption and any average case assumption are only any constant (Raghavendra and Steurer) and 2O(log2/3 n) (Alon et al.) respectively. In this work, we show, assuming the exponential time hypothesis (ETH), that there is no polynomial-time algorithm that approximates Densest k-Subgraph to within n1/(loglogn)c factor of the optimum, where c > 0 is a universal constant independent of n. In addition, our result has perfect completeness, meaning that we prove that it is ETH-hard to even distinguish between the case in which G contains a k-clique and the case in which every induced k-subgraph of G has density at most 1/n-1/(loglogn)c in polynomial time. Moreover, if we make a stronger assumption that there is some constant Îµ > 0 such that no subexponential-time algorithm can distinguish between a satisfiable 3SAT formula and one which is only (1 - ε)-satisfiable (also known as Gap-ETH), then the ratio above can be improved to nf(n) for any function f whose limit is zero as n goes to infinity (i.e. f ϵ o(1)).
