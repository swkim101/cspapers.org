The PIKM workshop offers Ph.D. students the opportunity to bring their work to an international and interdisciplinary research community, and create a network of young researchers to exchange and develop new and promising ideas. Similar to the CIKM, the PIKM workshop covers a wide range of topics in the areas of databases, information retrieval and knowledge management.
