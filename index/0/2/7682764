User-input validators play an essential role in guarding a web application against application-level attacks. Hence, the security of the web application can be compromised by defective validators. To detect defects in validators, testing is one of the most commonly used methodologies. Testing can be performed by manually writing test inputs and oracles, but this manual process is often labor-intensive and ineffective. On the other hand, automated test generators cannot generate test oracles in the absence of specifications, which are often not available in practice. To address this issue in testing validators, we propose a novel approach, called MiTV, that applies Multiple-implementation Testing for Validators, i.e., comparin gthe behavior of a validator under test with other validators of the same type. These other validators of the same type can be collected from either open or proprietary source code repositories. To show the effectiveness of MiTV, we applied MiTV on 53 different validators (of 6 common types) for web applications. Our results show that MiTV detected real defects in 70% of the validators.
