Today, most large companies maintain virtual private networks (VPNs) to connect their remote locations into a single secure network. VPNs can be quite large covering more than 1000 locations and in most cases use standard Internet protocols and services. Such VPNs are implemented using a diverse set of technologies such as Frame Relay, MPLS, or IPSEC to achieve the goal of privacy and performance isolation from the public Internet.Using VPNs to distribute live content has recently received tremendous interest. For example, a VPN could be used to broadcast a CEO-employee town hall meeting. To distribute this type of content economically without overloading the network, the deployment of streaming caches or splitters is most likely required.In this paper, we address the problem of optimally placing such streaming splitters or caches to broadcast to a given set of VPN endpoints under the constraints typically found within a VPN. In particular, we introduce an efficient algorithm with complexity O(V), V being the number of routers in the VPN. This guarantees the optimal cache placement if interception is used for redirection. We prove that the general problem is NP-hard and introduce multiple heuristics for efficient and robust cache placement suitable under different constraints. At the expense of increased implementation complexity, each heuristic solution provides additional saving in the number of caches required. We evaluate proposed solutions using extensive simulations. In particular, we show our flow-based solution is very close to the optimal.
