This paper proposes a new method that makes it easy for us to construct a positioning model for device-free passive indoor localization by using model transfer techniques. With device-free passive indoor positioning, a wireless sensor network is used to detect the movement of a person based on the fact that RF signals transmitted between a transmitter and a receiver are affected by human movement. However, because device-free passive indoor positioning relies on machine learning techniques, we must collect labeled training data at many training points in an end user's environment. This paper proposes a method that transfers a signal strength model used for locating a person obtained in another environment (source environment) to the end user environment. With the transferred models, we can construct a positioning model for the end user environment inexpensively. Our evaluation showed that our method achieved almost the same positioning performance as a supervised method that requires labeled training data obtained in an end user's environment.
