In this paper, a fish robot employing a carangiform swimming mode is adopted as an experimental platform for the parametric study. Experiments conducted in the laboratory aim to study the variation of robotic fish's thrust with respect to various parameters including the frequency and amplitude of oscillation, joint link, aspect ratio, free flow velocity and the spring effect. The testing also enables us to find out the relationship between various parameters and the thrust generated by the oscillatory motion of tail. On the other hand, the significance of the controlled parameters will be determined using statistical methods.
