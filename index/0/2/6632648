This video introduces a small, new reconnaissance robot that can climb concrete surfaces up to 85Â° at a rate of 25cm*s-1, make rapid horizontal to vertical transitions, carry an audio/visual payload, and survive impacts from 3m. The robot can travel over 45 cm*s-1 on flat ground, and turn in place. The Durable Reconnaissance and Observation Platform, D.R.O.P., is manufactured using a combination of selective laser sintering (SLS) and shape deposition manufacturing (SDM) techniques. The enabling feature of DROP is the use of microspines in a rotary configuration, increasing climbing and walking speed over previous microspine-based robots by more than 5x. The robot uses a 180mAh LiPo battery, Baby Orangutan microprocessor, and two brushed DC motors.
