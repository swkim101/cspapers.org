Communicating algorithms and processes is an integral part of computer science education yet in many instances is difficult to carry out effectively using traditional techniques. Using the computer as an aid in visualizing and understanding an algorithm is one way to improve this communication process. With the computer technology available to us today, it would be unfortunate if we did not make effective use of it in computer science education. (We don't want to be like the shoemaker's children.)
 The prototype systems described in this paper exemplify how a computer might be used as an instructional aid; the observations resulting from their application suggest further experimentation and use.
