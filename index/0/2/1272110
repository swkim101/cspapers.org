In this work, we attempt to tackle domain-transfer problem by combining old-domain labeled examples with new-domain unlabeled ones. The basic idea is to use old-domain-trained classifier to label some informative unlabeled examples in new domain, and retrain the base classifier over these selected examples. The experimental results demonstrate that proposed scheme can significantly boost the accuracy of the base sentiment classifier on new domain.
