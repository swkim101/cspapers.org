Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI) enables device free localization of physical objects by using signal attenuation in wireless networks. In this paper, we explore how existing RTI methods can be used in WiFi networks to do tomographic imaging. Moreover we analyze and evaluate the properties that affect the accuracy of WiFi tomographic imaging process.
