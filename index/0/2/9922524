In this paper we present a new parsing model of linguistic and computational interest. Linguistically, the relation between the parser and the theory of grammar adopted (Government and Binding (GB) theory as presented in Chomsky (1981, 1986a, b) is clearly specified. Computationally, this model adopts a mixed parsing procedure, by using left corner prediction in a modified LR parser.
