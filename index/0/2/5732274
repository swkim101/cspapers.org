Flatland is an augmented whiteboard interface designed forinformal office work. Our research investigates approaches tobuilding an augmented whiteboard in the context of continuous, longterm office use. In particular, we pursued three avenues ofresearch based on input from user studies: techniques for themanagement of space on the board, the ability to flexibly applybehaviors to support varied application semantics, and mechanismsfor managing history on the board. Unlike some previously reportedwhiteboard systems, our design choices have been influenced by adesire to support long-term, informal use in an individual officesetting.
