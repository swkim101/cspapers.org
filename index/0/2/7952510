This paper describes a simulator that allows users to explore concurrent I/O in UNIX. UNIX I/O provides an interesting example of how a shared variable, in this case the file offset, can be affected by concurrent access. The examples given can run on the simulator or a real UNIX-like system such as Linux, Solaris for Mac OS X. The simulator can run programs written by the user and display pictorially the relationship among various data structures involved in I/O, including the process file descriptor table, the system open file table, the inodes, and the data stored on disk. The user can run the program slowly, or step forward or back through the program to examine the data structures in detail. The simulator supports the creation of both child processes and threads as well as open, close, read, write, wait, join and detach functions. The simulator is freely available for download. It can be also be used directly from a browser without the need for installation.
