Chronic hand impairment is common following stroke. This paper presents an actuated thumb exoskeleton (ATX) to facilitate research in hand rehabilitation therapy. The ATX presented in this work permits independent bi-directional actuation in each of the 5 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) of the thumb using a mechanism that has 5 active DOF and 3 passive DOF. The ATX is able to provide considerable joint torques for the user while still allowing backdrivability through flexible shaft transmission. A prototype has been built and experiments were conducted to evaluate the closed-loop position control. Further improvement and future work are discussed.
