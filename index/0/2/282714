This paper describes a HDL synthesis based design methodology that supports user adoption of behavioral-level synthesis into normal design practices. The use of these techniques increases understanding of the HDL descriptions before synthesis, and makes the comparison of pre- and post-synthesis design behavior through simulation much more direct. This increases user confidence that the specification does what the user wants, i.e. that the synthesized design matches the specification in the ways that are important to the user. At the same time, the methodology gives the user a powerful set of tools to specify complex interface timing, while preserving a user's ability to delegate decision-making authority to software in those cases where the user does not wish to restrict the options available to the synthesis algorithms.
