Hierarchical discourse segmentation is a useful technology, but it is difficult to evaluate. I propose an error measure based on the word error rate of Beeferman et al. (1999). I then show that this new measure not only reliably distinguishes baseline segmentations from lexically-informed hierarchical segmentations and more informed segmentations from less informed segmentations, but it also offers an improvement over previous linear error measures.
