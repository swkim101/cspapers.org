We review a query log of hundreds of millions of queries that constitute the total query traffic for an entire week of a general-purpose commercial web search service. Previously, query logs have been studied from a single, cumulative view. In contrast, our analysis shows changes in popularity and uniqueness of topically categorized queries across the hours of the day. We examine query traffic on an hourly basis by matching it against lists of queries that have been topically pre-categorized by human editors. This represents 13% of the query traffic. We show that query traffic from particular topical categories differs both from the query stream as a whole and from other categories. This analysis provides valuable insight for improving retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. It is also relevant to the development of enhanced query disambiguation, routing, and caching algorithms.
