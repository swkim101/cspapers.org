We present a novel method that allows for simultaneous geometric and radiometric calibration of a projector-camera pair. It is simple and does not require specialized hardware. We prewarp and align a specially designed projection pattern onto a printed pattern of different colorimetric properties. After capturing the patterns in several orientations, we perform geometric calibration by estimating the corner locations of the two patterns in different color channels. We perform radiometric calibration of the projector by using the information contained inside the projected squares. We show that our method performs on par with current approaches that all require separate geometric and radiometric calibration, while being more efficient and user friendly.
