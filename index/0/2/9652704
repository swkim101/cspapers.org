Metal spinning is a plastic forming process in which a relatively ductile metal sheet is forced onto a rotataing mandrel by using a roller tool. This study is aimed at developing a versatile and intelligent forming process and expand the application area of robotic manufacturing processes. In this research, the metal spinning process has been accomplished with an industrial robot. Trajectory control algorothms have been implemented. The effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed method have been experimentally verified. In addition, wrinkle occurences have been experimentally analyzed with repect to spinning conditions.
