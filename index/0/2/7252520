The Web has become a major conduit to information repositories of all kinds. Today, more than 80% of information published on the Web is generated by underlying databases (however access is granted through a Web gateway using forms as a query language and HTML as a display vehicle) and this proportion keeps increasing. But Web data sources also consist of standalone HTML pages hand-coded by individuals, that provide very useful information such as reviews, digests, links, etc. As for the information that also exists in underlying databases, the HTML interface is often the only one available for many would-be clients.
