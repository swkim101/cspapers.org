This paper describes our experience in using modern Web 2.0 architecture, lightweight Python frameworks, and rapid prototyping to create an AI rostering and workforce management system to help prepare for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Equestrian Events, which will be held in Hong Kong. As part of the 2008 Olympics preparation, a scaled down "test" event - "The Good Luck Beijing - HKSAR 10th Anniversary Cup" was held in August 2007 as a dressed rehearsal for the Olympics Equestrian Events. To schedule and manage all the volunteers and staffs of this event, a Web-based AI "Workforce Management System" (WMS) was created. By leveraging on our existing Web-based application framework and AI platform, we were able to complete the entire AI project under very tight time constraints and helped Hong Kong successfully pass the readiness requirements of the International Olympic Committee. This paper focuses on our experience with using AI to support the Good Luck Beijing equestrian games. It describes the AI development approach we took as well as the AI architecture for the HR-XML compliant rostering system.
