In this paper we present a system for providing tactile feedback for stylus-based touch-screen displays. The Haptic Pen is a simple low-cost device that provides individualized tactile feedback for multiple simultaneous users and can operate on large touch screens as well as ordinary surfaces. A pressure-sensitive stylus is combined with a small solenoid to generate a wide range of tactile sensations. The physical sensations generated by the Haptic pen can be used to enhance our existing interaction with graphical user interfaces as well as to help make modern computing systems more accessible to those with visual or motor impairments.
