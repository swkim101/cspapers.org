We consider a class of robotic systems composed of high elongation linear actuators connected at universal joints. We derive the differential kinematics of such robots, and formalize concepts of controllability based on graph rigidity. Control methods are then developed for two separate applications: locomotion and shape morphing. The control algorithm in both cases solves a series of linearly constrained quadratic programs at each time step to minimize an objective function while ensuring physical feasibility. We present simulation results for locomotion along a prescribed path, and morphing to a target shape.
