Most existing attestation schemes deal with binaries and typically require an exhaustive list of known-good measurements beforehand in order to perform verification. However, many programs nowadays are custom-built: the end user is allowed to tailor, compile and build the source code into various versions, or even build everything from scratch. As a result, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for existing schemes to attest the custom-built software with theoretically unlimited number of valid binaries available. This paper introduce SCOBA, a new Source COde Based Attestation framework, to specifically deal with the attestation on custom software. Instead of trying to obtain a know-good measurement list, SCOBA focuses on the source code and provides a trusted building process to attest the resulting binaries based on the source files and building configuration. SCOBA introduces a trusted verifier to certify the binary code of custom-build program according to its source code and building configuration. For custom-built software based on open-source distributions, we implemented a fully automatic trusted building system prototype for SCOBA based on GCC and TPM. As a case study, we also applied SCOBA to Gentoo and its Portage, which is a source code based package management system. Experimental results show that remote attestation, one of the key TCG features, can be made practically available to the free software community.
