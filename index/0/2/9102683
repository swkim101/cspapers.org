This paper describes two initiatives aiming at improving code reusability for programming mobile robots: robotflow/flowdesigner, a data-flow programming environment; MARIE (mobile and autonomous robotics integration environment), a programming environment allowing multiple applications, programs and tools, to operate on one or multiple machines/OS and work together on a mobile robot implementation. Robotflow/flowdesigner's objective is to provide a modular, graphical programming environment that would help visualize and understand what is really happening in the robot's control loops, sensors, actuators, by using graphical probes. MARIE aims at avoiding making an exclusive choice on particular programming tools, making it possible to reuse code and applications.
