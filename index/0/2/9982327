Auto-Scheduling defines a program compilation and execution tlamework which supports effective and efficient exploitation of parallelism and automatic adjustment of task granularity during execution by providing each parallel program the ability to create, manage, and schedule its own parallel tasks. Auto-scheduling is based on a new powerful intermediate program representation, the Hierarchical Task Graph, or HTG, which is generated by the compiler. The HTG offers a single representation that partitions and organizes a program into a hierarchy of parallel tasks, which encapsulate program parallelism at all levels of granulmity. We argue that auto-scheduling offers an near-optimal approach for exploiting parallelism on real parallel computer systems. We tdso argue, that the HTG offers a most powerful intermediate representation for parallel programs.
