Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) are often realized using virtual machines (VMs) because they provide an isolated environment compatible with classical cloud computing technologies. However, VMs are demanding in terms of required resources (CPU and memory) and therefore not suitable for low-cost devices like residential gateways. Such equipment often runs a Linux-based operating system that includes by default a (large) number of common network functions, which can provide some of the services otherwise offered by simple VNFs, but with reduced overhead. In this paper those native software components are made available through a Network Function Virtualization (NFV) platform, thus making their use transparent from the VNF developer point of view.
