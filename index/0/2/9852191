This paper presents an SGML-MUCH (S-M) system, the I/O subsystem of a collaborative authoring and reuse system called MUCH (Many Using and Creating Hypermedia), for text and hypertext mutual conversion and hypertext interchange. The S-M system can dynamically generate text documents from the MUCH document database by traversing a subgraph of the hypertext database. With various options on traversal, different versions of documents ean be generated from the same set of nodes and links in the document database. The documents generated from the MUCH document database include not only document content but also groupware and hypertext information that can be used for hypertext interchange. With this generated document, hypertext for different systems such as Guide and Hyperties can be automatically generated and new features, like alternate outline and automatically derived indices can also be incorporated. The S-M system, which was developed using several public-domain development tools, adheres to standards where possible, and generally foeuses on’ openness’.
