This paper presents a formal scheme for addressing base and apex nodes in SW-banyan networks. This scheme is used for routing packets in the network. Packet-switching, in conjunction with the the circuit-switch mode of operation, offers a very flexible and powerful mechanism for interprocess communication in the multiprocessor architectures based on the banyan networks. Finally, a fault-tolerent scheme for re-routing the packets in the network is presented, in case the packet encounters a faulty node in its path.
