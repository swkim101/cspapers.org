CST is a programming language based on Smalltalk-802 that supports concurrency using locks, asynchronous messages, and distributed objects. In this paper, we describe CST: the language and its implementation. Example programs and initial programming experience with CST are described. Our implementation of CST generates native code for the J-machine, a fine-grained concurrent computer. Some compiler optimizations developed in conjunction with that implementation are also described.
