In this research paper, we propose a 3D propagation model that enables to characterize the electromagnetic far-field scattered by a complex scenario at high-frequency bands (i.e. Ka-band). This proposed model is based on the combination between the asymptotic method Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) and a Ray-Tracing (RT) technique. We have conducted some comparisons with the 33-37GHz indoor measurements in the anechoic chamber of School of Electrical Engineering (IU, VNU-HCMC) conducive to validate the model. The validated scenarios are composed of two metallic plates representing walls only and then a 4-in-1 corner reflector bestowed between them. Two identical broadband BBHA9170 antennas are used as transmitter and receiver in order to represent the bistatic configuration. These comparisons have shown that the model gives a good agreement with the experimental results. At the end, we apply the model to synthesize data for evaluating SAR imaging algorithms with the above configurations.
