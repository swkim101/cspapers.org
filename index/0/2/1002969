This session will continue efforts by the ACM and Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) to create a comprehensive body of resources to support the implementation of a national K-12 computer science curriculum. The ACM K-12 Computer Science Curriculum Committee, with input from the Computer Science educational community, published a Model Curriculum [1] in 2003. The Model suggests a four-level curriculum. Level-I topics, primarily for the K-8 years, closely follow the well-defined ISTE Standards [2]. Level-II topics are suggested for all students in grades 9 or 10 and are comprised of introductory computer science content. Level-III topics focus on analysis and design with emphasis on the scientific and engineering aspects of computer science. The Level III course is intended for students who may be interested in continuing their education in computer science at the college level. AP Computer Science and special topics courses comprise Level-4. This special session will focus on the learning objectives and activities for Level III of the K-12 Computer Science Model curriculum. Attendees will be invited to provide critical feedback that will help move the curriculum project forward.
