We consider linear models for stochastic dynamics. To any such model can be associated a network (namely a directed graph) describing which degrees of freedom interact under the dynamics. We tackle the problem of learning such a network from observation of the system trajectory over a time interval $T$. 
We analyze the $\ell_1$-regularized least squares algorithm and, in the setting in which the underlying network is sparse, we prove performance guarantees that are \emph{uniform in the sampling rate} as long as this is sufficiently high. This result substantiates the notion of a well defined `time complexity' for the network inference problem.
