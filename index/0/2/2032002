We give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm that, given a parameter k and two graphs G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>, either concludes that one of these graphs has treewidth at least k, or determines whether G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> are isomorphic. The running time of the algorithm on an n-vertex graph is 2<sup>O(k5 log k)</sup> · n<sup>5</sup>, and this is the first fixed-parameter algorithm for Graph Isomorphism parameterized by treewidth. Our algorithm in fact solves the more general canonization problem. We namely design a procedure working in 2<sup>OO(k5 log k)</sup> · n<sup>5</sup> time that, for a given graph G on n vertices, either concludes that the treewidth of G is at least k, or finds an isomorphism-invariant construction term - an algebraic expression that encodes G together with a tree decomposition of G of width O(k<sup>4</sup>). Hence, a canonical graph isomorphic to G can be constructed by simply evaluating the obtained construction term, while the isomorphism test reduces to verifying whether the computed construction terms for G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> are equal.
