In this paper we evaluate the performance of an SMT processor used as the geometry processor for a 3D polygonal rendering engine. To evaluate this approach, we consider PMesa (a parallel version of Mesa) which parallelizes the geometry stage of the 3D pipeline. We show that SMT is suitable for 3D geometry and we characterize the execution of the geometry stage in term of memory hierarchy, which is the main bottleneck. The results show that latency is not fully recovered by SMT; the use of L2 data prefetching does not succeed in increasing the performance. We show that this problem comes from a pollution of the instruction window by the threads experiencing L2 cache misses, thus reducing the window available for the other threads. We thus propose dcPRED, a hardware mechanism to predict L2 misses and control this pollution. Coupled with L2 data prefetching, dcPRED achieves gains up to 21% over the baseline SMT.
