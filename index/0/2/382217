This paper provides the first fully automatic approach for classifying clauses with respect to their aspectual properties as habitual, episodic or static. We bring together two strands of previous work, which address only the related tasks of the episodic-habitual and stative-dynamic distinctions, respectively. Our method combines different sources of information found to be useful for these tasks. We are the first to exhaustively classify all clauses of a text, achieving up to 80% accuracy (baseline 58%) for the three-way classification task, and up to 85% accuracy for related subtasks (baselines 50% and 60%), outperforming previous work. In addition, we provide a new large corpus of Wikipedia texts labeled according to our linguistically motivated guidelines.
