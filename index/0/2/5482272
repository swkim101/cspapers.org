We present a proposal intended to demonstrate the applicability of tabulation techniques for detecting approximately common patterns when dealing with structures sharing some common parts. This sharing saves on the space needed to represent the structures and also on their later processing, by factorizing the filtering of substructure matching. As a consequence, preliminary experimental tests indicate a reduction of the running time.
