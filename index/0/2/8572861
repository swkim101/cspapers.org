We are demonstrating several intelligent agents built according to the MGLAIR (Modal Grounded Layered Architecture with Integrated Reasoning) agent architecture. The top layer of MGLAIR is implemented in SNePS and its acting subsystem, SNeRE (the SNePS Rational Engine). The major demonstration will be act 3 of The Trial The Trail, an interactive drama running on an immersive Virtual Reality system, in which a human participant interacts with several MGLAIR actor-agents. We will also demonstrate several olher MGLAIR agents that operate in non-VR graphical environments. All these agents illustrate our approach to building agents with integrated first-person, on-line reasoning and acting.
