The performance of YouTube in cellular networks is crucial to network operators, who try to find a trade-off between cost-efficient handling of the huge traffic amounts and high perceived end-user Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper we present YoMoApp (YouTube Performance Monitoring Application), an Android application which passively monitors key performance indicators (KPIs) of YouTube adaptive video streaming on end-user smartphones. The monitored KPIs (i.e., player state/events, re-buffering, and video quality levels) can be used to analyze the QoE of mobile YouTube video sessions. YoMoApp is a valuable tool to assess the performance of cellular networks with respect to YouTube traffic, as well as to develop optimizations and QoE models for mobile HTTP adaptive streaming. We try YoMoApp through real subjective QoE lab tests showing that the tool is accurate to capture the experience of end-users watching YouTube on smartphones.
