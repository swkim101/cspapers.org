We present a nonlinear forward-search method suitable for planning the reactions of an agent operating in a highly unpredictable environment. We show that this method is more efficient than existing linear methods. We then introduce the notion of safety and liveness rules. This makes possible a sharper exploitation of the information retrieved when exploring the future of the agent.
