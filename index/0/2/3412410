Personalized recommendation has been proved effective as a content discovery tool for many online news publishers. As fresh news articles are frequently coming to the system while the old ones are fading away quickly, building a consistent and coherent feature representation over the ever-changing articles pool is fundamental to the performance of the recommendation. However, learning a good feature representation is challenging, especially for some small publishers that have normally fewer than 10,000 articles each year. In this paper, we consider to transfer knowledge from a larger text corpus. In our proposed solution, an effective article recommendation engine can be established with a small number of target publisher articles by transferring knowledge from a large corpus of text with a different distribution. Specifically, we leverage noise contrastive estimation techniques to learn the word conditional distribution given the context words, where the noise conditional distribution is pre-trained from the large corpus. Our solution has been deployed in a commercial recommendation service. The large-scale online A/B testing on two commercial publishers demonstrates up to 9.97% relative overall performance gain of our proposed model on the recommendation click-though rate metric over the non-transfer learning baselines.
