Knowledge representation systems using logical inference have been slow to embrace this new technology. We present the concept of inference graphs, a natural deduction inference system which scales well on multi-core and multi-processor machines. Inference graphs enhance propositional graphs by treating propositional nodes as tasks which can be scheduled to operate upon messages sent between nodes via the arcs that already exist as part of the propositional graph representation. The use of scheduling heuristics within a prioritized message passing architecture allows inference graphs to perform very well in forward, backward, bi-directional, and focused reasoning. Tests demonstrate the usefulness of our scheduling heuristics, and show significant speedup in both best case and worst case inference scenarios as the number of processors increases.
