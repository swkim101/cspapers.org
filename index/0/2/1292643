 This talk will discuss the challenges and strategies of managing the evolving ecosystem of "all data", from information security, to internal virtualization strategies. Engineering reliable globally scalable and compliant data management solutions demands a model for proactively measuring the risk complexity of an ecosystem for expert focus and potential proactive remediation. The research for quantitative measurement of database (or other) ecosystem entropy appears sparse. JPMC is looking to share its ideas in this space with the academic community as the need for such quantitative measures are increasingly important as ecosystems move from islands of single tenant risk into multi-tenant risk clusters.
