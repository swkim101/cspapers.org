Replacing aircraft hydraulic actuators with ElectroMechanical Actuators (EMAs) is seen as a necessary step towards the development of safer and more efficient aircraft with minimal environmental impact. EMAs are commonly used in a wide range of applications as they have improved efficiency over hydraulic actuators. However, in their current form, EMAs do not comply with the stringent weight and reliability requirements of primary flight control applications. This paper describes an Active Torque Distribution (ATD) system that could meet flight control reliability requirements, be lightweight, and increase the dynamic performance of current flight controls. The proposed ATD system uses magneto-rheological clutches to modulate the torque transferred from a centralized velocity source to various control surfaces. The fundamental advantage of this approach is found in the fluidic nature of magneto-rheological clutch interfaces which transmit torque without any solid mechanical contact thus preventing wear and failure causing mechanical seizure. The analytical study used to scale an ATD system and an analogue EMA system based on a representative flight control application shows that the proposed ATD system is 42% lighter than a system composed of EMAs and has a weight similar to that of current hydraulic actuators. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that ATD systems add ~100x less inertia to flight surfaces than EMAs allowing implementation of load alleviation control algorithms requiring high frequency motion (~30 Hz). A proof-of-concept clutch and controller confirm the analytical predictions and validate the possibility of using magneto-rheological clutches for flight control actuation.
