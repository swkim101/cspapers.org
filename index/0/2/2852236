To perform a schedulability test, scheduling analysis relies on a known worst-case execution time (WCET). This value may be difficult to compute and may be overly pessimistic. This paper offers an alternative analysis based on estimating a WCET from test data to within a specific level of probabilistic confidence. A method is presented for calculating an estimate given statistical assumptions. The implications of the level of confidence on the likelihood of schedulability are also presented.
