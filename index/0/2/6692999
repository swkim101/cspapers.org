The architecture of the Cytocomputer, an existing special-purpose, pipelined cellular image processor, is described. A formalism used to express cellular operations on images is then given. Cellular image processing algorithms are then developed that perform (1) design rule checks (DRC's) on VLSI circuit layouts, and (2) Lee-type wire routing. Two sets of cellular image processing transformations for checking the Mead and Conway design rules and for Lee-routing have been defined and used to program the Cytocomputer. Some experimental results are shown for these cellular implementations.
