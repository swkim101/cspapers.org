Recently, robots have been used in many applications including industry and human ordinary life. Robots can make the human life easier by doing the dangerous works such as working in a toxic environment or by doing the hard works such as carrying heavy objects. In addition, robots can add more precision and repeatability in many tasks such as welding and assembly tasks. Human assistant robot (HAR) is a humanoid type robot which consists of a body with waist joint, arms designed for safety, and a wheeled inverted pendulum mobile plat-form. Although the arms are designed at lowpower and lightweight for safety, it is capable to perform tasks that require high power by utilizing its self-weight, which is the feature of a wheeled inverted pendulum mobile platform.
