Kleinbergâ€™s HITS algorithm, a method of link analysis, uses the link structure of a network of webpages to assign authority and hub weights to each page. These weights are used to rank sources on a particular topic. We have found that certain tree-like web structures can lead the HITS algorithm to return either arbitrary or non-intuitive results. We give a characterization of these web structures. We present two modifications to the adjacency matrix input to the HITS algorithm. Exponentiated Input, our first modification, includes information not only on direct links but also on longer paths between pages. It resolves both limitations mentioned above. Usage Weighted Input, our second modification, weights links according to how often they were followed by users in a given time period; it incorporates user feedback without requiring direct user querying.
