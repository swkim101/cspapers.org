Many e-science communities, e. g., medicine, climatology, and astrophysics, are overwhelmed by the exponentially growing data volumes that need to be accessible by collaborating researchers. Nowadays, new scientific results are often obtained by exploring and cross-correlating data from different distributed sources [3]. However, neither centralized data processing by shipping the data to the processing site on demand nor a centralized data warehouse approach scale sufficiently to handle the huge data volumes and processing demands of future e-science communities and applications. The former suffers from high transmission costs while the latter cannot scale to the large amounts of data in combination with the growing number of queries.
