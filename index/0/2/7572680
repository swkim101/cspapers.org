In this paper we present preliminary work in the area of automated construction of user profiles. We consider the task of modeling the behavior of a user working with a command shell (such as csh or bash under the Unix operating system). We illustrate how the technique of inductive logic programming can be used to build a user profile and how this profile can be used to predict the future behavior of the user. We describe a first set of experiments to test these hypotheses and present directions for future work.
