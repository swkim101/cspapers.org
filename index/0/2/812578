In this paper, interference alignment (IA) is designed for secure multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems in the presence of an eavesdropper. The proposed IA technique designs the transmit precoding and receiving subspace matrices to minimize both the total inter-main-link interference and the wiretapped signals. With perfect channel state information is known at the transmitters (Txs), the cost function of the optimization problem is alternatively minimized over the precoding matrices at the Txs and the receiving subspace matrices at the receivers (Rxs) and the eavesdropper. The feasible condition, the proof of convergence of the proposed IA approach are provided. Numerical results reveal a significant improvement in terms of average secrecy sum rate of our IA algorithm as compared to the conventional IA design.
