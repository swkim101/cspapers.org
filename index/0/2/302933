The three problems that concern us are identifying a natural domain of pattern classification applications of feed forward neural networks, selecting an appropriate feedforward network architecture, and assessing the tradeoff between network complexity, training set size, and statistical reliability as measured by the probability of incorrect classification. We close with some suggestions, for improving the bounds that come from Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory, that can narrow, but not close, the chasm between theory and practice.
