In machine learning problems, labeled data are often in short supply. One of the feasible solution for this problem is transfer learning. It can make use of the labeled data from other domain to discriminate those unlabeled data in the target domain. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning framework based on similarity matrix approximation to tackle such problems. Two practical algorithms are proposed, which are the label propagation and the similarity propagation. In these methods, we build a hybrid graph based on all available data. Then the information is transferred cross domains through alternatively constructing the similarity matrix for different part of the graph. Among all related methods, similarity propagation approach can make maximum use of all available similarity information across domains. This leads to more efficient transfer and better learning result. The experiment on real world text mining applications demonstrates the promise and effectiveness of our algorithms.
