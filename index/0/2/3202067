In this paper we introduce our developed prototype mobile inspection robot for rescue activities named MOIRA. The robot consists of multi links and the four directions of each link are equipped with small crawlers. Due to the structural features, MOIRA has the following features. (a) MOIRA can go into the debris even if there is a restraint from the four directions (up-side, down-side, right-side and left side). (b) MOIRA does not have a concept of the four directions. That is, MOIRA can be operated even if the robot sideslips without any recover actions.
