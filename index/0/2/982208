Preliminary work by the authors made use of the so-called "Manhattan world" assumption about the scene statistics of city and indoor scenes. This assumption stated that such scenes were built on a cartesian grid which led to regularities in the image edge gradient statistics. In this paper we explore the general applicability of this assumption and show that, surprisingly, it holds in a large variety of less structured environments including rural scenes. This enables us, from a single image, to determine the orientation of the viewer relative to the scene structure and also to detect target objects which are not aligned with the grid. These inferences are performed using a Bayesian model with probability distributions (e.g. on the image gradient statistics) learnt from real data.
