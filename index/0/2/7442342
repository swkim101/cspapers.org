This paper discusses BAAR, a program to route conductor paths on printed-wiring boards. It is based upon the Moore-Lee algorithm1,2 and incorporates an effective path-cost function and a programmability feature. It is written in ALGOL for the Burroughs B6700 and is producing results which are very good in both of two respects: the quality of individual paths is comparable to what a human would produce, and completion rates are very high.
 The particular path-cost function used is inherently capable of yielding much better paths than a simple Manhattan-distance function, but the principal advantage of the program lies in the feature whereby a user may design a routing strategy for a particular board topography and then “program” the router to execute that strategy. The result is an algorithm which is remarkably simple, without the usual host of preprocessors, postprocessors, and special-case routines, while at the same time constituting a tool of considerable power and flexibility.
