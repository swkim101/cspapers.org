We present a new toolkit NiuParser for Chinese syntactic and semantic analysis. It can handle a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in Chinese, including word segmentation, partof-speech tagging, named entity recognition, chunking, constituent parsing, dependency parsing, and semantic role labeling. The NiuParser system runs fast and shows state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. Moreover, it is very easy to use for both research and industrial purposes. Advanced features include the Software Development Kit (SDK) interfaces and a multi-thread implementation for system speed-up.
