The Common Criteria (CC) provides comprehensive guidelines for the evaluation and certification of IT security. Due to the complexity of CC, CC-based certification process is quite time-consuming. The research aims to develop a CC Ontology and then construct an ontology-based tool supporting CC knowledge query, markup, review, and report functions. Results of this research can improve the understandability of CC, and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of CC-certification process.
