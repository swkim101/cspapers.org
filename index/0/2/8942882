This paper presents an operational space output feedback controller for non-redundant robot manipulators to achieve trajectory tracking without velocity measurements. The overall system can achieve a semi-global exponential stability (SGES) result for the position, orientation and velocity tracking errors as well as velocity observation errors. Experimental results of the proposed controller indicate good position and orientation tracking performance under parametric uncertainty and payload variations.
