We consider the problem of nonpreemptive scheduling with release dates on one machine to minimiie total completion time (l]rj] Cj Cj). We characterize a class of approtimation algorithms which includes an e/(el)approximation algorithm called BEST-a proposed by Chekuri, Motwani, Natarajan, and Stein [1997] (e/(e 1) z 1.58). Previously, it was not known whether the bound of e/(e 1) for B&ST-a was tight. We show that no algorithm in this class has an approximation ratio better than e/(e 1).
