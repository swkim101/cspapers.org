In this paper we investigate the face recognition problem via the overlapping energy histogram of the DCT coefficients. Particularly, we investigate some important issues relating to the recognition performance, such as the issue of selecting threshold and the number of bins. These selection methods utilise information obtained from the training dataset. Experimentation is conducted on the Yale face database and results indicate that the proposed parameter selection methods perform well in selecting the threshold and number of bins. Furthermore, we show that the proposed overlapping energy histogram approach outperforms the Eigenfaces, 2DPCA and energy histogram significantly.
