Adaptive mesh re(cid:0)nement (cid:1)AMR(cid:2) is a very important scienti(cid:0)c application(cid:3) Several libraries implementing speci(cid:0)c distribution policies havebeen written for AMR(cid:3) In this paper(cid:4) we present a (cid:5)fully general block distribu(cid:6) tion(cid:7) which subsumes these distributions(cid:4) and discuss compiler and run(cid:6)time tools for supporting these dis(cid:6) tributions e(cid:8)ciently in the context of a restructuring compiler(cid:3) We also present performance numbers which suggest that in comparison with library code written for a particular distribution policy(cid:4) the overhead arising from the generality of our approach is small(cid:3) (cid:0)
