As the American work force approaches the second millennium, requirements for competency in technology, science, and mathematics are increasing. According to a recent American Association of University Women study, by the year 2000, women and minorities will represent two out of three new participants in this work force. Other research suggests that the percent of women and minority computer science students is increasing only slowly or possibly decreasing. These trends will not fulfill the need for future American engineers and scientists even if other groups who have been traditionally involved with computing maintain their present levels. The demographics present the need for educating more and diverse student groups in computing, either as future scientists or as members of a technological society. The first course in computer science is crucial for maintaining student interest in the discipline. The course impacts not only studentsâ€™ technical skills but also career goals involving computing and, frequently, long term attitudes about the computing enterprise. Consequently thinking about a variety of strategies to reach diverse student groups is an important concern. In fact, only relying on the typical strategy in which the instructor sequentially presents the course material in an organized and closed form, i.e., the traditional lecture, is deleterious for many students. Active student involvement may make a difference in the learning of and commitment to computing. The panelists will discuss and demonstrate alternative teaching strategies for increasing the active involvement of all students. The strategies will illustrate a spectrum of techniques from those which are minimally intrusive to those involving a restructuring of the traditional first course in computer science. The panelists have
