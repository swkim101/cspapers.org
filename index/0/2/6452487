Event extraction is a particularly challenging problem in information extraction. The state-of-the-art models for this problem have either applied convolutional neural networks in a pipelined framework (Chen et al., 2015) or followed the joint architecture via structured prediction with rich local and global features (Li et al., 2013). The former is able to learn hidden feature representations automatically from data based on the continuous and generalized representations of words. The latter, on the other hand, is capable of mitigating the error propagation problem of the pipelined approach and exploiting the inter-dependencies between event triggers and argument roles via discrete structures. In this work, we propose to do event extraction in a joint framework with bidirectional recurrent neural networks, thereby beneÔ¨Åting from the advantages of the two models as well as addressing issues inherent in the existing approaches. We systematically investigate different memory features for the joint model and demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ACE 2005 dataset.
