The ACM Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges (CCECC) is updating the ACM curricular guidance for two-year transfer programs in computer science based on CS2013 with cybersecurity learning outcomes infused throughout. This BOF will provide a platform for two-year and four-year computer science faculty and academic administrators to discuss the newly revised associate-degree transfer guidance. The core task group writing the guidance consists of twelve community college faculty across the United States, led by the ACM CCECC and three task group leaders. The guidance has been informed by input from both two- and four-year educators in two rounds of public review and comment; a BOF, special session, and affiliated workshop at the prior two SIGCSE conferences; and international input at ITiCSE 2016. By SIGCSE 2017 the guidance will be in near-final form. The session will include an overview of the guidance, its relationship to CS2013, and infused cybersecurity. Discussion will center on implementing the guidance in two-year programs, gathering program exemplars, and facilitating transfer with four-year university partners.
