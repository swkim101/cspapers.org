The paper describes a data driven dependency parsing approach which uses clausal information of a sentence to improve the parser performance. The clausal information is added automatically during the parsing process. We demonstrate the experiments on Hindi, a language with relatively rich case marking system and free-word-order. All the experiments are done using a modified version of MSTParser. We did all the experiments on the ICON 2009 parsing contest data. We achieved an improvement of 0.87% and 0.77% in unlabeled attachment and labeled attachment accuracies respectively over the baseline parsing accuracies.
