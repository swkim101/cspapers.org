Tracking multiple people in an indoor environment enables various smart building applications such as HVAC energy saving, patient/child monitoring, etc. Researchers have explored various sensing methods including vision, motion, and RF, which either require specific installation requirements or high deployment density. We introduce a passive sparse sensing method based on ambient structural vibration induced by foot strikes. Our system tracks multiple people based on the premise that human foot strikes have spatio-temporal variation, and hence do not fully overlap. The system achieved less than 0.4m accuracy in both one and two persons stepping conditions.
