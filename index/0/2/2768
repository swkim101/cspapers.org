Automatic image annotation is a difficult and highly relevant machine learning task. Recent advances have significantly improved the state-of-the-art in retrieval accuracy with algorithms based on nearest neighbor classification in carefully learned metric spaces. But this comes at a price of increased computational complexity during training and testing. We propose FastTag, a novel algorithm that achieves comparable results with two simple linear mappings that are co-regularized in a joint convex loss function. The loss function can be efficiently optimized in closed form updates, which allows us to incorporate a large number of image descriptors cheaply. On several standard real-world benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that FastTag matches the current state-of-the-art in tagging quality, yet reduces the training and testing times by several orders of magnitude and has lower asymptotic complexity.
