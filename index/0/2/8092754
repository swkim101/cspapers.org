Programmable Embodied Agents are portable, wireless, interactivedevices embodying specific, differentiable, interactivecharacteristics. They take the form of identifiable characters whoreside in the physical world and interact directly with users. Theycan act as an out-of-band communication channel between users, asproxies for system components or other users, or in a variety ofother roles. Traditionally, research into such devices has beenbased on costly custom hardware. In this paper, we report on ourexplorations of the space of physical character-based interfacesbuilt on recently available stock consumer hardware platforms,structured around an initial framework of applications.
