In this paper, we study performance of multi-hop cooperative transmission protocols in underlay cognitive radio networks. In the considered protocols, secondary relays and secondary destination employ combining techniques such as selection combining (SC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) to combine the packets received from the secondary source and previous secondary relays. We derive asymptotic closed-form expressions of outage probability over Rayleigh fading channel. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to verify the derivations.
