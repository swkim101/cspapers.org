Building a secure computing system requires careful coordination among all layers in the system from hardware to software. Even if secure by itself, a higher layer protection mechanism may be bypassed if lower layer software or hardware is vulnerable. Additionally, hardware complements software through its efficiency, tamper resistance, etc. There have been significant efforts recently in hardware communities that aim to leverage hardware strengths to secure software layers, and also to secure hardware itself. This tutorial presents some of these hardware-enhanced security techniques to the security community.
