Performance is a high-priority consideration when designing concurrent or distributed systems. The process of designing such a system is complicated by two factors: (1) the current state-of-the-art in concurrent system design is very ad hoc â€” software design principles for concurrent systems are still in their infancy, and (2) performance evaluation of concurrent systems is quite difficult and it is especially difficult to relate aspects of the design to aspects of the implementation. This paper reports on work with a performance modeling technique for concurrent or distributed systems that allows structured design to be related to the implementation of the concurrency control component of the system. First, a General Process Model (GPM) is used to organize system design information into a six level hierarchy. The abstract performance properties of each level in the hierarchy have been established using concurrency control theory. Next, we describe how to translate the structured system design into efficient concurrency control techniques, using elements of this theory. Finally, a prototype automated design evaluation tool which serves as a central component of the design methodology is described.
