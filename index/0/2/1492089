Geoscience studies produce data from various observations, experiments, and simulations at an enormous rate. Exploratory data mining extracts "content information" from massive geoscientific datasets to extract knowledge and provide a compact summary of the dataset. In this paper, we discuss how database query processing and distributed object management techniques can be used to facilitate geoscientific data mining and analysis. Some special requirements of large scale geoscientific data mining that are addressed include geoscientific data modeling, parallel query processing, and heterogeneous distributed data access.
