We show in this paper that multi-layer dependability is an indispensable way to cope with the increasing amount of technology-induced dependability problems that threaten to proceed further scaling. We introduce the definition of multi-layer dependability and present our design flow within this paradigm that seamlessly integrates techniques starting at circuit layer all the way up to application layer and thereby accounting for ASIC-based architectures as well as for reconfigurable-based architectures. At the end, we give evidence that the paradigm of multi-layer dependability bears a large potential for significantly increasing dependability at reasonable effort.
