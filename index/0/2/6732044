With the aim to deal with sentiment-transfer problem, we proposed a novel approach, which integrates the sentiment orientations of documents into the graph-ranking algorithm. We apply the graph-ranking algorithm using the accurate labels of old-domain documents as well as the "pseudo" labels of new-domain documents. Experimental results show that proposed algorithm could improve the performance of baseline methods dramatically for sentiment transfer.
