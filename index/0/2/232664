We study an online model of fair division designed to capture features of a real world charity problem. We consider two simple mechanisms for this model in which agents simply declare what items they like. We analyse axiomatic properties of these mechanisms such as strategy-proofness and envy freeness. Finally, we perform a competitive analysis and compute the price of anarchy.
