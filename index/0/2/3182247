Classical logics and Datalog-related logics have both been proposed as underlying formalisms for the Semantic Web. Although these two different formalism groups have some commonalities, and look similar in the context of expressively-impoverished languages like RDF, their differences become apparent at more expressive language levels. After considering some of these differences, we argue that, although some of the characteristics of Datalog have their utility, the open environment of the Semantic Web is better served by standard logics.
