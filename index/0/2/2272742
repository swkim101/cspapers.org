Degrees of information and of contradiction are investigated within a uniform propositional framework, based on test actions. We consider that the degree of information of a propositional formula is based on the cost of actions needed to identify the truth values of each atomic proposition, while the degree of contradiction of a formula is based on the cost of actions needed to make the formula classically consistent. Our definitions are to a large extent independent of the underlying propositional logic; this flexibility is of prime importance since there is no unique, fully accepted logic for reasoning under inconsistency.
