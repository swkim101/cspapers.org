We introduce a new learning algorithm for decision lists to allow features that are constructed from the data and to allow a tradeoff between accuracy and complexity. We bound its generalization error in terms of the number of errors and the size of the classifier it finds on the training data. We also compare its performance on some natural data sets with the set covering machine and the support vector machine.
