Local structures of shadow boundaries as well as complex interactions of image regions remain largely unexploited by previous shadow detection approaches. In this paper, we present a novel learning-based framework for shadow region recovery from a single image. We exploit local structures of shadow edges by using a structured CNN learning framework. We show that using structured label information in classification can improve local consistency over pixel labels and avoid spurious labelling. We further propose and formulate shadow/bright measure to model complex interactions among image regions. The shadow and bright measures of each patch are computed from the shadow edges detected by the proposed CNN. Using the global interaction constraints on patches, we formulate a least-square optimization problem for shadow recovery that can be solved efficiently. Our shadow recovery method achieves state-of-the-art results on major shadow benchmark databases collected under various conditions.
