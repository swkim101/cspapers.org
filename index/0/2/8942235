Integrating value-oriented and object-oriented data models is one of the active research directions in database field. Current Horn clause languages do not have the concept of methods and there is no polymorphism. In this paper, we consider Horn clause programs from an object-oriented perspective. Our observation is that Horn clause languages can be extended and object-oriented features can be integrated with the support of a proper data model. Based on this observation, we present a deductive object-oriented database language, LLO, together with its supporting data model, which uses meta variables as an abstract mechanism to build type/class hierarchies. Methods are defined by rules and method inheritance is achieved through typing and unification mechanisms. Procedural semantics is also presented and several related issues are addressed.
