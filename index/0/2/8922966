At the present time there is a growing demand for the development of content-based image retrieval. This paper attempts to address the problems of indexing and retrieval of general photographic images. An indexing and retrieval scheme is introduced which models human colour perception. An initial evaluation of an implementation of the scheme reveals reasonable classification effectiveness, and a refinement method is proposed to overcome the problem of intrinsic colour appearance encountered with the implementation.
