Collision-free navigation in cluttered environments is essential for any mobile manipulation system. Traditional navigation systems have relied on a 2D grid map projected from a 3D representation for efficiency. This approach, however, prevents navigation close to objects in situations where projected 3D configurations are in collision within the 2D grid map even if actually no collision occurs in the 3D environment. Accordingly, when using such a 2D representation for planning paths of a mobile manipulation robot, the number of planning problems which can be solved is limited and suboptimal robot paths may result. We present a fast, integrated approach to solve path planning in 3D using a combination of an efficient octree-based representation of the 3D world and an anytime search-based motion planner. Our approach utilizes a combination of multi-layered 2D and 3D representations to improve planning speed, allowing the generation of almost real-time plans with bounded sub-optimality. We present extensive experimental results with the two-armed mobile manipulation robot PR2 carrying large objects in a highly cluttered environment. Using our approach, the robot is able to efficiently plan and execute trajectories while transporting objects, thereby often moving through demanding, narrow passageways.
