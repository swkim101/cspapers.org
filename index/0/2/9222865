Web services allow authorized entities (including individuals, corporations, and automated agents) to employ software components created by other parties scattered across the globe. In support of this powerful model of interaction, we have designed and implemented an infrastructure and a set of tools to simplify the development and management of Web services. This infrastructure and these tools form the TSpaces Services Suite (TSSuite). This paper shows how TSSuite supports the Web services model, and it describes the design and functionality of the main TSSuite components.
