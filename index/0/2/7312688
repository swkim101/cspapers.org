We propose a workshop on the topic of the Web of Things, which is about extending the Internet of Things concept beyond the connection of things and considering issues like heterogeneity, scalability, and usability with respect to pervasive computing. The goal of this initiative is to reuse the architectural principles that made the Web successful and apply them to smart devices, thereby making real-world objects first-class citizens of the Web. The approach taken by the Web of Things initiative is to look at the problems and research issues that emerge when considering the interaction of heterogeneous devices within composite applications. Continuing the successful Web of Things workshop series, this workshop aims at further exploring the use of technologies and principles at the core of the Web to provide methods for a seamless integration of physical devices. In particular, our goal is to foster discussion on systems towards a real-time Web of Things and the discovery, search, and composition of services provided by Web-enabled devices.
