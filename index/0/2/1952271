We employ an efficient method using Bayesian and linear classifiers for analyzing the dynamics of information in high-dimensional states of generic cortical microcircuit models. It is shown that such recurrent circuits of spiking neurons have an inherent capability to carry out rapid computations on complex spike patterns, merging information contained in the order of spike arrival with previously acquired context information.
