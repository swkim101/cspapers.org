We measure the WT10g test collection, used in the TREC-9 and TREC 2001 Web Tracks, with common measures used in the web topology community, in order to see if WT10g "looks like" the web. This is not an idle question; characteristics of the web, such as power law relationships, diameter, and connected components have all been observed within the scope of general web crawls, constructed by blindly following links. In contrast, WT10g was carved out from a larger crawl specifically to be a web search test collection within the reach of university researchers. Does such a collection retain the properties of the larger web? In the case of WT10g, yes.
