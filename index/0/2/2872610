A method of synthesizing low-power combinational logic circuits from Shannon Graphs is proposed such that an n input, m output circuit realization using 2-input gates with unbounded fanout has O(nm) transitions per input vector. Under a bounded fanout model, the transition activity is increased at most by a factor of n. Moreover, the power consumption is independent of circuit delays.
