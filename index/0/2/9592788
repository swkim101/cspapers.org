There are a number of systems that use a syntax-based reordering step prior to phrase-based statistical MT. An early work proposing this idea showed improved translation performance, but subsequent work has had mixed results. Speculations as to cause have suggested the parser, the data, or other factors. We systematically investigate possible factors to give an initial answer to the question: Under what conditions does this use of syntax help PSMT?
