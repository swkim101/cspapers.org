The class of Linear Inversion Transduction Grammars (litgs) is introduced, and used to induce a word alignment over a parallel corpus. We show that alignment via Stochastic Bracketing litgs is considerably faster than Stochastic Bracketing itgs, while still yielding alignments superior to the widely-used heuristic of intersecting bidirectional ibm alignments. Performance is measured as the translation quality of a phrase-based machine translation system built upon the word alignments, and an improvementof 2.85 bleu points over baseline is noted for French--English.
