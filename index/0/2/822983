A method of defining software functional tests is presented. This method uses program documentation, logic networks and a three-value simulator. The program function is extracted from the external specifications which are provided by the development programmer. Observable user and program actions are noted in the documentation and translated to a logic network. The network information and preliminary user actions are input to a three-value simulator. The simulator output is then translated into test cases and examined for completeness.
 This method of test defining provides “document testing” as well as function testing of the program. Problems associated with the method are discussed as well as recommendations for enhancements.
