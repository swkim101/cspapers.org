In this paper, we study the live streaming workload from a large content delivery network. Our data, collected over a 3 month period, contains over 70 million requests for 5,000 distinct URLs from clients in over 200 countries. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive data of live streaming on the Internet that has been studied to date. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we present a macroscopic analysis of the workload, characterizing popularity, arrival process, session duration, and transport protocol use. Our results show that popularity follows a 2-mode Zipf distribution, session interarrivals within small time-windows are exponential, session durations are heavy-tailed, and that UDP is far from having universal reach on the Internet. Second, we cover two additional characteristics that are more specific to the nature of live streaming applications: the diversity of clients in comparison to traditional broadcast media like radio and TV, and the phenomena that many clients regularly join recurring events. We find that Internet streaming does reach a wide audience, often spanning hundreds of AS domains and tens of countries. More interesting is that small streams also have a diverse audience. We also find that recurring users often have lifetimes of at least as long as one-third of the days in the event.
