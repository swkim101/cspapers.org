SCALD, a graphics-based hierarchical digital logic design system, is described and an example of its use is given. SCALD provides a total computer-aided design environment which inputs a high-level description of a digital system, and produces output for computer-aided manufacture of the system. SCALD has been used in the design of an operational, 15-MIPS, 5500-chip ECL-10K processor.
