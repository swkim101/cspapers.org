In surveying the possible applications of parallel computing, computer graphics is singularly attractive. This is because many computer graphics algorithms are so computationally intensive and yet also inherently very parallel in nature. The primary objective of an NSF grant to the University of North Carolina at Wilmington was to establish parallel computing in the undergraduate curriculum. A secondary objective was to address the issue of parallelism for computer graphics; however, curricular constraints made this difficult to do. Our response to this difficulty was twofold. For one, we focused on image processing as a more accessible, but very significant, alternative to ordinary computer graphics. Also, as a means of enabling deeper student involvement, we were able to supplement the original equipment grant (ILI) with one for supporting student research (REU).
