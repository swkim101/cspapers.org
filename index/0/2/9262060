1.3 Presentation As natural language is highly ambiguous even in restricted domains, interactive disambiguation is seen as a necessity for achieving more robust and user-friendly interactive systems, face-to-face translation systems and Dialogue-Based Machine Translation systems. We have proposed a methodology which distinguishes between two parts in a disambiguation module: an engine (languageand application-independent) and a lingware (languageand application-dependent). The engine is, thus, to be reused in the design of any disambiguation module. This paper presents the current state of our work, that is: an engine that has been used to design two interactive disambiguation modules, for French, and English.
