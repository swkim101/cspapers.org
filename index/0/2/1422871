This paper proposes constraint propagation relaxation (CPR), a probabilistic approach to classical constraint propagation that provides another view on the whole parametric family of survey propagation algorithms SP(ρ). More importantly, the approach elucidates the implicit, but fundamental assumptions underlying SP(ρ), thus shedding some light on its effectiveness and leading to applications beyond k-SAT.
