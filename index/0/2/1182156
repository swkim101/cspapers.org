In modeling the structure of task-related discourse using plans, it is important to distinguish between plans that the agent has adopted and is pursuing and those that are only being considered and explored, since the kinds of utterances arising from a particular domain plan and the patterns of reference to domain plans and movement within the plan tree are quite different in the two cases. This paper presents a three-level discourse model that uses separate domain and exploration layers, in addition to a layer of discourse metaplans, allowing these distinct behavior patterns and the plan adoption and reconsideration moves they imply to be recognized and modeled.
