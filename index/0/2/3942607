Battery-free, energy-harvesting devices operate using energy collected exclusively from their environment. Energy-harvesting devices allow maintenance-free deployment in extreme environments, but requires a power system to provide the right amount of energy when an application needs it. Existing systems must provision energy capacity statically based on an application's peak demand which compromises efficiency and responsiveness when not at peak demand. This work presents Capybara: a co-designed hardware/software power system with dynamically reconfigurable energy storage capacity that meets varied application energy demand. The Capybara software interface allows programmers to specify the energy mode of an application task. Capybara's runtime system reconfigures Capybara's hardware energy capacity to match application demand. Capybara also allows a programmer to write reactive application tasks that pre-allocate a burst of energy that it can spend in response to an asynchronous (e.g., external) event. We instantiated Capybara's hardware design in two EH devices and implemented three reactive sensing applications using its software interface. Capybara improves event detection accuracy by 2x-4x over statically-provisioned energy capacity, maintains response latency within 1.5x of a continuously-powered baseline, and enables reactive applications that are intractable with existing power systems.
