Magnetocardiography (MCG) is a technique of measuring the weak magnetic fields generated in the heart during its functioning. MCG can be measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) sensor that converts magnetic flux to voltage, and is the most sensitive sensor to detect magnetism. In this paper, analysis of myocardium current density distribution maps is proposed. Effective surface area dependence on time for full and divided into 4 parts current density distribution maps is obtained. Ref. 6, figs. 4.
