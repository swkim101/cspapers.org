In this paper we show that visual landmark generation and redetection is possible with a single feature per frame. The approach is based on the assumption that highly discriminative regions are easily redetectable in subsequent frames as well as in frames visited from different viewpoints. We investigate which feature detectors fit for this purpose and under which conditions the discriminability applies. The approach is tested in a topological localization scenario in which the best feature is tracked over several frames to build landmarks. We show that we can represent a large environment with a few salient landmarks and that a large percentage of these landmarks is robustly redetectable from different viewpoints.
