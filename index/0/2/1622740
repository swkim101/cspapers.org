Threat modeling is a lightweight approach to reason about application security and uses Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) with security annotations. We extended Reflexion Models to check the conformance of an as-designed DFD with an approximation of the as-built DFD obtained from the implementation. We also designed a set of properties and an analysis to help novice designers think about security threats such as spoofing, tampering and information disclosure.
