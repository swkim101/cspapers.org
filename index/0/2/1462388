This demo presents LeXFlow, a work-flow management system for cross-fertilization of computational lexicons. Borrowing from techniques used in the domain of document workflows, we model the activity of lexicon management as a set of workflow types, where lexical entries move across agents in the process of being dynamically updated. A prototype of LeXFlow has been implemented with extensive use of XML technologies (XSLT, XPath, XForms, SVG) and open-source tools (Cocoon, Tomcat, MySQL). LeXFlow is a web-based application that enables the cooperative and distributed management of computational lexicons.
