If modal logics for coalitions need to be applied, one must know how to translate coalition power into agents' actions. To these days, the connection between coalition power and the actions of the agents has not been studied in the literature. This paper fills the gap by presenting a semantic translation from Pauly's Coalition Logic to a (fragment of an) action logic. The interpretation of the empty coalition in Pauly's system and the representation of the notion of ability are discussed.
