The small instruction set size of the LC-3 as well as its similarities to more powerful instruction sets make it an ideal hypothetical machine for introductory computer science and computer engineering students. Several tools are available for working with this hypothetical machine including simulators, and assemblers for various platforms. We have created an additional tool, LC3uArch, that is useful for debugging LC-3 programs like the existing simulators, but unlike existing simulators also helps student to develop an understanding of the LC-3 microarchitecture. The results of a student survey on the use of LC3uArch indicate our students find LC3uArch a valuable learning tool.
