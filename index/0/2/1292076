D<sc>YNAMIC</sc> S<sc>TORAGE</sc> A<sc>LLOCATION</sc> is the problem of packing given axis-aligned rectangles into a horizontal strip of minimum height by sliding the rectangles vertically but not horizontally. Where <i>L=LOAD</i> is the maximum sum of heights of rectangles that intersect any vertical line and <i>OPT</i> is the minimum height of the enclosing strip, it is obvious that <i>OPT≥LOAD</i>; previous work showed that <i>OPT≤ 3• LOAD</i>. We continue the study of the relationship between <i>OPT</i> and <i>LOAD</i>, proving that <i>OPT=L+O((h<sub>max</sub>/L)<sup>1/7</sup>)L</i>, where <i>h<sub>max</sub></i> is the maximum job height. Conversely, we prove that for any <i>ε>0</i>, there exists a <i>c>0</i> such that for all sufficiently large integers <i>h<sub>max</sub></i>, there is a D<sc>YNAMIC</sc> S<sc>TORAGE</sc> A<sc>LLOCATION</sc> instance with maximum job height <i>h<sub>max</sub></i>, maximum load at most <i>L</i>, and <i>OPT≥ L+c(h<sub>max</sub>/L)<sup>1/2+ε</sup>L</i>, for infinitely many integers <i>L</i>. En route, we construct several new polynomial-time approximation algorithms for D<sc>YNAMIC</sc> S<sc>TORAGE</sc> A<sc>LLOCATION</sc>.
