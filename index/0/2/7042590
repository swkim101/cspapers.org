Business specifications are used to understand and describe businesses independently of any computing systems used for their possible automation. This understanding has to be expressed in a simple, clear, precise, and explicit way, in order to provide the essential common ground for business domain experts and software developers. In order for specifications to be understandable, they have to suppress irrelevant details (i.e., be abstract) and should not be presented in terms of possible or existing solutions. It follows that, for example, business specifications do not have to provide an owner for system state or behavior (as in message passing): such owners are required by legacy OO approaches to system development which have nothing to do with business specifications.
