Existing studies for mining frequent XML query patterns mainly introduce a straightforward candidate generate-and-test strategy and compute frequencies of candidate query patterns from scratch periodically by checking the entire transaction database, which consists of XML query patterns transformed from user queries. However, it is nontrivial to maintain such discovered frequent patterns in real XML databases because there may incur frequent updates that may not only invalidate some existing frequent query patterns but also generate some new frequent ones. Accordingly, existing proposals are inefficient for the evolution of the transaction database. To address these problems, this paper presents an efficient algorithm IPS-FXQPMiner for mining frequent XML query patterns without candidate maintenance and costly tree-containment checking. We transform XML queries into sequences through a one- to-one mapping and then mine the frequent sequences to generate frequent XML query patterns. More importantly, based on IPS-FXQPMiner, an efficient incremental algorithm, Incre-FXQPMiner is proposed to incrementally mine frequent XML query patterns, which can minimize the I/O and computation requirements for handling incremental updates. Our experimental study on various real-life datasets demonstrates the efficiency and scalability of our algorithms over previous known alternatives.
