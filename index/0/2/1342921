Using dynamic programming (DP), this paper presents a multi-level supervisory control implementation in the standard hierarchical discrete-event control framework. For a class of hierarchically consistent discrete-event systems, the DP algorithm developed implements a multi-level nonblocking controller with reduced off-line complexity of control synthesis and increased on-line transparency of control operations. An example illustrates the on-line control operations of the algorithm.
