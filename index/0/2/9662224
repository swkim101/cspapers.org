In this paper a DEC VAX with multiple register sets is evaluated under many differently sized register sets. Both the number of register sets and the number of registers per set were varied. Performance, measured in terms of memory traffic, is compared to that of a standard VAX. Memory traffic is measured from many real program traces on the standard processor and from transformations of the trace for the multiple register set processors. Results are presented for each program; an empirical formula is derived which describes the average program's behavior. A decrease in memory references of approximately 16% can be expected using multiple register sets.
