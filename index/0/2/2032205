We propose a new, simple model for the automatic induction of selectional preferences, using corpus-based semantic similarity metrics. Focusing on the task of semantic role labeling, we compute selectional preferences for semantic roles. In evaluations the similarity-based model shows lower error rates than both Resnikâ€™s WordNet-based model and the EM-based clustering model, but has coverage problems.
