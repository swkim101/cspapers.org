Emulabs, network testbeds on which experiments can be carried out through a web interface, are widely recognized as useful research environments. We believe that Emulabs are also excellent platforms for teaching courses in operating systems and networking. Moreover, equipment costs have fallen, and Emulab software has evolved, to the point where any school could conceivably afford their own. This raises the obvious question: "Should institutions build and operate their own Emulab?". To get a handle on this question, we describe our experiences building and operating Edulabs--Emulabs specifically designed for education--at Calvin College and the University of Kentucky. We argue that with the right technical support, owning and operating one's own Emulab is a worthwhile endeavor that has many benefits. We acknowledge, however, that in the absence of good technical support, deploying one's own Emulab can be a difficult enterprise. We also describe how we enhanced Emulab to improve its utility in an educational setting.
