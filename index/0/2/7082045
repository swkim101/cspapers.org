One of the main questions that arise when studying random and quasi‐random structures is which properties $ \cal P$ are such that any object that satisfies $ \cal P$ “behaves” like a truly random one. In the context of graphs, Chung, Graham, and Wilson (Combinatorica 9 (1989), 345–362) call a graph p‐quasi‐random if it satisfies a long list of the properties that hold in G(n,p) with high probability, such as edge distribution, spectral gap, cut size, and so on.
