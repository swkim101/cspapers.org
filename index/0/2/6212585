We are interested in diacritizing Semitic languages, especially Syriac, using only dia-critized texts. Previous methods have required the use of tools such as part-of-speech taggers, segmenters, morphological analyzers, and linguistic rules to produce state-of-the-art results. We present a low-resource, data-driven, and language-independent approach that uses a hybrid word- and consonant-level conditional Markov model. Our approach rivals the best previously published results in Arabic (15% WER with case endings), without the use of a morphological analyzer. In Syriac, we reduce the WER over a strong baseline by 30% to achieve a WER of 10.5%. We also report results for Hebrew and English.
