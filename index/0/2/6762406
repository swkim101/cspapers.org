Chelsio will present its Unified Wire adapter, based on the latest version of its proven Terminator engine architecture. The architecture's unique features allow simultaneous use of a 10Gbp Ethernet network for iSCSI storage, high performance computing using iWARP RDMA and general TCP/IP networking. The results of performance benchmarks show how both low latency and high bandwidth applications can be supported on this unified wire fabric, eliminating the need for multiple infrastructures and specialized interconnects, such as Fibre Channel and Infiniband, thereby significantly reducing the total cost of ownership.
