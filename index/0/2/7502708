Studies of human motor control suggest that humans develop internal models of the arm during the execution of voluntary movements. In particular, the internal model consists of the inverse dynamic model of the musculoskeletal system and intervenes in the feedforward loop of the motor control system to improve reactivity and stability in rapid movements. In this paper, an interaction control scheme inspired by biological motor control is resumed, i.e. the coactivation-based compliance control in the joint space (Zollo, L, et al., 2003), and a feedforward module capable of online learning the manipulator inverse dynamics is presented. A novel recurrent learning paradigm is proposed which derives from an interesting functional equivalence between locally weighted regression networks and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy systems. The proposed learning paradigm has been named recurrent locally weighted regression networks and strengthens the computational power of feedforward locally weighted regression networks. Simulation results are reported to validate the control scheme.
