Cryptographic algorithm standards play an important role both to the practice of information security and to cryptography theory research. Among them, the KEA and OPACITY (KEA/OPACITY, in short) protocols, and the MQV and HMQV ((H)MQV, in short) protocols, are a family of implicitly authenticated Diffie-Hellman key-exchange (IA-DHKE) protocols that are among the most efficient authenticated key-exchange protocols known and are widely standardized. In this work, from some new design insights, we develop a new family of practical IA-DHKE protocols, referred to as OAKE (standing for "optimal authenticated key-exchange" in brief). We show that the OAKE protocol family combines, in essence, the advantages of both (H)MQV and KEA/OPACITY, while saving from or alleviating the disadvantages of them both.
