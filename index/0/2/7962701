This paper presents a novel approach based on multiwavelet transform in Web information retrieval. The influence multiwavelet transform on feature extraction and information retrieval ability of calibration model and solve problem of selecting optimum wavelet transform for sentence query entered of any language by internet user was investigated. The empirical results show that the proposed method performs accurate retrieval of the multiwavelet transform than scalar wavelet transform. The aptitude of multiwavelet transform to represent one language (domain) of the multilingual world. Regardless of type, script, word order, direction of writing and difficult font problems of the language. This work is a step towards multilingual (English, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, German, Greek, Portuguese, French, Italian, Russian, Arabic, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Japanese and Korean (CJK)) search engine. We consider multiwavelet transform as signal processing tool in Soft Computing (SC) as well.
