This paper describes the latest version of speech-to-speech translation systems developed by the team of NICT-ATR for over twenty years. The system is now ready to be deployed for the travel domain. A new noise-suppression technique notably improves speech recognition performance. Corpus-based approaches of recognition, translation, and synthesis enable coverage of a wide variety of topics and portability to other languages.
