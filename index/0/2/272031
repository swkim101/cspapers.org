Recent research results have shown more benefits of the management of code clones, rather than detecting and removing them. However, existing clone management approaches are still unsatisfactory, and either incomplete or inefficient, due to the lack of incremental clone detection tool supports. In this paper, we introduce such an incremental clone detection tool, called ClemanX. Our empirical evaluation on real-world software projects shows that ClemanX is highly efficient, complete, precise, and is capable of working incrementally when the code changes.
