Place categorisation; i.e., learning to group perception data into categories based on appearance; typically uses supervised learning and either visual or 2D range data. This paper shows place categorisation from 3D data without any training phase. We show that, by leveraging the NDT histogram descriptor to compactly encode 3D point cloud appearance, in combination with standard clustering techniques, it is possible to classify public indoor data sets with accuracy comparable to, and sometimes better than, previous supervised training methods. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to outdoor data, with an added benefit of being able to hierarchically categorise places into sub-categories based on a user-selected threshold. This technique relieves users of providing relevant training data, and only requires them to adjust the sensitivity to the number of place categories, and provide a semantic label to each category after the process is completed.
