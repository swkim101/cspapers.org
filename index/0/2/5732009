However, many existing GL algorithms do not scale up to high-dimensional problems, and/or only work well for a specific choice of the transformation. We propose an efficient Matching Pursuit Generalized LASSO (MPGL) method, which overcomes these issues, and is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum. We formulate the GL problem as a convex quadratic constrained linear programming (QCLP) problem and tailor-make a cutting plane method. More specifically, our MPGL iteratively activates a subset of nonzero elements of the transformed variables, and solves a subproblem involving only the activated elements thus gaining significant speed-up. Moreover, MPGL is less sensitive to the choice of the trade-off hyper-parameter between data fitting and regularization, and mitigates the long-standing hyper-parameter tuning issue in many existing methods. Experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method over the state-of-the-arts in both classification and image processing tasks.
