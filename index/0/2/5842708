Abstract : A probabilistic analysis of the Rocchio relevance feedback algorithm, one of the most popular learning methods from information retrieval, is presented in a text categorization framework. The analysis results in a probabilistic version of the Rocchio classifier and offers an explanation for the TFIDF word weighting heuristic. The Rocchio classifier, its probabilistic variant and a standard naive Bayes classifier are compared on three text categorization tasks. The results suggest that the probabilistic algorithms are preferable to the heuristic Rocchio classifier.
