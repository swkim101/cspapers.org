Cache storage is a proven memory speedup technique in large mainframe computers. Two of the main difficulties associated with the use of this concept in small machines are the high relative cost and complexity of the cache controller. An LSI bit-slice chip set is described which should reduce both controller cost and complexity. The set will enable a memory designer to construct a wide variety of cache structures with a minimum number of components and interconnections. Design parameters are based on the results of extensive simulation. Particular emphasis is placed on the need for design flexibility.
 The chip set consists of three devices - an address bit-slice, a data bit-slice and a central control unit. Circuit design has been completed to a gate level based on an ECL/EFL implementation. The proposed structure will accommodate cache sizes up to 2K words with access times as short as 25 ns.
