In this work, we propose a method to compute the stiffness of flexible joints and its realization in order to let the fingers track a certain predefined trajectory. We refer to tendon-driven, underactuated and passively compliant hands composed of deformable joints and rigid links. Specific stiffness and pre-form shapes can be assigned to the finger joints can be given s such that a single-cable actuation can be used. We firstly define a procedure to determine suitable joints stiffness and then we propose a possible realization of soft joints using rapid prototyping techniques. The stiffness computation is obtained leveraging on the the mechanics of tendon-driven hands and on compliant systems, while for its implementation beam theory has been exploited. We validate the proposed framework both in simulation and with experiments using the robotic Soft-SixthFinger, a wearable robot for grasping compensation in patients with a paretic hand, as a case study. The proposed framework can be used to design the stiffness of the passive joints in several model of underactuated tendon-driven soft hands so to improve their grasping capabilities.
