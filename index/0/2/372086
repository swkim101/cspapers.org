Discourse references, notably coreference and bridging, play an important role in many text understanding applications, but their impact on textual entailment is yet to be systematically understood. On the basis of an in-depth analysis of entailment instances, we argue that discourse references have the potential of substantially improving textual entailment recognition, and identify a number of research directions towards this goal.
