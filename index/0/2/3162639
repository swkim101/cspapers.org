This paper presents a genetic algorithm based approach to the automatic discovery of finite-state automata (FSAs) from positive data. FSAs are commonly used in computational phonology, but-given the limited learnability of FSAs from arbitrary language subsets-are usually constructed manually. The approach presented here offers a practical automatic method that helps reduce the cost of manual FSA construction.
