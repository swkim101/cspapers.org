The recommendation of additional shopping items that are potentially interesting for the customer has become a standard feature of modern online stores. In academia, research on recommender systems (RS) is mostly centered around approaches that rely on explicit item ratings and long-term user profiles. In practical environments, however, such rating information is often very sparse and for a large fraction of the users very little is known about their preferences. Furthermore, in particular when the shop offers products from a variety of categories, the decision of what should be recommended can strongly depend on the user's current short-term interests and the navigational context. In this paper, we report the results of an initial experimental analysis evaluating the predictive accuracy of different contextualized and non-contextualized recommendation strategies and discuss the question of appropriate experimental designs for such types of evaluations. To that purpose, we introduce a parameterizable protocol that supports session-specific accuracy measurements. Our analysis, which was based on log data obtained from a large online retailer for clothing and lifestyle products, shows that even a comparably simple contextual post-processing approach based on product features can leverage short-term user interests to increase the accuracy of the recommendations.
