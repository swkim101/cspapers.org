The comparison of evolutionary trees is a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology. Different evolutionary hypotheses (or conflicting phylogenies) arise when different phylogenetic reconstruction methods are applied to the same data set, or when a single method is applied to different data sets (e.g. different genes). Several similarity metrics between evolutionary trees are currently in use [2]. In this paper, we study the quartet metric, which is based on common subtrees induced by four leaves. This metric has several attractive properties, though its use has been limited by the time required to compute the distance [7]. In this paper, we address this problem by describing an O(n 2) algorithm that computes the quartet distance between two evolutionary trees. Two general approaches are currently ill use to resolve conflicting phylogenies. One method is to select a consensus tree (or trees) that best represents the information provided by each tree. The maximum agreement subtree (MAST) is an instance of this approach. A substantial amount of effort has been devoted to efficient algorithms for finding the MAST of two or many evolutionary trees, see [8] for a summary of results. A more quantitative approach is to define a similarity metric between trees to assess the stability of a solution by measuring the degree of similarity among the trees. The distributions of various tree similarity metrics are well-studied [7] and are very useful in testing statistical hypotheses. An evolutionary tree represents the direction of evolution by the location of its root, the rate of evolutionary by its edge lengths and the history of speciation events by its branching pattern or topology. Biologists are often interested in the distance between
