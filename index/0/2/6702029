The goal of this workshop was to discuss two major issues: efficient exploration of a learner's state space, and learning in continuous domains. The common themes that emerged in presentations and in discussion were the importance of choosing one's domain assumptions carefully, mixing controllers/strategies, avoidance of catastrophic failure, new approaches with difficulties with reinforcement learning, and the importance of task transfer.
