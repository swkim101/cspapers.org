In this paper, we propose a novel approach for bird part localization, targeting fine-grained categories with wide variations in appearance due to different poses (including aspect and orientation) and subcategories. As it is challenging to represent such variations across a large set of diverse samples with tractable parametric models, we turn to individual exemplars. Specifically, we extend the exemplar-based models in [4] by enforcing pose and subcategory consistency at the parts. During training, we build pose-specific detectors scoring part poses across subcategories, and subcategory-specific detectors scoring part appearance across poses. At the testing stage, likely exemplars are matched to the image, suggesting part locations whose pose and subcategory consistency are well-supported by the image cues. From these hypotheses, part configuration can be predicted with very high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains from our method on an extensive dataset: CUB-200-2011 [30], for both localization and classification tasks.
