We describe a view-management component for interactive 3D user interfaces. By view management, we mean maintaining visual constraints on the projections of objects on the view plane, such as locating related objects near each other, or preventing objects from occluding each other. Our view-management component accomplishes this by modifying selected object properties, including position, size, and transparency, which are tagged to indicate their constraints. For example, some objects may have geometric properties that are determined entirely by a physical simulation and which cannot be modified, while other objects may be annotations whose position and size are flexible.We introduce algorithms that use upright rectangular extents to represent on the view plane a dynamic and efficient approximation of the occupied space containing the projections of visible portions of 3D objects, as well as the unoccupied space in which objects can be placed to avoid occlusion. Layout decisions from previous frames are taken into account to reduce visual discontinuities. We present augmented reality and virtual reality examples to which we have applied our approach, including a dynamically labeled and annotated environment.
