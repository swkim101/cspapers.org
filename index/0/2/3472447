CS2013 brings parallel and distributed computing (PDC) into the CS curricular mainstream. The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a platform independent, industry-standard library for parallel and distributed computing. The MPI standard includes support for C, C++, and Fortran; third parties have created implementations for Python and Java. This hands-on workshop introduces MPI basics and applications in C/C++ using Raspberry Pi single-board computers, as an inexpensive and engaging hardware platform for studying PDC. The workshop includes: (i) personal experience with the Raspberry Pi (units provided) accessed via participant laptops (Windows, Mac, or Linux); (ii) assembly of Beowulf clusters of Raspberry Pis quickly in the classroom; (iii) self-paced hands-on experimentation with the working MPI programs; and (iv) a discussion of how such clusters can be used to engage students in and out of the classroom. Participants will experience how to teach distributed computing essentials with MPI by means of reusable, effective "parallel programming patterns," including single program multiple data (SPMD) execution, send-receive message passing, the master-worker, parallel loop, and other common patterns. Participants will then explore more in-depth "exemplar" applications, such as drug design and epidemiology. All materials including the Raspberry Pi software system setup from this workshop will be freely available from CSinParallel.org. No prior experience with MPI, PDC, or the Raspberry Pi is required. Windows, Mac, or Linux laptop required.
