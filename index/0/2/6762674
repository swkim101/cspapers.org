We demonstrate a pervasive social exergame platform called ExerLink that converts exercise intensity to game inputs and intelligently balances intensity/delay variations for fair game play experiences. Also, we show the potential of using multiple exercise devices as game controllers and incorporating multiple heterogeneous controllers into a game. Specifically, we consider a class of exercise equipment used for repetitive, individual, and aerobic (RIA) exercises such as treadmill running, stationary cycling, hula hooping, and jump roping.
