We present an elevating tangible block, G-raffe, supporting 2.5-dimensional (2.5-D) interaction in a tabletop computing environment. There is a lack of specialized interface devices for tabletop computing environments. G-raffe overcomes the limitation of conventional 2-D interactions inherited from the vertical desktop computing setting. We adopted a rollable metal tape structure to create up and down movements in a small volume of the block. This also becomes a connecting device for a mobile display to be used with the tabletop computer. We report on our design rationale as well as the results of a preliminary user study.
