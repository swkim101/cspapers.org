Carl is a prototype of an intelligent service robot, designed having in mind for such tasks as serving food in a reception or acting as a host in an organization. The approach that has been followed in the design of Carl is based on an explicit concern with the integration of the major dimensions of intelligence, namely communication, action, reasoning and learning. Although different communities have thoroughly studied these dimensions in the past, their integration has seldom been attempted in a systematic way. This paper describes the software architecture of Carl as well as the main modules, from sensor fusion and navigation to language-level communication and learning.
