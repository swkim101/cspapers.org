The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a canonical NP-complete problem which is known to be MAX-SNP hard even on (high-dimensional) Euclidean metrics [39]. In order to circumvent this hardness, researchers have been developing approximation schemes for low-dimensional metrics [4, 38] (under different notions of dimension). However, a feature of most current notions of metric dimension is that they are "local": the definitions require <i>every</i> local neighborhood to be well-behaved. In this paper, we consider the case <i>when the metric is less restricted: it has a few "dense" regions, but is "well-behaved on the average"?</i>
 To this end, we define a global notion of dimension which we call the <i>correlation dimension</i> (denoted by dim<sub><i>C</i></sub>), which generalizes the popular notion of doubling dimension. In fact, the class of metrics with dim<sub><i>C</i></sub> = <i>O</i>(1) not only contains all doubling metrics, but also contains some metrics containing uniform submetrics of size √<i>n</i>. We first show, using a somewhat "local" argument, that one can solve TSP on these metrics in time 2<sup><i>O</i>(√<i>n</i>)</sup>; we then take advantage of the global nature of TSP (and the global nature of our definition) to give a (1 + ε)-approximation algorithm that runs in <i>sub-exponential time</i>: i.e., in 2<sup><i>O</i>(<i>n</i>Δε-4dimC)</sup>-time for every constant 0 < Δ < 1.
