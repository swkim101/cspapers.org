Taking an autonomous road vehicle as an example, approaches and methods for object detection (this being the first step of obstacle recognition) are discussed. Vision, using a single passive camera as the primary sensor and a real-time vision system for analyzing the resulting image sequence, is found to be the best approach. Results obtained in real-world experiments with such a system are reported: large obstacles have been detected in distances up to 716 m; all relevant objects that were encountered during a prolonged test on a highway were detected; the cycle time of the detection process was below 100 ms, and less than one false alarm occurred per minute.
