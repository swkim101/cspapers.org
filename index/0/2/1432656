In this special session, attendees learn about techniques of teaching with team projects with Alice 3's new Save Type, Import Type, and Merge capabilities. Using this technique, students in introductory level programming courses can participate in team projects where students work as a team in various stages of design, development, and testing. As part of this process students may work independently to code one or more classes and then merge their work with that of other members of the team to create the final project.
