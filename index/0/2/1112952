The increasing popularity of adblockers has prompted online publishers to retaliate against adblock users by deploying anti-adblock scripts, which detect adblock users and bar them from accessing content unless they disable their adblocker. To circumvent anti-adblockers, adblockers rely on manually curated anti-adblock filter lists for removing anti-adblock scripts. Anti-adblock filter lists currently rely on informal crowdsourced feedback from users to add/remove filter list rules. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of anti-adblock filter lists to analyze their effectiveness against anti-adblockers. Specifically, we compare and contrast the evolution of two popular anti-adblock filter lists. We show that these filter lists are implemented very differently even though they currently have a comparable number of filter list rules. We then use the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to conduct a retrospective coverage analysis of these filter lists on Alexa top-5K websites over the span of last five years. We find that the coverage of these filter lists has considerably improved since 2014 and they detect anti-adblockers on about 9% of Alexa top-5K websites. To improve filter list coverage and speedup addition of new filter rules, we also design and implement a machine learning based method to automatically detect anti-adblock scripts using static JavaScript code analysis.
