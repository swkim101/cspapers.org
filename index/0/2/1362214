A model-based control scheme for robot manipulators employing a variable structure control law has been found to perform well, provided that the design parameters are carefully chosen. A refinement of the system model of this original scheme in which the actuator dynamics is taken into consideration is studied. Practical experiments are carried out on a commercial revolute-joint robot manipulator.
