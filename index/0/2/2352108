We discuss the problem of implementing an expert, knowledge-based system. In particular, we consider which predicates in an expert, knowledge-based system should be actually stored and which should be derived on demand. We present two solutions for unconstrained applications. When realistic constraints are present it is shown that the problem is NP-complete. A sub-optimal algorithm is given which operates in polynomial time when the application is not heavily constrained.
