An interdisciplinary bioinformatics course has been taught at Wake Forest for three semesters. Undergraduate and graduate students from multiple academic specialties are brought together in a single classroom. In addition to focusing on traditional bioinformatics topics, this course concentrates on interdisciplinary collaboration in the in-class exercises and the research-based course project. A team of faculty from complementary disciplines teach the course. Productive communication is one key goal of this course.
