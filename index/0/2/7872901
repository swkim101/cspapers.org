At U S WEST Advanced Technologies, we have been using a method we call Video Prototyping to simulate interface ideas for over a dozen software design projects. It is similar to the work described by Curtis and Vertelney [1], because we create a simple stop-motion animation depicting user interface design concepts. However, Video Prototyping requires no post-production editing or any special expertise in video production. In this way it is more like Muller's PICTIVE work [2], where multi-disciplinary design teams use it in informal brainstorming sessions. Unlike PICTIVE, we do not simply record design ideas but create an evocative simulation of the proposed interface.
