Providing patients who have disabilities with the rehabilitation and care necessary to allow them good quality of life creates overwhelming demands for health and rehabilitation services. We suggest that advancements in intelligent agent technology provide new opportunities for improving the provided services. We will discuss the challenges of building an agent for the health care domain and present four capabilities that are required for an agent in the health care domain: planning, monitoring, intervention and encouragement. We will discuss the importance of personalizing all of them and the needto facilitate cooperation between the automated agent and the human care givers. We will review recent technology that can be used toward the development of agents that can have these capabilities and their promise in automating services such as physiotherapy, speech therapy and cognitive training.
