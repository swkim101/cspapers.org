Tempus Fugit ("Time Flies") is the first of a new generation of Personal Information Management (PIM) systems. A PIM system incorporates an electronic calendar, "to-do" list and address book. The premise behind Tempus Fugit is that information stored in electronic calendars, to-do lists and address books can be given richer semantic interpretation and automatically processed to make its users more effective. Tempus Fugit also tracks the physical and virtual locations of users and uses this information to predict meeting attendance and help them as they travel during their day.
