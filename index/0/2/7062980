In view selection, little work has been done for optimizing the search process, views must be densely distributed and checked individually. Thus, evaluating poor views wastes much time, and a poor view may even be misidentified as a best one. In this paper, we propose a search strategy by identifying the regions that are very likely to contain best views, referred to as canonical regions. It is by decomposing the model under investigation into meaningful parts, and using the canonical views of these parts to generate canonical regions. Applying existing view selection methods in the canonical regions can not only accelerate the search process but also guarantee the quality of obtained views. As a result, when our canonical regions are used for searching N-best views during comprehensive model analysis, we can attain greater search speed and reduce the number of views required. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.
