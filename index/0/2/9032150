Teaching secure coding has never been more important. The CS2013 Ironman draft includes Information Assurance and Security as a new Knowledge Area and recommends that security be cross-cutting across all undergraduate computer science curricula. The Summit on Education in Secure Software recommended: 1) increasing the number of faculty who understand the importance of secure programming principles, and will require students to practice them; 2) integrating computer security content into existing technical and non-technical courses; and 3) using innovative teaching methods to strengthen the foundation of computer security knowledge. In this panel, we will speak to these recommendations and the new curricular guidelines and discuss the importance and challenges of teaching secure coding.
