Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) has been used in main memory design for decades. However, DRAM consumes an increasing power budget and faces difficulties in scaling down for small feature size CMOS processing technologies. Compared to conventional DRAM, emerging phase change random access memory (PRAM) demonstrates superior power efficiency and processing scalability as VLSI technologies and integration density continue to advance. Nevertheless, using nano-scale fabrication technologies will unavoidably introduce design parameter variability in the manufacturing stage. In the past, the impact of process variation (PV) on conventional transistor-based storage cells and combinational logic has been studied extensively. However, the implication of PV on non-volatile memory design using emerging phase change techniques has not been well understood. In this paper, we take the first step toward characterizing the effect of process variation on PRAM and explore PV-aware design techniques. We show that process variation increases the PRAM programming power by 96% and degrades PRAM endurance by 50X. Our proposed circuit and two microarchtiecture techniques with system-level support reduce PRAM power by 44%, 59% and 57% and improve PRAM endurance by 27X, 277X and 268X, relative to PV-affected PRAM design. Moreover, we show that the synergy of the proposed cross-layer approaches, which achieve an average 63% power savings and 13050X endurance improvement over the conventional case, provide an attractive design solution to mitigate the deleterious impact of PV for non-volatile memory in the upcoming nano-scale processing technology era.
