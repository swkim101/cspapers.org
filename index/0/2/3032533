XCheck is a tool for assessing the relative performance of different XQuery engines by means of benchmarks consisting of a set of XQuery queries and a set of XML documents. Given a benchmark and a set of engines, XCheck runs the benchmark on these engines and produces highly informative performance output. The current version of XCheck contains all available XQuery benchmarks which are run against four XQuery engines: Galax, Qizx/open, Saxon and MonetDB/XQuery. XCheck's design makes it easy to include new engines and new benchmarks.
