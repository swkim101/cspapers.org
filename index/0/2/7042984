Punctuations are not available in automatic speech recognition outputs, which could create barriers to many subsequent text processing tasks. This paper proposes a novel method to predict punctuation symbols for the stream of words in transcribed speech texts. Our method jointly performs parsing and punctuation prediction by integrating a rich set of syntactic features when processing words from left to right. It can exploit a global view to capture long-range dependencies for punctuation prediction with linear complexity. The experimental results on the test data sets of IWSLT and TDT4 show that our method can achieve high-level performance in punctuation prediction over the stream of words in transcribed speech text.
