This paper proposes a comprehensive modeling architecture for workloads on parallel computers using Markov chains in combination with state dependent empirical distribution functions. This hybrid approach is based on the requirements of scheduling algorithms: the model considers the four essential job attributes submission time, number of required processors, estimated processing time, and actual processing time. So far, no model exists that considers all those attributed at the same time. To assess the goodness-of-fit of a workload model the similarity between sequences of real jobs and jobs generated from the model needs to be captured. We propose to reduce the complexity of this task and to evaluate the model by comparing the results of a widely-used scheduling algorithm instead. This approach is demonstrated with commonly used scheduling objectives. To verify this evaluation technique, standard criteria for assessing the goodness-of-fit for workload models are additionally applied.
