This paper presents a novel line matching method based on the intersection context of coplanar line pairs especially working in poorly textured indoor scenes. To overcome the matching ambiguity of single line segments, intersecting line pairs in 2D images are utilized for line matching. Coplanarity of the intersecting line pairs and their corresponding intersection context discriminate true intersecting line pairs from false intersecting ones in 3D world. Compared to previous approaches, the proposed method can match line segments and estimate camera geometry simultaneously not knowing camera geometry in advance or not considering topological relations of all line segments. Comparison studies and experimental results prove the accuracy and speed of the proposed method in real world situations.
