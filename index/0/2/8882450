Foot positions are features of how humans express their intentions during conversations. This inspired us to investigate the usage of foot expressions during interactions with computers. We conducted an observational study to determine how foot positions correlate with the intentions of users at public displays. Using our findings, we performed a case study to demonstrate the usefulness of adapting content according to the intentions detected based on foot positions. Our results are valuable for researchers designing context-aware public displays.
