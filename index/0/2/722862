We describe funct$on materzakation as an optimization concept in object-oriented databases. Exploiting the object-oriented paradigm—namely class lficatton, object identzty, and encapsalatzon-—facilitates a rather easy incorporation of function materialization mto (existing) object-oriented systems. Furthermore, the exploitation of encapsulation (information hiding) and object identity provides for additional performance tuning measures which drastically decrease the rematerialization overhead incurred by updates in the object base. The paper concludes with a quantitative analysis of function materialization based on a sample performance benchmark obtained from our experimental object base system GOM.
