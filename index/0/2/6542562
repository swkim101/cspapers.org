A Beowulf cluster is a MIMD multiprocessor built from commodity off-the-shelf personal computers connected via a dedicated network, running free open-source software. Such a cluster can provide a supercomputer's performance at a small fraction of one's cost. For small colleges and universities, the relatively low cost of a Beowulf cluster makes it an attractive alternative to a commercial supercomputer. This paper details our experience building a Beowulf cluster at a four-year comprehensive college.
