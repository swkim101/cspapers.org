Smart actuators are the key components in a variety of nanopositioning applications, such as scanning probe microscopes and atomic force microscopes. Piezoelectric actuators are the most common actuators among a variety of smart actuators due to their high resolution, low power consumption and wide operating frequency but they suffer hysteresis which affects linearity. In this paper, an innovative digital charge amplifier is presented to reduce hysteresis in stack piezoelectric actuators. Experimental results are presented.
