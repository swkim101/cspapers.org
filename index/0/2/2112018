Description Logic (DL) Systems can be useful as front-ends for databases, particularly in applications that involve browsing and exploring, such as data mining. Such use of DL sy~ terns raises some pragmatic and theoretical issues, In this paper, we describe a general architecture for “loose coupling” DL systems with databases; in the context of this architecture, we have built a system called qindJ that can generate, from a specification, a translator from a descrip tion logic to a databaee query language. QINDL was used to generate translators from CLASSIC, a typical DL, to 3 different database query languages. We also present one view of safety of CLASSIC when it is used to query databsses, and present a semantical basis for this view.
