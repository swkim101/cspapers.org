We demonstrate the benefits of DroidRA, a tool for taming reflection in Android apps. DroidRA first statically extracts reflection-related object values from a given Android app. Then, it leverages the extracted values to boost the app in a way that reflective calls are no longer a challenge for existing static analyzers. This is achieved through a bytecode instrumentation approach, where reflective calls are supplemented with explicit traditional Java method calls which can be followed by state-of-the-art analyzers which do not handle reflection. Instrumented apps can thus be completely analyzed by existing static analyzers, which are no longer required to be modified to support reflection-aware analysis.
