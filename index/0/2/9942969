It contradicts the human's expectations when humanoid robots move awkwardly during manipulation tasks. The unnatural motion may be caused by awkward start or goal configurations or by probabilistic path planning processes that are often used. This paper shows that the choice of an arm's target configuration strongly effects planning time and how human-like a planned path appears. Human-like goal configurations are found using a criterion from ergonomics research. The knowledge which pose of the Tool Center Point (TCP) can be reached in a natural manner is encapsulated in a restricted reachability map for the robot arm.
