We develop a statistical model of saccadic eye movements during reading of isolated sentences. The model is focused on representing individual differences between readers and supports the inference of the most likely reader for a novel set of eye movement patterns. We empirically study the model for biometric reader identification using eye-tracking data collected from 20 individuals and observe that the model distinguishes between 20 readers with an accuracy of up to 98%.
