The College Board estimates that the new AP CS Principles (CSP) course will set a participation record for new course launches. With a large number of students across the USA enrolling in CSP at the high school level, CS departments at colleges and universities will need to begin considering their position for awarding AP credit. One possibility is the introduction of a new college-focused CSP course for non-majors that can serve as a mapping for AP credit. This paper summarizes the experiences of two faculty at different universities who were official CSP College Board Pilots for several years. An overview of each university's experience is provided in terms of student demographics, common evaluation measures, and individual course nuances, followed by a series of recommendations to faculty who are considering the creation of a CSP course within the curriculum of their own department.
