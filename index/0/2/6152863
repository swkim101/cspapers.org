In this paper, we study the expressive power of first-order disjunctive logic programming (DLP) and normal logic programming (NLP) under the stable model semantics. We show that, unlike the propositional case, first-order DLP is strictly more expressive than NLP. This result still holds even if auxiliary predicates are allowed, assuming NP â‰  coNP. On the other side, we propose a partial translation from first-order DLP to NLP via unfolding and shifting, which suggests a sound yet incomplete approach to implement DLP via NLP solvers. We also identify some NLP definable subclasses, and conjecture to exactly capture NLP definability by unfolding and shifting.
