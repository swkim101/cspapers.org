Open-ended activities such as CAD/CAM, VLSI layout and software development require consistent concurrent access and fault tolerance associated with database transactions, but their uncertain duration, uncertain developments during execution and long interactions with other concurrent activities break traditional transaction atomicity boundaries. We propose splittransaction as a new database operation that solves the above problems by permitting transactions to commit data that will not change. Thus an open-ended activity can release the committed data and serialize interactions with other concurrent activities through the committed data.
