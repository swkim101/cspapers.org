We propose a discrete variant of the Bak-Sneppen model for self-organized criticality. In this process, a configuration is an n-bit word, and at each step one chooses a random bit of minimum value (usually a zero) and replaces it and its two neighbors by independent Bernoulli variables with parameter p. We prove bounds on the average number of ones in the stationary distribution and present experimental results.
