cently been developed for computing approximate inverse preconditioners, but most results show them to be less effective, in terms of iterations required for convergence, than are serial preconditioners based on incomplete factorizations (ILU) of A .H owever, while ILU preconditioners are popular, effective, and robust, they are, according to the conventional wisdom, primarily serial in nature. We have developed and implemented course-grained algorithms that perform well for 2D and 3D problems. High performance is achieved through use of local and global orderings of partitioned matrices, coupled with the constraint that subdomain graphs, which capture communication patterns, be identical for A and the LU factors. Our algorithmic framework supports threshold-based (ILUT) and level based (ILU(k)) factorization methods, with optional partial pivoting (ILUTP, ILUP(K)). ILU preconditioning is based on the computation of triangular factors L and U , where LU ≈ A. Preconditioner application reduces to the solution of two triangular systems, Ly = b and Ux = y, during each iteration. The factors are commonly grouped together as F = L + U − I. Several algorithms for computing the triangular factors, L and U , are known and widely used in serial contexts. ILUT algorithms perform row-by-row, upward-looking factorizations, discarding elements that are smaller than a given value. Perhaps the most popular formulation is ILUT(τ, p) [14], which employs a dual-dropping strategy. The first parameter τ is the dropping threshold, while the second parameter, p, limits the amount of fill in any row of the matrix. If a row in the original matrix A has r nonzero entries, then a maximum of r + p entries are permitted in the corresponding row of F . The limit p is sometimes applied separately to upper and lower triangular portions of the row. As with other ILU algorithms, both symmetric and non-symmetric variants exist.
