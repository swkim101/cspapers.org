In this paper, the area coverage problem of non-convex environments by a group of mobile robots is addressed. Each robot is equipped with a sensing device modeled through a range-limited visibility field. The network is assumed to be homogeneous in terms of nodes' sensing capabilities and general characteristics. A gradient-ascent control law is proposed, based on visibility-based Voronoi diagrams, leading the network to the optimal final state in terms of total area coverage. The provided simulation studies illustrate the results derived by the application of the proposed control scheme and validate its effectiveness.
