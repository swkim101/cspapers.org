Emotions involve complex processes produced by interactions between motives/ beliefs/ percepts, etc. E.g. real or imagined fulfilment or violation of a motive/ or triggering of a 'motive-generator'/ can disturb processes produced by other motives. To understand emotions/ therefore/ we need to understand motives and the types of processes they can produce. This leads to a study of the global architecture of a mind. Some constraints on the evolution of minds are disussed. Types of motives and the processes they generate are sketched.
