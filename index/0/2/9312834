Advances in graphics and the reduced cost of computing and storage have made many engineering and scientific graphics-oriented applications practical that are now beginning to accumulate large volumes of data. Further, new technologies such as satellite images and speech processing are also creating large volumes of data. Typically, these new data elements are distinctly different from the traditional character data associated with current data bases; especially, in the structure, usage patterns and size of the records themselves.
