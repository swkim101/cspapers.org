We propose an alternative to the common approaches to the topological segmentation in structured or unstructured environments, Contour-Based Segmentation. It is faster and equally accurate, without the need of fine tuning parameters or heuristics. During robotic exploration, we propose an incremental version that reduces the processing time by reusing the previous segmentation. Tests demonstrate the velocity and quality in room segmentation in both batch and incremental mode. Tests also demonstrate the incremental version outperforms the state of the art in incremental topological segmentation.
