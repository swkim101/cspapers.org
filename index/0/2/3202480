In this paper we search for and analyze the atomic components of general governance systems and discuss whether or not they can be informated, i.e. tangibly represented within the digital realm of information systems. We draw a framework based on the theories of Downs, Jellinek, and Hohfeld and find that the therein identified atomic components cannot be informated directly, but only indirectly, due to the inherent complexity of governance. We outline pending research questions to be addressed in the future.
