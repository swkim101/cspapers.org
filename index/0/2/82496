A hands-on embedded computing project is introduced into an undergraduate social sciences course. In the pilot module, nine student teams created working prototypes, using the technology to address social, ecological and ethical issues. The teams included freshman to senior level computer science majors, other technical majors, and non-technical students. Most students became highly engaged in the activity, developed exciting ideas, and reported improved learning in the social sciences.
