This paper shows how a newtwork view of probabilistic information indexing and retrieval with components may implement query expansion and modification (based on user relevance feedback) by growing new edges and adapting weights between queries and terms of relevant documents. Experimental results with two collections and partial feedback confirm that the process can lead to much improved performance. Learning from irrelvant documents however was not effective.
