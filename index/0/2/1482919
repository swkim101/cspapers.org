We develop an automated technique for detecting damped Lyman-Î± absorbers (DLAs) along spectroscopic sightlines to quasi-stellar objects (QSOs or quasars). The detection of DLAs in large-scale spectroscopic surveys such as SDSS-III is critical to address outstanding cosmological questions, such as the nature of galaxy formation. We use nearly 50 000 QSO spectra to learn a tailored Gaussian process model for quasar emission spectra, which we apply to the DLA detection problem via Bayesian model selection. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness with a large-scale validation experiment on over 100 000 spectra, with excellent performance.
