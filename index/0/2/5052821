Deductive conceptual models (DCMs) aim at providing a complete specification of information systems, expressing only its logic component. It has been shown that DCMs have some advantages with respect to traditional, operational conceptual models, but they are more difficult to implement. We present a new approach to the design and implementation from a DCM. It consists in deriving from the DCM a new model, which we call the internal events model. This model describes the actions the information system must perform in terms of the inputs. The use of this model for data base and transactions design is discussed.
