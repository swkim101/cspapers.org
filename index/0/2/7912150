Both the quality and quantity of training data have significant impact on the performance of ranking functions in the context of learning to rank for web search. Due to resource constraints, training data for smaller search engine markets are scarce and we need to leverage existing training data from large markets to enhance the learning of ranking function for smaller markets. In this paper, we present a boosting framework for learning to rank in the multi-task learning context for this purpose. In particular, we propose to learn non-parametric common structures adaptively from multiple tasks in a stage-wise way. An algorithm is developed to iteratively discover super-features that are effective for all the tasks. The estimation of the functions for each task is then learned as a linear combination of those super-features. We evaluate the performance of this multi-task learning method for web search ranking using data from a search engine. Our results demonstrate that multi-task learning methods bring significant relevance improvements over existing baseline methods.
