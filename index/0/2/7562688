In view that some international bodies in the field of Telecontrol systems propose reliability requirements for line protocols which are not fulfilled by standard HDLC,here a detailed analysis of the reliability of HDLC is given and the statistical properties of sequences using the Bit Insertion Mechanism are analyzed. The final result is a proposal of a method,the Four Redundancy Bit Sequence method: (FRBS),which seems able to be added without much trouble before and after the HDLC layer to yield a protocol with the desired characteristics.
