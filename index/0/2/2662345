We present a system that supports review of a knowledge work lifelog as an activity history. Since knowledge workers often review their own activity histories, gathering each user's activities on his/her terminal as a lifelog is a promising approach. However, readability of the stored lifelog is a large problem of lifelog-based application. We propose a term extraction method to add annotation labels to the stored lifelog for supporting knowledge workers, exploiting text data acquired from desktop activities. Our prototype system monitors a user's desktop activities after combining raw events, and then extracts possible annotation labels with LDA and C-value techniques from documents and text data in sensor events. In this paper, we introduce a lifelogging module and a lifelog annotation method based on term extraction techniques. According to an empirical evaluation for three weeks, we found that the current method is useful for one-week review.
