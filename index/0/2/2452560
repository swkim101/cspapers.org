A series of field performance aids have been developed to assist IBM Systems Engineers evaluate the performance of System/3, System/34, and System/38 configurations. Use of those aids is appropriate at proposal time, for preinstallation design, for tuning, and for upgrade studies. This paper overviews some of the key features of these aids as they pertain to the user interface, workload characterization, and performance models.
