Run-time communication management in a Network-on-Chip (NoC) is a challenging task. On one hand, the NoC needs to satisfy the communication requirements (e.g. throughput) of running applications competing for NoC resources. On the other hand, the NoC resources should be managed efficiently while keeping additional management functionalities minimal. This paper details a NoC communication management scheme based on a centralized, end-to-end flow control mechanism deployed in a best-effort NoC. This scheme comes at a very low resource (i.e. limited hardware and run-time overhead) cost. We show that by using a flow control mechanism it is possible, even in a best-effort NoC, to provide sufficient communication guarantees with respect to the application requirements. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our approach for real-life multimedia applications.
