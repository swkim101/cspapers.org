We propose a host architecture for secure IP multicast. We identify the basic components of the architecture, describe their functionalities and how they interact with one another. The fundamental design tenets of the proposed architecture are simplicity, modularity, and compatibility with existing protocols and systems. More specifically, we try to re-use existing IPSec mechanisms as far as possible, and extend them when necessary. We also discuss our experiences with implementing the proposed architecture on Linux.
