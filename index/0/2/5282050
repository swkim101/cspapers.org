We have proposed smart sensor networks (S-Nets) as an architecture and set of distributed algorithms to extract, interpret and exploit networked sensor devices. Heretofore, the development of this approach has been done in simulation. In this paper, we describe two complementary implementations of S-Nets: (1) on a set of Berkeley motes comprised of low-power 8-bit, 128 Kb memory processors, communication devices and sensors, and (2) on a set of JStamps having 32-bit controllers, 2 Mb of memory and native execution Java hardware.
