Improvements in semiconductor technology have made it possible to include multiple processor cores on a single die. Chip multiprocessors (CMP) are an attractive choice for future billion transistor architectures due to their low design complexity, high clock frequency, and high throughput. In a typical CMP architecture, the L2 cache is shared by multiple cores and data coherence is maintained among private L1s. Coherence operations entail frequent communication over global on-chip wires. In future technologies, communication between different L1s will have a significant impact on overall processor performance and power consumption. On-chip wires can be designed to have different latency, bandwidth, and energy properties. Likewise, coherence protocol messages have different latency and bandwidth needs. We propose an interconnect composed of wires with varying latency, bandwidth, and energy characteristics, and advocate intelligently mapping coherence operations to the appropriate wires. In this paper, we present a comprehensive list of techniques that allow coherence protocols to exploit a heterogeneous interconnect and evaluate a subset of these techniques to show their performance and power-efficiency potential. Most of the proposed techniques can be implemented with a minimum complexity overhead
