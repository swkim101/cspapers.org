Increasing size and geographical separation of design data and teams has created a need for a network-based electronic design environment that is scaleable, adaptable, secure, highly available, and cost effective. In the WELD project we are evaluating aspects of the network integration and communication infrastructure needed to enable such a distributed design environment. The architecture of WELD and the components developed to implement the system, together with performance results, are described and evaluated.
