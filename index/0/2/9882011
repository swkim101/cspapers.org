Extracting tree transducer rules for syntactic MT systems can be hindered by word alignment errors that violate syntactic correspondences. We propose a novel model for unsupervised word alignment which explicitly takes into account target language constituent structure, while retaining the robustness and efficiency of the HMM alignment model. Our modelâ€™s predictions improve the yield of a tree transducer extraction system, without sacrificing alignment quality. We also discuss the impact of various posteriorbased methods of reconciling bidirectional alignments.
