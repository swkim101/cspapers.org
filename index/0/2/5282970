We propose a simple contact model of a soft fingertip based on geometrical analysis and statics of the fingertip. First, we introduce a virtual spring system to the soft fingertip corresponding to one and two-dimensional contact between a planar object and a soft fingertip. Second, we describe pressure distribution, and estimate that equation by simulating and measuring total force and pressure center using tactile sensors. Finally, we describe how to obtain the orientation of an grasped object and the maximum displacement of a soft fingertip from the tactile sensor measurement.
