A method for transferring external touch input is proposed by partially attaching a sticker to a touch-panel display. The touch input area can be extended by printing striped patterns using a conductive ink and attaching them to overlap with a portion of a touch-panel display. Even if the user does not touch the touch panel directly, a touch event can be generated by touching the stripes at an arbitrary point corresponding to the touched area. Thus, continuous touch input can be generated, such as a scrolling operation without interruption. This method can be applied to a variety of devices including PCs, smartphones, and wearable devices. In this paper, we present several different examples of applications, including a method for extending control areas outside of the touch panel, such as the side or back of a smartphone.
