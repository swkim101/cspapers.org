Generating expository dialogue from monologue is a task that poses an interesting and rewarding challenge for Natural Language Processing. This short paper has three aims: firstly, to motivate the importance of this task, both in terms of the benefits of expository dialogue as a way to present information and in terms of potential applications; secondly, to introduce a parallel corpus of monologues and dialogues which enables a data-driven approach to this challenge; and, finally, to describe work-in-progress on semi-automatic construction of Monologue-to-Dialogue (M2D) generation rules.
