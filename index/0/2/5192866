This paper discusses a formation control of a multiple mobile robot system (MMRS) called super mechano-colony (SMC). First, we describe the SMC system composed of a mother ship and many agents as a prototype of MMRS. Second, we propose a cooperative transportation method of the mother ship with multiple agents, and the properties of the proposed method are analyzed using an experimental system.
