To improve the interaction between students and an intelligent tutoring system, we developed two Natural Language generators, that we systematically evaluated in a three way comparison that included the original system as well. We found that the generator which intuitively produces the best language does engender the most learning. Specifically, it appears that functional aggregation is responsible for the improvement.
