We model hippocampal place cells and head-direction cells by combining allothetic (visual) and idiothetic (proprioceptive) stimuli. Visual input, provided by a video camera on a miniature robot, is preprocessed by a set of Gabor filters on 31 nodes of a log-polar retinotopic graph. Unsupervised Hebbian learning is employed to incrementally build a population of localized overlapping place fields. Place cells serve as basis functions for reinforcement learning. Experimental results for goal-oriented navigation of a mobile robot are presented.
