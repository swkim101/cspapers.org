It is a profound dislocation to have reality replaced by models - that revolution is won, that blood spilt. The first radical changes in global companies that I have witnessed, attributable to the systems engineering and architecture Virtual System Prototype inflection point, occurred in 2004. In these instances, the whole assumed order of architecture in the engineering process was tipped upside-down by a single set of quantitatively derived results that are turning out to be critical to each company's ability to compete and win in its fiercely competitive market. These changes have accelerated in 2005. It is the most exciting time for us all to be part of the wholesale transformation of one of the fundamental engines of the last 50 years of economic growth - Embedded Software-Electronics Control Systems (Embedded SECS) design. The transformation is driven by necessity; the by-products are competitive advantage, speed of execution, quality, productivity, and ability to rapidly adapt to market and business conditions. There is no company, leader or laggard, who can afford to ignore this evidence and hope to survive. This paper addresses the quantitative development of embedded systems architectures - software, hardware, mechanical.
