Current recommendation methods are mainly classified into content-based, collaborative filtering and hybrid methods. These methods are based on similarity measurements among items or users. In this paper, we investigate recommendation systems from a new perspective based on object typicality and propose a novel typicality-based recommendation approach. Experiments show that our method outperforms compared methods on recommendation quality.
