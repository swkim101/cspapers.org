Covertly tracking mobile targets, either animal or human, in previously unmapped outdoor natural environments using off-road robotic platforms requires both visual and acoustic stealth. Whilst the use of robots for stealthy surveillance is not new, the majority only consider navigation for visual covertness. However, most fielded robotic systems have a non-negligible acoustic footprint arising from the onboard sensors, motors, computers and cooling systems, and also from the wheels interacting with the terrain during motion. This time-varying acoustic signature can jeopardise any visual covertness and needs to be addressed in any stealthy navigation strategy. In previous work, we addressed the initial concepts for acoustically masking a tracking robotâ€™s movements as it travels between observation locations selected to minimise its detectability by a dynamic natural target and ensuring con- tinuous visual tracking of the target. This work extends the overall concept by examining the utility of real-time acoustic signature self-assessment and exploiting shadows as hiding locations for use in a combined visual and acoustic stealth framework.
