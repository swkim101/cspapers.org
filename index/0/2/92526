Analog electronic cochlear models need exponentially scaled filters. CMOS Compatible Lateral Bipolar Transistors (CLBTs) can create exponentially scaled currents when biased using a resistive line with a voltage difference between both ends of the line. Since these CLBTs are independent of the CMOS threshold voltage, current sources implemented with CLBTs are much better matched than current sources created with MOS transistors operated in weak inversion. Measurements from integrated test chips are shown to verify the improved matching.
