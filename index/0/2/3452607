Much of modern biology requires quantitative and computational skills for the proper analysis of large-scale datasets, and there is a recognized need for computational training in undergraduate biology programs. This experience report describes a four-week unit designed to introduce fundamental computer science concepts and molecular biology concepts in an integrated fashion. The unit serves as the first four weeks of an introductory course taught within the Biology Department at an undergraduate institution, and is designed to introduce computational thinking to non-computational science majors. Survey results reveal that the course has attracted students from all years (first years through seniors), the majority of students have been women, and students have large self-perceived learning gains in computer science concepts. The unit shows promise for engaging non-computational students through applications in introductory molecular biology.
