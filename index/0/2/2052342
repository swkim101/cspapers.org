A theorem prover for part of arithmetic in described which proves theorems by representing them in the form of a diagram or network. The nodes of this network represent 'ideal integers', i.e. objects which have all the properties of integers, without being any particular intoger. The links in the network represent relationships between 'ideal integers'. The procedures which draw these diagrams make elementary deductions based on their built-in knowledge of the functions and predicates of arithmetic. This theorem prover is intended as a model of some kinds of human problem-solving behaviour.
