Reasoning about motion is an important part of common sense knowledge. The spatial and qualitative aspects of reasoning about motion through free space are studied through the construction of a program to perform such reasoning. An analog geometry representation serves as a diagram, and descriptions of both the actual motion of a ball and envisioning are used in answering simple questions.
