The extraction of multiple coherent structures from point clouds is crucial to the problem of scene modeling. While many statistical methods exist for robust estimation from noisy data, they are inadequate for addressing issues of scale, semi-structured clutter, and large point density variation together with the computational restriction of autonomous navigation. This paper extends an approach of nonparametric projection-pursuit based regression to compensate for the non-uniform and directional nature of data sampled in outdoor environments. The proposed algorithm is employed for extraction of planar structures and clutter grouping. Results are shown for scene abstraction of 3D range data in large urban scenes.
