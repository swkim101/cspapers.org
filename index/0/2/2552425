Although graphical user interfaces started as imitations of the physical world, many interaction techniques have since been invented that are not available in the real world. This paper focuses on one of these "previewing", and how a sensory enhanced input device called "PreSense Keypad" can provide a preview for users before they actually execute the commands. Preview important in the real world because it is often not possible to undo an action. This previewable feature helps users to see what will occur next. It is also helpful when the command assignment of the keypad dynamically changes, such as for universal commanders. We present several interaction techniques based on this input device, including menu and map browsing systems and a text input system. We also discuss finger gesture recognition for the PreSense Keypad.
