In this paper we generalize the framework of linear loop transformations: we consider loop alignment as a new component in the transformation process. The aim is to exploit the additional inherent statement-level parallelism and reduce the amount of interprocessor synchronization and communication when a coarse-grain MIMD execution model is considered. The transformation process is modelled with non-singular matrices and we use the ideas recently proposed in this field to generate an efficient transformed code. However, additional aspects have to be studied when statements are considered in the process. We try to reduce the overhead due to conditionals that appear in the loop body of the transformed loops.
