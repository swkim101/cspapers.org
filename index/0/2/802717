Due to the nature of chip design, the Very Large-Scale Integrated (VLSI) design data base is constantly changing. The changes may be caused by logical or physical design activities. In either case, there is a need to make sure that no matter what happens, the data base remains valid. This paper discusses a system which uses an AUtomated Data Integrity Technique (AUDIT) to eliminate errors prior to hardware build.
