We consider the problem of selecting a pool of individuals from several populations with incom-parable skills (e.g. soccer players, mathematicians, and singers) in a fair manner. The quality of an individual is deﬁned to be their relative rank (by cumulative distribution value) within their own population, which permits cross-population comparisons. We study algorithms which attempt to select the highest quality subset despite the fact that true CDF values are not known, and can only be estimated from the ﬁnite pool of candidates. Speciﬁcally, we quantify the regret in quality imposed by “meritocratic” notions of fairness, which require that individuals are selected with probability that is monotonically increasing in their true quality. We give algorithms with provable fairness and regret guarantees, as well as lower bounds, and provide empirical re-sults which suggest that our algorithms perform better than the theory suggests.
