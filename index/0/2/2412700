This paper describes a laboratory used to support a junior level course in real-time embedded software development. Thirteen years of data comparing programming languages for a real-time systems course are presented. Funding provided by the Maytag Corporation and Rockwell-Collins makes it possible to provide other schools with low cost electronics necessary to duplicate this laboratory with a minimum of effort.
