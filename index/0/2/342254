In this paper we describe the current state of a new Japanese lexical resource: the Hinoki treebank. The treebank is built from dictionary definition sentences, and uses an HPSG based Japanese grammar to encode both syntactic and semantic information. It is combined with an ontology based on the definition sentences to give a detailed sense level description of the most familiar 28,000 words of Japanese.
