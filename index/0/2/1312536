In this research, a Framework for Synthesizing Parallel Applications (FraSPA) in a user-guided manner is being developed. The FraSPA would facilitate the synthesis of parallel applications from existing sequential applications and middleware components for multiple-platforms and diverse domains. The framework design is based upon design patterns and generative programming techniques. The main goal of this research is to raise the level of abstraction of the widely used low-level parallel programming approaches. A technique to separate parallel and sequential concerns will be demonstrated through this work. Other contributions will be in the area of design patterns and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for parallel computing. The design patterns, along with the DSLs, will promote code reuse and code correctness. There would be a reduction in code complexity and code maintenance would become easy. The productivity of the end-users will increase. This research can be broadly classified as “Software Engineering for High Performance Computing”.
