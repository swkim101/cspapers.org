Mining numerical data is a relatively difficult problem in data mining. Clustering is one of the techniques. We consider a database with numerical attributes, in which each transaction is viewed as a multi-dimensional vector. By studying the clusters formed by these vectors, we can discover certain behaviors hidden in the data. Traditional clustering algorithms find clusters in the full space of the data sets. This results in high dimensional clusters, which are poorly comprehensible to human. One important task in this setting is the ability to discover clusters embedded in the subspaces of a high-dimensional data set. This problem is known as subspace clustering. We follow the basic assumptions of previous work CLIQUE. It is found that the number of subspaces with clustering is very large, and a criterion called the coverage is proposed in CLIQUE for the pruning. In addition to coverage, we identify new useful criteria for this problem and propose an entropybased algorithm called ENCLUS to handle the criteria. Our major contributions are: (1) identify new meaningful criteria of high density and correlation of dimensions for goodness of clustering in subspaces, (2) introduce the use of entropy and provide evidence to support its use, (3) make use of two closure properties based on entropy to prune away uninteresting subspaces efficiently, (4) propose a mechanism to mine non-minimally correlated subspaces which are of interest because of strong clustering, (5) experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
