We consider the practical implementation of Krylov subspace methods (conjugate gradients, GMRES, etc.) for parallel computers in the case where the preconditioning matrix is a multisplitting. The algorithm can be efficiently implemented by dividing the work into tasks that generate search directions and a single task that minimizes over the resulting subspace. Each task is assigned to a subset of processors. It is not necessary for the minimization task to send information to the direction generating tasks, and this leads to high utilization with a minimum of synchronization. We study the convergence properties of various forms of the algorithm.
