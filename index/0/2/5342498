This paper presents a distributed control strategy for deploying hovering robots with multiple downward facing cameras to collectively monitor an environment. Information per pixel is proposed as an optimization criterion for multi-camera placement problems. This metric is used to derive a specific cost function for multiple downward facing cameras mounted on hovering robot platforms. The cost function leads to a gradient-based distributed controller for positioning the robots. A convergence proof using LaSalle's invariance principle is given to show that the robots converge to locally optimal positions. The controller is demonstrated in experiments with three flying quad-rotor robots.
