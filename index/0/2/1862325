This paper describes design and application of a novel counter-balancing stackable parallel mechanism. The stackable mechanism is designed by combining a five-bar and a couple of parallelograms. This design allows a compact design and wide workspace as compared to prior parallel type counter-balancing mechanisms. A linear geometry of this mechanism guarantees static balancing in the whole workspace. This mechanism was successfully applied to otologic.
