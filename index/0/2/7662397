Many automatic optical design computer programs have been in operation for some time. Little in the way of complex optical system design is done without the aid of one of these programs. ACCOS V is a program used extensively at Martin Marietta for this purpose. It is a real-time program using interactive graphics terminals operating in a time-sharing system. With it a designer is able to characterize optical elements, array them, examine the results on a CRT screen, and modify the system interactively. This paper describes how the system is used, its virtues, limitations, and possible future growth potential from a user's point of view.
