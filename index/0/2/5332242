Previously presented methods for online collision avoidance for robots in a two-dimensional space are extended to the third dimension. Even if global planning and programming are done in multi-robot workcells, in real-world applications it is important to supervise the actual movements and to influence them if necessary, due to sensor-driven changes of the trajectories, incomplete information on the environment, and possible failures in mechanical or electrical devices. Therefore, precautions have to be taken for online collision detection and avoidance. Besides the considerations of dynamics for online collision avoidance in 3-D space, attention is given to the online computing of the algorithms and their execution on parallel hardware.
