In recent years the use of instruction mixes to define measures of relative computational power has diminished. This paper will describe how a systemic functional mix of much greater power and complexity than the traditional Gibson Mix was derived, then employed effectively in solving problems which arise in central processor definition and design. Some extensions of the basic technique are also covered, which include decomposition into fractional mixes as well as the study of instruction doublets and triplets.
