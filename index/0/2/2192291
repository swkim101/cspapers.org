We explore the use of the non-dominant hand to control a virtualcamera while the dominant hand performs other tasks in a virtual 3Dscene. Two experiments and an informal study are presented whichevaluate this interaction style by comparing it to the status-quounimanual interaction. In the first experiment, we find that for atarget selection task, performance using the bimanual technique was20% faster. Experiment 2 compared performance in a more complicatedobject docking task. Performance advantages are shown, however,only after practice. Free-form 3D painting was explored in the userstudy. In both experiments and in the user study participantsstrongly preferred the bimanual technique. The results alsoindicate that user preferences concerning bimanual interaction maybe driven by factors other than simple time-motion performanceadvantages.
