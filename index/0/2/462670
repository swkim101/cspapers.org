This article describes advances in regulation, standardization and research for Licensed Shared Access (LSA) in Europe and in USA. Different approaches for defining the spectrum sharing access system are taken by the European Standardization Institute (ETSI) focusing on a 2 tier access hierarchy and by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authority in USA focusing on a 3 tier access hierarchy. As shown in regard to the architecture design, LSA identifies a viable candidate for both approaches in that it supports different spectrum sharing modes such as static, semi-static and dynamic sharing.
