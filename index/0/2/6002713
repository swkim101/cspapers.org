Green is a live round tripping UML class diagram editor plug-in for Eclipse, originally designed with the intention of focusing CS1/CS2 students on modeling and design. Green's ease of use and flexible features has allowed it to grow into a robust tool providing end users with an easy to use application satisfying their individual class diagramming needs. Green's live round-tripping capability allows users to generate (Java) code from UML class diagrams and generate diagrams from (Java) code and have them both update each other as any changes are made.
 This demo will demonstrate the main features of Green, including forward and reverse engineering, live round-tripping, incremental exploration, and the various aspects of relationship semantics. Since Green is an ongoing project, demonstrations of additional features not in this list may also be included.
