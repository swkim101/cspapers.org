Human Desoxyribo-Nucleic Acid (DNA) sequences offer a wealth of information that reveal, among others, predisposition to various diseases and paternity relations. The breadth and personalized nature of this information highlights the need for privacy-preserving protocols. In this paper, we present a new error-resilient privacy-preserving string searching protocol that is suitable for running private DNA queries. This protocol checks if a short template (e.g., a string that describes a mutation leading to a disease), known to one party, is present inside a DNA sequence owned by another party, accounting for possible errors and without disclosing to each party the other party's input. Each query is formulated as a regular expression over a finite alphabet and implemented as an automaton. As the main technical contribution, we provide a protocol that allows to execute any finite state machine in an oblivious manner, requiring a communication complexity which is linear both in the number of states and the length of the input string.
