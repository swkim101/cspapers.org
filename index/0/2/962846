An approach for bringing semantic, as well as syntactic, information to bear on the problem of theorem-proving search for Question-Answering <QA) Sys­ tems is descrilsed. The approach is embodied in a search algorithm, the 0* search algorithm, developed to control deductive searches in an experimental system. The Q* algorithm is part of a system, termed the Mary­ land Refutation Proof Procedure System (MRPPS), which incorporates both the Q* algorithm, which performs the search required to answer a ouery, and an inferential component, which performs the logical manipulations necessary to deduce a clause from one or two other clauses. The inferential component includes many r e­ finements of resolution. The Q* algorithm generates nodes in the search space, applying semantic and syntactic information to direct the search. The use of semantics permits paths to be terminated and f r u i t f ul paths to be explored. The paper is restricted to a description of the use of syntactic and semantic information in the Q* algorithm.
