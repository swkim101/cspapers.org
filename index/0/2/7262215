It is important to understand the mechanism of human standing-up motion to improve the declined physical ability of the elderly people. This study employs the concept of muscle synergies (modular structure of coordinative muscle activation) to understand how humans coordinate their muscles to achieve the standing-up motion. Neuro-musculoskeletal model was developed to represent human body to generate standing-up motion. Using the developed model, forward dynamic simulation was used to analyze how humans utilized the muscle synergies to realize the motion. Results showed that the developed model could generate the standing-up motion with four muscle synergies rather than controlling individual muscles. Moreover, further analysis showed that three different strategies of the standing-up motion could be generated only by changing the start time of the particular muscle synergy.
