Since projections/extensions modify the cost functions, an important issue is tractable projection-safety, concerning whether minimum cost computation remains tractable after projections/extensions. In this paper, we prove that tractable projection-safety is always possible for projections/extensions to/from the nullary cost function (W0), and always impossible for projections/extensions to/from n-ary cost functions for n > = 2.  When n = 1, the answer is indefinite.  We give a simple negative example, while Lee and Leung's flow-based projection-safe cost functions are also tractable projection-safe. We propose polynomially decomposable cost functions, which are amenable to tractable minimum computation.  We further prove that the polynomial decomposability property is unaffected by projections/extensionsto/from unary cost functions.  Thus, polynomially decomposable cost functions are tractable projection-safe.  We show that the SOFT_AMONG, SOFT_REGULAR, SOFT_GRAMMAR and MAX_WEIGHT/MIN_WEIGHT are polynomially decomposable.  They are embedded in a WCSP solver for extensive experiments to confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our proposal.
