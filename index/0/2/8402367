Ontologies have been established for knowledge sharing and are widely used as a means for conceptually structuring domains of interest. With the growing usage of ontologies, the problem of overlapping knowledge in a common domain becomes critical. We propose the new method FCA-MERGE for merging ontologies following a bottom-up approach which offers a structural description of the merging process. The method is guided by application-specific instances of the given source ontologies, that are to be merged. We apply techniques from natural language processing and formal concept analysis to derive a lattice of concepts as a structural result of FCA-MERGE. The generated result is then explored and transformed into the merged ontology with human interaction.
