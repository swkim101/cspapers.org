In this paper we will treat input selection for a radial basis function (RBF) like classifier within a Bayesian framework. We approximate the a-posteriori distribution over both model coefficients and input subsets by samples drawn with Gibbs updates and reversible jump moves. Using some public datasets, we compare the classification accuracy of the method with a conventional ARD scheme. These datasets are also used to infer the a-posteriori probabilities of different input subsets.
