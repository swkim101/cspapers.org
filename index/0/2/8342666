The restricted chase is a sound and complete algorithm for conjunctive query answering over ontologies of disjunctive existential rules. We develop acyclicity conditions to ensure its termination. Our criteria cannot always detect termination (the problem is undecidable), and we develop the first cyclicity criteria to show non-termination of the restricted chase. Experiments on real-world ontologies show that our acyclicity notions improve significantly over known criteria.
