We describe a technique to build an affordance map interactively for robotic tasks. Affordances are predicted by a trained classifier using geometric features extracted from objects. Based on 2D occupancy grid, a Markov Random Field (MRF) model builds an affordance map with relational affordance with neighboring cells. The quality of the affordance map is refined by sequences of interactive manipulations selected from the model to yield the highest reduction in uncertainty.
