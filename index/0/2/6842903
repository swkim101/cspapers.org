While prior depth from focus and defocus techniques operated on laboratory scenes, we introduce the first depth from focus (DfF) method capable of handling images from mobile phones and other hand-held cameras. Achieving this goal requires solving a novel uncalibrated DfF problem and aligning the frames to account for scene parallax. Our approach is demonstrated on a range of challenging cases and produces high quality results.
