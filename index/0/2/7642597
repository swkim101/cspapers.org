After decades of work towards creating artificial intelligence, some researchers are now attempting to create machines that are emotionally intelligent. The standard definition of artificial intelligence is the ability for a machine to “think or act humanly or rationally” (Russell, 1995). The push towards emotionally intelligent machines is an exciting addition to this field, in the direction of machines that truly “act humanly.” In this article, I will provide a survey of topics and resources for teaching emotional computation in artificial intelligence courses. I will show that this topic area serves as an excellent application of modern artificial intelligence techniques, and is an important aspect of modern research in AI. The interdisciplinary nature of work in this space is not only compelling in the classroom, it may also lead to wider interest in the field of Computer Science.
