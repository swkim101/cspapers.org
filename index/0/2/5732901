In most streaming applications, the data streams need to be analyzed continuously to make instant decisions exploiting latest information. Often data streams are multidimensional and are at the low-level of abstraction, whereas analysts are interested in multi-level interactive analysis of data streams across several dimensions. On-line analytical processing (OLAP) is a proven technique for such analysis of static data and has also been studied by some researchers for data streams. Traditionally this is achieved by coupling a stream processing engine with an OLAP engine. We believe that coupling multiple systems is not an efficient solutions as it results in lower performance (due to the transfer of data between multiple systems), resource wastage (due to replication of data for each coupled system) and increased complexity and maintenance cost. To this end, we present StreamingCube, a unified framework for data stream processing and its interactive OLAP analysis. The proposed framework possesses all the essential operators to process data streams and introduces a new operator, cubify, to maintain OLAP lattice nodes (materialized views) incrementally. The novelty of the introduced cubify operator lies in the incremental maintenance of the materialized views. To demonstrate StreamingCube, a web-based GUI has been developed which enables users to register continuous queries (CQs). Once a CQ has been registered, users can perform different OLAP operations through the GUI for the interactive analysis. The results of the OLAP queries/operations are displayed in the form of tables and graphs.
