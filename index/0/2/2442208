This paper summarizes our work on using tags to broaden the dialog between a recommender system and its users. We present two tagging applications that enrich this dialog: tagsplanations are tag-based explanations of recommendations provided by a system to its users, and Movie Tuner is a conversational recommender system that enables users to provide feedback on movie recommendations using tags. We discuss the design of both systems and the experimental methodology used to evaluate the design choices.
