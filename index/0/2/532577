A large percentage of queries issued to search engines are broad or ambiguous. Search result diversification aims to solve this problem, by returning diverse results that can fulfill as many different information needs as possible. Most existing intent-aware search result diversification algorithms formulate user intents for a query as a flat list of subtopics. In this paper, we introduce a new hierarchical structure to represent user intents and propose two general hierarchical diversification models to leverage hierarchical intents. Experimental results show that our hierarchical diversification models outperform state-of-the-art diversification methods that use traditional flat subtopics.
