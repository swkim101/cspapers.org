The XWeb project addresses the problem of interacting with services by means of a variety of interactive platforms. Interactive clients are provided on a variety of hardware/software platforms that can access and XWeb service. Creators of services need not be concerned with interactive techniques or devices. The cross platform problems of a network model of interaction, adaptation to screen size and supporting both speech and visual interfaces in the same model are addressed.
