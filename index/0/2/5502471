As we move to the 0.18μm node and beyond, the dominant trend in device and process technology is a simple continuation of several decades of scaling. However, some serious challenges to straightforward scaling are on the horizon. This paper will review the present status of process technology and examine the likely departures from scaling in the various areas. The 0.18μm node is seeing the first major new materials introduced into the Si process for many years in the interconnect, and major departures from the traditional process are being actively considered for the transistor. However, it is probable that continued scaling will continue to dominate advanced processes for several generations to come.
