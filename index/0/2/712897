The SIFT project is aimed at developing an advanced text retrieval system possessing the features of high modularity, high portability, possibilities for integration with word processing systems and a flexible user interface. Possible applications for such a system would be found wherever any sizable collection of information requires efficient retrieval. The SIFT system is mainly designed to solve the problems of searching in free, i.e. unstructured, text but extensive functions for dealing with structured information are also offered.The SIFT project is based on former experience in the use of other retrieval systems, particularly the Norwegian version of the British STATUS system, NOVA*STATUS, a system which has found application in various public agencies and at all Norwegian universities.The SIFT project was initiated on January 1, 1980, and a prototype version of the system will be implemented on a NORD computer towards the end of 1981. The final product will be made available free of charge.This presentation will treat the structure, characteristics and applications of the SIFT system.
