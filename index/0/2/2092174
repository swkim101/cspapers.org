The ParkourBot is an efficient and dynamic climbing robot. The robot comprises two springy legs connected to a body. Leg angle and spring tension are independently controlled. The robot climbs between two parallel walls by leaping from one wall to the other. During flight, the robot stores elastic energy in its springy legs and automatically releases the energy to “kick off” the wall during touch down. This paper elaborates on the mechanical design of the ParkourBot. We use a simple SLIP model to simulate the ParkourBot motion and stability. Finally, we detail experimental results, from open-loop climbing motions to closed-loop stabilization of climbing height in a planar, reduced gravity environment.
