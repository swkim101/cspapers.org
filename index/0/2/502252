Comparison of two supercomputer-based visualization systems developed over a half-year period show that the visualization/animation efficiency is largely dependent upon the efficiencies of individual computers, networking, and memory management.
Using a meteorological database, a case study is presented to illustrate a selection of parameters based on physical laws. Then, three-dimensional animations of selected parameters are made and used for investigating the evolutions of winter cyclone systems. The results indicate an animation with combined parameters that are physically related and reveal important cyclonic development mechanisms that could not have been seen by an animation with an individual parameter.
