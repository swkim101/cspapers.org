Named entity recognition systems sometimes have difficulty when applied to data from domains that do not closely match the training data. We first use a simple rule-based technique for domain adaptation. Data for robust validation of the technique is then generated, and we use crowdsourcing techniques to show that this strategy produces reliable results even on data not seen by the rule designers. We show that it is possible to extract large improvements on the target data rapidly at low cost using these techniques.
