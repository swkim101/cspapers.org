In this paper, we propose an effortless way for disaggregating the CPU-memory couple, two of the most important resources in cloud computing. Instead of redesigning each resource board, the disaggregation is done at the power supply domain level. In other words, CPU and memory still share the same board, but their power supply domains are separated. Besides this disaggregation, we make the two following contributions: (1) the prototyping of a new ACPI sleep state (called zombie and noted Sz) which allows to suspend a server (thus save energy) while making its memory remotely accessible; and (2) the prototyping of a rack-level system software which allows the transparent utilization of the entire rack resources (avoiding resource waste). We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of our solution and show that it can improve the energy efficiency of state-of-the-art consolidation techniques by up to 86%, with minimal additional complexity.
