Undergraduate research is a critical component of high-quality education in any discipline, including Computer Science (CS). Over the past few years, there has been a dramatic increase in CS undergraduate research activities at colleges and universities, and predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs) have an important role to play. Not every university has abundant resources to devote to research, and teaching-focused institutions may face the greatest challenges in this respect. Faculty at PUIs, for example, may face funding and infrastructure challenges and may find themselves stretched thin due to especially high teaching and service expectations. A frequently asked question by new faculty at these institutions is: Is it really possible to conduct meaningful research in such a fast-paced discipline as CS, while juggling a very high teaching and service load? Not only is the answer to this question "Yes!" but there are advantages to conducting research at a non-research institution. Faculty here has access to some of the brightest young minds who will potentially be future graduate students in research-intensive universities. They may have the freedom to do research that is too risky for graduate students. They can work on projects they are interested in, rather than those they know must work. With good time management techniques and careful selection of collaborators and student researchers, faculty here really can conduct important CS research. Thus, the focus of this BOF is to share methods that are helpful in conducting significant and meaningful CS research in a primarily undergraduate or teaching institution.
