This paper presents ExperTime, a web-based system for tracking expertise over time. We visualize a person's expertise profile on a timeline, where we detect and characterize changes in the focus or topics of expertise. It is possible to zoom in on a given time period in order to examine the underlying data that is used as supporting evidence. It is also possible to perform visual and quantitative comparison of two arbitrarily selected time periods in a highly interactive environment. We invite profile owners to evaluate and fine-tune their profiles, and to leave feedback.
