Defining concepts is a fundamental process of modelling a certain domain of knowledge. Current knowledge representation languages, even those said to support terminological adequency, still suffer from severe apisternological deficiences. Especially the procedures for defining subconcepts are shown to be inadequate. A basic analysis of primitive concept formation processes yields some general requirements for the definitional part of knowledge reconstruction device comprising the possibility to model system aggragation, role, collection, and membership abstractions.
