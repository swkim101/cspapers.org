This paper discusses the parameterization of speech by an analog cochlear model. The tradeoff between time and frequency resolution is viewed as the fundamental difference between conventional spectrographic analysis and cochlear signal processing for broadband, rapid-changing signals. The model's response exhibits a wavelet-like analysis in the scale domain that preserves good temporal resolution; the frequency of each spectral component in a broadband signal can be accurately determined from the interpeak intervals in the instantaneous firing rates of auditory fibers. Such properties of the cochlear model are demonstrated with natural speech and synthetic complex signals.
