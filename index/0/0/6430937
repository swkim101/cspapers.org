While current eye-based interfaces offer enormous potential forefficient human-computer interaction, they also manifest thedifficulty of inferring intent from user eye movements. This paperdescribes how fixation tracing facilitates the interpretation ofeye movements and improves the flexibility and usability ofeye-based interfaces. Fixation tracing uses hidden Markov models tomap user actions to the sequential predictions of a cognitiveprocess model. In a study of eye typing, results show that fixationtracing generates significantly more accurate interpretations thansimpler methods and allows for more flexibility in designing usableinterfaces. Implications for future research in eye-basedinterfaces and multimodal interfaces are discussed.
