A reliable and efficient data transfer protocol is proposed for multicast applications in broadband broadcast networks. The protocol is based on negative acknowledgements, with several enhancements so that it matches most of the functionality of a positive acknowledgement based protocol. The protocol makes the best use of resources in the broadband network environment by conserving processing and trading off transmission and storage resources. The performance of this protocol is compared with the positive acknowledgement based protocol on the basis of maximum throughput as a function of group size for lecture and conference applications.
