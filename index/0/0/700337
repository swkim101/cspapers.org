Object representation is one of the most challenging tasks in robotics because it must provide reliable information in real-time to enable the robot to physically interact with the objects in its environment. To ensure reliability, a global object descriptor must be computed based on a unique and repeatable object reference frame. Moreover, the descriptor should contain enough information enabling to recognize the same or similar objects seen from different perspectives. This paper presents a new object descriptor named Global Orthographic Object Descriptor (GOOD) designed to be robust, descriptive and efficient to compute and use. The performance of the proposed object descriptor is compared with the main state-of-the-art descriptors. Experimental results show that the overall classification performance obtained with GOOD is comparable to the best performances obtained with the state-of-the-art descriptors. Concerning memory and computation time, GOOD clearly outperforms the other descriptors. Therefore, GOOD is especially suited for real-time applications.
