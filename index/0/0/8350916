Cameras are a useful source of input for many interactive applications, but computer vision programming is difficult and requires specialized knowledge that is out of reach for many HCI practitioners. In an effort to learn what makes a useful computer vision design tool, we created Eyepatch, a tool for designing camera-based interactions, and evaluated the Eyepatch prototype through deployment to students in an HCI course. This paper describes the lessons we learned about making computer vision more accessible, while retaining enough power and flexibility to be useful in a wide variety of interaction scenarios.
