We describe a compound eye vision sensor for 3D ego motion computation. Inspired by eyes of insects, we show that the compound eye sampling geometry is optimal for 3D camera motion estimation. This optimality allows us to estimate the 3D camera motion in a scene-independent and robust manner by utilizing linear equations. The mathematical model of the new sensor can be implemented in analog networks resulting in a compact computational sensor for instantaneous 3D ego motion measurements in full six degrees of freedom.
