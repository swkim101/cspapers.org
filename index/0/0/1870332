This paper introduces primitive Optimality Theory (OTP), a linguistically motivated formalization of OT. OTP specifies the class of autosegmental representations, the universal generator Gen, and the two simple families of permissible constraints. In contrast to less restricted theories using Generalized Alignment, OTP's optimal surface forms can be generated with finite-state methods adapted from (Ellison, 1994). Unfortunately these methods take time exponential on the size of the grammar. Indeed the generation problem is shown NP-complete in this sense. However, techniques are discussed for making Ellison's approach fast in the typical case, including a simple trick that alone provides a 100-fold speedup on a grammar fragment of moderate size. One avenue for future improvements is a new finite-state notion, "factored automata," where regular languages are represented compactly via formal intersections âˆ©ki=1Ai of FSAs.
