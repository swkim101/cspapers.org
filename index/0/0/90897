In this paper we demonstrate a close relationship between circular-arc graphs and chordal bipartite graphs. We exploit this relationship to achieve an O(n2) time circular-arc graph recognition algorithm. The algorithm employs a new 0 (n2) time method for computing neighborhood containment relations in circular-am graphs and reductions to the recognition problem on circular-arc graphs whose vertices can be partitioned into two cliques. The recognition algorithm also yields an 0 (n2) time isomorphism test for circular-arc graphs.
