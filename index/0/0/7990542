In this paper, we discuss a technique for handling multi-class problems with binary classifiers. The idea—learning one classifier for each pair of classes—is known as pairwise classification but—to our knowledge—has not yet been thoroughly investigated in the context of inductive rule learning. We present an empirical evaluation of the method as a wrapper around the Ripper rule learning algorithm on 20 multiclass datasets from the UCI database repository. Our results show that the method is very likely to improve Ripper’s classification performance without having a high risk of decreasing it. The size of this improvement is similar to that obtained by boosting C5. In addition, we give a theoretical analysis of the complexity of the approach and show that its training time is within a small constant factor of the training time of the sequential class binarization technique that is currently used in Ripper
