Suppose we are given some fixed (but unknown) subset <i>X</i> of a set Ω = F<inf>2</inf><sup><i>n</i></sup>, where F<inf>2</inf> denotes the field of two elements. We would like to learn as much as possible about the elements <i>X</i> by asking certain binary questions. Each "question" <i>Q</i> is some element of Ω, and the "answer" to <i>Q</i> is just the inner product <i>Q·x</i> (in F<inf>2</inf>) for <i>some x</i> ε <i>X.</i> However, the choice of <i>x</i> is made by a truthful (but possibly malevolent) adversary <b>A,</b> whom we may assume is trying to choose answers so as to as yield as little information as possible about <i>X.</i> In this paper, we study various aspects of this problem. In particular, we are interested in extracting as much information as possible about <i>X</i> from <b>A</b>'s answers. Although <b>A</b> can prevent us from learning the identity of any particular element of <i>X,</i> with appropriate questions we can still learn a lot about <i>X.</i> We determine the maximum amount of information that can be recovered and discuss the optimal strategies for selecting questions. For the case that |<i>X</i>| = 2, we give an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>) algorithm for an optimal strategy. However, for the case that |<i>X</i>| ≥ 3, we show that no such polynomial-time algorithm can exist, unless <i>P = NP.</i>
