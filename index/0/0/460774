This paper presents a new distributed process calculus, called the M-calculus, that can be understood as a higher-order version of the Distributed Join calculus with programmable localities. The calculus retains the implementable character of the Distributed Join calculus while overcoming several important limitations: insufficient control over communication and mobility, absence of dynamic binding, and limited locality semantics. The calculus is equipped with a polymorphic type system that guarantees the unicity of locality names, even in presence of higher-order communications -- a crucial property for the determinacy of message routing in the calculus.
