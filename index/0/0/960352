As an entry for the 2002 Gordon Bell performance prize, we report the performance achieved on the GRAPE-6 system for a simulation of the early evolution of the protoplanet-planetesimal system of the Uranus-Neptune region. GRAPE-6 is a special-purpose computer for astrophysical N-body calculations. The present configuration has 2048 custom pipeline chips, each containing six pipeline processors for the calculation of gravitational interactions between particles. Its theoretical peak performance is 63.4 Tflops. The actual performance obtained was 29.5 Tflops, for a simulation of the early evolution of outer Solar system with 1.8 million planetesimals and two massive protoplanets.
