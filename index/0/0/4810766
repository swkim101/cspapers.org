In the world of training, online training is introduced as a modern training services model. For the optimal use of online training services, possession of an appropriate technology platform is vital. Cloud computing is a modern technology which was dramatically interested in the world of information technology, providing software, infrastructure and platform as internet services for the IT world. In this study, the impact of cloud computing on e-learning as an alternative technology for the traditional Web 2, analyzed. The quantitative/experimental method utilized for measurements of two e-learning management servers: one with cloud computing and another with web based technology, with particular QoS (Quality of Service) parameters are done by tools of Apache Benchmark service. Hypothesis testing employed to prove the effects statistically. Three different benchmark tests deployed as follows: analyzing the accessibility to the first page of the Moodle, analyzing the accessibility to the login file system and analyzing the accessibility to the academic file. Final consequences that are resulted from comparing the two servers have shown that the QoS indices of cloud computing server are better than the web 2 based server. The findings prove better performance and quality of service in four aspects of the response time, the throughput passing, the scalability and accessibility. This study grants the E-learning Practitioners and researchers, proved leads, to direct and implement their e-learning systems and platforms on cloud computing infrastructure to achieve identified qualities in their educational and learning services.
