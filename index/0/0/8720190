As the use of information technology is increasing rapidly in organizations around the world, an important task is to de-sign global networks with high security, e√Üciency and functionality. While centralized systems have the advantages of simpli(cid:12)ed management, they face the problems of bottle-neck and single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a new authorization scheme that operates over existing centralized authentication mechanisms. The goal is to enhance the performance and scalability in a centrally administered security architecture. A new technique of using one-shot authorization tokens is introduced. It facilitates a mechanism for updating or revocation of the access rights of users in online or o(cid:11)-line authorization models. A smart card is used as an authorization device in addition to its traditional function of user authentication. This scheme provides the mobility for users and the (cid:13)exibility in coping with di(cid:11)erent access control policies in a cross domain multi-application environment.
