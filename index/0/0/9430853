This paper presents motion control concepts on parallel robots with explicit focus on anti-windup-design and trajectory-tracking. Starting from modeling and exact feedback linearization, a cascade control is designed. Improvements to control laws with respect to input-saturations are derived by using concepts of anti-windup compensation. A multiple-axis anti-windup-control is presented, guaranteeing tracking in case of input-saturation. Control schemes are implemented on a planar parallel manipulator for performance evaluation of high dynamic operation. Efficiency of control is highlighted with respect to trajectory tracking i. e. Cartesian distortion. All concepts are derived in a formal way guaranteeing manipulator-independent results and transferability.
