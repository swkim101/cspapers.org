The goal of our research is to improve event extraction by learning to identify secondary role filler contexts in the absence of event keywords. We propose a multi-layered event extraction architecture that progressively "zooms in" on relevant information. Our extraction model includes a document genre classifier to recognize event narratives, two types of sentence classifiers, and noun phrase classifiers to extract role fillers. These modules are organized as a pipeline to gradually zero in on event-related information. We present results on the MUC-4 event extraction data set and show that this model performs better than previous systems.
