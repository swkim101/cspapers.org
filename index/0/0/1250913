This paper proposes a prefetch-based disk buuer management algorithm, which we call W 2 R (Weighing/Waiting Room). Instead of using elaborate prefetching schemes to decide which block to prefetch and when, we simply follow the LRU-OBL (One Block Lookahead) approach and prefetch the logical next block along with the block that is being referenced. The basic diierence is that the W 2 R algorithm logically partitions the buuer into two rooms, namely the Weighing Room and the Waiting Room. The referenced, hence fetched block is placed in the Weighing Room, while the prefetched logical next block is placed in the Waiting Room. By so doing, we alleviate some inherent deeciencies of blindly prefetching the logical next block of a referenced block. Speciically, a prefetched block that is never used may replace a possibly valuable block and a prefetched block, though ref-erenced in the future, may replace a block that is used earlier than itself. Using the DB2 and OLTP traces, we show through trace driven simulation that for the workloads and the environments considered the W 2 R algorithm improves the hit rate by a maximum of 23.19 percentage points compared to the 2Q algorithm and a maximum of 9.27 percentage points compared to the LRU-OBL algorithm. 1 Introduction Many algorithms for improving the performance of database disk buuer management have been proposed. A large group of work can be categorized into those that tune the buuer management algorithm based on informa
