We develop a novel technique for measuring lighting that exploits the interaction of light with a set of custom BRDFs. This enables the construction of a planar light probe with certain advantages over existing methods for measuring lighting. To facilitate the construction of our light probe, we derive a new class of bi-directional reflectance functions based on the interaction of light through two planar surfaces separated by a transparent medium. Under certain assumptions and proper selection of the two surfaces, we show how to recover Fourier series coefficients of the incident lighting parameterized over the plane. The results are experimentally validated by imaging a sheet of glass with spatially varying patterns printed on either side.
