Sometime in recent years, everybody discovered computing. Some combination of cheap. hardware, graphical interfaces, and the World Wide Web has resulted in,a state of affairs that has nearly everyone using, computers for something. As computer science educators, we are faced with the sometimes difficult and often enjoyable task,,of spreading the good news about computer science, of teaching people about the essentials of, “algorithmic thinking” that enables us tom have computers help us do things. : Arguably,: the most important focus of our efforts should be at the introductory level, where most non-CS people will be exposed. If we are able to effectively express the principles of computer science to students in other disciplines, and’cause them to realize how tionderfnl computer science really is, then we might not only find durselves with. some “converts” but also might influence those in other disciplines to better incorporate algbrithmic thinking and problem-solving into their own di sciplines.
