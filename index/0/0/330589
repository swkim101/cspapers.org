There is growing need for software tools that can accurately simulate the complex dynamics of modern robots. While a number of candidates exist, the field is fragmented. It is difficult to select the best tool for a given project, or to predict how much effort will be needed and what the ultimate simulation performance will be. Here we introduce new quantitative measures of simulation performance, focusing on the numerical challenges that are typical for robotics as opposed to multi-body dynamics and gaming. We then present extensive simulation results, obtained within a new software framework for instantiating the same model in multiple engines and running side-by-side comparisons. Overall we find that each engine performs best on the type of system it was designed and optimized for: MuJoCo wins the robotics-related tests, while the gaming engines win the gaming-related tests without a clear leader among them. The simulations are illustrated in the accompanying movie.
