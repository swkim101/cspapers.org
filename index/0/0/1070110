There is a lot of research on formalization of intention. The common idea of these theories is to interprete intention as an unary modal operator in Kripkean semantics. These theories suffer from the side-effect problem seriously. We introduce an alternative approach by establishing a nonclassical logic of intention. This logic is based on a novel non-Kripkean semantics which embodies some cognitive features. We show that this logic does provide a formal specification and a decidable inference mechanism of intention consequences. All and only the instances of sideeffects, except ones in absorbent forms, are forbidden in the logic.
