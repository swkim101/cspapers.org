This full-day tutorial provides general instruction about the design of controlled laboratory experiments that are conducted in order to better understand human information interaction and retrieval. Different data collection methods and procedures are described, with an emphasis on self-report measures and scales. This tutorial also introduces the use of statistical power analysis for sample size estimation and introduces and demonstrate two data analysis procedures, Multilevel Modeling and Structural Equation Modeling, that allow for examination of the whole set of variables present in interactive information retrieval (IIR) experiments, along with their various effect sizes. The goals of the tutorial are to increase participants' (1) understanding of the uses of controlled laboratory experiments with human participants; (2) understanding of the technical vocabulary and procedures associated with such experiments and (3) confidence in conducting and evaluating IIR experiments. Ultimately, we hope our tutorial will increase research capacity and research quality in IR by providing instruction about best practices to those contemplating interactive IR experiments.
