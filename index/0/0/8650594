This paper presents a trajectory planning approach for cable-suspended parallel mechanisms. A planar two-degree-of-freedom parallel mechanism is used for the analysis. Based on the dynamic model of the suspended robot, a set of algebraic inequalities is obtained that represents the constraints on the cable tensions. Parametric Cartesian trajectories are then defined and substituted into the constraints in order to obtain global conditions on the trajectory parameters which ensure that the trajectories are feasible. Special frequencies arise from the equations that are akin to natural frequencies of pendulum-type systems. An experimental validation is also presented using a two-dof prototype. The proposed trajectory planning approach can be used to plan dynamic trajectories that go beyond the static workspace of the mechanism, thereby opening novel applications and possibilities for cable-suspended robots.
