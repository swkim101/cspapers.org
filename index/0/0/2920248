Presents an automated system for counting fish by species. This system is to be used in fishways for monitoring and surveying fish. The system requires very few adjustments and no special installation. An infrared silhouette sensor is used to acquire the fish silhouettes These silhouettes are then processed on a personal computer for fish counting and classification by species. The system allows the operator to select the species of interest according to the fauna of the specified river. Classification is made based on the combined results of a Bayes maximum likelihood classifier, a learning vector quantization classifier and a one-class-one-network neural network classifier. Through the use of specialized classifiers of different types, a robust, modular and expandable recognition system is created.
