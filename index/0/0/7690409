While software metrics are a generally desirable feature in the software management functions of project planning and project evaluation, they are of especial importance with a new technology such as the object-oriented approach. This is due to the significant need to train software engineers in generally accepted object-oriented principles. This paper presents theoretical work that builds a suite of metrics for object-oriented design. In particular, these metrics are based upon measurement theory and are informed by the insights of experienced object-oriented software developers. The proposed metrics are formally evaluated against a widelyaccepted list of software metric evaluation criteria.
