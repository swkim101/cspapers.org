MineSetTM is a highly integrated suite of client-server tools for the high-end mining and visualization of very large enterprise databases. MineSet represents the confluence of several important software and hardware technologies: data mining algorithms, fast multiprocessing database servers, novel techniques for interactive 3-D data visualization, and powerful graphics workstations. MineSet provides integrated facilities for the extraction of data from varied sources, algorithms for mining the extracted data, and tools for the 3-D visualization of results. The mining algorithms allow for the discovery of previously unknown nuggets of information, while the sophisticated visualizations allow the user to get a better understanding of both the data mining results, and also the interrelationships among the raw data (“visual data mining”). Underlying all these techniques is the ability to handle large data sets.
