Knowledge extraction from online repositories such as PubMed holds the promise of dramatically speeding up biomedical research and drug design. After initially focusing on recognizing proteins and binary interactions, the community has recently shifted their attention to the more ambitious task of recognizing complex, nested event structures. State-of-the-art systems use a pipeline architecture in which the candidate events are identified first, and subsequently the arguments. This fails to leverage joint inference among events and arguments for mutual disambiguation. Some joint approaches have been proposed, but they still lag much behind in accuracy. In this paper, we present the first joint approach for bio-event extraction that obtains state-of-the-art results. Our system is based on Markov logic and adopts a novel formulation by jointly predicting events and arguments, as well as individual dependency edges that compose the argument paths. On the BioNLP'09 Shared Task dataset, it reduced F1 errors by more than 10% compared to the previous best joint approach.
