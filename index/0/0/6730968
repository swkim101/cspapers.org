Despite ease of deployment being seen as a primary advantage of sensor networks, deployment remains difficult. We present Snap, a system for rapid sensornet deployment that allows sensor networks to be deployed, positioned, and reprogrammed through a sensornet appstore. Snap uses a smartphone interface that uses QR codes for node identification, a map interface for node positioning, and dynamic loading of applications on the nodes. Snap nodes run the Contiki operating system and its low-power IPv6 network stack that provides direct access from nodes to the smartphone application. We demonstrate rapid sensor node deployment, identification, positioning, and node reprogramming within seconds, over a multi-hop sensornet routing path with a WiFi-connected smartphone.
