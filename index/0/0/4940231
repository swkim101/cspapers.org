The detection and correction of grammatical errors still represent very hard problems for modern error-correction systems. As an example, the top-performing systems at the preposition correction challenge CoNLL-2013 only achieved a F1 score of 17%. In this paper, we propose and extensively evaluate a series of approaches for correcting prepositions, analyzing a large body of high-quality textual content to capture language usage. Leveraging n-gram statistics, association measures, and machine learning techniques, our system is able to learn which words or phrases govern the usage of a specific preposition. Our approach makes heavy use of n-gram statistics generated from very large textual corpora. In particular, one of our key features is the use of n-gram association measures (e.g., Pointwise Mutual Information) between words and prepositions to generate better aggregated preposition rankings for the individual n-grams. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using cross-validation with different feature combinations and on two test collections created from a set of English language exams and StackExchange forums. We also compare against state-of-the-art supervised methods. Experimental results from the CoNLL-2013 test collection show that our approach to preposition correction achieves âˆ¼30% in F1 score which results in 13% absolute improvement over the best performing approach at that challenge.
