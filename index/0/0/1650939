Blob detection and image denoising are fundamental, and sometimes related, tasks in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a blob reconstruction method using scale-invariant normalized unilateral second order Gaussian kernels. Unlike other blob detection methods, our method suppresses non-blob structures while also identifying blob parameters, i.e., position, prominence and scale, thereby facilitating blob reconstruction. We present an algorithm for high-ISO long-exposure noise removal that results from the combination of our blob reconstruction method and state-of-the-art denoising methods, i.e., the non-local means algorithm (NLM) and the color version of block-matching and 3-D filtering (CBM3D). Experiments on standard images corrupted by real high-ISO long-exposure noise and real-world noisy images demonstrate that our schemes incorporating the blob reduction procedure outperform both the original NLM and CBM3D.
