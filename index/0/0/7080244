In this paper, we present a set of metrics (scalability, adaptability, overhead, latency, complexity, and effectiveness) to evaluate dynamic configuration techniques. We have applied these metrics to two real systems: remote management system and dynamic security configuration of networked systems. The evaluation results show that our approach can efficiently and dynamically manage system resources and network security with little overhead.
