Decentralized resource management in distributed systems has become more practical with the availability of communication facilities that support multicasting. In this paper we present several example solutions for managing resources in a decentralized fashion, using multicasting facilities. We review the properties of these solutions in terms of scalability, fault tolerance and efficiency. We conclude that decentralized solutions compare favorably to centralized solutions with respect to all three criteria.
