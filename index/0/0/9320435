The distance metric is a key component in RRT-based motion planning that deeply affects coverage of the state space, path quality and planning time. With the goal to speed up planning time, we introduce a learning approach to approximate the distance metric for RRT-based planners. By exploiting a novel steer function which solves the two-point boundary value problem for wheeled mobile robots, we train a simple nonlinear parametric model with constant-time inference that is shown to predict distances accurately in terms of regression and ranking performance. In an extensive analysis we compare our approach to an Euclidean distance baseline, consider four alternative regression models and study the impact of domain-specific feature expansion. The learning approach is shown to be faster in planning time by several factors at negligible loss of path quality.
