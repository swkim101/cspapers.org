Indexing according to occurrences of selected word fragments, called “n-grams”, offers a significant alternative to keyword indexing and full text scanning methods in the design of information systems based on documents. Finite sets of n-grams can be selected to allow effective fixed indexing of all words, numbers, and special terms in text. The characteristics of such indexing can be modeled statistically and validated over a wide range of text. The model provides a descriptive and predictive tool for controlling precision and recall in searching and for scaling estimates of relevance to an adaptive reference noise distribution for a target collection. Special techniques such as partial inversion of index terms, probabilistic ordering of index terms, and various types of data compression allow n-gram indexing to be competitive in performance with other approaches.
