This paper is about some of the social aspects of knowledge and action relevant to thinking in AI, and in particular the basic experience of multiple perspectives and integrating different kinds of local knowledge. It discusses ways of rethinking a number of familiar concepts including facts, interaction, knowledge, and organization, raising questions about how well we can currently capture their social dimensions conceptually, representationally, and computationally. It suggests several approaches to developing more complete computational models of these phenomena.
