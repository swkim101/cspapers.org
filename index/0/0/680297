In this paper we present a new data structure called edge-valued binary decision diagrams (EV) as a representation of functions. An EV is an extension of ordered binary decision diagrams that allows for multilevel and hierarchical verification. We show that an EV is a compact and canonical representation for arbitrary integer functions. Hence the specification can be at a higher level than the implementation. Furthermore, the variable ordering strategy for an EV can be derived from a hi her level functional specification instead of the gate fevel specification. Examples shown in this paper includes SN74L85[7], SN74181 71, a 64built from SN74181.
