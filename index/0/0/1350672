The goal of this paper is to provide computable account for some definite descriptions. To this end, we define in terms of inclusion the notion of distinguishing description and of distinguishable entities introduced by [Dale 89]. These definitions allow us to give conditions of wellformedness for incomplete distinguishing descriptions. We also extend the notion of distinguishing description to take into account cases of synonymy and hyponymy.We describe a real application of a guided composition system where this sort of expressions arise.
