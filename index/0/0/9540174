We present a fast method for solving rigid body contact problems with friction, based on optimizations incorporated into Lemkeâ€™s algorithm for solving linear complementarity problems. These optimizations improve computation time in general and reduce the expected solution complexity from O(n3) to nearly O(nm + m3), where n and m are the number of contacts and rigid bodies. For a fixed number of bodies the expected complexity is therefore close to O(n) . Our method also improves numerical robustness, and removes the need to explicitly compute the large matrices associated with rigid body contact problems.
