The ADVISE system is an integrated set of tools for the development of and experimentation with expert systems in various specific application domains. It functions as a multi-purpose inference system that employs three knowledge representations: a rule-base, a conceptual network and a relational data base. In addition, it includes learning capabilities by incorporating the inductive learning programs GEM (for learning from examples) and CLUSTER (for constructing classifications). 
 
Three expert systems have been developed using ADVISE: PLANT/ds (version 2)--for diagnosing soybean diseases, PLANT/cd--for predicting cutworm damage to corn, and BABY--a consultant for the neo-natal intensive care unit.
