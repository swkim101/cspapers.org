TextTrees, introduced in (Newman, 2005), are skeletal representations formed by systematically converting parser output trees into unlabeled indented strings with minimal bracketing. Files of TextTrees can be read rapidly to evaluate the results of parsing long documents, and are easily edited to allow limited-cost treebank development. This paper reviews the TextTree concept, and then describes the implementation of the almost parser- and grammar-independent TextTree generator, as well as auxiliary methods for producing parser review files and inputs to bracket scoring tools. The results of some limited experiments in TextTree usage are also provided.
