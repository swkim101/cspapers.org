It is a tedious task to search and locate a specific food from a massive number of foods arbitrarily placed in a fridge. In this paper, we develop iFridge, an intelligent system which allows the user to effectively manage and accurately locate the foods stored inside the fridge. By leveraging the RFID technology, iFridge is able to automatically collect the food information, perceive the user's activities and locate the specified foods. We develop a smart application "cooking recipe recommendation" by sensing the user's daily eating habits. Moreover, by specifying those foods with roughly known locations as anchor nodes, we are able to locate the specified food by using cluster analysis.
