This paper describes an efficient and accurate approach to estimate the network distance between arbitrary Internet hosts. We use three landmark hosts forming a triangle in two-dimensional space to estimate the distance between arbitrary hosts with simple trigonometrical calculations. To improve the accuracy of estimation, we dynamically choose the "best" triangle for a given pair of hosts using a heuristic algorithm. Our experiments show that this approach achieves both lower computational and network probing cost over the classic landmarks-based approach while producing more accurate estimates.
