The purpose of this paper is to introduce recent developments in the time analysis, simulation and modeling of logic circuits. These advances which have taken place in the circuit and systems area augment the recent advances in logic time simulators. The latest trend has been to combine the approaches into a single system, a so called mixed simulation-analysis program. In this paper we review some of the circuit oriented techniques at a level understandable to the non circuit-theorist.
