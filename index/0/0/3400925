In this paper, we propose a novel single image action recognition algorithm based on the idea of semantic part actions. Unlike existing part-based methods, we argue that there exists a mid-level semantic, the semantic part action; and human action is a combination of semantic part actions and context cues. In detail, we divide human body into seven parts: head, torso, arms, hands and lower body. For each of them, we define a few semantic part actions (e.g. head: laughing). Finally, we exploit these part actions to infer the entire body action (e.g. applauding). To make the proposed idea practical, we propose a deep network-based framework which consists of two subnetworks, one for part localization and the other for action prediction. The action prediction network jointly learns part-level and body-level action semantics and combines them for the final decision. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposal on semantic part actions as elements for entire body action. Our method reaches mAP of 93.9% and 91.2% on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Stanford-40, which outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.3% and 8.6%.
