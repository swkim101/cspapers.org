The kinematic design of a multi-segment ambulatory microrobot inspired by centipedes is presented. The kinematics of five repeated segments joined by a flexible backbone of rigid links and flexures are described and simulated. The kinematic model was used to guide the design of an individual two degree of freedom segment, which was fabricated using the Smart Composite Microstructures process. Testing and analysis of a suspended segment displayed motion similar to that predicted by the model. Multiple segments can be joined to a flexible backbone to create a multi-segment structure capable of a variety of gaits. Due to its modular, multi-legged, and compact design, this robot has the potential to serve as a platform for swarm robotics applications, advance control techniques for ambulatory systems, and inspire batch fabrication of microrobots.
