Underwater Gliders have found broad applications in ocean sampling. In this paper, the nonlinear dynamic model of the glider developed by the Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, is established. Based on this model, we solve for the parameters that characterize steady state spiraling motions of the glider. A set of nonlinear equations are simplified so that a recursive algorithm can be used to find the solutions.
