We present a simple new criterion for classification, based on principles from lossy data compression. The criterion assigns a test sample to the class that uses the minimum number of additional bits to code the test sample, subject to an allowable distortion. We prove asymptotic optimality of this criterion for Gaussian data and analyze its relationships to classical classifiers. Theoretical results provide new insights into relationships among popular classifiers such as MAP and RDA, as well as unsupervised clustering methods based on lossy compression [13]. Minimizing the lossy coding length induces a regularization effect which stabilizes the (implicit) density estimate in a small-sample setting. Compression also provides a uniform means of handling classes of varying dimension. This simple classification criterion and its kernel and local versions perform competitively against existing classifiers on both synthetic examples and real imagery data such as handwritten digits and human faces, without requiring domain-specific information.
