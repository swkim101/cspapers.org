'People-nearby' applications for meeting new people online are some of the most popular examples of systems that lead people from an online interaction to an offline interaction. This paper provides a critical review of available applications, and identifies three key properties that are essential for the applications: physical location, identity management, and trust. The paper suggests open research questions that can explain the success of these applications and guide the design of new technologies that encourage offline interactions.
