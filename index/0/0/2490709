Trajectory planning is a critical aspect of autonomous tractor-trailer vehicle design. Trajectory planning algorithms usually compute paths first, trajectories are obtained thereafter. This multi-step feature makes those planners inefficacious to handle time-dependent constraints. In this study, we consider the original trajectory planning mission directly, which is described as an optimal control problem containing the kinematics, mechanical/physical constraints, environmental requirements as well as an optimization criterion. In this formulation, only the fundamental driving principles with no special issues (e.g., backing-up maneuver and jackknife) are considered. For example, the prevailing “small-angle assumption” is not utilized to prevent jackknifing. Instead, we only require that different parts of a tractor-trailer vehicle should not collide, since the emergence of jackknife does not physically violate the kinematics. An interior-point method based simultaneous approach is adopted to solve the formulated optimal control problem. Simulation results verify our proposal is capable of handling scenarios with various user-specified requirements.
