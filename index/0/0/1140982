We study variants of Kleinberg's small-world model where we start with a <i>k</i>-dimensional grid and add a random directed edge from each node. The probability <i>u's</i> random edge is to <i>v</i> is proportional to <i>d(u,v)<sup>-r</sup></i> where <i>d(u,v)</i> is the lattice distance and <i>r</i> is a parameter of the model.For a <i>k</i>-dimensional grid, we show that these graphs have poly-log expected diameter when <i>k</i> < <i>r</i> < 2<i>k</i>, but have polynomial expected diameter when <i>r</i> > 2<i>k.</i> This shows an interesting phase-transition between small-world and "large-world" graphs.We also present a general framework to construct classes of small-world graphs with Θ(log <i>n</i>) expected diameter, which includes several existing settings such as Kleinberg's grid-based and tree-based settings [15].We also generalize the idea of 'adding links with probability α the inverse distance' to design small-world graphs. We use semi-metric and metric functions to abstract distance to create a class of random graphs where almost all pairs of nodes are connected by a path of length <i>O</i> (log <i>n</i>), and using only local information we can find paths of poly-log length.
