In this paper we address power-aware scheduling of periodic hard real-time tasks using dynamic voltage scaling. Our solution includes three parts: (a) a static (off-line) solution to compute the optimal speed, assuming worst-case workload for each arrival, (b) an on-line speed reduction mechanism to reclaim energy by adapting to the actual workload, and (c) an online, adaptive and speculative speed adjustment mechanism to anticipate early completions of future executions by using the average-case workload information. All these solutions still guarantee that all deadlines are met. Our simulation results show that the reclaiming algorithm saves a striking 50% of the energy, over the static algorithm. Further our speculative techniques allow for an additional approximately 20% savings over the reclaiming algorithm. In this study, we also establish that solving an instance of the static power-aware scheduling problem is equivalent to solving an instance of the reward-based scheduling problem [1, 4] with concave reward functions.
