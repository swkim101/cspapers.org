It is well known that anthropomorphic manipulators, such as the PA-10, are intolerant to a single locked joint failure of the elbow. This is because the elbow is the only joint that can change the distance between the spherical shoulder joint and the spherical wrist. In this work, it is shown how such arms can be made significantly more fault tolerant by a minor modification to the kinematic structure of the arm. We quantify the degree of fault tolerance to locked joint failures as the minimum of the smallest singular value of the resulting seven Jacobians over all possible single failures. The DH parameters for the modified arm are designed so that the corresponding fault tolerant properties are close to those of a robot with an optimally failure tolerant Jacobian. The fault tolerance of the designed robot is evaluated for two different classes of applications, i.e., point-to-point motions and specified end-effector trajectories.
