We present several interesting applications for the Pattern-Annotated Course Tool (PACT) and pedagogical design patterns in the process of curriculum design. PACT is a visual editor in which content designers can create visual representations of their courses and annotate them with references to educational theory in the form of pedagogical patterns. Each usage scenario illustrates the opportunities for learning that PACT, the annotation process, and the artifacts that users create present to experts, novices, and everyone in between. Finally, we take an in-depth look at one ongoing course annotation being crafted by an experienced curriculum designer and examine his interesting findings from the process. An analysis of these discoveries demonstrates the utility of PACT in the curriculum design process.
