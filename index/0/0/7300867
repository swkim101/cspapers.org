This paper describes adaptations of unsupervised word sense discrimination techniques to the problem of name discrimination. These methods cluster the contexts containing an ambiguous name, such that each cluster refers to a unique underlying person or place. We also present new techniques to assign meaningful labels to the discovered clusters.
