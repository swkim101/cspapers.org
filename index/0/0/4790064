The problem of estimating the <i>k</i><sup><i>th</i></sup> frequency moment <i>F</i><inf><i>k</i></inf> over a data stream by looking at the items exactly once as they arrive was posed in [1, 2]. A succession of algorithms have been proposed for this problem [1, 2, 6, 8, 7]. Recently, Indyk and Woodruff [11] have presented the first algorithm for estimating <i>F</i><inf><i>k</i></inf>, for <i>k</i> > 2, using space <i>Ã•</i>(<i>n</i><sup>1-2/<i>k</i></sup>), matching the space lower bound (up to poly-logarithmic factors) for this problem [1, 2, 3, 4, 13] (<i>n</i> is the number of distinct items occurring in the stream.) In this paper, we present a simpler 1-pass algorithm for estimating <i>F</i><inf><i>k</i>.</inf>
