The acquisition of musical gestures and particularly of instrument controls from a musical performance is a field of increasing interest with applications in many research areas. In the last years, the development of novel sensing technologies has allowed the fine measurement of such controls. However, the acquisition process usually involves the use of expensive sensing systems and complex setups that are generally intrusive in practice. An alternative to direct acquisition is through the analysis of the audio signal. So called indirect acquisition has many advantages including the simplicity and low-cost of the acquisition and its nonintrusive nature. The main challenge is designing robust detection algorithms to be as accurate as the direct approaches. In this paper, we present an indirect acquisition method to estimate violin bowing controls from audio signal analysis based on training Convolutional Neural Networks with a database of multimodal data (bowing controls and sound features) of violin performances.
