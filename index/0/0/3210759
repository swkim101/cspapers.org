It is helpful to reduce the time cost, data amount, and expertise required. Deep learning has achieved great success in various tasks involving images, voices and videos. There are several studies have the sense of model reuse, by trying to reuse pre-trained deep networks architectures or deep model features to train a new deep model. They, however, neglect the fact that there are many other fixed models or features available. In this paper, we propose a more thorough model reuse scheme, FMR (Fixed Model Reuse). FMR utilizes the learning power of deep models to implicitly grab the useful discriminative information from fixed model/features that have been widely used in general tasks. We firstly arrange the convolution layers of a deep network and the provided fixed model/features in parallel, fully connecting to the output layer nodes. Then, the dependencies between the output layer nodes and the fixed model/features are knockdown such that only the raw feature inputs are needed when the model is being used for testing, though the helpful information in the fixed model/features have already been incorporated into the model. On one hand, by the FMR scheme, the required amount of training data can be significantly reduced because of the reuse of fixed model/features. On the other hand, the fixed model/features are not explicitly used in testing, and thus, the scheme can be quite useful in applications where the fixed model/features are protected by patents or commercial secrets. Experiments on five real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of FMR compared with state-of-the-art deep methods.
