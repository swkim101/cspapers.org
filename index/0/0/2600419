In this paper we design and implement a Spatial Data Model. The model provides the ability to support, through one schema, various spatial object represent ations in relation to user perspective, and provides constructs to intelligently process certain semantically imprecise spatial operators such as “close-to”, “between” and “adjacent-to”. We develop our Model using a combination of two well kuown 00 design methodologies, namely the Responsibility-Driven Approach and the Frameworks Approach. Strategies for processing the above imprecise operators are developed. The paper also shows, through actual examples, how the structural and dynamic aspects of the proposed model facilitates the processing of imprecise operators.
