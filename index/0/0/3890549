An approach is outlined to the problem of understanding of temporal relations in natural language texts by a computer. Discussed are the principles of constructing of a time logic, appropriate for the application in the artificial intelligence systems. Means for constructing a time logic for text analysis in robots and dialog systems are proposed. TIMER, the processor implementing "time understanding" in DILOS (a system of natural language man-machine communication) is briefly described.
