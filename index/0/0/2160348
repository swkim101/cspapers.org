Axiom pinpointing plays an important role in the development and maintenance of ontologies. It helps the user to comprehend an unwanted entailment of an ontology by presenting all minimal subsets of the ontology which are responsible for the entailment (called MinAs). In this paper, we consider the problem of axiom pinpointing in description logic EL+, which underpins OWL 2 EL, a profile of the latest version of Web Ontology Language (OWL). We propose a novel method to compute all MinAs that utilizes the hierarchy information obtained from the classification of an EL+ ontology. The advantage of our method over an existing labeled classification based method is that we do not attach labels to entailed subsumptions, which can be memory exhaustion for large scale ontologies. We further consider axiom pinpointing in EL+ when ontologies change. An incremental algorithm is given to compute all MinAs by reusing MinAs previously computed.
