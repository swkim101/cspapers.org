This research investigates the problem of how to adapt the changing of quorum assignments for objects in a replicated database to the duration and extent of failures occurring in the underlying; communication network. The concept of a view based on a connected component of the network is used to coordinate changes to quorum assignments of differ- ent objects. A dynamic view formation protocol is proposed that permits objects to join a new view on demand. A new technique called inheritance enables a new view to acquire quorum assignments from an old view, so that only those objects that were ac- cessed during a failure need to change their quorum assignments back following repair of the failure. Ex- tension of an existing view may be used to incorpo- rate a recovering site into the network without form- ing a new view, thus localizing the effects of the fail- ure. We have made analytical performance estimates for some sample network configurations and failure situations to show the improvements of our method over previously proposed methods. Following repair of a failure, our method can begin processing transac- tions almost immediately, but with less extra average overhead than for previous methods. We describe a prototype implementation of our method that will be used for future experimentation.
