In accord with a college-wide assessment program at the author's institution, a required major course approximately midway through a student's college career forms the matrix for an intensive project which both develops and evaluates the student's communication skills in discipline-specific ways. For Computer Science majors, the project is a component of a junior-level Advanced Object-Oriented Programming course. Though centered about a semester-long programming project, it involves expectations, guidance, and feedback beyond what is traditional. This assessment instrument has a minimal impact on class time and course content, substantial impact on faculty and student effort, and tremendous impact on learning.
