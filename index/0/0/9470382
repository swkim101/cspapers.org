As the world gets hyper-connected, cities are evolving into complex ecosystems, technically and behaviourally. Machines and humans interact continually, generating streams of data and behavior patterns. To be a true smart city in a hyper-connected world, cities today have to use technology like a modern enterprise: build a digital spine; become intelligent and leverage automation. However, this technology core should be people centric. In a multiple stakeholder ecosystem, city administrators, industries and citizens, will look at the city from a different perspective and expect different experiences. Finally citizen experience will be the determinant of success of a smart city. While articulating this vision, Ananth will highlight how differently businesses must orient themselves in this environment.
