Syntactic knowledge is important for discourse relation recognition. Yet only heuristically selected flat paths and 2-level production rules have been used to incorporate such information so far. In this paper we propose using tree kernel based approach to automatically mine the syntactic information from the parse trees for discourse analysis, applying kernel function to the tree structures directly. These structural syntactic features, together with other normal flat features are incorporated into our composite kernel to capture diverse knowledge for simultaneous discourse identification and classification for both explicit and implicit relations. The experiment shows tree kernel approach is able to give statistical significant improvements over flat syntactic path feature. We also illustrate that tree kernel approach covers more structure information than the production rules, which allows tree kernel to further incorporate information from a higher dimension space for possible better discrimination. Besides, we further propose to leverage on temporal ordering information to constrain the interpretation of discourse relation, which also demonstrate statistical significant improvements for discourse relation recognition on PDTB 2.0 for both explicit and implicit as well.
