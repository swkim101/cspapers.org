In recent times, we have seen a proliferation of personal data. This can be attributed not just to a larger proportion of our lives moving online, but also through the rise of ubiquitous sensing through mobile and IoT devices. Alongside this surge, concerns over privacy, trust, and security are expressed more and more as different parties attempt to take advantage of this rich assortment of data. The Databox seeks to enable all the advantages of personal data analytics while at the same time enforcing **accountability** and **control** in order to protect a user's privacy. In this work, we propose and delineate a personal networked device that allows users to **collate**, **curate**, and **mediate** their personal data.
