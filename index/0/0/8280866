CALAS is a subsystem for acquiring semantic grammars to be used in CUSAGA which can understand technical Chinese texts and extract knowledge from them. The semantic grammar is acquired in a semi--automatic way under the guidance of the user. CUSAGA is implemented on UV68000 with about 12000 PASCAL lines. This paper gives a short overview on the architcclure and functions of CUSAGA and a more detailed discussion about the working principles and techniques adopted by CALAS is presented.
