Grace is a new object-oriented language that supports a variety of approaches to teaching programming. It integrates accepted new ideas in programming languages into a simple language that allows students and teachers to focus on the essential complexities of programming rather than the accidental complexities of the language. We motivate Grace, review its design, and evaluate it against Kolling's criteria.
