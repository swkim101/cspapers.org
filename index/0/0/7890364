This paper presents a method for detecting contact on a compliant link utilizing a method to sense changes in the resonant frequency of the link due to external contact. The approach uses an inexpensive accelerometer mounted on or inside the compliant link and a phase locked loop circuit to oscillate the link at its resonant frequency. Using this approach, we are able to reliably sense contact anywhere on the link with a contact force threshold sensitivity of between 0.05 and 0.15 N depending on the contact location.
