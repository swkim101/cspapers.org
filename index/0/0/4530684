The PyPy project seeks to prove both on a research and a practical level the feasibility of constructing a virtual machine (VM) for a dynamic language in a dynamic language - in this case, Python. The aim is to translate (i.e. compile) the VM to arbitrary target environments, ranging in level from C/Posix to Smalltalk/Squeak via Java and CLI/.NET, while still being of reasonable efficiency within these environments.A key tool to achieve this goal is the systematic reuse of the Python language as a system programming language at various levels of our architecture and translation process. For each level, we design a corresponding type system and apply a generic type inference engine - for example, the garbage collector is written in a style that manipulates simulated pointer and address objects, and when translated to C these operations become C-level pointer and address instructions.
