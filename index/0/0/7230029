Recently, a large number of pay-as-you-go data services are offered over cloud infrastructures. Data service providers need appropriate and flexible query charging mechanisms and query optimization that take into consideration cloud operational expenses, pricing strategies and user preferences. Yet, existing solutions are static and non-configurable. We demonstrate COCCUS, a modular system for cost-aware query execution, adaptive query charge and optimization of cloud data services. The audience can set their queries along with their execution preferences and budget constraints, while COCCUS adaptively determines query charge and manages secondary data structures according to various economic policies. We demonstrate COCCUS's operation over centralized and shared nothing CloudDBMS architectures on top of public and private IaaS clouds. The audience is enabled to set economic policies and execute various workloads through a comprehensive GUI. COCCUS's adaptability is showcased using real-time graphs depicting a number of key performance metrics.
