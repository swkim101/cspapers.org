A new virtual memory management algorithm WSCLOCK has been synthesized from the local working set (WS) algorithm, the global CLOCK algorithm, and a new load control mechanism for auxiliary memory access. The new algorithm combines the most useful feature of WS—a natural and effective load control that prevents thrashing—with the simplicity and efficiency of CLOCK. Studies are presented to show that the performance of WS and WSCLOCK are equivalent, even if the savings in overhead are ignored.
