A neurocomputer was implemented using radial basis functions and a combination of analog and digital VLSI circuits. The hybrid system uses custom analog circuits for the input layer and a digital signal processing board for the hidden and output layers. The system combines the advantages of both analog and digital circuits, featuring low power consumption while minimizing overall system error. The analog circuits have been fabricated and tested, the system has been built, and several applications have been executed on the system. One application provides significantly better results for a remote sensing problem than have been previously obtained using conventional methods.
