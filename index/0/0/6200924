A set of stations wish to transmit messages to one another over a shared link. Messages are generated either according to so called finite source or infinite source arrival statistics. The message lengths are independent identically distributed random variables. Two policies for arbitrating contention are compared: polling, and carrier sense collision detection. The maximum mean throughput rate and mean message delay is calculated as a function of model parameters.
