The research of my PhD thesis focuses on image emotion computing (IEC), which aims to predict the emotion perceptions of given images. The development of IEC is greatly constrained by two main challenges: affective gap and subjective evaluation. Previous works mainly focused on finding features that can express emotions better to bridge the affective gap, such as elements-of-art based features and shape features. According to the emotion representation models, including categorical emotion states (CES) and dimensional emotion space (DES), three different tasks are traditionally performed on IEC: affective image classification, regression and retrieval. The state-of-the-art methods on the three above tasks are image-centric, focusing on the dominant emotions for the majority of viewers. For my PhD thesis, I plan to answer the following questions: (1) Compared to the low-level elements-of-art based features, can we find some higher level features that are more interpretable and have stronger link to emotions? (2) Are the emotions that are evoked in viewers by an image subjective and different? If they are, how can we tackle the user-centric emotion prediction? (3) For image-centric emotion computing, can we predict the emotion distribution instead of the dominant emotion category?
