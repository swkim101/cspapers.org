In this paper we provide an abstract characterisation of different kinds of robust processing in Machine Translation and Natural Language Processing systems in terms of the kinds of problem they are supposed to solve. We focus on one problem which is typically exacerbated by robust processing, and for which we know of no existing solutions. We discuss two possible approaches to this, emphasising the need to correct or repair processing malfunctions.
