This paper describes RAPTURE - a system for revising probabilistic knowledge bases that combines neural and symbolic learning methods. RAPTURE uses a modified version of backpropagation to refine the certainty factors of a MYCIN-style rule base and uses ID3's information gain heuristic to add new rules. Results on refining two actual expert knowledge bases demonstrate that this combined approach performs better than previous methods.
