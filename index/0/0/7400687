The notion of a Social Web of Things (SWoT) appears in recent works at the convergence of the Social Web and the Web of Things. In our vision, a third dimension is needed: pro-activeness. We propose to extend and transform social networks by integrating autonomous and proactive things. In this paper, we discuss the evolution of the Web on several dimensions, leading to our vision for the SWoT. We discuss the challenges that need to be addressed, a possible approach for addressing them and we illustrate the applicability of the SWoT through a motivating scenario.
