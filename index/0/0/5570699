ACRONYM Is a model-based image understanding system. It demonstrates mechanisms for interpretation of images with generic object classes and generic viewing conditions, in a way that is generalizable. It incorporates a powerful geometric modeling capability with a high level modeling language for natural communication with the user In terms of object models. A user gives high level descriptions of both generic and specific instances of objects. A rule-based Inference system produces a viewpoint dependent symbolic summary of the predicted appearance of the objects. This geometric reasoning capability enables the system to incorporate and relate knowledge and information at different levels. This summary drives a powerful syntactic matcher to find instances of the objects in preprocessed images.
