Current understanding of the effects of damage on neural networks is rudimentary, even though such understanding could lead to important insights concerning neurological and psychiatric disorders. Motivated by this consideration, we present a simple analytical framework for estimating the functional damage resulting from focal structural lesions to a neural network. The effects of focal lesions of varying area, shape and number on the retrieval capacities of a spatially-organized associative memory. Although our analytical results are based on some approximations, they correspond well with simulation results. This study sheds light on some important features characterizing the clinical manifestations of multiinfarct dementia, including the strong association between the number of infarcts and the prevalence of dementia after stroke, and the 'multiplicative' interaction that has been postulated to occur between Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia.
