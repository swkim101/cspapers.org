This poster presents recent progress with the Computing Educators Oral History Project (CEOHP). To provide context, the poster includes a brief history of CEOHP and a summary of the interviews currently in the collection (a total of twenty-six completed interviews at the end of 2011). During Evaluation efforts in 2009 and 2010, a series of face-to-face and on-line qualitative interviews provided feedback about the CEOHP website, including its organization, content, and usability by target groups. The Evolution process incorporated ideas generated during Evaluation to improve both quality and consistency of the collection elements and the CEOHP website. In the Archival Storage process, all completed interviews in the CEOHP collection are being submitted to the prestigious Charles Babbage Institute for permanent indexing and archiving. These archival steps will become part of CEOHP's standard processing procedures, so each interview added to the CEOHP collection will be archived by the Charles Babbage Institute, guaranteeing that these materials will survive far into the future. This poster describes major steps, challenges, and achievements in the areas of Evaluation, Evolution, and Archival Storage, as well as the spiral nature of these activities as part of the on-going process of growing a collection such as CEOHP.
