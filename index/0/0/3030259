This paper develops a minimally supervised approach, based on focused distributional similarity methods and discourse connectives, for identifying of causality relations between events in context. While it has been shown that distributional similarity can help identifying causality, we observe that discourse connectives and the particular discourse relation they evoke in context provide additional information towards determining causality between events. We show that combining discourse relation predictions and distributional similarity methods in a global inference procedure provides additional improvements towards determining event causality.
