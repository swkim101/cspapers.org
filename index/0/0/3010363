In teleoperation studies, most researchers have been researching on the stability and telepresence. Few of them have studied the influence of the operational status of the teleoperator on the telerobotic systems. As a matter of fact, improper and incorrect operations of the teleoperator may decrease the teleoperation efficiency and even result in some serious safety problems even if the stability and telepresence are both guaranteed. Thus, this paper investigates a method to online identify the quality of the teleoperator and then integrate it into the planning and control of the telerobotic system. The method can help improve the performance of the system including efficiency and safety. It is also implemented on a mobile manipulator and the experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the designed method.
