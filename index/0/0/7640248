Collecting the data required for quality prediction within a development team is time-consuming and expensive. An alternative to make predictions using data that crosses from other projects or even other companies. We show that with/without relevancy filtering, imported data performs the same/worse (respectively) than using local data. Therefore, we recommend the use of relevancy filtering whenever generating estimates using data from another project.
