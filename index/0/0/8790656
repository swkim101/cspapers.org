Loss-load curves are a recently proposed feedback mechanism for rate-based congestion control in datagram computer networks. In the loss-load model, packet loss inside the network is a direct function of sender transmission rates, and senders choose their own transmission rate based on the loss-load tradeoff curve provided by the network. Earlier work [1] has provided the mathematical basis for the loss-load model and provided preliminary simulation results demonstrating its responsiveness, fairness, and stability. The loss-load model works Well for simple network environments where each source has a large number of packets to transmit, and wishes to maximize raw throughput.
