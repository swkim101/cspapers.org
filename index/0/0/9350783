A "s t ruc tura l descript ion" for two-dimensional black and white patterns is defined as the set of contour l ines for an appropriate function which f i ts the binary pat tern. These contour lines are mutually nonintersecting closed polygonal curves with edges in only eight different directions and they represent the bound足 ar ies between connected black and white areas of the pattern. Rigorous procedures are described to t rans足 fo rm a "mat r i x pat tern" into a "st ructura l descr ipt ion" and vice versa. Advantages of this method for descr ib足 ing patterns previous to pattern recognition are d is 足 cussed at some length.
