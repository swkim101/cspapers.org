An important recent technological development in computer science is the availability of highly distributed and scalable systems to process Big Data, i.e., datasets with high volume, velocity and variety. Given the extensive and effective use of systems incorporating Big Data in many application scenarios, these systems have become a key component in the broad landscape of database systems. This fact creates the need to integrate the study of Big Data Management Systems as part of the computing curricula. This paper presents well-structured guidelines to perform this integration by describing the important types of Big Data systems and demonstrating how each type of system can be integrated into the curriculum. A key contribution of this paper is the description of an array of course resources, e.g., virtual machines, sample projects, and in-class exercises, and how these resources support the learning outcomes and enable a hands-on experience with Big Data technologies.
