This paper proposes a scheme for improving the throughput of multi-programming systems. The basis of the proposal is the collection of a suitable set of measures of total system performance as well as corresponding per-process measures. Two types of control over system performances are suggested: (1) dynamic tuning of allocation policies to reflect the total system load, and (2) adjustment of the mix of processes competing for system resources in such a way as to keep the system within the range over which its allocation policies function properly.This work was supported in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency at the Office of the Secretary of Defense (F 44620-67-C-0058) and is maintained by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.
