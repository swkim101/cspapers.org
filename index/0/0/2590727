This paper presents outlines to express the matchmg between complex objects, using works done in the Information Retrieval field. The basic idea is to help an application programmer to describe theorcticatly the matching using modal logic, and then to express the operational matching. We describe here these two parts using a medical information retrieval example. We are implementing our work on the 02 system [1].
