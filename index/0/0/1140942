When software components evolve, they change interfaces. Members that are obsolete are marked as deprecated and new members are added. We deal with the problem of migration from deprecated members to their replacement. We implemented two tools: Java Source Code Update Tool, which updates the source code based on a configuration file, and a generator, which heuristically figures out how to migrate from deprecated members and generates the configuration file. We evaluated these tools on five open source projects and the results are very encouraging.
