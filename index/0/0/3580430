Enrollments in Computer Science classes have been increasing at an exponential rate in many colleges and universities, which has resulted in a rapid increase in class size especially for the Introduction to Programming classes. The Spinoza system was developed as a way to add active learning to very large CS1 classes taught in Python. The main goals were to keep all students actively involved in learning how to code and how to debug. The key innovation of Spinoza is the Solve-Then-Debug activity in which students first solve a problem by getting their code to pass a suite of unit tests and then they debug the most common incorrect attempts of their classmates. The instructor has access to a wide variety of tools for viewing performance of the class and the individual students in real-time. In this demo, we will show you how to use Spinoza in your own classes. In particular, we show how to create a class, create a problem, and how to monitor the progress of the students in both the solving and the crowdsourced debugging phase, and how to use the other orchestration features to effectively explore the concepts exposed by that problem.
