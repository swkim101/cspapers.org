This paper presents a new configuration for single axis tactile sensor arrays molded in rubber to enable tri-axial force measurement. The configuration requires the sensing axis of each sensor in the array to be rotated out of alignment with respect to external forces. This angled sensor array measures shear forces along axes in a way that is different to a planar sensor array. Three sensors using the angled configuration (22.5째, 45째 and 67.5째) and a fourth sensor using the planar configuration (0째) have been fabricated for experimental comparison. Artificial neural networks were trained to interpret the external force applied along each axis (X, Y and Z) from raw pressure sensor values. The results show that the angled sensor configuration is capable of measuring tri-axial external forces with a root mean squared error of 1.79N, less error in comparison to the equivalent sensor utilizing the planar configuration (4.52N). The sensors are then implemented to control a robotic arm. Preliminary findings show angled sensor arrays to be a viable alternative to planar sensor arrays for shear force measurement; this has wide applications in physical Human Robot Interaction (pHRI).
