In this paper, we intend to demonstrate a novel system to measure the high-speed vibration of an anonymous vibrating object using COTS camera and optical strobing. The whole process is unobtrusive and frugal, can be used in machine inspection. The camera used has a frame rate of 30 frames per second (fps), so in conventional fashion, it is incapable to detain significant information about any vibration frequency which is not in the range of Nyquist theory of frequency (within a range of ±15 Hz). We have solved the challenge using optical strobing phenomena for capturing modulo (of division) between object's frequency and strobing frequency using camera. Motion in the video is tracked by conventional image processing technique. Finally, object vibration is calculated from the frequency plot and optical strobing frequency. Under most of the cases, the application estimates vibration frequency values, within a range of ±1.5% of error.
