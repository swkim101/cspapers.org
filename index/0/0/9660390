Publicly available map services are widely used by humans for navigation and nowadays provide almost complete road network data. When utilizing such maps for autonomous navigation with mobile robots one is faced with the problem of inaccuracies of the map and the uncertainty about the position of the robot relative to the map. In this paper, we present a probabilistic approach to autonomous robot navigation using data from OpenStreetMap that associates tracks from Open-StreeetMap with the trails detected by the robot based on its 3D-LiDAR data. It combines semantic terrain information, derived from the 3D-LiDAR data, with a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo technique to match the tracks from OpenStreetMap with the sensor data. This enables our robot to utilize OpenStreetMap for navigation planning and to still stay on the trails during the execution of these plans. We present the results of extensive experiments carried out in real world settings that demonstrate the robustness of our system regarding the alignment of the vehicle pose relative to the OpenStreetMap data.
