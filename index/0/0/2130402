This paper addresses the impedance control problem for flexible joint manipulators. An impedance controller structure is proposed, which is based on an exact decoupling of the torque dynamics from the link dynamics. A formal stability analysis of the proposed controller is presented for the general tracking case. Preliminary experimental results are given for a single flexible joint.
