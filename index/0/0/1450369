We propose a method to gradually expand the moves to consider at the nodes of game search trees. The algorithm is an extension of Abstract Proof Search, an algorithm that solves more problem than basic Alpha-Beta search in less time and which is more reliable. Unlike other related algorithms, iterative winding adapts to the game via genearal game definition functions. In the game of Go, it can solve more problems than the original non windening algorithm in approximately half of the time, as shown by the experimental results.
