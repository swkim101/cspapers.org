This paper presents some such results for various families of L languages without interactions (see, e.g., [2] or [9]). We have chosen to investigate L languages (without interactions) because: (i) they are physically well motivated, see, e.g., [5], (ii) L systems may very well be algebraically the most natural way to define languages, see, e.g., [1],[7] and [10], (iii) they contribute to our understanding of the essential differences between sequential and parallel string processing (rewriting), see, e.g. [2], [4], [8] and [11]. In this paper we investigate the families of ET0L and E0L languages and their deterministic subfamilies. After each theorem we present an example of a language that can be proved, using the theorem, to be not in the given family of languages.
