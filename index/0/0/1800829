The compliance of muscles with external forces and the structural stability given by biarticular muscles are important features of animals to realize dynamic whole body motions such as running and hopping in various environments. For this reason, we have been studying an electromagnetic linear actuator. This actuator can emulate the behavior of a human muscle such as the spring-damper characteristics by quick control of the output force (i.e. impedance control) and it is expected to be used as an artificial muscle. In this paper, we develop a monopedal robot possessing bi- and mono-articular muscles implemented by linear actuators. Thanks to the biarticular muscle, the bouncing direction of the robot can be controlled by changing the stiffness ellipse at the endpoint (i.e. foot) of the robot. We confirm that the bouncing direction of the robot can be controlled and hopping can be achieved by changing the stiffness ellipse.
