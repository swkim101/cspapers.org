We present a computational framework and experimental setup for deployment of autonomous cars in a miniature Robotic Urban-Like Environment (RULE). The specifications are given in rich, human-like language as temporal logic statements about roads, intersections, and parking spaces. We use transition systems to model the motion and sensing capabilities of the robots and the topology of the environment and use tools resembling model checking to generate robot control strategies and to verify the correctness of the solution. The experimental setup is based on Khepera III robots, which move autonomously on streets while observing traffic rules.
