This paper presents a method for feedback stabilization of nonholonomic systems with drift by using their ability to track their own extended systems, which can be made asymptotically stable. The method is tested on a rigid body model with two torque actuators which is an example of nonholonomic systems with drift. The method presents time varying feedback control laws based on the construction of stabilizing feedback control laws for the extended system. This approach does not necessitate conversion of the system model into a "chained form", and thus does not rely on any special transformation techniques.
