We present a deterministic distributed algorithm that computes a (2&#x03B4;-1)-edge-coloring, or even list-edge-coloring, in any n-node graph with maximum degree &#x03B4;, in O(log^8 &#x03B4; &#x22C5; log n) rounds. This answers one of the long-standing open questions of distributed graph algorithms} from the late 1980s, which asked for a polylogarithmic-time algorithm. See, e.g., Open Problem 4 in the Distributed Graph Coloring book of Barenboim and Elkin. The previous best round complexities were 2^{O(&#x221A;{log n})} by Panconesi and Srinivasan [STOC92] and &#x00D5;(&#x221A;{&#x03B4;}) + O(log^* n) by Fraigniaud, Heinrich, and Kosowski [FOCS16]. A corollary of our deterministic list-edge-coloring also improves the randomized complexity of (2&#x03B4;-1)-edge-coloring to poly(loglog n) rounds.The key technical ingredient is a deterministic distributed algorithm for hypergraph maximal matching, which we believe will be of interest beyond this result. In any hypergraph of rank r &#x2014; where each hyperedge has at most r vertices &#x2014; with n nodes and maximum degree &#x03B4;, this algorithm computes a maximal matching in O(r^5 log^{6+log r } &#x03B4; &#x22C5; log n) rounds.This hypergraph matching algorithm and its extensions also lead to a number of other results. In particular, we obtain a polylogarithmic-time deterministic distributed maximal independent set (MIS) algorithm for graphs with bounded neighborhood independence, hence answering Open Problem 5 of Barenboim and Elkins book, a \big((log &#x03B4;/&#x03B5;)^{O(log 1/&#x03B5;)}\big)-round deterministic algorithm for (1+&#x03B5;)-approximation of maximum matching, and a quasi-polylogarithmic-time deterministic distributed algorithm for orienting &#x03BB;-arboricity graphs with out-degree at most \lceil (1+&#x03B5;)&#x03BB; \rceil, for any constant &#x03B5; 0, hence partially answering Open Problem 10 of Barenboim and Elkins book.
