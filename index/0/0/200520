We describe an algorithm for a novel task: disambiguating the pronoun you in conversation. You can be generic or referential; finding referential you is important for tasks such as addressee identification or extracting 'owners' of action items. Our classifier achieves 84% accuracy in two-person conversations; an initial study shows promising performance even on more complex multi-party meetings.
