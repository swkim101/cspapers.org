We consider the problem of query rewrites in the context of pay-per-click search advertising. Given a three-layer graph consisting of queries, query rewrites, and the corresponding ads that can be served for the rewrites, we formulate a family of graph covering problems whose goals are to suggest a subset of ads with the maximum benefit by suggesting rewrites for a given query. We obtain constant-factor approximation algorithms for these covering problems, under two versions of constraints and a realistic notion of ad benefit. We perform experiments on real data and show that our algorithms are capable of outperforming a competitive baseline algorithm in terms of the benefit of the rewrites.
