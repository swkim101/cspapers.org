This paper presents a symbolic method to detect short and open circuit faults in switch-level networks. Detection and fault sensitization vector determination are possible since the behavior of each node is described by a set of two functions: the on-set and the off-set functions. Their analyses provide designers with an efficient tool for circuit verification and test pattern generation.
