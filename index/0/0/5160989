When translating into a morphologically complex language, segmenting the target language can reduce data sparsity, while introducing the complication of desegmenting the system output. We present a method for decoder-integrated desegmentation, allowing features that consider the desegmented target, such as a word-level language model, to be considered throughout the entire search space. Our re-sults on a large-scale, English to Arabic translation task show signiÔ¨Åcant improvement over the 1-best desegmentation baseline.
