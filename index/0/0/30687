A wide variety of approximation algorithms for permanents of non-negative matrices has been proposed and analyzed before [5; 7; 9; 1]. Usually, these approximation algorithms have been presented for 0-1 matrices and i t has been remarked that they extend to other matrices as long as all entries are non-negative. Here we present the first approximation algorithm for the permanent of an arbi trary complex matrix. We extend the notion of an (e,6)-approximation algorithm to accommodate for cancellations in additions. Our running t ime is 0(3n/2e -2 log 1/6) compared to 0(2n/2e -2 log 1/6) for nonnegative matrices. (A faster algorithm is known for 0-1 matrices [6].)
