Online unsupervised spike sorting or clustering is an integral component of implantable closed-loop brain-computer-interface systems. Robust clustering performance against various non-idealities such as poor initialization and order-of-arrival of inputs are desirable while meeting the minimal area and power requirements for implants. We explore an online and unsupervised spike-sorting algorithm utilizing a low-overhead feature screening process that improves feature discriminability in the use of sub-optimal features for reducing hardware complexity. Based on the algorithm, an accelerator architecture that performs feature screening and clustering is devised and implemented in a 65-nm high-VTH CMOS, largely improving clustering accuracy even with poor clustering initialization. In the post-layout static timing and power simulation, the power consumption and the area of the accelerator are found to be 2.17 μW/ch and 0.052 μm2/ch, respectively, which are 53% and 25% smaller than the previous designs, while achieving the required throughput of 420 sorting/s at the supply voltage of 300mV.
