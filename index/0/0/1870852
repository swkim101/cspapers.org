Branch instructions form a significant fraction of executed instructions, and their design is thus a crucial component of any architecture. This paper examines three alternatives in the design of branch instructions: delayed vs. non-delayed branches, one- vs. two-instruction branches, and the use or non-use of condition codes. Simulation and analytical techniques are used to provide quantitative comparisons between these choices.
