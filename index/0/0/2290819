We describe how project management and team communication skills are taught and practiced in two experiences. Our CS III course provides a formal introduction and practice in homogenous small group settings. Our new multidisciplinary yearlong video game course provides extensive practice of these skills through the development of a single deliverable (a video game) produced by a large team (an entire class of approximately 20 students). This model can be extended to other institutions very easily.
