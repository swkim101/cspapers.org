We are currently investigating the creation of an didactic environment for the teaching of a programming language to approximately 1500 students each year. At this effect we are constructing a robust and perspicious system : VISION & CAN & PHENARETE (GREUSSAY 1977, GOOSSENS 1977, WERTZ 1976), a system designed to help the individual apprentice in the process of deveÂ­ loping, writing and debugging programs.
