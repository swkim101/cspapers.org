The demand for computer science education on the college campus is rapidly increasing. This is due to the ever expanding market for computer expertise in industry, government, and academia. The growth in the need for off-campus computer science instruction is also phenomenal. Professionals in areas other than computer science—engineering, business, etc.—need to acquire computing skills. Computer scientists need to continually keep pace with the rapidly evolving computer technology. This training must be available at sites remote from the college campus. In the era of overall decreasing college enrollments, computer science educators are being requested to service this off-campus market.
 Traditional forms of providing education to this market include faculty or student travel, remote campuses, live video, and audio teleconferencing systems. Each has either high cost, an ineffectiveness, and/or inconvenience factors. It is the purpose of this panel to explore the electronic remote education. The particular systems to be discussed are the “electronic blackboard,” controlled scan TV, computer teleconferencing and computer-based color-graphics technologies. The first two systems are in use and the latter two are proposed. Ted Lewis will describe experience with the electronic blackboard and Stuart Meyer will describe the use of the controlled scan TV. Ron Clarke and William Hankley will describe the proposed usage of the computer teleconferencing and color graphics, respectively, in the remote classroom. Each of these panelists will briefly describe the particular system and address the areas of teaching technique and effectiveness within the specific technology.
 Following the formal presentations, there will be an open discussion of the issues presented. For those people who cannot attend the panel discussion, a very short bibliography on electronic education and teleconferencing is included.
