This fill-day tutorial outlines the principles and methods of the PSP, including exercises that demonstrate how some of the methods are used. The PSP is a process-based method that software engineers can use to apply process definition and measurement principles to their personal tasks. Through a structured sequence of processes and exercises, engineers learn how to estimate, plan, and track software tasks and how to improve the quality of the products they produce. The data on PSP introduction at several universities and corporations show that engineers significantly improve the quality of their work, learn how to plan their projects, and improve their productivity. Average quality improvements of five to ten times are normal, as are productivity improvements of 25% of more. The principal audience for this tutorial is practicing sofhvare engineers and technical managers.
