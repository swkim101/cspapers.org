Current Web technology has enabled the distribution of informative content through dynamic media platforms.
 In addition, the availability of the same content in the form of digital multimedia data has dramatically increased.
 Content-based, cross-media retrieval applications are needed to efficiently access desired information from this variety of data sources. This paper presents a novel approach for cross-media information aggregation, and describes a prototype system implementing this approach. The prototype adopts online newspaper articles and TV newscasts as information sources, to deliver a service made up of items including both contributions. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a real-world business context.
