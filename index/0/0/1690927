There has been a recent interest in understanding text to perform mathematical reasoning. In particular, most of these efforts have focussed on automatically solving school level math word problems. In order to make advancements in this area accessible to people, as well as to facilitate this line of research, we release the ILLINOIS MATH SOLVER, a web based tool that supports performing mathematical reasoning. ILLINOIS MATH SOLVER can answer a wide range of mathematics questions, ranging from compositional operation questions like “What is the result when 6 is divided by the sum of 7 and 5 ?” to elementary school level math word problems, like “I bought 6 apples. I ate 3 of them. How many do I have left ?”. The web based demo can be used as a tutoring tool for elementary school students, since it not only outputs the final result, but also the mathematical expression to compute it. The tool will allow researchers to understand the capabilities and limitations of a state of the art arithmetic problem solver, and also enable crowd based data acquisition for mathematical reasoning. The system is currently online at https://cogcomp.cs.illinois. edu/page/demo_view/Math.
