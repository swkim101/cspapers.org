This paper concerns the energy optimization of systems with interacting robots. Pseudo spectral optimal control is used to collocate the continuous time dynamics of each robot. The resulting model is a multi stage, multi robot, trajectory planning problem with timing constraints. In the case of a given task sequence, the mathematical formulation is that of a Nonlinear Programming problem. We present two example problems where three 3-DoF robots work together. For the case the problem consists of undetermined sequences, we outline an algorithm which integrates Operations Research methods with those of Constraint Programming.
