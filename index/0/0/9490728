The more successful reso lu t i on programs today owe t h e i r power in part to e f f i c i e n t r e t r i e v a l mechanisms fo r re tu rn ing l i t e r a l s that are p o t e n t i a l l y u n i f i a h l e w i th or subsumed by a given l i t e r a l . For example, the e f f i c i e n t subsumption algor i thms and the hack demodulation of [2 ] are based on one such scheme, the FPA l i s t s . We propose a new technique that can be used to locate "compat ib le" l i t e r a l s fo r r e s o l u t i o n , subsumption, e tc . This new scheme has some advantages (and disadvantages) r e l a t i v e to FPA l i s t s .
