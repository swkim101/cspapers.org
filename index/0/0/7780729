Recently a number of studies have demonstrated that search engine logfiles are an important resource to determine the relevance relation between URLs and query terms. We hypothesized that the queries associated with a URL could also be presented as useful URL metadata in a search engine result list, e.g. for helping to determine the semantic category of a URL. We evaluated this hypothesis by a classification experiment based on the DMOZ dataset. Our method can also annotate URLs that have no associated queries.
