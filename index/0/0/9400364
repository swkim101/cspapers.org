VUIMS is an object-oriented user interface management system that was designed to support reconfigurable components. VUIMS consists of a collection of objects and a semantically rich token language. The objects implement primitive presentation and interaction functions. The token language controls interaction and visual style. High level objects can be created from primitive objects using token templates. The user interface and application are controlled by token streams that are emitted in response to user actions. VUIMS supports a variety of presentation and interaction styles through simple, robust manipulation of a hierarchy of visual panels with a rich set of relationships and constraints. VUIMS has been used to implement two commercial highperformance computer graphics applications and an on-line help system. It has evolved over a three-year period and has proven to be an effective tool in commercial use.
