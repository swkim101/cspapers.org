The paper deals with a number of problems involved In planning a robot's activity. A formalized statement of the planning problem Is proposed and the theoretical principles of design and requirements to structure of the problem environment models and planning algorithms are discussed. A problem environment model is conoelved as a set of interrelated data on the real world of a robot's functioning that are necessary and sufficient for the solution of all problems belonging to a certain class. Algorithm is understood as a generalised procedure defined on a problem environment model.
