Reliability to soft errors is an increasingly important issue as technology continues to shrink. In this paper, we show that applications exhibit different reliability characteristics on big, high-performance cores versus small, power-efficient cores, and that there is significant opportunity to improve system reliability through reliability-aware scheduling on heterogeneous multicore processors. We monitor the reliability characteristics of all running applications, and dynamically schedule applications to the different core types in a heterogeneous multicore to maximize system reliability. Reliability-aware scheduling improves reliability by 25.4% on average (and up to 60.2%) compared to performance-optimized scheduling on a heterogeneous multicore processor with two big cores and two small cores, while de-grading performance by 6.3% only. We also introduce a novel system-level reliability metric for multiprogram workloads on (heterogeneous) multicores. We further show that our reliability-aware scheduler is robust across core count, number of big and small cores, and their frequency settings. The hardware cost in support of our reliability-aware scheduler is limited to 296 bytes per core.
