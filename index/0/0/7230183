Current statistical machine translation (SMT) systems are trained on sentence-aligned and word-aligned parallel text collected from various sources. Translation model parameters are estimated from the word alignments, and the quality of the translations on a given test set depends on the parameter estimates. There are at least two factors affecting the parameter estimation: domain match and training data quality. This paper describes a novel approach for automatically detecting and down-weighing certain parts of the training corpus by assigning a weight to each sentence in the training bitext so as to optimize a discriminative objective function on a designated tuning set. This way, the proposed method can limit the negative effects of low quality training data, and can adapt the translation model to the domain of interest. It is shown that such discriminative corpus weights can provide significant improvements in Arabic-English translation on various conditions, using a state-of-the-art SMT system.
