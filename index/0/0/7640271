Data dissemination from sources to sinks is one of the main functions in sensor networks. In this paper, we propose SEAD, a Scalable Energy-efficient Asynchronous Dissemination protocol, to minimize energy consumption in both building the dissemination tree and disseminating data to mobile sinks. SEAD considers the distance and the packet traffic rate among nodes to create near-optimal dissemination trees. The sinks can move without reporting their location to the tree while receiving data updates successfully. Our evaluation results illustrate that SEAD consumes less energy on building and maintaining a dissemination tree to multiple mobile sinks compared to other approaches such as directed diffusion, TTDD, and mobile ad hoc multicast.
