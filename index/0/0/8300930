Video in digital format played on programmable devices presents opportunities for significantly enhancing the user's viewing experience. For example, time compression and pause removal can shorten the viewing time for a video, textual and visual indices can allow personalized navigation through the content, and random-access digital storage allows instantaneous seeks into the content. To understand user behavior when such capabilities are available, we built a software video browsing application that combines many such features. We present results from a user study where users browsed video in six different categories: classroom lectures, conference presentations, entertainment shows, news, sports, and travel. Our results show that the most frequently used features were time compression, pause removal, and navigation using shot boundaries. Also, the behavior was different depending on the content type, and we present a classification. Finally, the users found the browser to be very useful. Two main reasons were: i) the ability to save time and ii) the feeling of control over what content they watched.
