We present a method which exploits automatically generated scientific discourse annotations to create a content model for the summarisation of scientific articles. Full papers are first automatically annotated using the CoreSC scheme, which captures 11 contentbased concepts such as Hypothesis, Result, Conclusion etc at the sentence level. A content model which follows the sequence of CoreSC categories observed in abstracts is used to provide the skeleton of the summary, making a distinction between dependent and independent categories. Summary creation is also guided by the distribution of CoreSC categories found in the full articles, in order to adequately represent the article content. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the summaries by evaluating them in a complex question answering task. Results are very encouraging as summaries of papers from automatically obtained CoreSCs enable experts to answer 66% of complex content-related questions designed on the basis of paper abstracts. The questions were answered with a precision of 75%, where the upper bound for human summaries (abstracts) was 95%.
