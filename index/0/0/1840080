Language modeling is to associate a sequence of words with a priori probability, which is a key part of many natural language applications such as speech recognition and statistical machine translation. In this paper, we present a language modeling based on a kind of simple dependency grammar. The grammar consists of head-dependent relations between words and can be learned automatically from a raw corpus using the reestimation algorithm which is also introduced in this paper. Our experiments show that the proposed model performs better than n-gram models at 11% to 11.5% reductions in test corpus entropy.
