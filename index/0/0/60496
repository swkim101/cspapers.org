We show how to test the bipartiteness of an intersection graph of n line segments or simple polygons in the plane, or of balls in Rd, in time O(n log n). More generally we find subquadratic algorithms for connectivity and bipartiteness testing of intersection graphs of a broad class of geometric objects. For unit balls in Rd, connectivity testing has equivalent randomized complexity to construction of Euclidean minimum spanning trees, and for line segments in the plane connectivity testing has the same lower bounds as Hopcroft's problem; therefore, for these problems, connectivity is unlikely to be solved as efficiently as bipartiteness. For line segments or planar disks, testing k-colorability of intersection graphs for k > 2 is NP-complete.
