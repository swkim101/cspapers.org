In many vision based tasks, the ability to focus attention on the important portions of a scene is crucial for good performance on the tasks. In this paper we present a simple method of achieving spatial selective attention through the use of a saliency map. The saliency map indicates which regions of the input retina are important for performing the task. The saliency map is created through predictive auto-encoding. The performance of this method is demonstrated on two simple tasks which have multiple very strong distracting features in the input retina. Architectural extensions and application directions for this model are presented.
