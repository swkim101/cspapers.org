JiPANG (A Jini-based Portal Augmenting Grids) is a portal system and a toolkit which provides uniform access interface layer to a variety of Grid systems, and is built on top of Jini distributed object technology. JiPANG performs uniform higher-level management of the computing services and resources being managed by individual Grid systems such as Ninf, NetSolve, Globus, etc. In order to give the user a uniform interface to the Grids JiPANG provides a set of simple Java APIs called the JiPANG Toolkits, and furthermore, allows the user to interact with Grid systems, again in a uniform way, using the JiPANG Browser application. With JiPANG, users need not install any client packages before-hand to interact with Grid systems, nor be concerned about updating to the latest version. Such uniform, transparent services available in a ubiquitous manner we believe is essential for the success of Grid as a viable computing platform for the next generation.
