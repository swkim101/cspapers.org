Research on grammatical error correction has received considerable attention. For dealing with all types of errors, grammatical error correction methods that employ statistical machine translation (SMT) have been proposed in recent years. An SMT system generates candidates with scores for all candidates and selects the sentence with the highest score as the correction result. However, the 1-best result of an SMT system is not always the best result. Thus, we propose a reranking approach for grammatical error correction. The reranking approach is used to re-score N-best results of the SMT and reorder the results. Our experiments show that our reranking system using parts of speech and syntactic features improves performance and achieves state-of-theart quality, with an F0.5 score of 40.0.
