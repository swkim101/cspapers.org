In traffic monitoring, accounting, and network anomaly detection, it is often important to be able to detect high-volume traffic clusters in near real-time. Such heavy-hitter traffic clusters are often hierarchical (<i>ie</i>, they may occur at different aggregation levels like ranges of IP addresses) and possibly multidimensional (<i>ie</i>, they may involve the combination of different IP header fields like IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol). Without prior knowledge about the precise structures of such traffic clusters, a naive approach would require the monitoring system to examine all possible ombinations of aggregates in order to detect the heavy hitters, which can be proohibitive in terms of computation resources.
 In this paper, we focus on online identification of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional hierarchical heavy hitters (HHHs), arguably the two most important scenarios in traffic analysis. We show that the problem of HHH detection can be transformed to one of dynamic packet classification by taking a top-down approach and adaptively creating new rules to match HHHs. We then adapt several existing static packet classification algorithms to support dynamic packet classification. The resulting HHH detection algorithms have much lower worst-case update costs than existing algorithms and can provide tunable deterministic accuracy guarantees. As an application of these algorithms, we also propose robust techniques to detect changes among heavy-hitter traffic clusters. Our techniques can accommodate variability due to sampling that is increasingly used in network measurement. Evaluation based on real Internet traces collected at a Tier-1 ISP suggests that these techniques are remarkably accurate and efficient.
