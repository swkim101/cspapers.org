A store of characteristic patterns of features is a fundamental requirement for pattern recognition. This store may be compiled either by intu i t ion or by mathematical analysis of representative patterns. T he precision of the mathematical method is considerably enhanced by statistical analysis of numerous representative patterns. This statistical method is employed in the BSM character recognition system. T he system is not only a reader, but also forms part of a statistical pattern analysator in order to create opt imal read only stores of representative pattern features.
