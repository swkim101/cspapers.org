Unsupervised learning methods often involve summarizing the data using a small number of parameters. In certain domains, only a small subset of the available data is relevant for the problem. One-Class Classification or One-Class Clustering attempts to find a useful subset by locating a dense region in the data. In particular, a recently proposed algorithm called One-Class Information Ball (OC-IB) shows the advantage of modeling a small set of highly coherent points as opposed to pruning outliers. We present several modifications to OC-IB and integrate it with a global search that results in several improvements such as deterministic results, optimality guarantees, control over cluster size and extension to other cost functions. Empirical studies yield significantly better results on various real and artificial data.
