Background activities on smartphones are essential to today's "always-on" mobile device experience. Yet, there lacks a clear understanding of the cooperative behaviors among background activities as well as a quantification of the consequences. In this paper, we present the first in-depth study of app collusion, in which one app surreptitiously launches others in the background without user's awareness. To enable the study, we develop AppHolmes, a static analysis tool for detecting app collusion by examining the app binaries. By analyzing 10,000 apps from top third-party app markets, we found that i) covert, cooperative behaviors in background app launch are surprisingly pervasive, ii) most collusion is caused by shared services, libraries, or common interest among apps, and iii) collusion has serious impact on performance, efficiency, and security. Overall, our work presents a strong implication on future mobile system design.
