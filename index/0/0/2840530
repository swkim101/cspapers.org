A new neural network, the Binary Diamond, is presented and its use as a classifier is demonstrated and evaluated. The network is of the feed-forward type. It learns from examples in the 'one shot' mode, and recruits new neurons as needed. It was tested on the problem of pixel classification, and performed well. Possible applications of the network in associative memories are outlined.
