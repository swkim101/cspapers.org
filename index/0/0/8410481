This is an intermediate and advanced debugging tutorial focusing on ways to solve memory bugs in parallel and distributed applications. Memory problems such as heap memory leaks and array bounds violations can be challenging to track down in serial environments, and the challenges can be even more vexing when involving an MPI program running in a cluster environment. Tutorial participants will learn how to use Etnus TotalView to debug memory problems in both serial and parallel applications. In the process, they will learn to take advantage of heap error reporting, pointer annotation, and various report views through an interactive debugging session designed to track down memory problems. The tutorial with also focus on the use of heap status information -- to track down specific processes within large MPI applications for further scrutiny, and heap comparison features -- to make quick comparisons.
