The purpose of this paper Is to tntroducx the use of incremental concept formation algorithms in a multi database schema mtegratmrt. W’e have developed a Data Base Schema Integration \fodel (DBSI\l) which uses our e~tended version of the Incremental concept formation algorithms to produce concept hierarchies and a conceot dlctionan that are used with semantic data modehrrg 10 produce a federated schema. We have extended two of the Incremental concept formation algorithms (COBW’t3? and EX-Wf3B) to build concept hierarchies and a concept dlchonag. DBSI\f uses these concept hierarchies and concept dictionary to integrate local data base schemas (in the form of a semantic data model) mto a federatecf semantic data model 1. Background Review A heterogeneous DDBS or multidatabase supports an integrated view of mult lple preexistl ng databases. Interoperabiht y among heterogeneous databases is an active academic and commercial research area and is predicted to be even more lmpcn-tant m the future [1, 2, 6, 9, 10] Semantic [nte.gmtion, m a heterogeneous DEt\lS, 1s the process of discovering and represenhng the semantic relationships among prec-ilstlng databases. An Important goat of schema integration is to provide a means of resoivlng lncomlstencles without phj slcallymodlfylng or consolidatrtrg these databases. In recent years. the semantic data model has gained a lot of atterrtlon, SD\f pro! ides a foundatlorr for database schema lntegratiorr SD\f has :1} en us addltlona] capabilities to understand more about the data, Its components, and their relatmnships and can acl as a common model to Imk other data models Currently, the process of schema integration is done manually b) DB.\s and experts from different sites.

Incremental Concept Formation Models Given a set of observations, humans acquire concepts that orgamze those observations and use them in classifying future eqrenences This type of concept formation can occur in the absence of a tutor and it can take place despite irrelevant and incomplete information [4] \Iost of the incremental concept formation algorithms share features such as the hierarchical organizahon of concepts, top-down classification, unsupervised learning, and mcremental hdlchmbmg approach Some of Ihe major models are, C“XI\lEll [11], CC)BWEB [31, CL.-\SS1T [4], and EX-LJ’EB & PROf3-R’EB [7] EY-}J”lZI and PROB-WEB are two extensions of C[)BJYEB EX-tVI:tl evaluahon is based on Farruly Resemblance (FR) [8] The FR score M added to each concept node .\ nelt lnsertlon to a given category class wdl happen If’ the msertlon results m the greatest increase In the ovemll fW score The onglnal (WBII’EB dld not use Famil} Resemblance scores Simdarity is identified based on the value of attributes that are the same as compared to those that arc dlffe rent 3. Brief Overview of DBSIM \Ve have approached the mulhdatabase Schema Integrator problem by using Semantic Data ilodehng (SD\f) as a genenc interface bet~veen different local dalabase schemas participating ]rr the integrahon process. DBSI\f M dlvidcd Into four phases In phase one, the SD\l was used as a generic Interface. The SDM provided a common em Ironment to analyze and e},aluate the local database schemas The preexisting database schemas were converted Into scmantlc data models The SDM acted as a common model to h nk primary data models together Converted locaf schemas, or LSDMS, were processed Into the concept formalion and inte.gratton models to produce the federated SIXI (FSD\l) In phase two, local SD\Is (In the form of Machinery.
