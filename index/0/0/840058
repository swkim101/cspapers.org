Compared to traditional media, computer illustration software offers superior editing power at the cost of reduced freedom in the picture construction process. To reduce this discrepancy, we propose an extension to the classical paradigm of 2D layered drawing, the map paradigm, that is conducive to a more natural drawing technique. We present the key concepts on which the new paradigm is based: a) graphical objects, called planar maps, that describe shapes with multiple colors and contours; b) a drawing technique, called map sketching, that allows the iterative construction of arbitrarily complex objects. We also discuss user interface design issues in map based illustration software.
