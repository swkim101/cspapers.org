This paper introduces a new design approach that combines logic and layout synthesis for Cellular-Architecture (CA) FPGAs. The comprehensive design method starts from a Boolean function, specified as SOP or ESOP, and produces a rectangularly-shaped multi-level structure of (mostly) locally connected cells. This two-dimensional array of logic cells is well suited for CA-type FPGA realization. Two stages: restricted factorization and technology folding are discussed in more details. The architecture constraints and the implementation are presented for ATMEL6000 series architecture.
