One cannot understand computer hacking without delving into the history of computer science but is the converse true? In this talk, I examine zones of collaboration as well as points of tension between the fields of computer science/engineering and computer hacking. By drawing on my anthropological research on hackers and turning to a set of cases around voting machines vulnerabilities, the Unix operating system, cryptography, and the Bit Torrent protocol, this talk suggests that while the object and practices around computers help account for a range of important similarities, the differences end there. Significant cultural differences and institutional constraints account for distinct moral and even technical trajectories evident in these two domains. I end reflecting on a slice of the important differences to asses what computer science may have to offer hacking and what hacking may have to offer the field of computer science.
