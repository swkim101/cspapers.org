In this paper we explore human-computer interaction for carving, building upon our previous work with the FreeD digital sculpting device. We contribute a new tool design (FreeD V2), with a novel set of interaction techniques for the fabrication of static models: personalized tool paths, manual overriding, and physical merging of virtual models. We also present techniques for fabricating dynamic models, which may be altered directly or parametrically during fabrication. We demonstrate a semi-autonomous operation and evaluate the performance of the tool. We end by discussing synergistic cooperation between human and machine to ensure accuracy while preserving the expressiveness of manual practice.
