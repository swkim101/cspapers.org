The variable stiffness actuation concept is considered to provide a human-friendly robot technology. This paper examines a joint concept called the bidirectional antagonistic joint which is a extension of antagonistic joints. A new operating mode called the helping mode is introduced, which increases the joint load range. Although the joint can not be pretensioned in the helping mode, it is shown that a stiffness variation is possible, assuming a suitable torque-stiffness characteristic of the elastic elements. A methodology to design such characteristics is presented along with several example cases interpreted in a torque-stiffness plot. Furthermore, a stiffness adaptation control scheme which ensures mechanism safety is described. Finally, the design methodology and the control are evaluated on an implementation of a bidirectional antagonistic joint.
