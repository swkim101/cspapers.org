We consider the problem of verifying the identity of a distribution: Given the description of a distribution over a discrete support p = (p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ... , p<sub>n</sub>), how many samples (independent draws) must one obtain from an unknown distribution, q, to distinguish, with high probability, the case that p = q from the case that the total variation distance (L<sub>1</sub> distance) ||p - q||1≥ ϵ? We resolve this question, up to constant factors, on an instance by instance basis: there exist universal constants c, c' and a function f(p, ϵ) on distributions and error parameters, such that our tester distinguishes p = q from ||p-q||1≥ ϵ using f(p, ϵ) samples with success probability > 2/3, but no tester can distinguish p = q from ||p - q||1≥ c · ϵ when given c' · f(p, ϵ) samples. The function f(p, ϵ) is upperbounded by a multiple of ||p||2/3/ϵ<sup>2</sup>, but is more complicated, and is significantly smaller in some cases when p has many small domain elements, or a single large one. This result significantly generalizes and tightens previous results: since distributions of support at most n have L<sub>2/3</sub> norm bounded by √n, this result immediately shows that for such distributions, O(√n/ϵ<sup>2</sup>) samples suffice, tightening the previous bound of O(√npolylog/n<sup>4</sup>) for this class of distributions, and matching the (tight) known results for the case that p is the uniform distribution over support n. The analysis of our very simple testing algorithm involves several hairy inequalities. To facilitate this analysis, we give a complete characterization of a general class of inequalities- generalizing Cauchy-Schwarz, Holder's inequality, and the monotonicity of L<sub>p</sub> norms. Specifically, we characterize the set of sequences (a)<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>1</sub>, . . . , ar, (b)i = b<sub>1</sub>, . . . , br, (c)i = c<sub>1</sub>, ... , cr, for which it holds that for all finite sequences of positive numbers (x)<sub>j</sub> = x<sub>1</sub>,... and (y)<sub>j</sub> = y<sub>1</sub>,...,Π<sub>i=1</sub><sup>r</sup> (Σ<sub>j</sub>x<sup>a</sup><sub>j</sub><sup>i</sup><sub>y</sub><sub>i</sub><sup>b</sup><sup>i</sup>)<sup>ci</sup>≥1. For example, the standard Cauchy-Schwarz inequality corresponds to the sequences a = (1, 0, 1/2), b = (0,1, 1/2), c = (1/2 , 1/2 , -1). Our characterization is of a non-traditional nature in that it uses linear programming to compute a derivation that may otherwise have to be sought throu.gh trial and error, by hand. We do not believe such a characterization has appeared in the literature, and hope its computational nature will be useful to others, and facilitate analyses like the one here.
