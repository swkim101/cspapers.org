The offline parsable grammars apparently have enough formal power to describe human language, yet the parsing problem for these grammars is solvable. Unfortunately they exclude grammars that use x-bar theory - and these grammars have strong linguistic justification. We define a more general class of unification grammars, which admits x-bar grammars while preserving the desirable properties of offline parsable grammars.
