Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) software supports a wide variety of domains including nuclear physics, crash simulation, satellite data processing, fluid dynamics, climate modeling, bioinformatics, and vehicle development. The increases importance of CSE software motivates the need to identify and understand appropriate software engineering (SE) practices for CSE. Because of the uniqueness of the CSE domain, existing SE tools and techniques developed for the business/IT community are often not efficient or effective. Appropriate SE solutions must account for the salient characteristics of the CSE development environment. SE community members must interact with CSE community members to understand this domain and to identify effective SE practices tailored to CSE's needs. This workshop facilitates that collaboration by bringing together members of the CSE and SE communities to share perspectives and present findings from research and practice relevant to CSE software and CSE SE education. A significant portion of the workshop is devoted to focused interaction among the participants with the goal of generating a research agenda to improve tools, techniques, and experimental methods for CSE software engineering.
