The goal of this study is to develop a mechanical system which display elastic characteristic like stiffness on the surface of human body aiming at applying to palpation simulator. Pneumatic parallel manipulator is employed as a driving mechanism, consequently, it brings capability of minute force displaying property owing to the air compressibility. Compliance control system without using force/moment sensor is constructed by introducing a disturbance observer and a compliance display scheme is proposed. The validity of the proposed scheme is verified experimentally.
