APIs are one of the most important concepts in today's modern software engineering. They allow software developers to work independently and minimize the impact caused by changes in the implementation of software services. Despite their importance, currently there are only a few approaches that guide the design of an API. In this paper, we present an approach, and associated tool, that allows an API client (developer) to evaluate the usability of an API and decide whether to use it (release it). In this aspect, our approach goes beyond previous approaches by performing this complexity and usability API analysis automatically.
