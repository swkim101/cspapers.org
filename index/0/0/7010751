In this paper, a multi-stream paradigm is proposed to improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in the presence of highly interfering car noise. It was found that combining the classical MFCCs with some auditory-based acoustic distinctive cues and the main formant frequencies of a speech signal using a multi-stream paradigm leads to an improvement in the recognition performance in noisy car environments.
