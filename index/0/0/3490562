There is value in instructors guiding students through complex programming problems. An instructor can describe how they start a program, decide what to do next, recover from poor problem solving choices, and check their work. Worked examples give students an inside look at an expert/s mental model and show how an expert approaches a problem. Live coding demonstrations of complex problems can be difficult for instructors to do well, however. This demonstration will show a tool that allows programmers to guide an audience through the evolution of some code without requiring a live performance. The open source tool, Storyteller (https://github.com/markm208/storyteller), integrates with a popular text editor to record all file editing and file operations so that they can be replayed in an animated, annotated playback. Instructors can replay their work to reflect on it. They can insert comments (text, drawings, screenshots, and audio) to describe their code and to explain the reasons why certain decisions were made. These comments are linked not only to a place in the code but to a point in time during the evolution of the code. The comments are recorded and are visible in future playbacks of the code. The author of a playback can create a narrative describing how and why their code is changing. These can be used by instructors to provide worked examples for their students. The demonstration will show some example playbacks and how they were used in class along with how to create and share playbacks with the tool.
