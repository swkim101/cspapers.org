Recently, social network services such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn have been remarkably growing. There are various studies about social networks analysis. Haewoon Kwak performed the analysis of the Twitter network on 2009 and shows the degree of separation. However, the number of users on 2009 is about 41.7 million, the graph scale is not very large compared with the current graph. In this paper, we conduct a Twitter network analysis in terms growth by region, scale-free, reciprocity, degree of separation and diameter using Twitter user data with 469.9 million users and 28.7 billion relationships. We report that the value of degree of separation is 4.59 in current Twitter network through our experiments.
