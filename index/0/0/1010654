Statistical language models have been proposed recently for several information retrieval tasks, including the resource selection task in distributed information retrieval. This paper extends the language modeling approach to integrate resource selection, ad-hoc searching, and merging of results from different text databases into a single probabilistic retrieval model. This new approach is designed primarily for Intranet environments, where it is reasonable to assume that resource providers are relatively homogeneous and can adopt the same kind of search engine. Experiments demonstrate that this new, integrated approach is at least as effective as the prior state-of-the-art in distributed IR.
