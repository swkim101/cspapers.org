Computer programs are usually written with the illusion that they will run on something like a random access machine (RAM) [AHU74], with a large memory, all locations of which are equally fast. In practice, this is far from the truth. In large machines, for example, the range of speeds from the fastest memory (registers at about Ions) to the slowest (disks or mass store at IOms or seconds) can bc a factor of a million or even a billion! Machine dcsigncrs attempt IO smooth out this range. to the ~‘xtcnt lhat is technologically feasible, by providing many levels of memory in hctwccn. ‘l’hcsc memory levels m;ry includes one or Iwo lcvcls of c:rThc. main memory, cxpandcd slow , :IIKI drums.
