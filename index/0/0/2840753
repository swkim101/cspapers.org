Few concepts embody the goals of artificial intelligence as well as fully autonomous robots. Countless films and stories have been made that focus on a future filled with autonomous agents that complete menial tasks or run errands that humans do not want or are too busy to carry out. One such task is driving automobiles. In this paper, we summarize the work we have dune towards a future of fully-autonomous vehicles, specifically coordinating such vehicles safely and efficiently at intersections. We then discuss the implications this work has for other areas of AI, including planning, multiagent learning, and computer vision.
