Community-based Question Answering sites, such as Yahoo! Answers or Baidu Zhidao, allow users to get answers to complex, detailed and personal questions from other users. However, since answering a question depends on the ability and willingness of users to address the asker's needs, a significant fraction of the questions remain unanswered. We measured that in Yahoo! Answers, this fraction represents 15% of all incoming English questions. At the same time, we discovered that around 25% of questions in certain categories are recurrent, at least at the question-title level, over a period of one year. We attempt to reduce the rate of unanswered questions in Yahoo! Answers by reusing the large repository of past resolved questions, openly available on the site. More specifically, we estimate the probability whether certain new questions can be satisfactorily answered by a best answer from the past, using a statistical model specifically trained for this task. We leverage concepts and methods from query-performance prediction and natural language processing in order to extract a wide range of features for our model. The key challenge here is to achieve a level of quality similar to the one provided by the best human answerers. We evaluated our algorithm on offline data extracted from Yahoo! Answers, but more interestingly, also on online data by using three "live" answering robots that automatically provide past answers to new questions when a certain degree of confidence is reached. We report the success rate of these robots in three active Yahoo! Answers categories in terms of both accuracy, coverage and askers' satisfaction. This work presents a first attempt, to the best of our knowledge, of automatic question answering to questions of social nature, by reusing past answers of high quality.
