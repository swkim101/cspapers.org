This workshop introduces software architecture concepts and their incorporation into computer science and software engineering curricula. Participants will learn techniques used in industry to specify quality attributes critical to architecture and use those attributes to drive the system structure using common architectural styles. Exercises will demonstrate these techniques and explore pedagogical uses of the techniques in CS and SE classes. Sample computer science curricula with courses that integrate workshop material will be presented. Presenters will lead a brainstorming session to help participants develop practical methods for using the material in their courses. Participants will become part of a community of educators sharing educational resources in software architecture.
