The accuracy and completeness of a digital map plays a critical role in determining the quality of most location-based services. Unfortunately, road networks change frequently. Consequently, we study the issue of automatic map update in this paper. We propose a system called COBWEB which takes all the unmatched trajectories as input and generates the missing road segments with both the geometry properties and topology features well preserved. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study via real trajectory data generated by roughly 15,000 taxis in Singapore within a 5-month period. Compared with existing work, COBWEB demonstrates a better and more stable performance and a stronger resilience to various sampling rates and data sizes.
