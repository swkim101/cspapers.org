Anafora is a newly-developed open source web-based text annotation tool built to be lightweight, flexible, easy to use and capable of annotating with a variety of schemas, simple and complex. Anafora allows secure web-based annotation of any plaintext file with both spanned (e.g. named entity or markable) and relation annotations, as well as adjudication for both types of annotation. Anafora offers automatic set assignment and progress-tracking, centralized and human-editable XML annotation schemas, and file-based storage and organization of data in a human-readable single-file XML format.
