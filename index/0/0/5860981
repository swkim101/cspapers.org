We give a new randomized algorithm for enumerating all possible embeddings of a metric space (i.e., the distances between every pair within a set of <i>n</i> points) into <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> Cartesian space preserving their <i>l</i><inf>∞</inf> (or <i>l</i><inf>1</inf>) metric distances. Our expected time is O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> log<sup>3</sup> <i>n</i>) (i.e. within a poly-log of the size of the input) beating the previous O(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>) algorithm. In contrast, we prove that detecting <i>l</i><sup>3</sup><inf>∞</inf> embeddings is NP-complete. The problem is also NP-complete within <i>l</i><sup>2</sup><inf>1</inf> or <i>l</i><sup>2</sup><inf>∞</inf> with the added constraint that the locations of two of the points are given or alternatively that the two dimension are curved into a 3-dimensional sphere. We also refute a compaction theorem by giving a metric space that cannot be embedded in <i>l</i><sup>3</sup><inf>∞</inf>, however, can be if even one point is removed.
