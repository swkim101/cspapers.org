We present a new modeling technique for analyzing the impact of substrate-coupled switching noise in CMOS mixed-signal circuits. Lumped element RC substrate macromodels are efficiently generated from layout using Voronoi tessellation. The models retain the accuracy of previously proposed models, but contain orders of magnitude fewer circuit nodes, and are suitable for analyzing large-scale circuits. The modeling strategy has been verified using detailed device simulation, and applied to some mixed-A/D circuit examples.
