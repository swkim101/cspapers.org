DiCE is a system for online testing of federated and heterogeneous distributed systems. We have built a prototype of DiCE and integrated it with an open-source BGP router. DiCE quickly detects three important classes of faults, resulting from configuration mistakes, policy conflicts and programming errors. The goal of this demo is to showcase our DiCE prototype while it executes an experiment that involves exploring BGP system behavior in a topology with 27 BGP routers and Internet-like conditions (Figure 1).
