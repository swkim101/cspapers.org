My dissertation is primarily focused on providing computational approaches to study and analyze dialectical reasoning in large-scale online platforms. In particular, I aim to tackle the challenge of developing novel models to automatically classify explanation and argumentation as two different types of reasoning in text of discourse on the Web. The resulting models can be incorporated in the social Web environments to increase participants' awareness of others' reasoning types, which may lead to a more effective dialogue protocol and strategy.
