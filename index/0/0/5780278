The OO7 Benchmark was first published in 1993, and has since found a home in the marketing literature of various object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) vendors. The OO7 Benchmark (as published) was the initial result of an ongoing OODBMS performance evaluation effort at the University of Wisconsin. This paper provides an update on the status of the effort on two fronts: single-user and multi-user. On the single-user front, we review and critique the design of the initial OO7 Benchmark. We discuss some of its faults, the reasons for those faults, and things that might be done to correct them. On the multi-user front, we describe our current work on the development of a multi-user benchmark for OODBMSs. This effort includes changes and extensions to the OO7 database and the design of a family of interesting multi-user workloads.
