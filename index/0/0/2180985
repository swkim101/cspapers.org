Admission control and overload management techniques are central to the design and implementation of real-time database systems. We motivate the need for these mechanisms and present protocols for adding such capabilities to real-time databases. In particular, we present a novel admission control paradigm, we describe a number of admission control strategies and contrast (through simulations) their relative performance.
