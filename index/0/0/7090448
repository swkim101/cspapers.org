This paper revisits the static term-based pruning technique presented in Carmel et al., SIGIR 2001 for ad-hoc retrieval, addressing different issues concerning its algorithmic design not yet taken into account. Although the original technique is able to retain precision when a considerable part of the inverted file is removed, we show that it is possible to improve precision in some scenarios if some key design features are properly selected.
