1 SUMMARY Researcher Practitioner Partnerships (RPP) are "long-term, mutualistic collaborations between practitioners and researchers that are intentionally organized to investigate problems of practice and solutions for improving district [and school] outcomes." [1] As highlighted in NSF solicitation NSF 17-525, RPPs are critical for the success of CS For All initiatives aimed at providing all Kâ€“12 students access to CS education. The panelists represent three examples of mature RPPs that have successfully implemented CS4All programs in three states working with school districts with different characteristics and at different scales. The projects share similar approaches to the goal of increasing equity in CS education by providing all high school students access to a rigorous and relevant CS course. All projects chose to focus on the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) Curriculum and Professional Development. While the specifics of the implementation vary, the projects encountered similar challenges especially when transitioning from a pilot stage to igniting systemic change across the region. Challenges vary in importance and scale across a wide range of issues including: teacher capacity building, fidelity of implementation, leadership structure and buyin, personnel turnover and continuity of funding.
