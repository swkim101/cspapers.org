Can one assess, by visiting only a small portion of a graph, if a given node has a significantly higher PageRank score than another? We show that the answer strongly depends on the interplay between the required correctness guarantees (is one willing to accept a small probability of error?) and the graph exploration model (can one only visit parents and children of already visited nodes?).
