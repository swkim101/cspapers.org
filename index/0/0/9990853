Security verification relies on using direct tests manually prepared. Test preparation often requires intensive efforts from experts with in-depth domain knowledge. This work presents an approach to learn from direct tests written by an expert. After the learning, the learned model acts as a surrogate for the expert to produce new tests. The learning software comprises a database for accumulating and sharing security verification knowledge. The learning approach uses process discovery to build an upper-bound model and continuously adds constraints to refine it. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the learning approach in a commercial SoC verification environment.
