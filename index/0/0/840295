A database is viewed as a collection or data objects which can be read or written by concurrent transactions. Interleaving of updates can leave the database in an inconsistent state. A sufficient condition to guarantee consistency of the databme is seriolizobilify of the actions (reads or writes) performed by the transactions on the data items, that is, the interleaved execution of the transaction should be equivalent to some serial execution of the the transactions [1,2,7]. Here we will assume serializability as the criterion of correctness.
