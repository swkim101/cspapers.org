The introduction of the 157-nm wavelength for next-generation optical lithography has created a need for new soft (polymeric) or hard (quartz) pellicle materials optimized for that wavelength. The design and development of ultratransparent fluoropolymers suitable for 157-nm soft-pellicle applications has produced several promising candidate materials with absorbances 95%. In order to successfully fabricate 157-nm pellicles from these fluoropolymer materials, the materials must have the appropriate molecular weight, glass transition temperature, and mechanical strength and toughness so that thin polymer films can be spin coated, lifted, and adhesively mounted on pellicle frames.
