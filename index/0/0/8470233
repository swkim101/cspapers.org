The purpose of the work described in this paper is to achieve dynamic manipulation of a sheet-like flexible object. As one example, we examine dynamic folding of a cloth with two high-speed multifingered hands mounted on two sliders. First, dynamic folding by a human subject is analyzed in order to extract the necessary motions for realizing this task. Second, a model of a sheet-like flexible object is proposed by extending a linear flexible object model (algebraic equation) that takes advantage of high-speed robot motion. Third, motion planning of the robot system is performed by using the proposed model, and the simulation results are shown. Finally, an experiment was conducted with the robot motion obtained by the simulation.
