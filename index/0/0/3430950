With the proliferation of XML data and applications on the Internet, efficient XML query processing techniques are in great demand. Answering queries using XML indexes is a natural approach. A number of XML indexes have been proposed in the literature: among them, FB the result is a disk-based F&B Index with good clustering properties. In addition, novel query processing algorithms exploiting the physical organization of the disk-based F&B Indexes are proposed. Experimental results verify that our disk-based F&B Index can scale up for large data size with good query performance compared with state-of-the-art XML query processing algorithms.
