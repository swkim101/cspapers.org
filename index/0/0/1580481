Scalability is a widely-used term in scientific papers, technical magazines and software descriptions. Its use in the most varied contexts contribute to a general confusion about what the term really means. This lack of consensus is a potential source of problems, as assumptions are made in the face of a scalability claim. A clearer and widely-accepted understanding of scalability is required to restore the usefulness of the term. This research investigates commonly found definitions of scalability and attempts to capture its essence in a systematic framework. Its expected contribution is in assisting software developers to reason, characterize, communicate and adjust the scalability of software systems.
