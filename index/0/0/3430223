As programmers, we like to think of software as the product of our intelligent design, carefully crafted to meet well-specified goals. In reality, software evolves inadvertently through the actions of many individual programmers, often leading to unanticipated consequences. Large complex software systems are subject to constraints similar to those faced by evolving biological systems, and we have much to gain by viewing software through the lens of evolutionary biology. The talk will highlight recent research that applies the mechanisms of evolution quite directly to the problem of repairing software bugs.
