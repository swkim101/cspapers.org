In this paper we describe how information extraction technology has been used to build a summarisation system in the domain of occupational health and safety. The core of the application is based on named entity recognition using pattern-action semantic grammar rules. Co-occurrence of the named entities is used as a criteria to identify the sentences to be included in the summary. The system is developed and automatically evaluated within the GATE framework, and can easily be extended or ported to new domains.
