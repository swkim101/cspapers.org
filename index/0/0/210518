In the last year deep learning has gone from being a special purpose machine learning technique used mainly for image and speech recognition, to becoming a general purpose machine learning tool. This has broad implications for all organizations that rely on data analysis. It represents the latest development in a general trend towards more automated algorithms, and away from domain specific knowledge. For organizations that rely on domain expertise for their competitive advantage, this trend could be extremely disruptive. For start-ups interested in entering established markets, this trend could be a major opportunity. This talk will be a non-technical introduction to general-purpose deep learning, and its potential business impact.
