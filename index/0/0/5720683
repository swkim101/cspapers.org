DC analysis, as a foundation for the simulation of many electronic circuits, is concerned with locating DC operating points. In this paper, a new and efficient algorithm to find all DC operating points is proposed for transistor circuits. The novelty of this DC operating points finder is its two-level simple implementation based on the affine arithmetic preconditioning and interval contraction method. Compared to traditional methods such as homotopy, this finder offers a dramatically faster way of computing all roots, without sacrificing any accuracy. Explicit numerical examples and comparative analysis are given to demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach.
