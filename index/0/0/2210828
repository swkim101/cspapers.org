We present a method to recover complete 3D models of articulated objects. Structure-from-motion techniques are used to capture 3D point cloud models of the object in two different configurations. A novel combination of Procrustes analysis and RANSAC facilitates a straightforward geometric approach to recovering the joint axes, as well as classifying them automatically as either revolute or prismatic. With the resulting articulated model, a robotic system is able to manipulate the object along its joint axes at a specified grasp point in order to exercise its degrees of freedom. Because the models capture all sides of the object, they are occluded-aware, enabling the robotic system to plan paths to parts of the object that are not visible in the current view. Our algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the object, nor does it make any assumptions about the planarity of the object or scene. Experiments with a PUMA 500 robotic arm demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a variety of objects with both revolute and prismatic joints.
