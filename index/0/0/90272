Dynamic Programming (DP) is an important class of algorithms widely used in many areas of speech and language processing. It provides efficient solutions to seemingly intractable inference over exponentially-large spaces by sharing overlapping subproblems. Well-known examples of DP in our field include Viterbi and Forward-Backward Algorithms for finite-state models, CKY and Earley Algorithms for context-free parsing, and A* Algorithm for both. These algorithms are widely used to solve problems ranging from sequence labeling to word alignment to machine translation decoding.
