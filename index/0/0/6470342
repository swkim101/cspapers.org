An improved version of IRACQ (for Interpretation Rule ACQuisition) is presented. Our approach to semantic knowledge acquisition: 1) is in the context of a general purpose NL interface rather than one that accesses only databases, 2) employs a knowledge representation formalism with limited inferencing capabilities, 3) assumes a trained person but not an Al expert, and 4) provides a complete environment for not only acquiring semantic knowledge, but also maintaining and editing it in a consistent knowledge base. IRACQ is currently in use at the Naval Ocean Systems Center.
