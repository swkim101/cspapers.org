The programming language B has been designed for personal computing. In B, variables need not be declared, nor formal parameters specified. Nevertheless, B is strongly typed. All type requirements can be checked statically. To signal type violations on the spot during editing, the computations can be organized so that local the source text require a modest amount of recomputation.
