Characterising the differences between two databases is an often occurring problem in Data Mining. Detection of change over time is a prime example, comparing databases from two branches is another one. The key problem is to discover the patterns that describe the difference. Emerging patterns provide only a partial answer to this question.
 In previous work, we showed that the data distribution can be captured in a pattern-based model using compression [12]. Here, we extend this approach to define a generic dissimilarity measure on databases. Moreover, we show that this approach can identify those patterns that characterise the differences between two distributions.
 Experimental results show that our method provides a well-founded way to independently measure database dissimilarity that allows for thorough inspection of the actual differences. This illustrates the use of our approach in real world data mining.
