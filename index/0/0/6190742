The coordination ratio is a game theoretic measure that aims to reflect the price of selfish routing in a network. We show the worst-case coordination ratio on m parallel links (of possibly different speeds) isÎ˜(log m/log log log m)Our bound is asymptotically tight and it entirely resolves an question posed recently by Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [3].
