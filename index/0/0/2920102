Groupware development has been characterized by many exciting breakthroughs, and we are finally beginning to see these innovations replicated by research and commercial outfits. Yet groupware replicated is tedious and painful, and great efforts are spent re-inventing the wheel. Part of the problem is the paucity of tools specifically supporting groupware development. To this end, we are constructing GROUPKIT, a groupware toolkit that provides the building blocks common to a variety of real-time distributed conferencing systems.
