Differential privacy enables organizations to collect acc urate aggregates over sensitive data with strong, rigorous guarantees on individuals’ privacy. Previous work has found that under differ ential privacy, computing multiple correlated aggregates as a bat ch, using an appropriatestrategy, may yield higher accuracy than computing each of them independently. However, finding the optimal str tegy that maximizes result accuracy is non-trivial, as it involv es solving a complex constrained optimization program that appear s to be non-linear and non-convex. Hence, in the past much effort ha s been devoted in solving this non-convex optimization program. E xisting approaches include various sophisticated heuristics and e xpensive numerical solutions. None of them, however, guarantees to fi nd the optimal strategy. This paper points out that under ( ǫ, δ)-differential privacy, the optimal strategy for answering an arbitrary batch of linear aggregate queries can be found, rather surprisingly, by solving a simple and elegant convex optimization program. Then, we propose a n efficient algorithm based on Newton’s method, which we prove t always converge to the optimal solution with linear global c onvergence rate and quadratic local convergence rate. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the propo sed solution.
