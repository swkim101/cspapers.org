The classical problem of efficiently listing all the simple cycles in a graph has been studied since the early 70s. For a graph with n vertices and m edges, containing η cycles, the most efficient solution was presented by Johnson [SIAM J. Computing, 1975] and takes O((η + 1)(m + n)) time. This solution is not optimal for undirected graphs: nevertheless, no theoretical improvements have been proposed in the past decades. 
 
We present the first optimal solution to list all the simple cycles in an undirected graph G. Specifically, let C(G) denote the set of all these cycles (|C(G)| = η). For a cycle c e C(G), let |c| denote the number of edges in c. Our algorithm requires
