This paper presents a whole body teleoperation system for a humanoid robot integrating operator's intention and the robot's autonomy. Instead of giving command to all the joints of the body, we have been proposing a switching command based teleoperation system of which the operator selects only the necessary points of the robot's body to manipulate depending on the required tasks. We have also proposed a whole body motion generation method, which satisfies both, and the desired movement of specific points of the robot's body and the robot's balance constraint. This paper first explains the concept of the proposed teleoperation system and the autonomous functions for maintaining balance and expanding the reachable area of a humanoid robot. Then the paper reports on the experimental results using the proposed methods to teleoperate a real humanoid robot HRP-1S to perform balanced whole body motions satisfying operator's input command.
