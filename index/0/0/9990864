The starting place for professional ethics is with the idea that certain occupational groups have special expertise that leads to special responsibilities. The organization of the group into a profession with an organization that controls admission and promulgates a code of ethics is a mechanism for ensuring that the special expertise of members is deployed in ways that benefit the public (consumers, users, non-experts) or, at least, does not harm the public.
