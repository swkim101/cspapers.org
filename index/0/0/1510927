This paper summarizes a long-term project to install and maintain socially interactive, autonomous mobile robots in public spaces. We have deployed four robots over the past five years, accumulating a total operational time exceeding seven years. This document introduces the robots, then focuses on lessons learned from each deployment. Finally, this paper describes how this entire project came to a close, offering a cautionary tale for those who wish to embark on such an effort in the future.
