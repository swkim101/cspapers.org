The challenges that instructors face attempting to motivate novice programming students are amplified when the students are not pursuing degrees or careers in computer science. For the programming module of our course for non-computer science majors we assigned a video game programming deliverable that we expected would engage students and enhance their experiences. After extensive analyses of the survey responses of 245 enrolled students we were surprised to learn that, although the majority believed the game programming experience enhanced their learning overall, another majority reported that the project itself was not enjoyable. Through qualitative analysis we have identified several key areas that seem to have detracted from the overall level of enjoyment, and in this paper we follow this investigation with discussion surrounding how these issues could be remedied in the future. These recommended strategies will bolster student enjoyment and motivation in future offerings and we believe this discussion will prove very useful to other instructors planning to employ game programming components.
