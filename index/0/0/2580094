As China's largest cloud service provider, Alibaba Cloud has been one of the fastest growing cloud computing platforms in the world. In this talk, I-ll present an overview of Big Data and AI computing platform at Alibaba Cloud, which consists of a wide range of products and services to enable fast and efficient big data development and intelligent analysis. The underlying computing infrastructure supports a variety of computation scenarios, including batch, interactive, stream, and graph computation, as well as large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous cloud-scale data centers. Several big data products, such as rule-based engine, recommendation system, BI tools, etc., are provided to address different business needs. The platform not only supports Alibaba's internal businesses but also provides solid services to enterprise customers. In addition, I'll describe key techniques and system internals, and outline outstanding research and engineering challenges.
