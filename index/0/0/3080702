In this paper we present a logical framework for defining consistent axiomatizations of planning domains. A language to define basic actions and structured plans is embedded in a logic. This allows general properties of a whole planning scenario to be proved as well as plans to be formed deductively. In particular, frame assertions and domain constraints as invariants of the basic actions can be formulated and proved. Even for complex plans most frame assertions are obtained by purely syntactic analysis. In such cases the formal proof can be generated in a uniform way. The formalism we introduce is especially useful when treating recursive plans. 
A tactical theorem prover, the Karlsruhe Interactive Verifier KIV is used to implement this logical framework.
