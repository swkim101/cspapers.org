Peer-to-peer systems have emerged as a robust, scalable and decentralized way to share and publish data. In this paper, we propose P-Ring, a new P2P index structure that supports both equality and range queries. P-Ring is fault-tolerant, provides logarithmic search performance even for highly skewed data distributions and efficiently supports large sets of data items per peer. We experimentally evaluate P-Ring using both simulations and a real distributed deployment on PlanetLab, and we compare its performance with Skip Graphs, Online Balancing and Chord.
