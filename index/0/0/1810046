The key contribution of this paper is the first general model which can be used to predict the running time of transport sweeps on orthogonal grids for any regular mapping of the grid cells to processors. Our model, which accounts for machine dependent parameters such as computation cost and communication latency, can be used to analyze and compare the effects of various spatial decompositions on the running time of the transport sweep. Insight obtained from the model yields two significant contributions to the theory of optimal transport sweeps on orthogonal grids. First, our model provides a theoretical basis which explains why, and under what circumstances, the column decomposition of the current standard KBA algorithm is superior to the 'balanced' decomposition obtained by classic domain decomposition techniques. Second, our model enables us to identify a new decomposition, we call Hybrid, which proves to be almost as good as, and sometimes superior to, the current standard KBA method. Our analysis covers sweeps in two- and three-dimensional spatial domains, and first considers sweeps in only one direction, and then sweeps involving multiple simultaneous directions. We obtain expressions for the completion time and discuss theoretical results.
