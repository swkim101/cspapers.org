Word embeddings – distributed representations of words – in deep learning are beneﬁcial for many tasks in NLP. However, different embedding sets vary greatly in quality and characteristics of the captured information. Instead of relying on a more advanced algorithm for embedding learning, this paper proposes an ensemble approach of combining different public embedding sets with the aim of learning metaembeddings . Experiments on word similarity and analogy tasks and on part-of-speech tagging show better performance of metaembeddings compared to individual embedding sets. One advantage of metaembeddings is the increased vocabulary coverage. We release our metaembeddings publicly at http:// cistern.cis.lmu.de/meta-emb .
