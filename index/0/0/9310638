The goal of this paper is to improve wireless AP caching by leveraging in-network caching. We observe that by treating routers as an in-network storage extension, we can relieve the storage limitation of APs. The unique challenge is that APs and routers cannot have a full collaboration, which makes the problem different from traditional cooperative caching problems. We study how APs can optimize caching decisions by using in-network caching information without controlling routers.
