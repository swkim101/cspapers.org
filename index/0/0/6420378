An efficient method is presented for implementing mobile robot 'perceptionaction' behaviors, based on time-varing potential field. The major contributions in this paper are that the concept of dynamic potential U(x,y,z,t) is proposed to achieve the control scheme, the scheme is successfully implemented on THMR-II mobile robot for avoiding obstacle, wandering, following road, moving to subgoal, etc., and the drawbacks of known potential field methods are solved by the composition of behavior controls. A lot experimental results based on sonar and vision signal are given to show that the method has better real-time response, adaptability and robust in dynamic environments.
