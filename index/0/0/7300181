The HR program forms concepts and makes conjectures in domains of pure mathematics and uses theorem prover OTTER and model generator MACE to prove or disprove the conjectures. HR measures properties of concepts and assesses the theorems and proofs involving them to estimate the interestingness of each concept and employ a best first search. This approach has led HR to the discovery of interesting new mathematics and enables it to build theories from just the axioms of finite algebras.
