Evolution of cooperation in the metanorms game proposed by Axelrod is well known but some papers pointed out that the evolution emerges only in the relative narrow parameter space. We examine its realized conditions carefully in the metanorms game and search conditions for existing stable cooperation. As a result of analyzing our model, we show that maintaining variety is a key point of evolution of cooperation. Moreover, we investigate that the stability of cooperation emerges robustly in the relative wide parameter space when a few defectors are always existing in the society. 1. はじめに
