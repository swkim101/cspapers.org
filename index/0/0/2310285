There has been recent interest in the problem of decoding letter substitution ciphers using techniques inspired by natural language processing. We consider a different type of classical encoding scheme known as the running key cipher, and propose a search solution using Gibbs sampling with a word language model. We evaluate our method on synthetic cipher-texts of different lengths, and find that it outperforms previous work that employs Viterbi decoding with character-based models.
