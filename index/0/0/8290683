A biological neuron can be viewed as a device that maps a multidimensional temporal event signal (dendritic postsynaptic activations) into a unidimensional temporal event signal (action potentials). We have designed a network, the Spatio-Temporal Event Mapping (STEM) architecture, which can learn to perform this mapping for arbitrary biophysical models of neurons. Such a network appropriately trained, called a STEM cell, can be used in place of a conventional compartmental model in simulations where only the transfer function is important, such as network simulations. The STEM cell offers advantages over compartmental models in terms of computational efficiency, analytical tractability, and as a framework for VLSI implementations of biological neurons.
