In this work, we investigate the use of directional antennas and beam steering techniques to improve performance of 802.11 links in the context of communication between amoving vehicle and roadside APs. To this end, we develop a framework called MobiSteer that provides practical approaches to perform beam steering. MobiSteer can operate in two modes - cached mode - where it uses prior radiosurvey data collected during "idle" drives, and online mode, where it uses probing. The goal is to select the best AP and beam combination at each point along the drive given the available information, so that the throughput can be maximized. For the cached mode, an optimal algorithm for AP and beam selection is developed that factors in all overheads.
 We provide extensive experimental results using a commercially available eight element phased-array antenna. In the experiments, we use controlled scenarios with our own APs, in two different multipath environments, as well as in situ scenarios, where we use APs already deployed in an urban region - to demonstrate the performance advantage of using MobiSteer over using an equivalent omni-directional antenna. We show that MobiSteer improves the connectivity duration as well as PHY-layer data rate due to better SNR provisioning. In particular, MobiSteer improves the throughput in the controlled experiments by a factor of 2 - 4. In in situ experiments, it improves the connectivity duration by more than a factor of 2 and average SNR by about 15 dB.
