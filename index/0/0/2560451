In this paper we present an approach for teaching the Freshman-Sophomore introduction to data structures course (CS2) in a way that provides an introduction to object-oriented software engineering patterns in addition to the theory of data structures. We survey in this paper several design patterns and describe how they can be naturally integrated in the CS2 curriculum.
