Micro-blogging services provide platforms for users to share their feelings and ideas on the go. Desiging to produce information stream in almost Micro-blogging services, although are capable of recording rich and diverse senses, still suffer from a drawback of not being able to provide deeper and summarized views. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Pusic, to musicalize micro-blogging messages for terms or users. Pusic can be used to (1) summarize users' messages into certain expression of emotions, (2) explore the emotions and senses and transform them into music, and (3) serve as a presentation of crowd net art. We generate the music from two aspects: emotion and harmony. The former is tackled by emotion detection from messages while the latter is estabilished by rule-based harmonic heuristics according to the detected emotions. Pusic has been announced online for people's experience and further investigation.
