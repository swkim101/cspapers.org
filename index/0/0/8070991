Voting trees describe an iterative procedure for selecting a single vertex from a tournament. They provide a very general abstract model of decision‚Äêmaking among a group of individuals, and it has therefore been studied which voting rules have a tree that implements them, i.e., chooses according to the rule for every tournament. While partial results concerning implementable rules and necessary conditions for implementability have been obtained over the past 40 years, a complete characterization of voting rules implementable by trees has proven surprisingly hard to find. A prominent rule that cannot be implemented by trees is the Copeland rule, which singles out vertices with maximum degree.
