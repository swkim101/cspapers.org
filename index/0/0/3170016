We present software tools that support robust input processing and comprehensive testing in Java. The software includes the JPT library that supports error-checked typed input via console or GUI for all primitive types. This provides a robust encapsulation of typical interactive input requests encountered in introductory programming courses.The Java Power Framework and its extension allow the user to develop a comprehensive test suite independent of the target classes. The type-safe input framework allows us to implement an external iterator interface for several types of input data sources, including the console, a GUI, a file, and an internal data structure. Student's programs that implement various algorithms can then process data independently of its source: running tests on existing data structures; creating inputs interactively; or running stress tests and timing tests on large input files.
