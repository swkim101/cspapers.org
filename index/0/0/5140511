Nevertheless, significant progress has been made on learning-based coreference research since its inception two decades ago. This paper provides an overview of the major milestones made in learning-based coreference research and discusses a hard entity coreference task, the Winograd Schema Challenge, which has recently received a lot of attention in the AI community.
