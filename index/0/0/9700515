The snakeboard is a well-studied example for mechanical systems analysis, largely because of its simultaneous richness in behavior and simplicity in design. However, few snakeboard models incorporate dissipative friction in the traveling direction and skidding as a violation of the rigid nonholonomic constraints. In this paper we investigate these effects on trajectory planning by evaluating a previously proposed friction model as well as a novel skidding model based on the addition of Rayleigh dissipation functions. We show how these additions change the usual behavior of gaits in the forward planning problem, and incorporate the changes into the solutions of the inverse planning problem by utilizing body coordinates along with a curvature parameterization for trajectories.
