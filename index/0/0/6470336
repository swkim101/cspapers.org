MyCS (Middle-years Computer Science) is a one-semester CS curriculum that engages middle schoolers in computational skill-building. Scratch programming serves as a touchstone throughout the eighteen-week syllabus. Students punctuate that foundation with hands-on activities leveraged from excellent resources such as Exploring Computer Science, CS Principles, webdev tools, and CS unplugged. Over twenty classrooms and 700 students participated in MyCS's pilot years within the Pomona, CA and Lihue, HI school districts; 2013-15 will see an NSF-supported expansion of its summer workshops, academic-year classes, and program evaluation. This poster highlights our experiences developing MyCS, deploying it widely, and soliciting feedback on students' evolving computational identities.
