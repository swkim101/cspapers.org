Oblivious routing algorithms for general undirected networks were introduced by Räcke [17], and this work has led to many subsequent improvements and applications. Comparatively little is known about oblivious routing in general <i>directed</i> networks, or even in undirected networks with node capacities.We present the first non-trivial upper bounds for both these cases, providing algorithms for <i>k</i>-commodity oblivious routing problems with competitive ratio <i>O</i>(√<i>k</i>log(<i>n</i>)) for undirected node-capacitated graphs and <i>O</i>(√<i>kn</i><sup>1/4</sup>log(<i>n</i>)) for directed graphs. In the special case that all commodities have a common source or sink, our upper bound becomes <i>O</i>(√<i>n</i>log(<i>n</i>)) in both cases, matching the lower bound up to a factor of log(<i>n</i>). The lower bound (which first appeared in [6]) is obtained on a graph with very high degree. We show that in fact the degree of a graph is a crucial parameter for node-capacitated oblivious routing in undirected graphs, by providing an <i>O</i>( polylog(<i>n</i>))competitive oblivious routing scheme for graphs of degree. For the directed case, however, we show that the lower bound of Ω(√<i>n</i>) still holds in low-degree graphs.Finally, we settle an open question about routing problems in which all commodities share a common source or sink. We show that even in this simplified scenario there are networks in which no oblivious routing algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than Ω(log <i>n</i>).
