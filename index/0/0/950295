The goal of the MobileDeli 2015 workshop is to establish a vibrant research community of researchers and practitioners for sharing work and leading further research and development in the area of mobile software engineering. At the workshop, we will discuss how other technologies (e.g., DSLs, cloud computing) drive new capabilities in mobile software development. The workshop attendees will also examine the lifecycle of mobile software development and how it relates to the software engineering lifecycle. There will also be working group discussions and activities where attendees will explore and evaluate existing techniques, patterns, and best practices of mobile software development.
