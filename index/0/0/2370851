As a result of the invention of social networks friendships, relationships and social communications have all gone to a new level with new definitions. One may have hundreds of friends without even seeing their faces. Meanwhile, alongside this transition there is increasing evidence that online social applications have been used by children and adolescents for bullying. State-of-the-art studies in cyberbullying detection have mainly focused on the content of the conversations while largely ignoring the users involved in cyberbullying. We propose that incorporation of the users' information, their characteristics, and post-harassing behaviour, for instance, posting a new status in another social network as a reaction to their bullying experience, will improve the accuracy of cyberbullying detection. Cross-system analyses of the users' behaviour - monitoring their reactions in different online environments - can facilitate this process and provide information that could lead to more accurate detection of cyberbullying.
