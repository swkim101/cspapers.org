This paper proposes the use of optical flow from a moving robot to provide force feedback to an operator's joystick to facilitate collision free teleoperation. Optic flow is measured by wide angle cameras on board the vehicle and used to generate a virtual environmental force that is reflected to the user through the joystick, as well as feeding back into the control of the vehicle. The coupling between optical flow (velocity) and force is modelled as an impedance - in this case an optical impedance. We show that the proposed control is dissipative and prevents the vehicle colliding with the environment as well as providing the operator with a natural feel for the remote environment. The paper focuses on applications to aerial robotics vehicles, however, the ideas apply directly to other force actuated vehicles such as submersibles or space vehicles, and the authors believe the approach has potential for control of terrestrial vehicles and even teleoperation of manipulators. Experimental results are provided for a simulated aerial robot in a virtual environment controlled by a haptic joystick.
