As rapid development of precision medicine, in vivo manipulation of micro/nano-scaled particles have attracted increasing attention in recent years. To accommodate complex in-vivo environment, robot-aided automated manipulation technology is highly demanded in trapping and controlling micro/nano-particles stably and effectively. This paper presents an in-vivo cell manipulation system, where a disturbance compensation controller is utilized to minimize the effect of fluid (e.g., blood flow) on the cell. The controller has exhibited advantages in adjusting cell tracking trajectory online, minimizing the steady-state error, and eliminating overshoot. Simulation and experimental results verify the performance of the controller.
