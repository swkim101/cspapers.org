Manipulating graph-structured schemas (ontologies, models, etc.) requires the result to remain fully connected. In certain cases, e.g., calculating the difference of two schemas, support structures may be needed in the result. We describe our engine to process support structures in the context of a schema management system and describe schema reintegration experiments which validate the performance and correctness of our system
