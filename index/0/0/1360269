This paper presents a locomotion control strategy for quadruped robots based on central pattern generator (CPG). The proposed control architecture consists of a workspace trajectory generator and a motion engine. The CPG-inspired trajectory generator can generate workspace trajectories and the motion engine can calculate the accurate joint control signals. Moreover, entrainment with sensory feedback information from robot-environment interaction, the presented control system can generate adaptive joint control signals. A quadruped platform AIBO is used to validate the proposed control architecture and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the control system.
