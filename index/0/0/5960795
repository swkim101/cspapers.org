The Gould NP1 is a multicomputer multiprocessing system designed for high performance and parallel processing required in diverse scientific and engineering applications. The NP1's basic building block is a dual-processor single bus system which can be expanded up to eight processors over four system buses.
This paper discusses the overall design and implementation of tne NP1 system interconnection in particularly the inter-system bus link which interconnects four system buses to form a tightly coupled eight processor system. Such interconnectivity provides NP1 the flexibility in system expansion capable of addressing full four gigabytes of physical memory with the least communications delay.
