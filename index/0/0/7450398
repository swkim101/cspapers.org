The design of simple cryptographic protocols for elementary two-party (session oriented) tasks (such as entity authentication and key transport) has had a history (starting with [NS78]) where security has been quite evasive. Only recently we have seen protocol designs which are both provably secure and efficient
Currently, much attention of the designers of network systems and services is directed towards group operations, which will enable such important tasks as one-to-many distribution of content, group collaborative efforts, etc over the Internet and Intranets [Be98]. Rather than designing each group oriented task from scratch, we move in this work towards a more methodological approach, which derives a design of group (multicast) protocols from two-party ones. The approach, which we call secure protocol expansion, maintains the efficiency of the basic design and at the same tune preserves provable security. It enables us to achieve efficient and secure protocols for a large variety of group tasks. We consider basic group authentication and key transport protocols, as well as functional protocol extensions like multicast perfect forward secrecy, group access-control, group announcement and termination.
