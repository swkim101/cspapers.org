Precise control of synchronous drive depends on the accurate position feedback of the rotor. This can be achieved using an absolute position encoder. One of the protocol used for encoder is Synchronous Serial Interface. The encoder with this protocol has to be interfaced with the drive or the testing setup in laboratory. In order to avoid a physical hardware, this paper proposes the SSI protocol implementation in FPGA layer of a Real time Simulator used for Hardware in Loop Simulation. A signal interface board is used instead of an actual encoder hardware. The signal interface board is linked with the real time simulator. A Medium Voltage Hardware in Loop simulator is used to test synchronous drive with this proposed implementation of the protocol. The testing is also automated in order to evaluate the accuracy of the real time response of the embedded protocol. The lab test along with automated testing results are presented in this paper.
