Reactive stepping is an important utility to regain balance when bipedal walking motions are disturbed. This paper sheds light on the reasons for humanoid robots to fall down. It presents a method to calculate modifications of predefined foot placements with the objective to minimize deviations of the Zero Moment Point from a reference without interrupting the walk. The calculation is in closed-form, and is embedded into a well-evaluated preview controller with observer based on the 3D Linear Inverted Pendulum Mode (3D-LIPM). Experiments in simulation and on a physical robot prove the benefit of the proposed system.
