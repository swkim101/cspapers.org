This paper describes the programming of a computer controlled arm. The programming is divided logically into planning and execution Communication between planning and execution is by a data file which specifies the arm trajectory with reapect to time, and actions that the arm should perform. The servo program which moves the arm along the trajectory is based on Legrangian mechanics and takes into account coupling between links, and the variation of inertial loading with change of arm configuration.
