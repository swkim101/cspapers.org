Our goal is to produce high-quality symbolic descriptions from aerial scenes. We have chosen to work in the domain of large commercial airport complexes. Such scenes have a variety of features such as the transportation network, building structures, and mobile objects. This paper concentrates on detection and description of the transportation network (runways and taxiways). We illustrate the complexities of this problem and how it can be solved by using geometrical context and generic airport domain knowledge.
