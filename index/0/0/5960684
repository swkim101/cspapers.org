Contextual text mining is concerned with extracting topical themes from a text collection with context information (e.g., time and location) and comparing/analyzing the variations of themes over different contexts. Since the topics covered in a document are usually related to the context of the document, analyzing topical themes within context can potentially reveal many interesting theme patterns. In this paper, we generalize some of these models proposed in the previous work and we propose a new general probabilistic model for contextual text mining that can cover several existing models as special cases. Specifically, we extend the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) model by introducing context variables to model the context of a document. The proposed mixture model, called contextual probabilistic latent semantic analysis (CPLSA) model, can be applied to many interesting mining tasks, such as temporal text mining, spatiotemporal text mining, author-topic analysis, and cross-collection comparative analysis. Empirical experiments show that the proposed mixture model can discover themes and their contextual variations effectively.
