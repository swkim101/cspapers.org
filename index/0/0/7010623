The hypothesis that information on the Web can be verified automatically, with minimal user interaction, will be tested by building and evaluating an interactive system. In this paper, verification is defined as a reasonable determination of the truth or correctness of a statement by examination, research, or comparison with similar text. The system will contain modules for reliability ranking, query processing, document retrieval, and document clustering based on agreement. The query processing and document retrieval components will use standard IR techniques. The reliability module will estimate the likelihood that a statement on the Web can be trusted using standards developed by information scientists, as well as linguistic aspects of the page and the link structure of associated web pages. The clustering module will cluster relevant documents based on whether or not they agree or disagree with the statement to be verified. Relevant references are discussed.
