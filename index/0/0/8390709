The key technique for the design of a frequency divider is to find a function between the input and output. In general, the design process and circuit of a frequency divider is complicated, modification and transplantation for it is difficult. A creative design method of CAIFD (Controllable Arbitrary Integer Frequency Divider) is presented in this paper, which uses the VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language ) source code to synthesize a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) or a CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device) circuit that produces a 50% duty cycle n (n is a integer and nâ‰«0 ) controllable waveform. In order to validate the design method, CAIFD which has different frequency coefficients is simulated in device of ALTERA Corporation's EP2S15F484C3. Results of the experiment shows that modification and transplantation of CAIFD is easy, moreover the performance is steady and reliable.
