To improve the search results for socially-connect users, we propose a ranking framework, Social Network Document Rank (SNDocRank). This framework considers both document contents and the similarity between a searcher and document owners in a social network and uses a Multi-level Actor Similarity (MAS) algorithm to efficiently calculate user similarity in a social network. Our experiment results based on YouTube data show that compared with the tf-idf algorithm, the SNDocRank method returns more relevant documents of interest. Our findings suggest that in this framework, a searcher can improve search by joining larger social networks, having more friends, and connecting larger local communities in a social network.
