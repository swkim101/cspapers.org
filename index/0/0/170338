This paper presents the first description of the motion subcorpus of ISO-SpaceBank (MotionBank) and discusses how motion-events are represented in ISO-Space 1.5, a specification language for the representation of spatial information in language. We present data from this subcorpus with examples from the pilot annotation, focusing specifically on the annotation of motion-events and their various participants. These data inform further discussion of outstanding issues concerning semantic annotation, such as quantification and measurement. We address these questions briefly as they impact the design of ISO-Space.
