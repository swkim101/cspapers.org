Multiplayer virtual reality (VR) games introduce the problem of variations in the physical size and shape of each user's space for mapping into a shared virtual space. We propose an asymmetric approach to solve the spatial variation problem, by allowing people to choose roles based on the size of their space. We demonstrate this concept through the implementation of a virtual snowball fight where players can choose from multiple roles, namely the shooter, the target, or an onlooker depending on whether the game is played remotely or together in one large space. In the co-located version, the target stands behind an actuated cardboard fort that responds to events in VR, providing non-VR spectators a way to participate in the experience. During preliminary deployment, users showed extremely positive reactions and the spectators were thrilled.
