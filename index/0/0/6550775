Vehicle type recognition is an active subject in the area of computer pattern recognition, which has been a focus in reach for the last couple of decades because of its wide potential application. And Edge detection is an important step for vehicle type recognition, a vehicle type recognition method based on Sobel was proposed. Also discussed are the vehicle vector and the vehicle recognize process. Experiments have been conducted for vehicle video. The result shows that the vehicle edge could be detected easily by the Sobel operator, and the vehicle feature can be extracted in short time. So, the Sobel operator can be good fit for vehicle type recognition.
