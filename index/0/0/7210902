The recent popularity of big data has brought immense quantities of high-dimensional data, which presents challenges to traditional data mining tasks due to curse of dimensionality. Feature selection has shown to be effective to prepare these high dimensional data for a variety of learning tasks. To provide easy access to feature selection algorithms, we provide an interactive feature selection tool FeatureMiner based on our recently released feature selection repository scikit-feature. FeatureMiner eases the process of performing feature selection for practitioners by providing an interactive user interface. Meanwhile, it also gives users some practical guidance in finding a suitable feature selection algorithm among many given a specific dataset. In this demonstration, we show (1) How to conduct data preprocessing after loading a dataset; (2) How to apply feature selection algorithms; (3) How to choose a suitable algorithm by visualized performance evaluation.
