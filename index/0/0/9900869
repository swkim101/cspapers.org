In this paper, we introduce an adaptive sensing method to a landform using a ground reflection of a ground penetrating radar (GPR). When GPR scans a ground surface, an antenna of GPR should be put on a ground as an ideal condition. The farther an antenna is put away from a ground, the shallower the sensing depth becomes, because a ground surface reflects most of the electromagnetic wave radiated by the antenna. Practically an antenna should be manipulated, keeping a small distance from a ground in order to avoid a collision with a ground. Besides, the distance should be controlled so as to observe the ground reflection at a constant position in B-scan image, which is eliminated by a simple algorithm. There are many sensors to measure a ground configuration, but we propose an adaptive sensing which does not require any additional sensors such as laser range finder. In addition, the ground reflection in B-scan image is precisely eliminated by manipulating the sensor head according to GPR sensor information. We show some experimental results to confirm its effectiveness and its performance.
