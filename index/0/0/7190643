The new software engineering initiative, Semat, is in the process of developing a kernel for software engineering that stands on a solid theoretical basis. So far, it has suggested a set of kernel elements for software engineering and basic language constructs for defining the elements and their usage. This paper describes a session during which Semat results and status will be presented. The presentation will be followed by a discussion panel.
