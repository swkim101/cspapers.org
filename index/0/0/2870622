This paper focuses on data warehouse modelling. The conceptual model we defined, is based on object concepts extended with specific concepts like generic classes, temporal classes and archive classes. The temporal classes are used to store the detailed evolutions and the archive classes store the summarised data evolutions. We also provide a flexible concept allowing the administrator to define historised parts and non-historised parts into the warehouse schema. Moreover, we introduce constraints which configure the data warehouse behaviour and these various parts. To validate our propositions, we describe a prototype dedicated to the data warehouse design.
