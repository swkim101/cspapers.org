Wireless sensor network has been identified as being useful in a variety of domains including the battlefield and perimeter defense. These mission critical applications raise the concern for security in sensor network. Typical security problems identified include passive information gathering, subversion of a node, legitimate addition of a node to an existing sensor network, and so forth [1]. Under traditional routing concept, information security is usually ensured through high-level security protocols, but limited computational power and memory space in sensor nodes make traditional cryptographical techniques cumbersome to be implemented in sensor networks.
