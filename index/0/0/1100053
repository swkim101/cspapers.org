Digital Object Memories (DOMes) comprise hardware and software components, which together provide an open and universal platform for capturing and interacting with the digital information of connected objects - including storage, documentation and provision of information concerning actions an object is or might be involved in. We envisage that connected objects equipped with DOMes will be enabled to make suggestions and propositions to human users - which implies that an object may have a level of agency. The latter concept is a striking possibility that may change the way that we perceive, interact, and relate to objects. The goal of this established workshop series is to twofold: 1.) initiate a conversation concerning the potential for objects to develop agency; and 2.) explore how data that is associated with an object may leverage real-world actions. DOMe-IoT 2012 provides a hybrid interdisciplinary workshop format that will combine traditional presentations and discussion with practice-based experimentation.
