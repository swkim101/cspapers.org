An empirical study was carried out comparing three kinds of hands-on practice in training users of a software package; exercises, guided-exploration, and a combination of exercises and guided-exploration. Moderate to high experience computer users were trained. Subjects who were trained with exercises or the combined approach did significantly better in both time and errors than those trained using guidedexploration. There were no significant differences between the exercise and the combined approach groups. Thus, it appears that the better performance of these groups can be attributed to the exercise component of their practice.
