A general scheme to aid in the selection of therapies is described. A topological sorting procedure within a general production rule representation is introduced. The procedure is used to choose among competing therapies on the basis of precedence rules. This approach has a degree of naturalness that lends itself to automatic explanation of the choices made. A system has been implemented using this approach to develop an expert system for planning therapies for patients diagnosed as having ocular herpes simplex. An abstracted example of the system s output on an actual case is given.
