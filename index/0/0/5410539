Throughout history, inefficient methods to use devices have been replaced by more efficient ones. This shift typically occurs when users discover how to &legate work to the powers of a tool, and to circumvent its liiitations. Strategies of delegation and circumvention, therefore, appear to be the core of efficient use. To show how this approach can expiain the relationship between tools and strategies in complex computer systems, we describe five ways to perform a real-world drawing task with current as well as 5.rture tools. We then present five corresponding GOMS models that demonstrate the value of efficient strategies when compared to the observed behavior of a professional CAD user. We conclude by presenting a generalized framework to characterize efficient strategies and discuss its relevance to design and training.
