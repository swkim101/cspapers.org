Squeak is a new programming language that is particularly appropriate for learning computer science. It offers an excellent infrastructure for interesting projects (e.g., multimedia, Web browsing and serving), and all source code is included (and written in Squeak) from the virtual machine, windowing, on up. Squeak is being used in a course on Objects and Design (focusing on the development of user interfaces), both to enhance the infrastructure for a course on, and to change how user interfaces are taught. Rather than teach a toolkit, the focus is now on teaching students how to build toolkits. This paper presents a pilot study suggesting benefits of our new approach.
