The Intelligence in Wikipedia project at the University of Washington is combining self-supervised information extraction (IE) techniques with a mixed initiative interface designed to encourage communal content creation (CCC). Since IE and CCC are each powerful ways to produce large amounts of structured information, they have been studied extensively — but only in isolation. By combining the two methods in a virtuous feedback cycle, we aim for substantial synergy. While previous papers have described the details of individual aspects of our endeavor [25, 26, 24, 13], this report provides an overview of the project’s progress and vision.
