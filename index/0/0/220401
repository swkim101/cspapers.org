A "Front End" for a Computer-Based Glaucoma Consultation System is described. The system views a case as a description of a particular instance of a class of concepts called "structured objects" and builds up a representation of the instance from the sentences in the case. the information required by the consultation system is then extracted and passed on to the consultation system in the appropriately coded form. A core of syntactic, semantic and contextual rules which are applicable to all structured objects is being developed together with a representation of the structured object GLAUCOMA-PATIENT. There is also a facility for adding domain dependent syntax, abbreviations and defaults.
