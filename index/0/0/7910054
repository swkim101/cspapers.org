This paper presents a novel local feature for 3D range image data called `the line image'. It is designed to be highly viewpoint invariant by exploiting the range image to efficiently detect 3D occupancy, producing a representation of the surface, occlusions and empty spaces. We also propose a strategy for defining keypoints with stable orientations which define regions of interest in the scan for feature computation. The feature is applied to the task of object classification on sparse urban data taken with a Velodyne laser scanner, producing good results.
