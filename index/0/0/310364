Circuit Analysis with s digital computer has become almost commonplace. Such programs as NET-1, ECAP, SCEPTRE, CIRCUS and many others have significantly advanced the state of the art of circuit analysis. So much so that the past several years have witnessed the development of the worst-case analysis era. It is no longer sufficient just to supply a customer with a piece of electronic equipment that is thoroughly tested. Frequently, and especially when the customer is connected with the space program, an analysis is also required that shows the equipment will meet the performance specifications when component parameters are permitted to vary. These variations may be due to purchase tolerances, temperature variation, or end-of-life degradation. The analysis procedure that leads to a worst-case calculation is very tedious. The variation which gives the worst-caste performance must be selected. The analyst is given some aid in his search for the worst-case performance by some computer programs. For example, ECAP will calculate the sensitivities and the worst-case voltages in a DC circuit. However, neither the worst-case transient solution nor the worst-case frequency response solution can be obtained automatically from available programs.
 A digital computer program which uses the extremes of the parameter varizations to compute the worst-case performance of a lumped-linear model of an electronic circuit was developed by the authors and is presented here.
 The program is described in this paper in several sections. In Sections II through IV the worst-case feature is described in detail and an example is given to illustrate the use of the program. In Section V the detailed operating instructions for the program are listed. Section VI presents conclusions.
