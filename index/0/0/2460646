The exponential number of possible subgraphs makes the problem of frequent subgraph mining a challenge. The set of maximal frequent subgraphs is much smaller to that of the set of frequent subgraphs, thus providing ample scope for pruning. MARGIN is a maximal subgraph mining algorithm that moves among promising nodes of the search space along the "border" of the infrequent and frequent subgraphs. This drastically reduces the number of candidate patterns considered in the search space. Experimental results validate the efficiency and utility of the technique proposed.
