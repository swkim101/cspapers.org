We introduce a novel topic segmentation approach that combines evidence of topic shifts from lexical cohesion with linguistic evidence such as syntactically distinct features of segment initial contributions. Our evaluation demonstrates that this hybrid approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms even when applied to loosely structured, spontaneous dialogue.
