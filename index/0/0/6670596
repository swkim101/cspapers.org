Existing research on accelerators has emphasized the performance and energy efficiency improvements they can provide, devoting little attention to practical issues such as accelerator invocation and interaction with other on-chip components (e.g. cores, caches). In this paper we present a quantitative study that considers these aspects by implementing seven high-throughput accelerators following three design models: tight coupling behind a CPU, loose out-of-core coupling with Direct Memory Access (DMA) to the LLC, and loose out-of-core coupling with DMA to DRAM. A salient conclusion of our study is that working sets of non-trivial size are best served by loosely-coupled accelerators that integrate private memory blocks tailored to their needs.
