The philosophy, structure, and design of a data-management system that is applicable to a wide range of organizational environments - from production groups to research and development groups - are introduced and discussed. The system is in operation in two locations and has been used to design numerous LSI/VLSI chips. This low cost system is transportable, extendable, and suitable for use by designers having a diversity of CAD-related skill levels. User reaction to the system and future plans are discussed.
