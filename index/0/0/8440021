However, these intentions are often not directly derivable from the semantics of an utterance (e.g., when linguistic modulations are employed to convey polite-ness, respect, and social standing). Robotic architectures withsimple command-based natural language capabilities are thus not equipped to handle more liberal, yet natural uses of linguistic communicative exchanges. In this paper, we propose novel mechanisms for inferring in-tentions from utterances and generating clarification requests that will allow robots to cope with a much wider range of task-based natural language interactions. We demonstrate the potential of these inference algorithms for natural human-robot interactions by running them as part of an integrated cognitive robotic architecture on a mobile robot in a dialogue-based instruction task.
