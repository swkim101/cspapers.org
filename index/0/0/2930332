Structural Analysis is a lucrative option for Fault Detection and Identification in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), because it handles detailed, large-scale mathematical models. It can be employed by an on-board flight computer to generate residual generators and implement automatic fault-detection. Contemporary algorithms applied on dynamic systems may yield residual generators which require the real-time solution of Differential-Algebraic Equation (DAE) systems. Depending on the form and differential index of each DAE system, its solution may not be possible exclusively by computational means. In this paper we explore the relation between Structural Analysis algorithms and the forms of DAE systems they produce, propose conditions under which all generated DAEs are Structural Index-1 and semi-explicit and provide a large-scale fixed-wing UAV model with that property.
