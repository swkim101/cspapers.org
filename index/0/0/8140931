We investigate the criteria used by online searchers when assessing the relevance of web pages to information-seeking tasks. Twenty four searchers were given three tasks each, and indicated the features of web pages which they employed when deciding about the usefulness of the pages. These tasks were presented within the context of a simulated work-task situation. The results of this study provide a set of criteria used by searchers to decide about the utility of web pages. Such criteria have implications for the design of systems that use or recommend web pages, as well as to authors of web pages.
