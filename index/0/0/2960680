Grammatical relationships (GRs) form an important level of natural language processing, but different sets of GRs are useful for different purposes. Therefore, one may often only have time to obtain a small training corpus with the desired GR annotations. To boost the performance from using such a small training corpus on a transformation rule learner, we use existing systems that find related types of annotations.
