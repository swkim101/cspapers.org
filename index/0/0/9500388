In the more dynamic environments emerging from ad hoc and peer-to-peer networks, our research has explored the extent to which Web-based knowledge sharing as well as community formation require automation to understand human-readable content in a more distributed manner. RDFa is a syntactic format which can leverage this issue by allowing machine-readable data to be easily integrated into XHTML Web pages. Although there is a growing number of tools and techniques for generating and distilling RDFa, comparatively little work has been carried out on publishing existing RDF data sets as an XHTML+RDFa serialization. This paper proposes a generic approach to integrating RDF data into Web pages using the concept of automatically discovered "topic nodes". RDFaÂ² is a proof-of-concept implementation of this approach and provides an on-line service assisting users in generating and personalizing pages with RDFa. We provide experimental results that support the viability of our approach to generating Web documents such as FOAF-based online profiles as well as RDF vocabularies with little user intervention.
