Main memory is a major shared resource among cores in a multicore system. If the interference between different applications' memory requests is not controlled effectively, system performance can degrade significantly. Previous work aimed to mitigate the problem of interference between applications by changing the scheduling policy in the memory controller, i.e., by prioritizing memory requests from applications in a way that benefits system performance.
