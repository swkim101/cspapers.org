Remote Data Checking (RDC) allows clients to efficiently check the integrity of data stored at untrusted servers. This allows data owners to assess the risk of outsourcing data in the public cloud, making RDC a valuable tool for data auditing. Early RDC schemes have focused on static data, whereas later schemes such as DPDP support the full range of dynamic operations on the outsourced data, including insertions, modifications, and deletions. Robustness is required for both static and dynamic RDC schemes that rely on spot checking for efficiency. In this paper, we propose the first RDC schemes that provide robustness and, at the same time, support dynamic updates, while requiring small, constant, client storage.
