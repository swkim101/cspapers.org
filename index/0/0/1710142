Pintos is an instructional operating system, complete with documentation and ready-made, modular projects that introduce students to the principles of multi-programming, scheduling, virtual memory, and filesystems. By allowing students to run their work product on actual hardware, while simultaneously benefiting from debugging and dynamic analysis tools provided in simulated and emulated environments, Pintos increases student engagement. Unlike tailored versions of commercial or open source OS such as Linux, Pintos is designed from the ground up from an educational perspective. It has been used by multiple institutions for a number of years and is available for wider use.
