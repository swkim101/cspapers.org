?Ve introduce an abstract form of interobject communication for object-oriented concurrent programming based on the proof theory of Linear Logic, a logic introduced to provide a theoretical basis for the study of concurrency. Such a form of communication, which we call forumbased communication, can be seen as a refinement of blackboard-based communication in terms of a more local notion of resource consumption. Forumbased communication is introduced as part of a new computational model for the object-oriented concurrent programming language LO, presented at last year OOPSLA/ECOOP (1990), which exploits the proof-theory of Linear Logic also to achieve a powerful form of knowledge-sharing.
