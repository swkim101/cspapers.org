Good quality models for the analysis of complex enterprise information systems (EIS) are hard to build and require lots of experience and effort, which are not always available. A possible solution to deal with the previous issue is to build automated procedures for quality model generation. Such procedures will encapsulate previous existing knowledge on quality modeling and their use will reduce the cost of developing quality models. The authors concentrate on the performance and reliability of EIS and investigate the automatic generation of quality models from EIS architectural descriptions comprising additional information related to the aspects that affect the quality of the EIS.
