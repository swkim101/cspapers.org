A very flexible and easy-to-use scheme which possesses unique advantages over existing systems is presented in this article. The scheme is based on the partitioning of a character into parts, A character is inputted by specifying the sequence of character parts descriptions, which is then matched against the standard sequences of the characters in the character set. A character part is either described with a unique key or its stroke count. The matching algorithm allows the characters to be partitioned flexibly and inputted in many different ways. An automatic binding mechanism offers very high adaptability to the input style of the user. The user need not remember all the key bindings before he can input Chinese and the scheme is also capable of tolerating many variations in character style and/or errors. CR
