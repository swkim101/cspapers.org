The purpose of the study was to explore elementary school children's preferences for computer mice of different shapes and sizes. A user-centered approach was employed to elicit children's input about alternative designs. The intent was to indentify shapes that constitute a better ergonomic fit for children's smaller hands and to establish whether different shapes are suitable for different age groups.
