In Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), the node mobility leads to network topology changed frequently. Due to the vehicle movement, the limited wireless resources and channel fading, the routing protocols in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks MANETs are not suitable for VANETs. In this paper we propose a new multipath route protocol based on Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) for adapting VANETs environment called Enhanced Multipath AODV (EMP-AODV). EMP-AODV use a node-disjoint multipath strategy to set up routing and choose routing to transmission based on a link expected link lifetime algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed protocol reduces the end-to-end delay and packet loss ratio while improving the network throughput in VANETs.
