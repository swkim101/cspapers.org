Abstract : We specify and analyze a new channel access protocol for wireless local area networks. The new protocol, FAMA-PJ, consists of both carrier sensing and a collision detection mechanism based on control packets and jamming that prevent collision of data packets with control or data packets from other stations. Control of the channel (which we call the floor) is assigned to at most one station in the network at a time, and this station is guaranteed to be able to transmit one or more data packets to different destinations with no collision with transmissions from other stations. The minimum control packet size required to enforce correct floor control is specified as a function of the channel propagation delay and transmit to receive turn around time. The throughput and delay of FAMA-PJ are analyzed and compared with the throughput and delay of non-persistent CSMA. This analysis shows that FAMA-PJ can provide similar or better throughput than non-persistent CSMA in a high-speed wireless local area network, and that is more stable and has better delay characteristics than non-persistent CSMA.
