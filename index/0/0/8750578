Previous work hasshown problems in coalition games to be computationally hard. Wooldridge and Dunne (Artifi. Intell. 2006) studied the classical computational complexity of several natural decision problems in Coalitional Resource Games (CRG) - games in which each agent is endowed with a set of resources and coalitions can bring about a set of goals if they are collectively endowed with the necessary amount of resources. The input of coalitional resource games bundles together several elements, e.g., the agent set Ag, the goal set G, the resource set R, etc. Shrot et al. (AAMAS 2009) examine coalition formation problems in the CRG model using the theory of Parameterized Complexity. Their refined analysis shows that not all parts of input act equal - some instances of the problem are indeed tractable while others still remain intractable.We answer an important question left open by Shrot, Aumann,and Kraus by showing that the SC Problem (checking whether a Coalition is Successful) is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the size of the coalition. Then via a single theme of reduction from SC, we are able to show that various problems related to resources, resource bounds, and resource conflicts introduced by Wooldridge et al. are (i) W[1]-hard or co-W[1]-hard w.r.t the size of the coalition; and (ii) Para-NP hard or co-Para-NP-hard w.r.t |R|. When parameterized by |G| or |R| + |Ag|, we give a general algorithm which proves that these problems are indeed tractable.
