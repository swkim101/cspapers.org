We have developed a simple yet motivating course-project for use in a one-semester undergraduate course in Artificial Intelligence. The project is well-suited to small liberal arts college environments that lack specialized hardware, software, and faculty, fulfilling an unmet need for many faculty at such institutions.We describe the project and how to deploy and use supporting software for faculty wishing to adopt this project.
