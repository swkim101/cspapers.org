An ever growing number of XML repositories are being made available for search. A lot of activity has been deployed in the past few years to query such repositories. In particular, full-text querying of text-rich XML documents has generated a wealth of issues that are being addressed by both the database (DB) and information retrieval (IR) communities. The DB community has traditionally focused on developing query languages and efficient evaluation algorithms for highly structured data. In contrast, the IR community has focused on searching unstructured data, and has developed various techniques for ranking query results and evaluating their effectiveness. Fortunately, recent trends in DB and IR research demonstrate a growing interest in adopting IR techniques in DBs and vice versa [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9].
