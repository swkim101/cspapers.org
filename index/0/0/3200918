Frauds and attacks for online banking are increasing quickly. The major platform for current online banking, personal computer, has become untrusted especially under malware attacks. In this study, we design a smart card-based solution called secure online banking companion (SOBC) to address this problem. Portability and cost are also highly considered in the design. We have implemented a prototype of the solution on a Java Card simulator, which shows the solution can be implemented easily using current smart card technologies.
