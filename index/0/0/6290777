This talk presents NTT's approach for realizing a Human-Centered Network. Last November, we announced the NTT Group's Medium-Term Management Strategy, which consists of three management objectives: (1) building the ubiquitous broadband market and helping achieve the e-Japan Strategy and the u-Japan Initiative; (2) building a safe, secure, and convenient communications network environment and broadband access infrastructure, while achieving a seamless migration from the legacy telephone network to the next generation network; and (3) striving to increase corporate value and achieve sustainable growth. Since the management strategy takes account of Japan's future social issues such as declining birthrate and aging population, the need to reduce the environmental load, etc, we believe that the R&D activities directed towards accomplishing these objectives consequently lead to the realization of a Human-Centered Network.
