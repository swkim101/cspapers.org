In order to improve the performance of heuristic search for finding optimal solutions, two high level problem solving strategies, namely, subgoal ordering and goal augmentation, have been developed. The essence of these two strategies is to make explicit the knowledge embedded in a general problem formulation which can be used to constrain the solution search space. These two strategies have been incorporated into a methodology which we previously developed for automatically generating admissible search heuristics. The effectiveness of these strategies is demonstrated by the application to robot opt imal task planning problems.
