We start by summarizing our goals with an emphasis on our requirements on references. A dynamically varying space of virtual addresses is postulated. This space has the structure of a rooted tree. All references considered are essentially relative: to a target from a context. A few reference concepts are defined and explored, together with a unified operation of qualification and offsetting and one operation for forming references from new contexts.
