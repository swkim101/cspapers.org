The relative placement of records in a database has a significant impact on the overall system performance. In this paper we study three related assignment problems. They are (1) the assignment of records to devices so as to minimize the expected completion time and to maximize the expected utilization of the devices, (2) the assignment of records to pages or blocks in secondary memory so as to minimize the number of blocks to be accessed, and (3) the analysis of the performance of a hashing scheme under the assumption that the record-to-bucket probability varies from one bucket to another. The solutions to these problems are obtained by studying an occupancy problem. In each case, an optimal solution is obtained.
