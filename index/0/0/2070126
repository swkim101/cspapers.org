In recent years system engineers, product designers, and human interface designers have become increasingly interested in developing ways of involving users in the design and evolution of computer-based systems. Some have turned for guidance and inspiration to an approach to systems design pioneered in Scandinavia and often referred to as Participatory Design. In this paper we examine the development of a computer-based design tool, Trillium, which on the surface looked like an example of Participatory Design in that users were directly involved in the development of the technology. Our analysis leads us to conclude, however, that Trillium's development departed in critical ways from our current model of Participatory Design and to suggest that the manner in which users are involved in the development effort plays an important role in the success of the endeavor.
