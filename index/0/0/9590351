Data from real applications involve multiple modalities representing content with the same semantics and deliver rich information from complementary aspects. However, relations among heterogeneous modalities are simply treated as observation-to-fit by existing work, and the parameterized cross-modal mapping functions lack flexibility in directly adapting to the content divergence and semantic complicacy of multi-modal data. In this paper, we build our work based on Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM) to learn the non-linear non-parametric mapping functions and transform heterogeneous data into a shared latent space. We propose multi-modal Similarity Gaussian Process latent variable model (m-SimGP), which learns the nonlinear mapping functions between the intra-modal similarities and latent representation. We further propose multi-modal regularized similarity GPLVM (m-RSimGP) by encouraging similar/dissimilar points to be similar/dissimilar in the output space. The overall objective functions are solved by simple and scalable gradient decent techniques. The proposed models are robust to content divergence and high-dimensionality in multi-modal representation. They can be applied to various tasks to discover the non-linear correlations and obtain the comparable low-dimensional representation for heterogeneous modalities. On two widely used real-world datasets, we outperform previous approaches for cross-modal content retrieval and cross-modal classification.
