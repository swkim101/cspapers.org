What is the best paging algorithm if one has partial information about the possible sequences of page requests? Borodin, Irani, Raghavan and Schieber [2] proposed a framework in which such questions can be addressed, by studying the competitive analysis of paging algorithms in the access graph model. This model restricts page requests so that they conform to a notion of locality of reference, given by an arbitrary access graph. It can also be viewed as an example of a diffuse adversary model, as defined by Koutoupias and Papadimitriou [11]. We present two results in this model. The first is a randomized algorithm which is strongly competitive against oblivious adversaries for undirected access graphs. We also present strongly competitive algorithms against adversaries that can use multiple pointers into the access graph in order to construct the reference sequence. This models more closely a multiprogramming environment, or a situation in which there are multiple threads of control.
