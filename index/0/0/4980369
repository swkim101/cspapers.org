Language Emulator, written in Java, is a toolkit to help undergraduate students to understand the concepts of Automata Theory. The software allows the manipulation of regular expressions, regular grammars, deterministic finite automata, nondeterministic finite automata with and without lambda transitions, and Moore and Mealy machines. Language Emulator introduces error-detecting and internationalization functionalities into automata tools. It has been accepted by 95% of students in a recent survey, indicating that it is a helpful toolkit in learning Automata Theory.
