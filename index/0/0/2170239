We study the minimum-cost bounded-skew routing tree problem under the Elmore delay model. We present two approaches to construct bounded-skew routing trees: (i) the Boundary Merging and Embedding (BME) method which utilizes merging points that are restricted to the boundaries of merging regions, and (ii) the Interior Merging and Embedding (IME) algorithm which employs a sampling strategy and dynamic programming to consider merging points that are interior to, rather than on the boundary of, the merging regions. Our new algorithms allow accurate control of Elmore delay skew, and show the utility of merging points inside merging regions.
