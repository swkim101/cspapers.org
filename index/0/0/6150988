We introduce a natural new network formation game in which buyers and sellers may purchase edges representing trading opportunities between themselves, and then accrue wealth in the resulting exchange economy. Our main result is an exact characterization of the set of bipartite graphs G that are Nash equilibria for this game. This characterization provides sharp limits on the amount and structure of wealth variation that can occur, as well as on the allowable equilibrium exchange rates.
