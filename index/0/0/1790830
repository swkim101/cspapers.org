Held for the first time in conjunction with the ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM), NWSearch 2015 aims to bring together researchers, developers and practitioners who are interested in pushing the search boundary on the Web and exploring more novel forms of searches, interfaces, task formulations, and result organizations and presentations. In particular, the workshop seeks to identify some of the problems and challenges facing the development of such tools and interfaces and to flourish new ideas and findings that can shape or influence future research directions and developments. The workshop organizers solicited contributions that would fall within the large spectrum of human-computer interaction in one extreme and system production and development in the other extreme.
