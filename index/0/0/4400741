Engaging students in the learning process has been shown to be an effective means for education. Several methods have been proposed to achieve this engagement for computer science and other disciplines. Active learning is one such technique that incorporates interactive classroom activities to reinforce concepts and involve the students. Visualizations of computer science concepts such as algorithm animations can be used for these activities. To be most effective in this environment, they need to be designed and used with active learning in mind. This paper describes the design characteristics of such visualizations, ways of using them in the classroom, and our experience with developing and using visualization tools across different courses in the computer science curriculum.
