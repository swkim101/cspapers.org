High performance computing centers have traditionally served monolithic MPI applications. However, in recent years, many of the large scientific computations have included high throughput and data-intensive jobs. HPC systems have mostly used batch queue schedulers to schedule these workloads on appropriate resources. There is a need to understand future scheduling scenarios that can support the diverse scientific workloads in HPC centers. In this paper, we analyze the workloads on two systems (Hopper, Carver) at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) Center. Specifically, we present a trend analysis towards understanding the evolution of the workload over the lifetime of the two systems.
