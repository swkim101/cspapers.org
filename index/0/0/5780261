Experimenting in courses such as operating systems, computer networks, and distributed systems is challenging due to the need to access system kernels and network infrastructures, as well as the distributed nature of these experiments. In this paper, we design and develop a laboratory platform that can be rapidly and economically adopted in any educational institutions to teach introductory computer networks courses. By using commercial, off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software, and together with our technical solutions, the platform gives students an opportunity to experiment in a real, flexible and scalable network, and to interact with the network both as a network user and more importantly as a network operator. These features can help students to better understand the algorithms, protocols and practice of computer networks. This easy-to-use lab platform has been received favorably by students. Also, the low-cost platform is easy to maintain, and can be repeatedly used in multiple, back-to-back lab sections.
