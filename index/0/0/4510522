We present a multiview image completion method that provides geometric consistency among different views by propagating space structures. Since a user specifies the region to be completed in one of multiview photographs casually taken in a scene, the proposed method enables us to complete the set of photographs with geometric consistency by creating or removing structures on the specified region. The proposed method incorporates photographs to estimate dense depth maps. We initially complete color as well as depth from a view, and then facilitate two stages of structure propagation and structure-guided completion. Structure propagation optimizes space topology in the scene across photographs, while structure-guide completion enhances, and completes local image structure of both depth and color in multiple photographs with structural coherence by searching nearest neighbor fields in relevant views. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in completing multiview images.
