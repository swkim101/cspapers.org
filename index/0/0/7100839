Automatic grading systems for summaries and essays have been studied for years. Most commercial and research implementations are based in statistical methods, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which can provide high accuracy on similarity between the essay and the graded or standard essays, but they can offer very limited feedback. In the present work, we propose a novel method to provide both grades and meaningful feedback for student summaries by Ontology-based Information Extraction (OBIE). We use ontological concepts and relationships to create extraction rules to identify correct statements. Based on ontology constraints (e.g., disjointness between concepts), we define patterns that are logically inconsistent with the ontology to create rules to extract incorrect statements. Experiments show that the grades given to 18 student summaries on Ecosystems by OBIE are correlated to human gradings. OBIE also provide meaningful feedback on the errors those students made in their summaries.
