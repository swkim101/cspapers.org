We provide a hands-on demonstration of the potential of interactive systems based on electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). These wearable devices allow attendees, for example, to physically learn how to manipulate objects they never seen before, feel walls and forces in virtual reality, and so forth. In our demo we plan to not only demonstrate several of these EMS-based prototypes but also to provide instructions and free hardware for people to conduct their first projects using EMS.
