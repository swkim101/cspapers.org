We report our remote appreciation system using a mobile robot driven by remote control via the Internet using a Web browser. The robot in the museum is an avatar that acts for people who, for various reasons, cannot visit the museum in person and would like to visit the museum from distant homes or offices. This work is part of the special project on "modeling the evaluation structure of KANSEI" at the University of Tsukuba. We also discuss problem on the infrastructure of global network for our system and its solution in "giga-bit/high-speed network".
