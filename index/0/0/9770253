The accelerating rate of scientific publications makes it difficult to find relevant citations or related work. Context-aware citation recommendation aims to solve this problem by providing a curated list of high-quality candidates given a short passage of text. Existing literature adopts bag-of-word representations leading to the loss of valuable semantics and lacks the ability to integrate metadata or generalize to unseen manuscripts in the training set. We propose a flexible encoder-decoder architecture called Neural Citation Network (NCN), embodying a robust representation of the citation context with a max time delay neural network, further augmented with an attention mechanism and author networks. The recurrent neural network decoder consults this representation when determining the optimal paper to recommend based solely on its title. Quantitative results on the large-scale CiteSeer dataset reveal NCN cultivates a significant improvement over competitive baselines. Qualitative evidence highlights the effectiveness of the proposed end-to-end neural network revealing a promising research direction for citation recommendation.
