In morphologically rich languages such as Arabic, the abundance of word forms resulting from increased morpheme combinations is significantly greater than for languages with fewer inflected forms (Kirchhoff et al., 2006). This exacerbates the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. Test set words are more likely to be unknown, limiting the effectiveness of the model. The goal of this study is to use the regularities of Arabic inflectional morphology to reduce the OOV problem in that language. We hope that success in this task will result in a decrease in word error rate in Arabic automatic speech recognition.
