We outline some matrix factorization approaches for co- clustering polyadic data (like publication data) using non-negative factorization (NMF). NMF approximates the data as a product of non-negative low-rank matrices, and can induce desirable clustering properties in the matrix factors through a flexible range of constraints. We show that simultaneous factorization of one or more matrices provides potent approaches for co-clustering.
