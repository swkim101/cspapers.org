Facilitating information retrieval in the vastly growing realm of digital media has become increasingly difficult. DelaunayMM seeks to assist all users in finding relevant information through an interactive interface that supports pre- and post-query refinement, and a customizable multimedia information display. This project leverages the strengths of visual query languages with a resourceful framework to provide users with a single intuitive interface. The interface and its supporting framework are described in this paper.
