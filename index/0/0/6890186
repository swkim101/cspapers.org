We introduce and theoretically study the Gardener's problem that well models many web information monitoring scenarios, where numerous dynamically changing web sources are monitored and local information needs to be periodically updated under communication and computation capacity constraints. Typical such examples include maintenance of inverted indexes for search engines and maintenance of extracted structures for unstructured data management systems. We formulate a corresponding multicriteria optimization problem and propose heuristic solutions.
