We introduce a method for the efficient design of a Boltzmann machine (or a Hopfield net) that computes an arbitrary given Boolean function f. This method is based on an efficient simulation of acyclic circuits with threshold gates by Boltzmann machines. As a consequence we can show that various concrete Boolean functions f that are relevant for classification problems can be computed by scalable Boltzmann machines that are guaranteed to converge to their global maximum configuration with high probability after constantly many steps.
