We introduce a variant of Aldous and Vazirani's \Go with the winners" algorithm that can be used for search graphs that are not trees. We analyze the algorithm in terms of the properties of a tree-decomposition of the search graph. We show a large class of distributions for search graphs so that \Go with the winners" works well with high probability for almost all graphs from the distribution. We also give a suÂ±cient combinatorial property that ensures good performance.
