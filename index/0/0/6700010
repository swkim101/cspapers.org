For generating whole-body behavior involving contacts with environments such as climbing ladder behavior or walking on terrain behavior, “contact-before-motion” approach was used in some previous researches. By separating contact search process and motion search process, whole-body behavior generation was achieved. However, in previous researches, there were few examinations about contact transition strategies while generating behavior. For changing contact states, there are many kinds of contact transition strategies such as walking, sliding, rotating and so on. For example, while generating standing up behavior, it is important to switch contact transition strategies because the lack of degree of freedom makes it difficult to detach limb contacts from ground, and it may be desirable not to detach contacts but to slide them. In this study, we propose a novel whole-body behavior generation algorithm which involves contact transition strategies switching function. Especially, in this paper, we focus on the walk-type and slide-type transition strategies switching. We call walk-type transition as the contact transition process which detaches some contacts, moves them, and attaches them again. Besides, we call slide-type transition as the contact transition process which keeps on attaching contacts, and slides to move them. By using this algorithm, it is possible to generate whole-body behaviors which are difficult or impossible to achieve only with walk-type transition and which are more desirable by comparing multiple transition strategies. Finally, we evaluated this algorithm by generating standing up behavior and sitting on chair behavior.
