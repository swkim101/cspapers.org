We describe ASTRX/OBLX, a synthesis system that can size high-performance analog circuit topologies to meet usersupplied linear performance specifications without designer-supplied equations. We present synthesis results for a large suite of circuit benchmarks and show that, when compared to prior approaches, ASTRX/OBLX can synthesize high-performance circuits with up to 3 orders of magnitude less initial design effort.
