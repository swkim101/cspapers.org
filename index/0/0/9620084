This paper explores a stochastic approach for controlling swarms of independent robots toward a target distribution in a bounded domain. The robot swarm has no central controller, and individual robots lack both communication and localization capabilities. Robots can only measure a scalar field (e.g. concentration of a chemical) from the environment and from this deduce the desired local swarm density. Based on this value, each robot follows a simple control law that causes the swarm as a whole to diffuse toward the target distribution. Using a new holonomic drive robot, we present the first confirmation of this control law with physical experiment. Despite deviations from assumptions underpinning the theory, the swarm achieves the theorized convergence to the target distribution in both simulation and experiment. In fact, simulated and experimental performance agree with one another and with our hypothesis that the error from the target distribution is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of robots. This is evidence that the algorithm is both practical and easily scalable to large swarms.
