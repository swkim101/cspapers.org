In this paper we describe the design, fabrication, control, and experimental validation of a soft and highly compliant 2D manipulator. The arm consists of several body segments actuated using bi-directional fluidic elastomer actuators and is fabricated using a novel composite molding process. We use a cascaded PI and PID computation and novel fluidic drive cylinders to provide closed-loop control of curvature for each soft and highly compliant body segment. Furthermore, we develop algorithms to compute the arm's forward and inverse kinematics in a manner consistent with piece-wise constant curvature continuum manipulators. These computation and control systems enable this highly compliant robot to autonomously follow trajectories. Experimental results with a robot consisting of six segments show that controlled movement of a soft and highly compliant manipulator is feasible.
