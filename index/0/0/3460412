The remoteness of rural K-12 school districts brings unique challenges to school leaders seeking to expand access to computer science education. Limited resources and perceived relevance of computer science education to rural life are but some of the challenges rural school leaders may face. To ensure the success of the current computer science education reform movement, reformers should incorporate needs assessment into their rationale for change. Supported by insights from a needs assessment, school district leaders are equipped to make the case to stakeholders for the need for computer science education. In the current study, two university-based educational researchers in the State of Georgia conducted a qualitative needs assessment single-case study to explore the challenges and opportunities a rural school district faces in broadening access to computer science education. The researchers used a collaborative process to guide the assessment of the school district's resources, educational programming, and outcomes. Data collection and analysis included documents, archival records, school walk-throughs of the district's five schools, and 15 in-depth interviews with administrators and teachers. Findings included the identification and prioritization of needs as well as themes related to challenges faced by the school district in broadening access to computing. Visitors to this poster session will have the opportunity to learn about one rural school district's unique case and what it suggests for expanding rural computer science initiatives.
