Searching for a person name in a Web Search Engine usually leads to a number of web pages that refer to several people sharing the same name. In this paper we study whether it is reasonable to assume that pages about the desired person can be filtered by the user by adding query terms. Our results indicate that, although in most occasions there is a query refinement that gives all and only those pages related to an individual, it is unlikely that the user is able to find this expression a priori.
