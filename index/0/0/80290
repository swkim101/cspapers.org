Object oriented database systems, in contrast to traditional relational database systems, allow the scope of a query against a class to be either the class itself or all classes in the class hierarchy rooted at the class. If object oriented databases have to achieve acceptable performance levels against such queries, we need indexes that support efficient retrieval of instances from a single class as well as from all classes in a class hierarchy. In this pa per, we propose a new index structure called h&-tree (hierarchy class Chain tree) that sup ports both kinds of retrieval &ciently. Moreover, the update cost of the index structure is bounded by the h$ght of the h&-tree. We have implemented hcC-trees along with Htrees and CH-trees (two other index structures that have been proposed in the literature) and report a detailed performance analysis of the three structures. The performance study reveals that h&-trees perform much better than the other two structures under most circumstances. The balanced behaviour of hcC-tree under all kinds of queries and in the presence of updates shows that it is a promising index structure for the future.
