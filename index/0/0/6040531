There has been significant progress recently in object recognition research, but many of the current approaches still fail for object classes with few distinctive features, and in settings with significant clutter and viewpoint variance. One such setting is visual search in mobile robotics, where tasks such as finding a mug or stapler require robust recognition. The focus of this paper is on integrating stereo vision with appearance based recognition to increase accuracy and efficiency. We propose a model that utilizes a chamfer-type silhouette classifier which is weighted by a prior on scale, which is robust to missing stereo depth information. Our approach is validated on a set of challenging indoor scenes containing mugs and shoes, where we find that priors remove a significant number of false positives, improving the average precision by 0.2 on each dataset. We additionally experiment with an additional classifer by Felzenszwalb et al.[1] to demonstrate the approach's robustness.
