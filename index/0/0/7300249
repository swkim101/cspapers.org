In this work, we introduce an Interactive Parts (IP) model as an alternative to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We tested both models on a database of on-line cursive script. We show that implementations of HMMs and the IP model, in which all letters are assumed to have the same average width, give comparable results. However, in contrast to HMMs, the IP model can handle duration modeling without an increase in computational complexity.
