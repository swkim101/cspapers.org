Domain mismatch _. and schema mismatch are two of the important semantic integration problems for interoperating heterogeneous databases. This paper structures the domain mismatch problem, illustrates approaches to its solution, and then extends r.his to the schema mismatch problem. Structuring of the problem and solution includes notions of conceptual territory, spheres, domain groups, localized and integrator functions, and type and function groups. Despite this structuring, the full generality of the problem still requires a rich language in which to describe the rules for reconciling discrepancies. Exarnple solutions are illustrated in the Iris Progr;ring Language (IPL) extension of Iris
