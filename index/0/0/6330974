In this paper we show how global serializability and atomic commit can be attained in a Heterogeneous Distributed Database Management System in which each local DBMS is assumed to be an off-the-shelf, binarylicensed commercial product providing the IBM SAA Common Programming Interface ([SAA88]). Our HYDRO system achieves global serializability using a set of objects based on the Request Order Linked List or ROLL object developed in [PER89] and [PER91 ]. ROLL is based on the general Serialization Graph Test methodology ([BER87]), and provides freedom from idle-wait, deadJock, livelock and restart. Atomic commitment is based on Two-Phase Commit. Two options are offered to achieve the PREPARED state locally. HYDRO-I achieves the PREPARED state by protecting writes during the uncertainty period. HYDRO-H provides more concurrency, but raises the commitment overhead in the absence of a visible PREPARED state offered by the local DBMS.
