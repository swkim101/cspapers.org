In this paper we describe a new Bayesian estimation approach for simultaneous mapping and localization for pedestrians based on odometry with foot mounted inertial sensors. When somebody walks within a constrained area such as a building, then even noisy and drift-prone odometry measurements can give us information about features like turns, doors, and walls, which we can use to build a form of a map of the explored area, especially when these features are revisited over time. Our initial results for our novel scheme which we call "FootSLAM" are very surprising in that true SLAM with stable relative positioning accuracy of 1-2 meters for pedestrians is indeed possible based on inertial sensors alone without any prior known building indoor layout. Furthermore, the 2D maps obtained even for just 10 minutes of walking converge to a good approximation of the true layout forming the basis for future automated collaborative mapping of buildings.
