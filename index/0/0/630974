We present the Game2Learn methodology for the design and evaluation of educational games with a focus on well-defined learning objectives and empirical verification. This integrative process adapts ideas from educational design, intelligent tutoring systems, classical test-theory, and interaction and game design, and agile software development. The methodology guides researchers through the steps of the design process, including identification of specific learning objectives, translation of learning activities to game mechanics, and the empirical evaluation of the final product. This methodology is particularly useful for ensuring successful student research experiences or software engineering courses.
