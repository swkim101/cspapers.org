We define fuzzy constraint networks and prove a theorem about their relationship to fuzzy logic. Then we introduce Khayyam, a fuzzy constraint-based programming language in which any sentence in the first-order fuzzy predicate calculus is a well-formed constraint statement. Finally, using Khayyam to address an equipment selection application, we illustrate the expressive power of fuzzy constraint-based languages.
