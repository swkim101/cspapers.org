We describe a method for interpreting abstract flat syntactic representations, LFG f-structures, as underspecified semantic representations, here Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (UDRSs). The method establishes a one-to-one correspondence between subsets of the LFG and UDRS formalisms. It provides a model theoretic interpretation and an inferential component which operates directly on underspecified representations for f-structures through the translation images of f-structures as UDRSs.
