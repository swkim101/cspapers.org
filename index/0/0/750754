Earlier work in parsing Arabic has speculated that attachment to construct state constructions decreases parsing performance. We make this speculation precise and define the problem of attachment to construct state constructions in the Arabic Treebank. We present the first statistics that quantify the problem. We provide a baseline and the results from a first attempt at a discriminative learning procedure for this task, achieving 80% accuracy.
