Shared representations are highly appealing due to their potential for gains in computational and statistical efficiency. Compressing a shared representation leads to greater computational savings, but can also severely decrease performance on a target task. Recently, sparselets (Song et al., 2012) were introduced as a new shared intermediate representation for multiclass object detection with deformable part models (Felzenszwalb et al., 2010a), showing significant speedup factors, but with a large decrease in task performance. In this paper we describe a new training framework that learns which sparselets to activate in order to optimize a discriminative objective, leading to larger speedup factors with no decrease in task performance. We first reformulate sparselets in a general structured output prediction framework, then analyze when sparselets lead to computational efficiency gains, and lastly show experimental results on object detection and image classification tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that discriminative activation substantially outperforms the previous reconstructive approach which, together with our structured output prediction formulation, make sparselets broadly applicable and significantly more effective.
