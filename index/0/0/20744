We present an incremental joint framework to simultaneously extract entity mentions and relations using structured perceptron with efficient beam-search. A segment-based decoder based on the idea of semi-Markov chain is adopted to the new framework as opposed to traditional token-based tagging. In addition, by virtue of the inexact search, we developed a number of new and effective global features as soft constraints to capture the interdependency among entity mentions and relations. Experiments on Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) 1 corpora demonstrate that our joint model significantly outperforms a strong pipelined baseline, which attains better performance than the best-reported end-to-end system.
