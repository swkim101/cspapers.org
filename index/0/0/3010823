We describe some issues in designing and building educational Java applets for an introductory computer graphics course. The design problem involves balancing educational goals of building intuition about fundamental concepts in a domain against heterogeneity both in subject material and in student backgrounds. We present our design approach for resolving these forces --- fine-grained units addressing small concepts --- and discuss its effects on other areas including hypertext structure, interface design, and software engineering.
