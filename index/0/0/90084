We present new faster algorithms for the exact solution of the shortest vector problem in arbitrary lattices. Our main result shows that the shortest vector in any <i>n</i>-dimensional lattice can be found in time 2<sup>3.199<i>n</i></sup> (and space 2<sup>1.325<i>n</i></sup>), or in space 2<sup>1.095<i>n</i></sup> (and still time 2<sup><i>O(n)</i></sup>). This improves the best previously known algorithm by Ajtai, Kumar and Sivakumar [Proceedings of STOC 2001] which was shown by Nguyen and Vidick [J. Math. Crypto. 2(2):181--207] to run in time 2<sup>5.9<i>n</i></sup> and space 2<sup>2.95<i>n</i></sup>. We also present a practical variant of our algorithm which provably uses an amount of space proportional to Ï„<i>n</i>, the "kissing" constant in dimension <i>n</i>. No upper bound on the running time of our second algorithm is currently known, but experimentally the algorithm seems to perform fairly well in practice, with running time 2<sup>0.52<i>n</i></sup>, and space complexity 2<sup>0.2<i>n</i></sup>.
