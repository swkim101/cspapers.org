Around 350 BCE, Aristotle set down in Poetics an understanding of narrative forms, based upon notions of the nature and intricate relations of various elements of dramatic structure and causation. Drama relied upon human performers to represent action. With computers, interactive forms and simulation inherit much of its dramatic structure from traditional narrative forms, but authorship is more explicitly shared among designers, engineers, and interactors. I and others have proposed extensions of the fundamental elements of Aristotle's Poetics to understand these new narrative forms. Ubiquitous computing is a horse of a different color. Today's new blends of sensors, networks, computation, and space create contexts for novel interactive narrative forms. When we embed what Rob Tow calls "perception-representation-action loops" in objects and spaces, we enter a realm that I call designed animism. What new forms of narrative and experience may emerge from such systems? How do we understand them in terms of structure, causality, narrative, and experience? What are the poetics of this newly animistic world? And, does it have a soul.
