Text classiﬁcation is a major data mining task. An advanced text classiﬁcation technique is known as partially supervised text classiﬁcation, which can build a text classiﬁer using a small set of positive examples only. This leads to our curiosity whether it is possible to ﬁnd a set of features that can be used to describe the positive examples. Therefore, users do not even need to specify a set of positive examples. As the ﬁrst step, in this paper, we formalize it as a new problem, called hot bursty events detection, to detect bursty events from a text stream which is a sequence of chrono-logically ordered documents. Here, a bursty event is a set of bursty features, and is considered as a potential category to build a text classiﬁer. It is important to know that the hot bursty events detection problem, we study in this paper, is diﬀerent from TDT (topic detection and tracking) which attempts to cluster documents as events using clustering techniques. In other words, our focus is on detecting a set of bursty features for a bursty event. In this paper, we propose a new novel parameter free probabilistic approach, called feature-pivot clustering. Our main technique is to fully utilize the time information to determine a set of bursty features which may occur in diﬀerent time windows. We detect bursty events based on the feature distributions. There is no need to tune or estimate any parameters. We conduct experiments us-ing real life data, a major English newspaper
