As interactive text editing systems become more and more pervasive on the job, at school, and in the home, the necessity for good human engineering in the design of such interactive systems becomes increasingly apparent.
 The issue we are concerned with in this paper is not that of modes in general, but rather the more specific question of how editors should handle text insertions. In this context, moded editing means that the editor user must enter a special command before text is inserted and another special command to end the text insertion and return to the command mode. Ordinary printing characters typed while in an insertion mode are entered as text. The same characters entered while the editor is in the command mode are treated as commands. Modeless editing is different; ordinary characters are entered directly as text. There are no special commands required to enter or stop entering text.
