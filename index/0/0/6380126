Algebraic optimization is both theoretically and practically important for query processing in (nested) relational databases. In this paper, we consider this issue and investigate some algebraic properties concerning the nested relational operators. We also outline a heuristic optimization algorithm for nested relational expressions by adopting algebraic transformation rules developed in this paper and previous related work.
