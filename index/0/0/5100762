2. Molecular Neurobiology Recent studies in neurobiology have discovered that many hormones exist in the brain, and play key roles in learning and memorization. In this paper, we discuss the possible role of hormones in learning, and propose a new learning model which incorporates hormonal effects on learning. The model is a variant of reinforcement learning with modulation on learning rate and the frequency of mental rehearsal. The modulation enables the system to focus its learning on data which are evaluated as important for the system's overall performance. The experiment demonstrates that the incorporation of hormonal modulation improves behavior learning performance, and such an evaluation network can be acquired through the evolutionary mechanism.
