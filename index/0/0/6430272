This paper presents a formal method that permits the development of verified specifications and implementation of communication protocols. A non-executable high level language is introduced for specification purposes. This language permits the concise and unambiguous specification of those characteristics which are normally needed to be modeled in the design of protocols. A simple algorithm for verifying the protocol specifications is indicated. Then it is shown how the verified specifications can be transformed into another descriptive model, a processing machine which is more directly related to hardware implementation. The processing machine description resulting from this model simplifies the last stage of protocol design, that of the realization.
