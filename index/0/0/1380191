We study the problem of finding the best head-driven parsing strategy for Linear Context-Free Rewriting System productions. A head-driven strategy must begin with a specified righthand-side nonterminal (the head) and add the remaining nonterminals one at a time in any order. We show that it is NP-hard to find the best head-driven strategy in terms of either the time or space complexity of parsing.
