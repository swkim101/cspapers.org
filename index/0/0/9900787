While recent work has begun to address this issue by working towards learning aspects of an HTN model from demonstration, or even the whole framework, the focus so far has been on simple domains, which lack many of the challenges faced in the real world such as imperfect information and real-time environments. I plan to extend this work using the domain of real-time strategy (RTS) games, which have gained recent popularity as a challenging and complex domain for AI research.
