Driving while being tired or distracted is dangerous. We are developing the CafeSafe app for Android phones, which fuses information from both front and back cameras and others embedded sensors on the phone to detect and alert drivers to dangerous driving conditions in and outside of the car. CarSafe uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms on the phone to monitor and detect whether the driver is tired or distracted using the front camera while at the same time tracking road conditions using the back camera. CarSafe is the first dual-camera application for smart-phones.
