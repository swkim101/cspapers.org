We consider the nearest-neighbor problem over the d-cube: given a collection of points in {0, 1}d, find the one nearest to a query point (in the L1 sense). We establish a lower bound of Î©(log log d/ log log log d) on the worst-case query time. This result holds in the cell probe model with (any amount of) polynomial storage and word-size d O(1) . The same lower bound holds for the approximate version of the problem, where the answer may be any point further than the nearest neighbor by a factor as large as \( 2^{\left\lfloor {(\log d)^{1 - \varepsilon } } \right\rfloor } \) , for any fixed e > 0.
