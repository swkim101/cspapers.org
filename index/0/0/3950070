This paper presents an integrated framework to enable using standard non-sequential machine learning tools for accurate multi-modal activity recognition. We develop a novel framework that contains simple pre- and post-classification strategies to improve the overall performance. We achieve this through class-imbalance correction on the learning data using structure preserving oversampling (SPO), leveraging the sequential nature of sensory data using smoothing of the predicted label sequence and classifier fusion, respectively. Through evaluation on recent publicly available activity datasets comprising of a large amount of multi-dimensional sensory data, we demonstrate that our proposed strategies are effective in improving classification performance over common techniques such as One Nearest Neighbor (1NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Our framework also shows better performance over sequential probabilistic models, such as Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and when these models are used as meta-learners.
