Over the past 20 years, websites have grown increasingly complex and interconnected. In 2016, only a negligible number of sites are dependency free, and over 90% of sites rely on external content. In this paper, we investigate the current state of web dependencies and explore two security challenges associated with the increasing reliance on external services: (1) the expanded attack surface associated with serving unknown, implicitly trusted third-party content, and (2) how the increased set of external dependencies impacts HTTPS adoption. We hope that by shedding light on these issues, we can encourage developers to consider the security risks associated with serving third-party content and prompt service providers to more widely deploy HTTPS.
