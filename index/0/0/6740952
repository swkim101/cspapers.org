I shall present an extension of Moggi's computational metalanguage with primitives from linear logic, the enriched effect-calculus. Illustrative applications to side effects, continuations, nondeterminism and polymorphism will be considered. The talk is based on joint work with Jeff Egger and Rasmus Mogelberg.
