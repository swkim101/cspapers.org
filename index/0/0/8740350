Professional software developers depend on version control every day and that dependency will continue to grow as advances in version control technology continue. Students with experience using version control are more prepared and qualified to work in industry. We should expose students to version control early in their training not only as an additional skill but also as a tool to improve the learning experience. Version control can be leveraged to greatly improve assignment submission, grading, and feedback systems. In this session we will discuss strategies for incorporating the use of version control in the classroom as well as best practices for individual and group work submission, grading and feedback.
