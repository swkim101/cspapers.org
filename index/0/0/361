In this work we introduce Dynamic Random Geometric Graphs as a basic rough model for mobile wireless sensor networks, where communication distances are set to the known threshold for connectivity of static random geometric graphs. We provide precise asymptotic results for the expected length of the connectivity and disconnectivity periods of the network. We believe the formal tools developed in this work could be of use in future studies in more concrete settings. In addition, for static random geometric graphs at the threshold for connectivity, we provide asymptotic expressions on the probability of existence of components according to their sizes.
