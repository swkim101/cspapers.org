This paper presents the design, implementation and control of a device intented to mechanically improve the safety of serial robots interacting with humans. The device consists of an electronically adjustable torque limiter placed in series with each actuator, referred to as a Series Clutch Actuator (SCA). By appropriately adjusting the limit torques according to the robot's configuration, the maximum static force that the robot can apply to its environment at the Tool Centre Point (TCP) can be limited to a prescribed safe level. If a limit torque is exceeded, the SCA slips and an emergency stop is triggered while the inertia located upstream from the SCA in the kinematic chain is mechanically disconnected. A method is presented to determine the optimal limit torques that maximize the isotropically achievable force (which can be applied in all directions without triggering any SCA) while satisfying the safe force limit. An approach to optimize the pose of a redundant robot in order to maximize the isotropically achievable force while preserving a safe maximum force threshold is also proposed. The design and fabrication of a torque limiter using a large number of friction discs is presented. Finally, the mechanisms are implemented into a 4-DOF redundant serial arm and preliminary experimental results are presented.
