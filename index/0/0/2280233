This paper presents a system for the social annotation and discovery of videos based on social networks and social knowledge. The system, developed as a web application, allows users to comment and annotate, manually and automatically, video frames and scenes enriching their content with tags, references to Facebook users and pages and Wikipedia resources. These annotations are used to semantically model the interests and the folksonomy of each user and resource in the network, and to suggest to users new resources, Facebook friends and videos whose content is related to their interests. A screencast showing an example of these functionalities is publicly available at:http://vimeo.com/miccunifi/facetube
