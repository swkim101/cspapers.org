We resolve the question of whether Fourier sampling can efficiently solve the hidden subgroup problem in general groups. Specifically, we show that the hidden subgroup problem in the symmetric group cannot be efficiently solved by strong Fourier sampling. Indeed we prove the stronger statement that no measurement of a single coset state can reveal more than an exponentially small amount of information about the identity of the hidden subgroup, in the special case relevant to the graph isomorphism problem.
