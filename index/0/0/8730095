This paper addresses issues that arose in applying the model for discourse entity (DE) generation in B. Webber's work (1978, 1983) to an interactive multimodal interface. Her treatment was extended in 4 areas: (1) the notion of context dependence of DEs was formalized in an intensional logic, (2) the treatment of DEs for indefinite NPs was modified to use skolem functions, (3) the treatment of dependent quantifiers was generalized, and (4) DEs originating from non-linguistic sources, such as pointing actions, were taken into account. The discourse entities are used in intra- and extra-sentential pronoun resolution in BBN Janus.
