Prior approaches to sentence compression have taken low level syntactic constraints into account in order to maintain grammaticality. We propose and successfully evaluate a more comprehensive, generalizable feature set that takes syntactic and structural relationships into account in order to sustain variable compression rates while making compressed sentences more coherent, grammatical and readable.
