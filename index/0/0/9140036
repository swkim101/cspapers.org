Computer science students must often be able to mentally execute "static" source code to envision "dynamic" changes in data structures. This is a difficult skill to acquire, however, the computer itself can help students develop such talents through well designed simulations. This paper reports on one such simulation, recursive traversals of binary trees, developed as part of an NSF grant. The processes of pedagogical design, screen design, top down program coding, and field testing are described in detail. Based on these field tests, it is clear that simulations help students understand difficult concepts, such as reeursion and tree traversals.
