We consider the price of anarchy of pure Nash equilibria in congestion games with linear latency functions. For asymmetric games, the price of anarchy of maximum social cost is Θ(√N), where N is the number of players. For all other cases of symmetric or asymmetric games and for both maximum and average social cost, the price of anarchy is 5/2. We extend the results to latency functions that are polynomials of bounded degree. We also extend some of the results to mixed Nash equilibria.
