We present a novel approach to weakly supervised semantic class learning from the web, using a single powerful hyponym pattern combined with graph structures, which capture two properties associated with pattern-based extractions: popularity and productivity. Intuitively, a candidate is popular if it was discovered many times by other instances in the hyponym pattern. A candidate is productive if it frequently leads to the discovery of other instances. Together, these two measures capture not only frequency of occurrence, but also cross-checking that the candidate occurs both near the class name and near other class members. We developed two algorithms that begin with just a class name and one seed instance and then automatically generate a ranked list of new class instances. We conducted experiments on four semantic classes and consistently achieved high accuracies.
