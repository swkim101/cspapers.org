We show how the subtype relation of the well-known system F<, the second-order polymorphic A-calculus with bounded u~lversal type quantification and subtyping, due to Cardelli, Wegner, Bruce, Longo, Curien, Ghelli [6, 2, 8], proved undecidable by Pierce [12], can be interpreted in the (weak) monadic second-order theory of one (Buchi), two (Rabin), several, or infinitely many successor functions [13, 14]. These (W) SnS-interpretations show that the undecidable system F< possesses consistent decidable extensions, i.e., F< is not essentially undecidable (Tarski et. al., 1949, [17]). We demonstrate an infinite class of “structural” decidable extensions of F<, which combine traditional subtype inference rules with the above (W) SnS-interpretations. All these extensions, which we call systems F~ti, are still more powerful than F<, but less coarse than th~ direct (W) SnSinterpretations: F< C F~& C (lV)SnS-interpretations — The main distinctive features of the systems F~fi are: 1) decidabilit y, 2) closure w.r.t. transitivity; 37 structuredness, e.g., they never subtype a functional type to a universal one or vice versa, 4) they all contain the powerful rule for subtyping boundedly quantified types:
