In any competitive business, success is based on the ability to make an item more appealing to customers than the competition. A number of questions arise in the context of this task: how do we formalize and quantify the competitiveness relationship between two items? Who are the true competitors of a given item? What are the features of an item that most affect its competitiveness? Despite the impact and relevance of this problem to many domains, only a limited amount of work has been devoted toward an effective solution. In this paper, we present a formal definition of the competitiveness between two items. We present efficient methods for evaluating competitiveness in large datasets and address the natural problem of finding the top-k competitors of a given item. Our methodology is evaluated against strong baselines via a user study and experiments on multiple datasets from different domains.
