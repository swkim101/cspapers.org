While designing new manifold learning algorithms has attracted much research attention, fewer research efforts have been focused on out-of-sample extrapolation of learned manifold. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm of manifold learning. The proposed algorithm, namely Local and Global Regressive Mapping (LGRM), employs local regression models to grasp the manifold structure. We additionally impose a global regression term as regularization to learn a model for out-of-sample data extrapolation. Based on the algorithm, we propose a new manifold learning framework. Our framework can be applied to any manifold learning algorithms to simultaneously learn the low dimensional embedding of the training data and a model which provides explicit mapping of the out-of-sample data to the learned manifold. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework uncover the manifold structure precisely and can be freely applied to unseen data.
