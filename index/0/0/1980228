Simulating asynchronous multiple-loop networks is commonly considered a difficult task for parallel programming. This paper presents two examples of asynchronous multiple-loop networks: a stylized queuing system and an Ising model. The network topology in both cases is an nX n grid on a torus. A new distributed simulation algorithm is demonstrated on these two examples. The algorithm combines three elements: 1) the bounded lag restriction, 2) precomputed minimal propagation delays, and 3) the so-called opaque periods. Theoretical performance evaluation suggests that if N processing elements (PEs) execute the algorithm in parallel and the simulated system exhibits sufficient density of events, then, in average, processing one event would require &Ogr;(logN) instructions of one PE. In practice, the algorithm has achieved substantial speed-ups: the speed-up is greater than 16 using 25 PEs on a shared memory MIMD bus computer, and greater than 1900 using 214 PEs on a SIMD computer.
