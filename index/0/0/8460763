The need to teach user interface design concepts is shown both in recent computer science curriculum proposals and from experience with student programs. This paper describes an individual study hypertext module called UID Tutorial which surveys interface design principles and provides examples of good and bad interfaces. The module includes a hands-on tutorial and demonstration of the basic topics of user interface design in a way that cannot be accomplished by lecture alone. Experience using the module is reported and future needs are discussed.
