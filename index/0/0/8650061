Recently there has been a lot of interest in learning common representations for multiple views of data. Typically, such common representations are learned using a parallel corpus between the two views (say, 1M images and their English captions). In this work, we address a real-world scenario where no direct parallel data is available between two views of interest (say, $V_1$ and $V_2$) but parallel data is available between each of these views and a pivot view ($V_3$). We propose a model for learning a common representation for $V_1$, $V_2$ and $V_3$ using only the parallel data available between $V_1V_3$ and $V_2V_3$. The proposed model is generic and even works when there are $n$ views of interest and only one pivot view which acts as a bridge between them. There are two specific downstream applications that we focus on (i) transfer learning between languages $L_1$,$L_2$,...,$L_n$ using a pivot language $L$ and (ii) cross modal access between images and a language $L_1$ using a pivot language $L_2$. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in multilingual document classification on the publicly available multilingual TED corpus and promising results in multilingual multimodal retrieval on a new dataset created and released as a part of this work.
