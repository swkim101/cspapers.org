We propose a new, active scheme for fast and reliable detection of P2P malware by exploiting the enemies' strength against them. Our new scheme works in two phases: host-level dynamic binary analysis to automatically extract built-in remotely-accessible/controllable mechanisms (referred to as Malware Control Birthmarks or MCB) in P2P malware, followed by network-level informed probing for detection. Our new design demonstrates a novel combination of the strengths from both host-based and network-based approaches. Compared with existing detection solutions, it is fast, reliable, and scalable in its detection scope. Furthermore, it can be applicable to more than just P2P malware, more broadly any malware that opens a service port for network communications (e.g., many Trojans/backdoors). We develop a prototype system, PeerPress, and evaluate it on many representative real-world P2P malware (including Storm, Conficker, and more recent Sality). The results show that it can effectively detect the existence of malware when MCBs are extracted, and the detection occurs in an early stage during which other tools (e.g., BotHunter) typically do not have sufficient information to detect. We further discuss its limitations and implications, and we believe it is a great complement to existing passive detection solutions.
