Many applications can benefit from the capability to simultaneously and independently use arbitrarily sized but separate spectrum fragments with a single radio and antenna. By this capability we mean that the radio can simultaneously transmit, simultaneously receive, or simultaneously transmit and receive on arbitrary but separate spectrum fragments. For example, we can use it for spectrum aggregation in fragmented ISM bands as shown in as shown in Fig. 2(A). A WiFi AP can run independent OFDM PHY and CSMA MAC protocols on two WiFi channels to simultaneously serve two legacy WiFi clients assigned to different channels and achieve significantly higher throughput than a legacy AP that is restricted to use only one channel at a time. Similarly, a WiFi client radio with such a capability can use it to simultaneously connect to multiple WiFi APs on different channels and obtain a much higher aggregate throughput than current radios that can transmit or receive on only one channel at a time.
