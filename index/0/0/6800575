Annotating documents has long been a widely used strategy for distilling important contents and externalizing related thoughts and ideas in context. No one has studied the activity of annotating dynamic texts, such as online chat, although online conversation is an important communication media for global companies. In this paper, we investigate Instant Annotation (IA), a real-time annotation-enhanced chat tool. We contrast the use of the enhanced chat tool to a standard chat tool for multilingual groups doing a brainstorming and decision-making task. Results show that group satisfaction and perceived control of the conversation are enhanced for the participants who used IA. We also report new patterns of annotation use and discuss design implications for group chat tools.
