The problem of view updates in deductive databases is studied by casting this in a naturally associated abductive framework. It is shown that this abductive approach deals successfully, in a simple yet powerful way, with the difficulties related to the presence of negation in the database and provides a uniform common procedure for insert and delete update requests. This procedure is formally defined and its correctness and completeness is investigated. The abductive formalization of the update problem allows for a natural generalization of the basic update procedure in various ways. One important such extension is the fact the integrity checking asssociated with any update request can be dynamically incorporated into the update procedure so that potential inconsistent solutions to the request are trapped and rejected during their generation. It is also possible to extend the abductive approach to handle general non ground requests using constructive abduction and an associated form of constructive negation.
