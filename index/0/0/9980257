This paper will present a knowledge layer used by a hierarchical on-road driving planner that represents a road network as a discrete set of attributed road states. This knowledge layer facilitates the construction of a planning graph by providing simulation and prediction services to the planning system. These services allow the determination of possible spatial transitions along a road network that a vehicle may take from its current location given its current state.
