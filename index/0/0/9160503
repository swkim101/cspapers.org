This paper studies modeling and bio-mimetic control of a 3D 8-dof whole arm cooperative manipulation system using sensitive skin. A sphere is considered here as a manipulated object. The control law is designed based on integration of voluntary and reflex movements considering the system's redundancy. The voluntary task for holding the object is realized by impedance control at the four contact points with the object using the contact force information from the sensitive skin. The reflection on the other hand is introduced as a regulation problem of the direction between the points of end-effectors and elbows. The solution for the redundant control is formulated and derived from the optimization point of view. The validity of the proposed method is investigated by numerical simulations.
