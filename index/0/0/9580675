With the exponentially growing amount of available data on the Web over the last years, several projects have been created to automatically extract knowledge from this information set. As the data domains on the Web are too wide, most of these projects store the acquired knowledge in ontological knowledge bases (OKBs). Mapping it into graph-based representation makes possible to apply graph-mining techniques to extract implicit information. However most of these projects treat the mapping process using different adjustments in several ways, thus, there is not a standard mapping process or a formal way defifined to do this task. In this paper we formally describe a graph structure called Ontological Network and how it can be used to map an Ontological Knowledge Base. We also show some graph-mining based algorithms to add new facts and to extend the ontology of an OKB while mapped into an Ontological Network as example.
