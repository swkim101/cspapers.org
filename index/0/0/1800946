High precision manipulation becomes a recurrent need in micro or nanoscale. Microrobots based on active material were designed to perform micromanipulation tasks in various environments such as microrobotic stations or electronic microscopes (SEM, TEM). These active materials are used to generate proportional actuation, but show some drawbacks we want to avoid (non linearity, integration of sensors, â€¦). In this paper we propose a new type of microrobot, called digital microrobot. It is based on the use of bistable modules (Fig. 1), and generates a discrete workspace. This microrobot can be used in open-loop mode and gets rid of bulky and expensive instruments and sensor integration. Moreover, no external energy is required to maintain the microrobot in a given position. The study presented in this paper is dedicated to the design of the robotic structure in order to generate a desired workspace.
