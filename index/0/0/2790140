Safety-critical systems certification is a complex endeavor. Regulating agencies are moving to goal-based standards in an effort to remedy significant problems of prescriptive standards. However, goal-based standards introduce new difficulties into the development and certification processes. In this work I introduce Certification-Based Development, or CBD. CBD is a process framework designed to mitigate these difficulties by meeting the needs of a specific certifying agency with regard to a specific system.
