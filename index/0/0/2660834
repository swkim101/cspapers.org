We consider the problem of constructing public-key encryption schemes that are resilient to chosen-ciphertext and key-leakage attach. In this paper, we present a generic construction of public-key encryption that is resilient to this attack from any 1-universal hash proof system and any 4-wise independent hash function. As shown in the paper [6] they can be instantiated with efficient schemes based on standard intractability assumptions such as Decisional Diffie-Hellman, Quadratic Residuosity, and Pailliers Decisional Composite Residuosity.
