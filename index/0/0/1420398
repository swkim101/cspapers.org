Building robust and reliable autonomous navigation systems that generalize across environments and operating scenarios remains a core challenge in robotics. Machine learning has proven a significant aid in this task; in recent years learning from demonstration has become especially popular, leading to improved systems while requiring less expert tuning and interaction. However, these approaches still place a burden on the expert, specifically to choose the best demonstrations to provide. This work proposes two approaches for active learning from demonstration, in which the learning system requests specific demonstrations from the expert. The approaches identify examples for which expert demonstration is predicted to provide useful information on concepts which are either novel or uncertain to the current system. Experimental results demonstrate both improved generalization performance and reduced expert interaction when using these approaches.
