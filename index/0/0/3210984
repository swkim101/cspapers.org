In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of iPlane, a scalable service providing accurate predictions of Internet path performance for emerging overlay services. Unlike the more common black box latency prediction techniques in use today, iPlane adopts a structural approach and predicts end-to-end path performance by composing the performance of measured segments of Internet paths. For the paths we observed, this method allows us to accurately and efficiently predict latency, bandwidth, capacity and loss rates between arbitrary Internet hosts. We demonstrate the feasibility and utility of the iPlane service by applying it to several representative overlay services in use today: content distribution, swarming peer-to-peer filesharing, and voice-over-IP. In each case, using iPlane's predictions leads to improved overlay performance.
