We give an adaptive algorithm that tests whether an unknown Boolean function f: {0,1}^n -&#x2248; {0, 1} is unate (i.e. every variable of f is either non-decreasing or non-increasing) or &#x2265;-far from unate with one-sided error and O(n^{3/4}/&#x2265;^2) many queries. This improves on the best adaptive O(n/&#x2265;)-query algorithm from Baleshzar, Chakrabarty, Pallavoor, Raskhodnikova and Seshadhri when 1/&#x3b5;
