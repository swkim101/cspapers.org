We propose an algorithm for area optimisation of sequential circuits through redundancy removal. The algorithm finds compatible redundancies by implying values over nets in the circuit. The potentially exponential cost of state space traversal is avoided and the redundancies found can all be removed at once. The optimised circuit is a safe delayed replacement of the original circuit. The algorithm computes a set of compatible sequential redundancies and simplifies the circuit by propagating them through the circuit. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm even for large circuits through experimental results on benchmark circuits.
