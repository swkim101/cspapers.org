This paper explores practical and conceptual implications of using Server-Aided Signatures (SAS). SAS is a signature method that relies on partiallytrusted servers for generating public key signatures for regular users. Besides its two primary goals of 1) aiding small, resource-limited devices in computing heavy-weight (normally expensive) digital signatures and 2) fast certificate revocation, SAS also offers signature causality and has some interesting features such as built-in attack detection for users and DoS resistance for servers.
