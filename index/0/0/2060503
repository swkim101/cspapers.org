In this paper we present a new approach to critiquing-based conversational recommendation, which we call History-Aware Critiquing (HAC). It takes a case-based reasoning approach by reusing relevant recommendation sessions of past users to short-cut the recommendation session of the current user. It selects relevant recommendation sessions from a case base that contains the successful recommendation sessions of past users. A past recommendation session can be selected if it contains similar recommended items to the ones in the current session and its critiques sufficiently overlap with the critiques so far in the current session. HAC extends experience-based critiquing (EBC). Our experimental results show that, in terms of recommendation efficiency, while EBC performs better than standard critiquing (STD), it does not perform as well as more recent techniques such as incremental critiquing (IC), whereas HAC achieves better recommendation efficiency over both STD and IC.
