Today's working world of knowledge workers is changing rapidly. The available information that they need to process is ever growing. In addition, the characteristics of their work are changing as people can and do their work from home. This has resulted in the need to support knowledge workers in order to prevent burnouts. The project SWELL (http://www.swell-project.net) targets this by developing systems that support user's mental and physical well-being at work and at home. In the PhD project presented in this abstract we aim at maintaining well-being at work through information support.
