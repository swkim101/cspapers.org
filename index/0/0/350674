The torso of a humanoid robot is a fundamental part of its kinematic structure because it defines the reachable workspace, supports the entire upper-body and can be used to control the position of the center of mass. The majority of the torso joints are designed exploiting serial or differential mechanisms, while parallel kinematic structures are less used mainly because of their greater design complexity. This paper describes the design and construction of a 4 degrees of freedom (DoF) torso for our new humanoid robot. Three degrees of freedom, namely roll, pitch and heave, have been implemented using a 3 DoF parallel kinematic structure, while the fourth DoF, namely yaw, has been implemented with a rotational joint on top of the parallel structure. The design has been optimized to reduce the cost and the volume of the system. A first prototype of the torso has been constructed and validated with respect to our design requirements. Eventually, experimental tests have been conducted to assess the functionality of the proposed system.
