This method employs the update rule of the regularized dual averaging (RDA) method proposed by Xiao, but only on the subsequence of training examples where a classification error is made. We derive a bound on the number of mistakes made by this method on the training set, as well as its generalization error rate. We also intro- duce the concept of relative strength of regularization, and show how it affects the mistake bound and gener- alization performance. We examine the method using l1-regularization on a large-scale natural language pro- cessing task, and obtained state-of-the-art classification performance with fairly sparse models.
