This paper proposes a methodology that uses hybrid systems to model multiple robots in the execution of cooperative tasks. Basically, each robot is represented by a hybrid automation and the cooperative task execution is modeled by the composition of several automata. We describe in details our approach to perform the composition of these automata and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology modeling a cooperative manipulation task.
