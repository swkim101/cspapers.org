However,current metrics of flexibility ignore domain knowledge about how such constraints might arise in practice, e.g., due to the uncertain duration of a robotâ€™s transitiontime from one location to another. Probabilistic temporalplanning accounts for actions whose uncertain durations can be modeled with probability density functions. We introduce a new metric called robustness that measures the likelihood of success for probabilistic temporalplans. We show empirically that in multi-robot planning,robustness may be a better metric for assessing the quality of temporal plans than flexibility, thus reframing many popular scheduling optimization problems.
