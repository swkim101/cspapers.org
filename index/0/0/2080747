We describe the 3D Twins Expression Challenge (“3D TEC”) in the area of 3D face recognition. The supporting dataset contains 3D scans of pairs of identical twins taken with two different facial expressions, neutral and smiling. The dataset is smaller than the FRGC v2 dataset by approximately a factor of ten, but is still more challenging than the FRGC v2 dataset due to it containing twins with different expressions. We evaluate the performance of a modern 3D face recognition algorithm against the dataset and demonstrate that distinguishing between identical twins is a difficult problem which becomes more difficult when expressions come into play. This challenge problem will help to push the frontiers of 3D face recognition.
