Personal instrumentation and monitoring services that collect and archive the physical activities of a user have recently been introduced for various medical, personal, safety, and entertainment purposes. A general software architecture is needed to support different categories of such monitoring services. This paper presents a software architecture, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of SATIRE, a wearable personal monitoring service transparently embedded in user garments. SATIRE records the owner's activity and location for subsequent automated uploading and archiving. The personal archive can later be searched for particular events to answer questions regarding past and present user activity, location, and behavior patterns. A short feasibility and usage study of a prototype based on MicaZ motes provides a proof of concept for the SATIRE architecture.
