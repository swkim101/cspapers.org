Instagram, an online photo-sharing platform, has gained increasing popularity. It allows users to take photos, apply digital filters and share them with friends instantaneously by using mobile devices.Instagram provides users with the functionality to associate their photos with points of interest, and it thus becomes feasible to study the association between points of interest and Instagram photos. However, no previous work studies the association. In this paper, we propose to study the problem of mapping Instagram photos to points of interest. To understand the problem, we analyze Instagram datasets, and report our findings, which also characterize the challenges of the problem. To address the challenges, we propose to model the mapping problem as a ranking problem, and develop a method to learn a ranking function by exploiting the textual, visual and user information of photos. To maximize the prediction effectiveness for textual and visual information, and incorporate the users' visiting preferences, we propose three subobjectives for learning the parameters of the proposed ranking function. Experimental results on two sets of Instagram data show that the proposed method substantially outperforms existing methods that are adapted to handle the problem.
