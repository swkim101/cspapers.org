How do we break away from existing tools and techniques in HCI and truly innovate in a way that benefits the next generation of computer users? Today, too many of our technological designs and inventions are "one off" point designs, not building on or contributing to a theoretical foundation of understanding around human perception, cognition, social behavior and physical movement. Of course, these point designs can be successful in and of themselves, so why bother with theory and models? In order to mature as a field in a way that benefits users, it can be argued that we need to work more closely together and with an awareness of multiple disciplines, including not just the computer science and engineering arenas, but also psychology, sociology, and any field of human behavior. Of course, this could be a daunting task-how do we know that important improvements in user interface design can be obtained?
 I will present a series of examples of what I consider to be significant contributions to the field of HCI, each based on a multidisciplinarian, theory-driven approach. I hope to challenge the audience to creatively consider ways that their own work could be more theoretically motivated, and what it might take for more of us to move forward in that direction.
