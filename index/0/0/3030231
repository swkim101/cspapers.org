This paper describes the design of a general purpose deduction engine for use in expert systems. It represents an extension of a natural deduction theorem prover that has eliminated the negation symbol in favor of certainty factors and has an improved method of splitting problems into subproblems. Formulas are object-centered and are stored at nodes which are designed to control and provide sharper focus to the search. These nodes either are pointed to by words in a dictionary or are created by the deduction engine in its attempt to solve a specific problem.
