Object-relational DBMS was gradually added as a new topic to the author's database course in response to the rapid changes in DBMS technology in the real world. Implementation of ORDBMS technology in a traditional relational database course had significant impacts on the database curriculum.

Course design, teaching methodology, class activities and the outcome of the course are discussed.
