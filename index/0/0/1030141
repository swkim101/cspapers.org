This paper shows through faithfully deriving Paffian forms of 3D rolling contact constraints that 3D pinching can be stabilized by using a pair of robot fingers with a hemispherical soft tip and minimum degrees of freedom under the gravity effect. The proposed control input is based on fingers-thumb opposition without using object information or external sensing. Stability analysis of the closed-loop dynamics is presented by using a Lyapunov method. Finally, for the sake of confirmation of effectiveness of the proposed control signals, numerical simulations are carried out.
