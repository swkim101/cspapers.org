Previous text processing techniques focus on text itself while neglecting human reading process. Therefore they are limited in special applications. This paper proposes a text scanning mechanism for generating the dynamic impressions of words in text by simulating recall, association and forget processes during reading. Experiments show that the mechanism is suitable for multiple text processing applications.
