This paper presents a systematic and general technique for establishing a set of motions suitable for use with sensor systems, by drawing performable and measurable motions directly from users. It uses reinforcement which rewards originality to induce users to explore the space of motions they can perform. A decomposition of movements into motion primitives is constructed, among which a meaningful originality metric can be defined. Because the originality measure is defined in terms of the sensed input, the resulting space contains only movements which can both be performed and sensed. We show how this can be used to evaluate the relative performance of different joint user-sensor systems, providing objective analyses of gesture lexicons with regard to the technical limitations of sensors and humans. In particular, we show how the space of motions varies across the arm for a body-mounted inertial sensor.
