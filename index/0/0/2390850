A tap control technique for headphones is proposed. A simple circuit is used to detect tapping of the headphone shell by using the speaker unit in the headphone as a tap sensor. No additional devices are required in the headphone shell and cable, so the user can use their favorite headphones as a controller while listening music. A prototype is implemented with several calibration processes to compensate the differences in headphones and users' tapping actions. Tests confirm that the user can control a music player by tapping regular headphones.
