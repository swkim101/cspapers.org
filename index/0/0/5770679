Current Internet congestion control protocols operate independently on a per-flow basis. Recent work has demonstrated that cooperative congestion control strategies between flows can improve performance for a variety of applications, ranging from aggregated TCP transmissions to multiple-sender multicast applications. However, in order for this cooperation to be effective, one must first identify the flows that are congested at the same set of resources. In this paper, we present techniques based on loss or delay observations at end-hosts to infer whether or not two flows experiencing congestion are congested at the same network resources. We validate these techniques via queueing analysis, simulation, and experimentation within the Internet.
