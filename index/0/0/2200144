Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is one of the most commonly used power reduction techniques in high-performance processors. DVFS varies the frequency and voltage of a microprocessor in real-time according to processing needs. Although there are different versions of DVFS, at its core DVFS adapts power consumption and performance to the current workload of the CPU. Specifically, existing DVFS techniques in high-performance processors select an operating point (CPU frequency and voltage) based on the utilization of the processor. This approach integrates OS-level control, but such control is pessimistic. Existing DVFS techniques are pessimistic about the user. Indeed, they ignore the user, assuming that CPU utilization or the OS events prompting it are sufficient proxies. A high CPU utilization simply leads to a high frequency and high voltage, regardless of the userâ€™s satisfaction or expectation of performance. Existing DVFS techniques are pessimistic about the CPU. They assume worst-case manufacturing process variation and operating temperature by basing their policies on loose worstcase bounds given by the processor manufacturer. A voltage level for a given frequency is set such that even the worst shipped processor of a given generation will be stable at the highest specified temperature. In response to these observations, we have developed, implemented, and evaluated the following two new power management techniques that can be readily employed independently or together. We elaborate on these techniques in detail elsewhere [4].
