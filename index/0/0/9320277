The ideal local area network is a mechanism which provides concurrent high speed error-free data paths over a limited geographical area and between any computational entities on the network. A computational entity may be a program running on any type of computer, any intelligent device, or any terminal. This means that such an ideal network must be able to support systems of cooperating processes within disjoint and dissimilar host environments. Achieving such an ideal heterogeneous network (referred to as an “open” network with respect to the ISO Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection) may be impossible in the limit. However, the ideal shows promise of being approachable. Recent work in local area networks, protocols, and multiprocessor operating systems looks promising for attacking the problem. This paper first discusses data paths and the dilemma of heterogeneous data communications. Existing local area networks, their functionality, shortcomings, and relationship to networking standards are described. Commercial LANs are discussed and classified. Standards, high level protocols, and operating system concepts are discussed and related to networks. Finally some possible approaches to the implementation of hetergeneous networks are discussed.
