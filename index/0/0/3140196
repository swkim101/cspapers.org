We propose an ISA extension that decouples the data access and register write operations in a load instruction. We describe system and hardware support for decoupled loads. Furthermore, we show how compilers can generate better static instruction schedules by hoisting a decoupled load's data access above may-alias stores and branches. We find that decoupled loads improve performance with geometric mean speedups of 8.4%.
