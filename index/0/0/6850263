Dynamo augments current BPEL technology with self-healing capabilities. Dedicated supervision rules allow the designer to set the amount of checks that must be performed at runtime and how the BPEL process must react whether anomalies arise. The technological underpinnings come from assertion languages and rule-based systems. The implementation exploits aspects and a rule engine to extend ActiveBPEL with self-healing capabilities.
