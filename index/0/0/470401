This paper outlines the system architecture and the core data structures of Kalchas, a fulltext search engine for XML data with emphasis on dynamic indexing, and identifies features worth demonstrating. The concept of dynamic index implies that the aim is to re ect the creation of, deletion of, and updates to relevant files in the search index as early as possible. This is achieved by a number of techniques, including ideas drawn from partitioned B-Trees and inverted indices. The actual ranked retrieval of document is implemented with XML-specific query operators for lowest common ancestor queries.A live demonstration will discuss Kalchas' behaviour in typical use cases, such as interactive editing sessions and bulk loading large amounts of static files as well as querying the contents of the indexed files; it tries to clarify both the short-comings and the advantages of the method.
