This is the proposal for the Third Workshop on Pervasive Urban Applications (PURBA 2013). The workshop aims to build on the success of the previous workshops organized in conjunction with the Pervasive 2011 and 2012, to continue to disseminate the results of the latest research outcomes and developments of ubiquitous computing technologies in urban areas. An IBM-Best student award will be given at the workshop.
