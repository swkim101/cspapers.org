This paper proposes the new thin wire production system and wire conveyance device in it. The thin wire production system consists of the conveyance module, thin film deposition module, processing module and so on. The conveyance module is a key component among them since it decides the specifications of wire and performance of production system. Proposed conveyance module consists of transportation unit and rotation unit. This paper proposes the new mechanism to generate the transportation by difference of rotation action of transportation unit and rotation unit. Also, this paper demonstrates of the new mechanism by experiments. The experimental results show the performance of the wire transportation, and the prototype achieved the requirement for the practical use such as transportation speed of 300 mm/s.
