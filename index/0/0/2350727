Knowledge workers use paper extensively for document reviewing and note-taking due to its versatility and simplicity of use. As users annotate printed documents and gather notes, they create a rich web of annotations and cross references. Unfortunately, as paper is a static media, this web often gets trapped in the physical world. While several digital solutions such as XLibris [15] and Digital Desk [18] have been proposed, they suffer from a small display size or onerous hardware requirements.To address these limitations, we propose PapierCraft, a gesture-based interface that allows users to manipulate digital documents directly using their printouts as proxies. Using a digital pen, users can annotate a printout or draw command gestures to indicate operations such as copying a document area, pasting an area previously copied, or creating a link. Upon pen synchronization, our infrastructure executes these commands and presents the result in a customized viewer. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of the PapierCraft command system, and report on early user feedback.
