J2EE and Microsoft.NET have emerged as two major frameworks for software development. Are they more similar than different or are the differences significant? How do they stack up against each other? This panel will offer a lively discussion from leaders of Microsoft and J2EE technologies.
 This panel will conducted using the 'Question Time' panel (http://martinfowler.com/bliki/QuestionTimePanel.html) format, so called as it's inspired by a popular British current affairs show. Panelists won't make any position statements; instead we'll go directly to the interesting material - the questions. All questions to the panel need to be submitted on cards during the panel and the chair will decide which questions form an interesting set to discuss. We'll spend longer on each question to allow the panelists to get into more depth than is typical on more rapid fire panels.
