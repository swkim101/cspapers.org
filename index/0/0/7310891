This paper considers the localization and navigation of a mobile robot. The control strategy is based on a nonlinear model predictive control technique that utilizes the Newton method. The robot localization is obtained using information from odometric and ultrasonic sensors through a Kalman filter. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method.
