This paper describes the use of a system which will allow effortless visualization and animation of standard C/C++ programs. The system brings alive programs so that students in CS 1 and CS 2 classes can more easily see each instruction and its effects. They can also see the effects of larger entities such as functions. The system serves as an excellent instructional tool and debugger.
