A massively-dense wireless sensor network may pose many challenges for efficient load-balancing routing algorithm design due to the problem scale and hardware constraints. One approach to mitigate such a scalability problem is to formulate the load-balancing routing problem as a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) through a geographic model. In this paper, we describe two well-known numerical approaches, namely finite difference method and finite element method, for solving the routing PDEs, and compare the quality of their derived routing directions in achieving routing load-balancing via simulations.
