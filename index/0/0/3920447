This short paper proposes a method to classify music video clips uploaded to a video sharing service into music mood categories such as 'cheerful,' 'wistful,' and 'aggressive.' The method leverages viewer comments posted to the music video clips for the music mood classification. It extracts specific features from the comments: (1) adjectives in comments, (2) lengthened words in comments, and (3) comments in chorus sections. Our experimental results classifying 695 video clips into six mood categories showed that our method outperformed the baseline in terms of macro and micro averaged F-measures. In addition, our method outperformed the existing approaches that utilize lyrics and audio signals of songs.
