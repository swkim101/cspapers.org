Today's large-scale softwareintensive systems exhibit an increasing complexity due to a broad spectrum of technical and socio-technical components. Due to the very dynamic character of such systems as well as fast evolving technologies, most requirements cannot be planned a priori. To overcome this problem, we suggest a method to gather enduser needs for requirements engineers at any time by applying a geographical deployed feedback system. End-user needs are gathered in-situ by utilizing mobile devices. In this paper, we present the implementation of our feedback system enabling end-users to submit feedback with smartphones at very low effort and cost.
