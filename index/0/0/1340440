Abstract : The thesis developed in this paper is that reasoning programs which take care to record the logical justifications for program beliefs can apply several powerful, but simple, domain-independent algorithms to: (1) maintain the consistency of program beliefs; (2) realize substantial search efficiencies; and (3) automatically summarize explanations of program beliefs. This report describes techniques for representing, recording, maintaining, and using justifications for beliefs. Also presented is an annotated implementation of a domain-independent program.
