The security aspects of autonomous robots are analyzed by modeling a robot as a set of sensors, effecters, optional communications resources, and processing elements whose behavior is tightly coupled to the sensed characteristics of its environment. A simple taxonomy of potential generic threat types is presented, comprising both the possible direct external threat paths and the derived consequent internal threat states. Several generic countermeasure strategies are proposed.
