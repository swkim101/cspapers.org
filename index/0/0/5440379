We study the problem of jointly embedding a knowledge base and a text corpus. The key issue is the alignment model making sure the vectors of entities, relations and words are in the same space. Wang et al. (2014a) rely on Wikipedia anchors, making the applicable scope quite limited. In this paper we propose a new alignment model based on text descriptions of entities, without dependency on anchors. We require the embedding vector of an entity not only to fit the structured constraints in KBs but also to be equal to the embedding vector computed from the text description. Extensive experiments show that, the proposed approach consistently performs comparably or even better than the method of Wang et al. (2014a), which is encouraging as we do not use any anchor information.
