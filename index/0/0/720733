TPC-DS is a new decision support benchmark currently under development by the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC). This paper provides a brief overview of the new benchmark. The benchmark models the decision support functions of a retail product supplier, including data loading, multiple types of queries and data maintenance. The database consists of multiple snowflake schemas with shared dimension tables; data is skewed; and the query set is large. Overall, the benchmark is considerably more realistic than previous decision support benchmarks.
