We consider a new model for computing with uncertainty. It is desired to compute a function f(X1,. . .,Xn), where X1, . . ., Xn are unknown but guaranteed to lie in specified intervals I1, . . ., In. It is possible to query the precise value of any Xj at a cost cj. The goal is to pin down the value of f to within a precision $\delta$ at a minimum possible cost. We focus on the selection function f which returns the value of the kth smallest argument. We present optimal offline and online algorithms for this problem.
