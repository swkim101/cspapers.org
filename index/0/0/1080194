The Marchitecture is a cognitive architecture for autonomous development of representations. The goals of The Marchitecture are domain independence, operating in the absence of knowledge engineering, learning an ontology of parameterized relational concepts, and elegance of design. To this end, The Marchitecture integrates classification, parsing, reasoning, and explanation. The Marchitecture assumes an ample amount of raw data to develop its representations, and it is therefore appropriate for long lived agents.
