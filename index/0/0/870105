In this paper, we describe a remote lab system that allows remote groups to access a shared PR2. This lab will enable a larger and more diverse group of researchers to participate directly in state-of-the-art robotics research and will improve the reproducibility and comparability of robotics experiments. We identify a set of requirements that apply to all web-based remote laboratories and focus on solutions to these requirements. Specifically, we present solutions to interface, control and design difficulties in the client and server-side software when implementing a remote laboratory architecture. The combination of shared physical hardware and shared middleware software allows for experiments that build upon and compare against results on the same platform and in the same environment for common tasks. We describe how researchers can interact with the PR2 and its environment remotely through a web interface, as well as develop similar interfaces to visualize and run experiments remotely.
