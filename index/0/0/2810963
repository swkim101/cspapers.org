In this paper, we describe an innovative tool that supports the design and evaluation of the information architecture of a Web site. The tool uses Latent Semantic Analysis and hierarchical clustering algorithms to provide optimal information navigation schemes in an automated manner. The proposed, tool-based, approach addresses the problem of reasonable content structuring, which established techniques such as card sorting also address. A real world case study depicted substantial effectiveness gain, without expense in the quality of results. We argue that such an approach could facilitate information-rich applications design, like most Web sites, by reducing time and resources required.
