Systems for text retrieval, routing, categorization and other IR tasks rely heavily on linear classifiers. We propose that two machine learning algorithms, the Widrow-Hoff and EG algorithms, be used in training linear text classifiers. In contrast to most IR methods, theoretical analysis provides performance guarantees and guidance on parameter settings for these algorithms. Experimental data is presented showing Widrow-Hoff and EG to be more effective than the widely used Rocchio algorithm on several categorization and routing tasks.
