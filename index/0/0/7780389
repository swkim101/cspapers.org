Optically actuated bubbles in oil were used as microrobots. Simulations of the thermocapillary fluid flow within the oil phase are used to illustrate the mechanisms driving the bubble actuation. Parallel manipulation of sub-millimeter objects including glass beads and hydrogel beads was demonstrated. These capabilities show the potential for using the bubble microrobots in biomedical or other microassembly applications.
