In this demo, we present Entity Relatedness Graph (EnRG), a focused related entities explorer, which provides the users with a dynamic set of filters and facets. It gives a ranked lists of related entities to a given entity, and clusters them using the different filters. For instance, using EnRG, one can easily find the American vegans related to Brad Pitt or Irish universities related to Semantic Web. Moreover, EnRG helps a user in discovering the provenance for implicit relations between two entities. EnRG uses distributional semantics to obtain the relatedness scores between two entities.
