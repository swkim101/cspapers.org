John V, Harrison Department of Computer Science University of Queensland Brisbanej QLD, 4072 Australia Active database systems react to pre-defined situations automatically without user intervention. The system detects when events occur and then triggers an action if a user-defined condition is satisfied. The types of events that can be detected and the expressiveness of the userdefined conditions are metrics of sophistication of an active database as they define the scope of real-world situations that can cause the system to react. This paper describes a situation monitor for an active database that can detect events affecting derived relations, as well as stored relations. The derived relations do not need to be materialized even if recursively defined or if the definition of the relations are modified. A novel representation for conditions that can express both states of stored relations as well as the implied states of the derived relations is described. The representation can be used to reason with the events to the stored relations as well as the detected events to the derived relations. The approach has been implemented to detect events and evaluate conditions for a prototype active deductaue database.
