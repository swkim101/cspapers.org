Let <i>S</i> be a set of <i>n</i> points in <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>. Given an integer 1 ≤ <i>k</i> ≤ <i>n</i>, we wish to find a <i>maximally separated subset I</i> ⊆ <i>S</i> of size <i>k;</i> this is a subset for which the minimum among the (<i><sup>k</sup></i><inf>2</inf>) pairwise distances between its points is as large as possible. The decision problem associated with this problem is to determine whether there exists <i>I</i> ⊆ <i>S</i>, |<i>I</i>| = <i>k</i>, so that all (<i><sup>k</sup></i><inf>2</inf>) pairwise distances in <i>I</i> are at least 2, say. This problem can also be formulated in terms of disk-intersection graphs: Let <i>D</i> be the set of unit disks centered at the points of <i>S.</i> The <i>disk-intersection</i> graph <i>G</i> of <i>D</i> connects pairs of disks by an edge if they have nonempty intersection. <i>I</i> is then the set of centers of disks that form an independent set in the graph <i>G.</i> This problem is known to be NP-Complete if <i>k</i> is part of the input.In this paper we first present a linear-time approximation algorithm for any constant <i>k.</i> Next we give <i>O(n</i><sup>4/3</sup>polylog(<i>n</i>)) exact algorithms for the cases <i>k</i> = 3 and <i>k</i> = 4. We also present a simpler <i>n<sup>O</sup></i>(√<i>k</i>)-time algorithm (as compared with the recent algorithm in [5]) for arbitrary values of <i>k.</i>
