This paper presents a pattern run-length compression method. Compression is conducted by encoding 2|n| runs of compatible or inversely compatible patterns into codewords in both views either inside a single segment or across multiple segments. With the provision of high compression flexibility, this method can achieve significant compression. Experimental results for the large ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits have demonstrated that the proposed approach can achieve up to 67.64% of average compression ratio.
