It is known from biological data that the response patterns of interneurons in the olfactory macroglomerulus (MGC) of insects are of central importance for the coding of the olfactory signal. We propose an analytically tractable model of the MGC which allows us to relate the distribution of response patterns to the architecture of the network.
