This paper describes a programming system based on the metaphor of communicating objects. Experience with a running system shows that this model provides flexibility, modularity and compactness. A compiled representation for the language is presented, along with an interpreter suitable for microcoding. The object-oriented model provides naturally efficient addressing; a corresponding virtual memory is described which offers dense utilization of resident space.
