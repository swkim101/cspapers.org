This paper describes an experiment comparing results of machine translation between two closely related languages, Czech and Slovak. The comparison is performed by means of two MT systems, one representing rule-based approach, the other one representing statistical approach to the task. Both sets of results are manually evaluated by native speakers of the target language. The results are discussed both from the linguistic and quantitative points of view.
