Representative algorithms for IC mask artwork analysis are described and compared. A novel IC mask analysis algorithm is described which does not restrict the representation of artwork, permits a wide range of functions, avoids pathologies, and achieves good runtime and tolerable main memory demands, even for LSI applications. Under reasonable assumptions about the distribution of artwork within the chip area, the algorithm is shown to achieve an expected runtime complexity of 0(E**(3/2)), where E is the number of edges in the artwork. Experience with LSI circuits is described.
