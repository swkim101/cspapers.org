We explore the use of a proposed general purpose programmable Storage/Logic Array chip (SLA) as a universal logic element for digital computers. Design examples are given to show how SLAs could be used in computer design. This approach to VLSI is compared and contrasted with other contending approaches using microprocessors, gate arrays and customized VLSI chips. The SLA appears attractive because of low cost, reasonable high performance and shorter implementation time.
