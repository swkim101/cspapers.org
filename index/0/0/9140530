Software reliability techniques are aimed at reducing or eliminat-ing failures in software systems. Reliability in software systems istypically measured during or after system implementation. How-ever, software engineering methodology lays stress on doing the"correct things" early on in the software development lifecycle inorder to curb development and maintenance costs. In this paper, wepropose a framework for reliability estimation of software compo-nents at the level of software architecture.
