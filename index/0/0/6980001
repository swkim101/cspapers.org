As traditional media and information devices integrate with the web, they must suddenly support a vastly larger database of relevant items. Many devices use remote controls with on-screen keyboards which are not well suited for text entry but are difficult to displace. We introduce a text entry method which significantly improves text entry speed for on-screen keyboards using the same simple Up/Down/Left/Right/Enter interface common to remote controls and gaming devices used to enter text. The paper describes QuickSuggest's novel adaptive user interface, demonstrates quantitative improvements from simulation results on millions of user queries and shows ease of use and efficiency with no learning curve in user experiments.
