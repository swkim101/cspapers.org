The popularity of microblogging platforms, such as Twitter, makes them important for information dissemination and sharing. However, they are also recognized as ideal places by spammers to conduct social spamming. Massive social spammers and spam messages heavily hurt the user experience and hinder the healthy development of microblogging systems. Thus, effectively detecting the social spammers and spam messages in microblogging is of great value. Existing studies mainly regard social spammer detection and spam message detection as two separate tasks. However, social spammers and spam messages have strong connections, since social spammers tend to post more spam messages and spam messages have high probabilities to be posted by social spammers. Combining social spammer detection with spam message detection has the potential to boost the performance of each task. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for social spammer and spam message co-detection in microblogging. Our framework utilizes the posting relations between users and messages to combine social spammer detection with spam message detection. In addition, we extract the social relations between users as well as the connections between messages, and incorporate them into our framework as regularization terms over the prediction results. Besides, we introduce an efficient optimization method to solve our framework. Extensive experiments on a real-world microblog dataset demonstrate that our framework can significantly and consistently improve the performance of both social spammer detection and spam message detection.
