A non-equijoin of relations R and S is R bnnd join if the join predicate requires valnes in the join att.ribr1t.e of R 10 fall within a specified hand ahcmt the valnrs in the join r.tt.rihnte of S. We propose a new algorithm. t.ermed a partitionerl hnnd join, for evaluating band joins. We present a comparison between the partitioned band ,join algorithm and the classical sort-merge join algorit.hm (op(.imixed for band ,jnins) using bot,h an analytical model and an implemenlaCon on top of the WiSS storage system. The results show that the partitioned ba.nd join algorithm outperforms sort.-merge unlrsp memory is scarce and t.he opernnda of t,he join are of equal size. We also describe a parallel implementation of the pnrtitioned band join on the Gamma database machine. and present data from speedup and scalcup experiments demonstrating that the partitioned hand join is efficiently paral-
