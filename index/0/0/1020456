Recently, millimeter wave communications in 60 GHz band have attracted considerable attention from academia, industry, and standards bodies. To overcome huge propagation loss, high gain directional antennas are used. Consequently, concurrent transmissions (spatial reuse) are enabled within a basic service set (BSS) and even among BSSs, which provides huge potential to improve the network capacity. In this paper, we propose a software-defined mmWave network architecture, where a centralized controller is introduced by abstracting the cross-layer control functions from the network layer to physical layer. Efficient coordination is achieved in this architecture to maximize the spatial reuse.
