Off-line robot dynamic identification methods are based on the use of the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model (IDIM), which calculates the joint forces/torques that are linear in relation to the dynamic parameters, and on the use of linear least squares technique to calculate the parameters (IDIM-LS technique). The joint forces/torques are calculated as the product of the known control signal (the current reference) by the joint drive gains. Then it is essential to get accurate values of joint drive gains to get accurate identification of inertial parameters. In the previous works, it was proposed to identify each gain separately. This does not allow taking into account the dynamic coupling between the robot axes. In this paper the global joint drive gains parameters of all joints are calculated simultaneously. The method is based on the total least squares solution of an over-determined linear system obtained with the inverse dynamic model calculated with available current reference and position sampled data while the robot is tracking one reference trajectory without load on the robot and one trajectory with a known payload fixed on the robot. The method is experimentally validated on an industrial StaÌˆubli TX-40 robot.
