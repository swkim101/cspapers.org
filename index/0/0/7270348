This paper describes the rule base management strategy of an expert system environment. The environment includes a set of integrated tools which facilitate acquisition, manipulation and maintenance of knowledge. The rule base management component of the system, called RBM, assists these tasks by organizing global semantic information within the rule base. RBM extracts this semantic information from the texts included in “rule structures” and builds a semantic network of the concepts found in the rule base. The rule base is then divided into rulesets which are clusters of rules that refer to the same atomic concept. Construction of this meta knowledge is achieved through a keyword matching mechanism. The paper includes a brief description of the RBM system, the dictionary it uses for building meta-level knowledge, and its keyword matching technique.
