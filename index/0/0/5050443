In this paper we present a formalization of behavior-based planning for nonholonomic robotic systems. This work provides a framework that integrates features of reactive planning models with modern control-theory-based robotic approaches in the area of path-planning for nonholonomic robots. In particular, we introduce a motion description language, MDLe, that provides a formal basis for robot programming using behaviors, and at the same time permits incorporation of kinematic models of robots given in the form of differential equations. The structure of the language MDLe is such as to allow descriptions of triggers (generated by sensors) in the language. Feedback and feedforward control laws are selected and executed by the triggering events. We demonstrate the use of MDLe in the area of motion planning for nonholonomic robots. Such models impose limitations on stabilizability via smooth feed-back, i.e. piecing together open loop and closed loop trajectories becomes essential in these circumstances, and MDLe enables one to describe such piecing together in a systematic manner. A reactive planner using the formalism of the paper is described. We demonstrate obstacle avoidance with limited range sensors as a test of this planner.
