Most design automation systems attempt to automate only a small part of the physical description. Much is left to the designers. An exploratory design automation system is being developed at the University of Southern California. The system is intended to be highly interactive and has several features which will enhance the possibilities of automatic physical description. Different approaches and algorithms required to accomplish the “future” system are outlined.
