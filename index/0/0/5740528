We study the min-max problem in factor graphs, which seeks the assignment that minimizes the maximum value over all factors. We reduce this problem to both min-sum and sum-product inference, and focus on the later. In this approach the min-max inference problem is reduced to a sequence of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), which allows us to solve the problem by sampling from a uniform distribution over the set of solutions. We demonstrate how this scheme provides a message passing solution to several NP-hard combinatorial problems, such as minmax clustering (a.k.a. K-clustering), asymmetric K-center clustering problem, K-packing and the bottleneck traveling salesman problem. Furthermore, we theoretically relate the min-max reductions and several NP hard decision problems such as clique cover, set-cover, maximum clique and Hamiltonian cycle, therefore also providing message passing solutions for these problems. Experimental results suggest that message passing often provides near optimal min-max solutions for moderate size instances.
