We have experienced rapid development of augmented reality (AR) systems and platforms in the automotive industry. However, to bring AR into production cars, we still face a range of challenges to design an AR system that meets vehicle specific requirements. Based on our experience with an AR prototype car, we analyze the influence of augmented reality on the design of the in-vehicle electric/electronic (E/E) architecture.
