We investigate the complexity of sorting in the model of sequential quantum circuits. While it is known that in general a quantum algorithm based on comparisons alone cannot outperform classical sorting algorithms by more than a constant factor in time complexity, this is wrong in a space bounded setting. We observe that for all storage bounds <i>n</i>/log ≥ <i>S</i> ≥ log<sup>3</sup><i>n</i>, one can devise a quantum algorithm that sorts <i>n</i> numbers (using comparisons only) in time <i>T</i>=<i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>3/2</sup> log<sup>3/2</sup> <i>n</i>/√<i>S</i>). We then show the following lower bound on the time-space tradeoff for sorting <i>n</i> numbers from a polynomial size range in a general sorting algorithm (not necessarily based on comparisons): <i>TS</i>=Ω(<i>n</i><sup>3/2</sup>). Hence for small values of <i>S</i> the upper bound is almost tight. Classically the time-space tradeoff for sorting is <i>TS</i>=Θ(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>).
