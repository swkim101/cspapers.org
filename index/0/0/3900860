Densely connected networks for classification enable feature exploration and result in state-of-the-art performance on multiple classification tasks. The alternative to dense networks is the residual network which enables feature re-usage. In this work, we combine these orthogonal concepts for encoder-decoder architectures, which we call Dual-Path Dense-Block Network (DPDB-Net). We introduce a dense block which incorporates feature re-usage and new feature exploration in the encoder. Moreover, we discuss that feature re-usage by the residual network architecture leads to a feature map explosion in the decoder and, thus, is not advantageous in this part of the network. We evaluated our proposed architecture in multiple segmentation tasks and report state-of-the-art performance on the Freiburg Forest dataset and competitive results on the Cam Vid dataset.
