Introduction This panel is a forum for sharing a few favorite CSl and CS2 assignments from the SIG-CSE community. Given our limited time, each panelist will concentrate on the broader niche, strengths, and weaknesses of their assignment, rather than its specific implementation. Fortunately, for each assignment there is a web page with all sorts of practical details and materials for anyone interested in using or studying the assignment.
