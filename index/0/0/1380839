Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks are capable of supporting a wide variety of applications with varying data rates. FDDI networks offer to support similar applications in the LAN environment. Both these networks are characterized by high data rates, low error rates, and are capable of providing performance guarantees. In this paper we present the design of an ATM-FDDI gateway that can provide high performance internetworking between these two important classes of networks. An important part of the gateway design philosophy is to partition the functionality into critical and non-critical paths. The critical path consists of per packet processing and...
