Assigning projects of group work in the context of software engineering courses has become a commonly used practice in several educational institutions. Previously reported results examined different aspects of this approach. The problem is that most studies are based on relatively small group sizes. In this article a large scale project template for a class-wide project that is currently in use in the Department of Computer Engineering, Bogazici University, will be presented.
