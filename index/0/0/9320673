This work describes the combination of three software frameworks from two different domains: robotics and smart environments. The two robotic frameworks MCA2 and SimVis-3D that have been in use for several years on a multitude of different robotic systems and TinySEP, a modular framework for smart environments were combined to create a win-win-situation for both roboticists and ubiquitous computing researchers. The possibilities and advantages this combination can offer are discussed, especially in situations where mobile robots and smart environments coexist next to each other. This work is concluded by an experiment that shows the feasibility and the strengths of the proposed approach.
