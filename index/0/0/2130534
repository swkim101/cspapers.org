Given a graph <i>G</i> and a spanning tree <i>T</i> of <i>G</i>, we say that <i>T</i> is a <i>tree t-spanner</i> of <i>G</i> if the distance between every pair of vertices in <i>T</i> is at most <i>t</i> times their distance in <i>G.</i> The problem of finding a tree <i>t</i>-spanner minimizing <i>t</i> is referred to as the <i>Minimum Max-Stretch spanning Tree (MMST)</i> problem. This paper concerns the MMST problem on unweighted graphs. The problem is known to be NP-hard, and the paper presents an <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) approximation algorithm for it.
