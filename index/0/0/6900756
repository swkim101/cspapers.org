The Software Engineering Laboratory (SEL), sponsored by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, was created to investigate the effectiveness of software engineering technologies. At SEL, the initial experience with object-oriented technology has been positive. However, the successes achieved thus far took seven years to achieve. In this panel, we will explore how typical the SELâ€™s experience is of large organizations doing large software developments.
