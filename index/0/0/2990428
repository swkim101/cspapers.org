Heterogeneous multicore architectures have the potential to improve energy efficiency by integrating power-efficient wimpy cores with high-performing brawny cores. However, it is an open question as how to deliver energy reduction while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) of latency-sensitive web-services running on such heterogeneous multicores in warehouse-scale computers (WSCs). In this work, we first investigate the implications of heterogeneous multicores in WSCs and show that directly adopting heterogeneous multicores without re-designing the software stack to provide QoS management leads to significant QoS violations. We then present Octopus-Man, a novel QoS-aware task management solution that dynamically maps latency-sensitive tasks to the least power-hungry processing resources that are sufficient to meet the QoS requirements. Using carefully-designed feedback-control mechanisms, Octopus-Man addresses critical challenges that emerge due to uncertainties in workload fluctuations and adaptation dynamics in a real system. Our evaluation using web-search and memcached running on a real-system Intel heterogeneous prototype demonstrates that Octopus-Man improves energy efficiency by up to 41% (CPU power) and up to 15% (system power) over an all-brawny WSC design while adhering to specified QoS targets.
