Current problem solving systems are constrained in their applicability by inadequate world models. We suggest a world model based on a temporal logic. This approach allows the problem solver to gather constraints on the ordering of actions without having to commit to an ordering when a conflict is detected. As such, it generalizes the work on nonlinear planning by Sacerdoti and Tate. In addition, it allows more general descriptions of actions that may occur simultaneously or overlap, and appears promising in supporting reasoning about external events and actions caused by other agents.
