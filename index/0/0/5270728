Recently, side-channel attacks on Last Level Caches (LLCs) were demonstrated. The attacks require the ability to evict critical data from the cache hierarchy, making future accesses visible. We propose Relaxed Inclusion Caches (RIC), a low-complexity cache design protecting against LLC side channel attacks. RIC relaxes inclusion when it is not needed, preventing the attacker from replacing the victim's data from the local core caches thus protecting critical data from leakage. RIC improves performance (by about 10%) and retains snoop filtering capabilities of inclusive cache hierarchies, while requiring only minimal changes to the cache.
