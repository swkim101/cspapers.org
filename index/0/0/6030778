We describe the design, development, and API of ODIN (Open Domain INformer), a domainindependent, rule-based event extraction (EE) framework. The proposed EE approach is: simple (most events are captured with simple lexico-syntactic patterns), powerful (the language can capture complex constructs, such as events taking other events as arguments, and regular expressions over syntactic graphs), robust (to recover from syntactic parsing errors, syntactic patterns can be freely mixed with surface, token-based patterns), and fast (the runtime environment processes 110 sentences/second in a real-world domain with a grammar of over 200 rules). We used this framework to develop a grammar for the biochemical domain, which approached human performance. Our EE framework is accompanied by a web-based user interface for the rapid development of event grammars and visualization of matches. The ODIN framework and the domain-specific grammars are available as open-source code.
