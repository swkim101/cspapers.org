In this paper, we investigate the question of what assessment tools are being used in practice by United States computing programs and what the faculty doing the assessment think of the tools and of the assessment process in general. We report on the results of two surveys, distributed to the SIGCSE mailing list and to the chairs of all ABET-CAC accredited computer science programs. We found that both parts of these surveys--the multiple-choice sections and the comments--provided some interesting insights into program assessment from the perspective of those responsible for collecting and using the information.
