It seems rather natural to admit that language use is governed by rules that relate signs, forms and meanings to possible intentions or possible interpretations, in function of utterance situations. Not less natural should seem the idea that the meaning of a natural language expression conveys enough material to the input of these rules, so that, given the situation of utterance, they determine the appropriate interpretation. If this is correct, the semantic description of a natural language expression should output not only the 'informative content' of that expression, but also all sorts of indications concerning the way this expression may be used or interpreted. In particular, the argumentative power of utterances is due to argumentative indications conveyed by the sentences uttered, indications that are not part of their informative content. This paper emphasizes the role of argumentation in language and shows how it could be accounted for in a formal Representation Semantics framework. An example of an analysis is provided in order to show the "system at work".
