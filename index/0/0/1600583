We present VeLoc, a smartphone-based vehicle localization approach that tracks the vehicle's parking location without GPS or WiFi signals. It uses only the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. VeLoc harnesses constraints imposed by the map and landmarks (e.g., speed bumps) recognized from inertial data, employs a Bayesian filtering framework to estimate the location of the vehicle. We have conducted experiments in three parking structures of different sizes and configurations, using three vehicles and three kinds of driving styles. We find that VeLoc can always localize the vehicle within 10m, which is sufficient for the driver to trigger a honk using the car key.
