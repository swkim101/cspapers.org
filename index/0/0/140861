In computer science education one should employ creative teaching methods, especially for non-majors or beginning students. Students who are new to computer science typically find the field full of theoretical, technical, or even tedious concepts. Lack of interest, motivation, or understanding creates a difficult mix of students. This paper describes a technique which combines analogy and simple memory techniques to aid in the teaching of technical concepts.
