The focus of this paper is the technique of recursion analysis. Recursion analysis is used by the Boyer-Moore Theorem Prover to choose an appropriate induction schema and variable to prove theorems by mathematical induction. A rational reconstruction of recursion analysis is outlined, using the technique of proof plans. This rational reconstruction suggests an extension of recursion analysis which frees the induction suggestion from the forms of recursion found in the conjecture. Preliminary results are reported of the automation of this rational reconstruction and extension using the CLAM-Oyster system.
