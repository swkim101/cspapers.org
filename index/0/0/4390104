Advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques tried to automatically categorize the emotions elicited by abstract paintings with limited success. Since the annotation of the emotional content is highly resourceconsuming, datasets of abstract paintings are either constrained in size or partially annotated. Consequently, it is natural to address the targeted task within a transductive framework. Intuitively, the use of multi-label classification techniques is desirable so to synergically exploit the relations between multiple latent variables, such as emotional content, technique, author, etc. A very popular approach for transductive multi-label recognition under linear classification settings is matrix completion. In this study we introduce non-linear matrix completion (NLMC), thus extending classical linear matrix completion techniques to the non-linear case. Together with the theory grounding the model, we propose an efficient optimization solver. As shown by our extensive experimental validation on two publicly available datasets, NLMC outperforms state-of-the-art methods when recognizing emotions from abstract paintings.
