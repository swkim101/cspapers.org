Spatial queries for extracting data from wireless sensor networks are important for many applications, such as environmental monitoring and military surveillance. One such query is K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) query that facilitates sampling of monitored sensor data in correspondence with a given query location. Recently, itinerary-based KNN query processing techniques, that propagate queries and collect data along a pre-determined itinerary, have been developed concurrently [12] [14]. These research works demonstrate that itinerary-based KNN query processing algorithms are able to achieve better energy efficiency than other existing algorithms. However, how to derive itineraries based on different performance requirements remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new itinerary-based KNN query processing technique, called PCIKNN, that derives different itineraries aiming at optimizing two performance criteria, response latency and energy consumption. The performance of PCIKNN is analyzed mathematically and evaluated through extensive experiments. Experimental results show that PCIKNN has better performance and scalability than the state-of-the-art.
