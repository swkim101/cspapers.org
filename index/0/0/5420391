The algorithm design problem is concerned with the construction of an algorithm satisfying a given specification of a problem. We present an overview of a system, called NAPS, which designs Algorithms in a top-down manner. Given a formal specification of a problem NAPS produces a top level algorithm plue specifications for any necessary subalgorithms. The specifications for the subalgorithms are produced in such a way that the top level algorithm will satisfy the original specifications if and only if subalgorithms can be built which satisfy the subalgorithms specifications.
