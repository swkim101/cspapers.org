We provide a general method which can be used in an algorithmic manner to reduce certain classes of 2nd-order circumscription axioms to logically equivalent 1st order formulas The algorithm takes as input an arbitrary 2nd-order formula and either returns as output an equivalent 1st order formula, or terminates with failure In addition to demonstrating the algorithm by applying it to various circumscriptive theories, we analyze its strength and provide formal subsumption results based on compan son with existing approaches.
