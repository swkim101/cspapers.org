We provide on-line algorithms for the problem of reducing the number of sample points used to represent a planar curve. The algorithms find a subsequence of the original sample points so that interpolating curves between successive points in the subsequence are near to the original sample points. We consider the case where the interpolating curves are line segments and the case where they are second degree polynomials. In both cases, linear time algorithms are given.
