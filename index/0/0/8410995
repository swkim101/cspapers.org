Counterpane Systems, 101 East Minnehaha Parkway, Minneapolis, MN 55419; We propose a system of commerce based on the Conditional Purchase Order (CPO). Individual buyers issue CPOs, which are evaluated and ful lled by sellers. There are mechanisms to bind the buyer to the transaction once the conditions are met. Additional enhancements include the ability to add anonymity, and assurances of product quality by trusted third parties.
