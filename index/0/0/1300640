In line with the growing interest in conversational agents as companions, we are developing a toy companion for children that is capable of engaging interactions and of developing a long-term relationship with them, and is extensible so as to evolve with them. In this paper, we investigate the importance of personalising interaction both for engagement and for long-term relationship development. In particular, we propose a framework for representing, gathering and using personal knowledge about the child during dialogue interaction.
