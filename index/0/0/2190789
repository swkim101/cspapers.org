This paper proposes a general framework, called EigenTransfer, to tackle a variety of transfer learning problems, e.g. cross-domain learning, self-taught learning, etc. Our basic idea is to construct a graph to represent the target transfer learning task. By learning the spectra of a graph which represents a learning task, we obtain a set of eigenvectors that reflect the intrinsic structure of the task graph. These eigenvectors can be used as the new features which transfer the knowledge from auxiliary data to help classify target data. Given an arbitrary non-transfer learner (e.g. SVM) and a particular transfer learning task, EigenTransfer can produce a transfer learner accordingly for the target transfer learning task. We apply EigenTransfer on three different transfer learning tasks, cross-domain learning, cross-category learning and self-taught learning, to demonstrate its unifying ability, and show through experiments that EigenTransfer can greatly outperform several representative non-transfer learners.
