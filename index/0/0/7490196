In this paper, we present the design and fabrication of a centimeter-scale propulsion system for a robotic fish. The key to the design is selection of an appropriate actuator and a body frame that is simple and compact. SMA spring actuators are customized to provide the necessary work output for the microrobotic fish. The flexure joints, electrical wiring and attachment pads for SMA actuators are all embedded in a single layer of copper laminated polymer film, sandwiched between two layers of glass fiber. Instead of using individual actuators to rotate each joint, each actuator rotates all the joints to a certain mode shape and undulatory motion is created by a timed sequence of these mode shapes. Subcarangiform swimming mode of minnows has been emulated using five links and four actuators. The size of the four-joint propulsion system is 6 mm wide, 40 mm long with the body frame thickness of 0.25 mm.
