This paper describes a knowledge-based planning and execution system concept for sensor-guided manipulation. The main purpose of the approach is to offer a flexible and easy prototyping method to build a sensor-guided manipulation system and to integrate multi-sensors. Qualitative knowledge about manipulation is represented in a rule-base system and actual control commands are greater in the functional modules of the manipulator and the sensors by the use of object models and sensor models. The proposed idea was applied to paper roll manipulation. The simulation system implemented was composed of a rule-based action planner, simulators for paper roll manipulator, force and vision sensors and a notice-board. Simulation of the paper roll stacking task showed that the concept is effective and applicable.
