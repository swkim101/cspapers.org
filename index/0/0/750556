The proposed program will establish a Computer Education Institute for computing, mathematics, and science teachers and supervisors in grade 7 to 12. The goals of the program are to: (1) provide teachers with a knowledge of programming in BASIC, and conceptual foundations of computer programming, (2) inform teachers of the variety of uses of computers in teaching science and mathematics, (3) provide an opportunity to observe and interact with youngsters as they learn to program, (4) establish a focus for teachers' future needs in computer education through contact with qualified scientists, and (5) develop and update teachers' knowledge about computers in society.
 The objectives will be accomplished through enrollment during a six-week summer session in a Structured Programming seminar and a Computer Education seminar. Intensive practice in a computer lab will develop programming skills.
 During the fall semester, four Guest Speaker Seminars will be held to provide nationally recognized experts as a resource. These meetings will also provide the program participants an opportunity to discuss their own implementation progress with the Institute staff.
