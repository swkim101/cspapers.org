We present a new biped walking pattern generator based on “half-steps”. Its key features are a) a 3-dimensional parametrization of the input space, and b) a simple homotopy that efficiently smooths the walking trajectory corresponding to a fixed sequence of steps. We show how these features can be ideally combined in the framework of sampling-based footstep planning. We apply our approach to the robot HRP-2 and are able to quickly produce smooth and dynamically stable trajectories that are solutions to a difficult problem of footstep planning.
