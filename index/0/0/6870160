In this paper we present a planner that interleaves free-space motion with motion in contact to reduce uncertainty. The planner finds such motions by growing a search tree in the combined space of collision-free and contact configurations. The planner reasons efficiently about the accumulated uncertainty by factoring the state in a belief over configuration and a fully observable contact state. We show the uncertainty-reducing capabilities of the planner on manipulation benchmark from the POMDP literature. The planner scales up to more complex problems like manipulation under uncertainty in seven-dimensional configuration space. We validate our planner in simulation and on a real robot.
