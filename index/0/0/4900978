This paper addresses modality classiﬁcation for multi-issue bargaining dialogues in order to model human-like negotiation behaviour and to efﬁciently compute negotiation strategies. We pro-pose a modality annotation and classiﬁcation scheme comprising semantically distinguishable categories applied reliably by humans and machines. Our classiﬁcation of modality varieties is based on both the traditional dichotomy of epistemic and root modalities, and on the analysis of the available corpus data. Our modality scheme has been used for annotating human-human dialogues and training SVM-based classiﬁers. We built predictive models that show accuracies in the range between 73.3 and 82.6%.
