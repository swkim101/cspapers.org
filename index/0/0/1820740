This paper presents an integrated solution for vehicle's velocity estimation and vehicle counting. The proposed restores the scene geometric properties, building a ground plane rectified image. Moreover, multiple vehicles tracking is performed embedding the concept of region covariance descriptors in a particle filter framework. The results show the effectiveness of the approach here proposed in very clutter scenes.
