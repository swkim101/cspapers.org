Crowdsourcing is widely adopted in many domains as a popular paradigm to outsource work to individuals. In the machine learning community, crowdsourcing is commonly used as a cost-saving way to collect labels for training data. While a lot of effort has been spent on developing methods for inferring labels from a crowd, few work concentrates on the theoretical foundation of crowdsourcing learning. In this paper, we theoretically study the cost-saving effect of crowdsourcing learning, and present an upper bound for the minimally-sufficient number of crowd labels for effective crowdsourcing learning. Our results provide an understanding about how to allocate crowd labels efficiently, and are verified empirically.
