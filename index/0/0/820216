This paper studies real-time scheduling of mixed-criticality systems where low-criticality tasks are still guaranteed some service in the high-criticality mode, with reduced execution budgets. First, we present a utilization-based schedulability test for such systems under EDF-VD scheduling. Second, we quantify the suboptimality of EDF-VD (with our test condition) in terms of speedup factors. In general, the speedup factor is a function with respect to the ratio between the amount of resource required by different types of tasks in different criticality modes, and reaches 4/3 in the worst case. Furthermore, we show that the proposed utilization-based schedulability test and speedup factor results apply to the elastic mixed-criticality model as well. Experiments show effectiveness of our proposed method and confirm the theoretical suboptimality results.
