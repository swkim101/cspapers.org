We consider the problem of learning sparse additive models, i.e., functions of the form: f(x) = Σl∈S ϕl(xl), x ∈ ℝd from point queries of f. Here S is an unknown subset of coordinate variables with |S| = k ≪ d. Assuming ϕl's to be smooth, we propose a set of points at which to sample f and an efficient randomized algorithm that recovers a uniform approximation to each unknown ϕl. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of our scheme along with sample complexity bounds. Our algorithm utilizes recent results from compressive sensing theory along with a novel convex quadratic program for recovering robust uniform approximations to univariate functions, from point queries corrupted with arbitrary bounded noise. Lastly we theoretically analyze the impact of noise - either arbitrary but bounded, or stochastic - on the performance of our algorithm.
