In this paper, we present an unlexicalized parser for German which employs smoothing and suffix analysis to achieve a labelled bracket F-score of 76.2, higher than previously reported results on the NEGRA corpus. In addition to the high accuracy of the model, the use of smoothing in an unlexicalized parser allows us to better examine the interplay between smoothing and parsing results.
