The importance of problem solving skills in addition to computational skills for computer science graduates is increasing. The authors present a curriculum of a creativity development program for undergraduate computer science students that aims at exposing them to problem solving and software development through a series of three courses spanning a period of six months. The focus of this initiative is to teach problem solving skills and software development skills as an integrated skill-set and take advantage of the combined effect to address the challenge for students to connect computer science knowledge to real-world problems, an issue apparent in our current curriculum. The curriculum starts with the first course on creativity development in which students propose solutions to a real-world problem through field-work and information gathering/analysis spanning five days. The second course introduces project management and software development through another five-day software development team project. In the final course, student teams work on a software development request from customers during a period of 4 months. All three courses use the same problem. The program is in its first year of offering with a relatively small group of students. The presentation will display our findings from program assessment including student scores on individual performance tests and student perception.
