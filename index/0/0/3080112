Semantic representation lies at the core of several applications in Natural Language Processing. However, most existing semantic representation techniques cannot 
be used effectively for the representation of individual word senses. We put forward a novel multilingual concept representation, called MUFFIN, which not only enables accurate representation of word senses in different languages, but also provides multiple advantages over existing approaches. MUFFIN represents a given concept in a unified semantic space irrespective of the language of interest, enabling cross-lingual comparison of different 
concepts. We evaluate our approach in two different evaluation benchmarks, semantic similarity and Word Sense Disambiguation, reporting state-of-the-art performance 
on several standard datasets.
