Much effort has been spent to reduce the software Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of modern systems. However, there remains a large and complex hardware TCB, including memory, peripherals, and system buses. There are many stronger, but still realistic, adversary models where we need to consider that this hardware may be malicious or compromised. Thus, there is a practical need to determine whether we can achieve secure program execution in the presence of not only malicious software, but also malicious hardware.
