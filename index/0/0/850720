The Hough transformation can detect straight lines in an edge-enhanced picture; however, its extension t o recover ellipses requires too much computing time. This paper proposes a modified method which utilizes two properties of an ellipse in such a way that it iteratively searches for clusters in two different parameter spaces to find visible ellipses, then evaluates their parameters by the least means squares method.
