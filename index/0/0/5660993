Addressing the will to give a more complete picture than an average relationship provided by standard regression, a novel framework for estimating and predicting simultaneously several conditional quantiles is introduced. The proposed methodology leverages kernel-based multi-task learning to curb the embarrassing phenomenon of quantile crossing, with a one-step estimation procedure and no post-processing. Moreover, this framework comes along with theoretical guarantees and an efficient coordinate descent learning algorithm. Numerical experiments on benchmark and real datasets highlight the enhancements of our approach regarding the prediction error, the crossing occurrences and the training time.
