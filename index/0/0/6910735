Virtual machine (VM) technologies are experiencing a resurgence in both industry and research communities. VMs offer many desirable features such as security, ease of management, OS customization, performance isolation, check-pointing, and migration, which can be very beneficial to the performance and the manageability of high performance computing (HPC) applications. However, very few HPC applications are currently running in a virtualized environment due to the performance overhead of virtualization. Further, using VMs for HPC also introduces additional challenges such as management and distribution of OS images.In this paper we present a case for HPC with virtual machines by introducing a framework which addresses the performance and management overhead associated with VM-based computing. Two key ideas in our design are: Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) bypass I/O and scalable VM image management. VMM-bypass I/O achieves high communication performance for VMs by exploiting the OS-bypass feature of modern high speed interconnects such as Infini-Band. Scalable VM image management significantly reduces the overhead of distributing and managing VMs in large scale clusters. Our current implementation is based on the Xen VM environment and InfiniBand. However, many of our ideas are readily applicable to other VM environments and high speed interconnects.We carry out detailed analysis on the performance and management overhead of our VM-based HPC framework. Our evaluation shows that HPC applications can achieve almost the same performance as those running in a native, non-virtualized environment. Therefore, our approach holds promise to bring the benefits of VMs to HPC applications with very little degradation in performance.
