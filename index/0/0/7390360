Using smart-phones for ad-hoc mathematical collaboration poses multiple user interface challenges. In this paper, software agents are used to lessen the cognitive load through automatic line labeling. Researchers in the human-computer interaction community have attempted to alleviate the problem of general usability through user interface engineering conventions (Myers 1994). However, these engineering approaches can be improved upon through the application of mixed-initiative principles.
