Many smartphones, nowadays, use GPS to detect the location of the user, and can use the Internet to interact with remote location-based services. These two capabilities support online navigation that incorporates search. In this demo we presents WISER---a system for Web-based Interactive Search en Route. In the system, users perform route search by providing (1) a target location, and (2) search terms that specify types of geographic entities to be visited. The task is to find a route that minimizes the travel distance from the initial location of the user to the target, via entities of the specified types. However, planning a route under conditions of uncertainty requires the system to take into account the possibility that some visited entities will not satisfy the search requirements, so that the route may need to go via several entities of the same type. In an interactive search, the user provides feedback regarding her satisfaction with entities she visits during the travel, and the system changes the route, in real time, accordingly. The goal is to use the interaction for computing a route that is more effective than a route that is computed in a non-interactive fashion.
