This workshop reviewed and classified the various models which have emerged from the general concept of selective attention and context dependency, and sought to identify their commonalities. It was concluded that the motivation and mechanism of these functional models are "efficiency" and "factoring", respectively. The workshop focused on computational models of selective attention and context dependency within the realm of neural networks. We treated only "functional" models; computational models of biological neural systems, and symbolic or rule-based systems were omitted from the discussion.
