A multiprogramming operating system for the TI980A permits replacement of system primitives by a programmer familiar with the system's design and data structures. This paper describes the hardware features available; the method of use of the replaceable parts facility; typical student assignments for an operating systems course (e.g. ACM Curriculum '68 I4); and student reaction to the projects.
