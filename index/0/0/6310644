Information warfare exercises, such as "Capture the Flag," serve as a capstone experience for a computer security class, giving students the opportunity to apply and integrate the security skills they learned during the class. However, many information security classes don't offer such exercises, because they can be difficult, expensive, time-consuming, and risky to organize and implement. This paper describes a real-time "Capture the Flag" exercise, implemented using a virtual network with free, open-source software to reduce the risk and effort of conducting such an exercise.
