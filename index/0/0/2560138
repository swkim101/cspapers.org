In current approaches to combined task and motion planning, usually symbolic planning and sampling based motion-planning are integrated. One problem is here to come up with good samples. We address the problem of identifying useful poses for a robot close to working surfaces such as tables or shelves. Our approach is based on reachability inversion which answers the question: where should the robot be located in order to reach a certain object? We extend the concept from point-based objects to flat polygonal surfaces in order to enable the robot to have a a good grasping position for many objects. Our approach allows to quickly sample multiple distinct poses for the robot from an prior computed distribution. Further we show how sampling from an inverse reachability distribution can be integrated into a CTAMP system.
