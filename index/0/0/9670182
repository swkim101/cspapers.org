In this paper, we describe a method for understanding the function of web elements. It classifies web elements into five functional categories: Content (C), Related Links (R), Navigation and Support (N), Advertisement (A) and Form (F). We construct five graphs for a web page, and each graph is designed such that most of the probability mass of the stationary distribution is concentrated in nodes belong to its corresponding category. We perform random walks on these graphs until convergence and classify based on its rank value in different graphs. Our experiment shows that the new method performed very well comparing to basic machine learning methods.
