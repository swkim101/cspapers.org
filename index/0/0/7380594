Controlled vocabularies have been used as the means for unifying disparate terminologies found within an application field. This unification leads to better administration of information and enhanced communication among various parties. Semantic networks have been shown to be excellent vehicles for modeling controlled vocabularies. However, they often lack the necessary access flexibility and robustness required by external agents such as intelligent information-locators and decision-support systems. In this paper, we describe the process of mapping an existing medical vocabulary based on a semantic network model into an Object-Oriented Database (OODB) system. We first consider two straightforward approaches to carrying out this task and describe their deficiencies. We then present a new approach which yields a very compact OODB schema for the representation of the vocabularyâ€™s entire hierarchy and inter-connectivity. We refer to the resulting OODB as the Object-Oriented Healthcare Vocabulary Repository (OOHVR), which is currently up and running in the context of ONTOS, a commercially available OODB system.
