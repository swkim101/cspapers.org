We describe an efficient, robust method for selecting and optimizing terms for a classification or filtering task. Terms are extracted from positive examples in training data based on several alternative term-selection algorithms, then combined additively after a simple term-score normalization step to produce a merged and ranked master term vector. The score threshold for the master vector is set via beta-gamma regulation over all the available training data. The process avoids para-meter calibrations and protracted training. It also results in compact profiles for run-time evaluation of test (new) documents. Results on TREC-2002 filtering-task datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over TREC-median results and rival both idealized IR-based results and optimized (and expensive) SVM-based classifiers in general effectiveness.
