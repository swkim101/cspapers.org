A method is given that "inverts" a logic grammar and displays it from the point of view of the logical form, rather than from that of the word string LR-compiling techniques are used to allow a recursive-descent generation algorithm to perform "functor merging" much in the same way as an LR parser performs prefix merging. This is an improvement on the semantic-head-driven generator that results in a much smaller search space. The amount of semantic lookahead can be varied, and appropriate tradeoff points between table size and resulting nondeterminism can be found automatically.
