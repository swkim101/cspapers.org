Summary form only given. The term system-on-silicon has been used to denote the integration of random logic, processor cores, SRAMs, ROMs, and analog ccimponents on the same die. But up to recently, one major component had been missing: high-density DRAMS. Today?s technologies allow the integration of such as data buffering, picture storage, and prograddata storage. In quarter-micron technology, chips with up to 128 Mbit of DRAM and 500 kgates of logic are eminently feasible. This enlarges the system design space tremendously since system architects arc no more restricted to standard commodity DRAMS. We will discuss the market for embedded DRAM applications as well as the associated challenges.
