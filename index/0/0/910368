A general device for handling nondeterminism in stack operations is described. The device, called a Graph-structured Stack, can eliminate duplication of operations throughout the nondeterministic processes. This paper then applies the graph-structured stack to various natural language parsing methods, including ATN, LR parsing, categorial grammar and principle-based parsing. The relationship between the graph-structured stack and a chart in chart parsing is also discussed.
