In pursuit of increasing the operational tempo of a ground robotics platform in unknown domains, we consider the problem of predicting the distribution of structural state-estimation error due to poorly-modeled platform dynamics as well as environmental effects. Such predictions are a critical component of any modern control approach that utilizes uncertainty information to provide robustness in control design. We use an online learning algorithm based on matrix factorization techniques to fit a statistical model of error that provides enough expressive power to enable prediction directly from motion control signals and low-level visual features. Moreover, we empirically demonstrate that this technique compares favorably to predictors that do not incorporate this information.
