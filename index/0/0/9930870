Practical courses in information security provide students with first-hand knowledge of technical security mechanisms and their weaknesses. However, teaching students only the technical side of information security leads to a generation of students that emphasize digital solutions, but ignore the physical and the social aspects of security. In the last two years we devised a course where students were given a practical assignment which includes a combination of physical security, social engineering and digital penetration testing. As part of the course, the students stole laptops using social engineering from unaware employees throughout the university campus. The assignment provided the students with a practical overview of security and increased their awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of security mechanisms. In this paper we present the design of the practical assignment and the observations from the execution.
