Wireless sensor networks have attracted much attention recently with ubiquitous or ad hoc applications. Wireless sensor nodes may be deployed on some fields and organize themselves in a large scale ad hoc network. A path diversity is an effective technique to get highly reliable communications in the sensor networks. In this paper, the capacity and cutoff rate of binary tree network composed of BSC is derived to examine the path diversity effect. Numerical results show that the capacity and cutoff rate keep constants, even if the network size becomes large.
