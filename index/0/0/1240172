The goal of this work is to separately control individual secure sessions between unlimited pairs of multicast receivers and senders while preserving the scalability of receiver initiated Internet multicast for the data transfer itself. Unlike other secure multicast solutions, there are absolutely no side-effects on other receivers when a single receiver joins or leaves a session. Each individual receiver can also reliably prove whether any fragment of the data hasn’t been delivered or wasn’t delivered on time (e.g. late video frames). Further, each receiver’s data can be subject to an individual, watermarked audit trail. The cost per receiver-session is typically just one set-up message exchange with a key manager. Key managers can be replicated without limit because they are only loosely coupled to the senders who can remain oblivious to members being added or removed. The solution requires a tamper-resistant processor such as a smartcard at each receiver. However, generic cards supplied by a trusted third party are used rather than cards specific to each information provider. The technique can be applied to other bulk data distribution channels instead of multicast, such as DVD.
