Traditional real-time disk-scheduling algorithms service real-time tasks according to their deadlines. Such a priority-based algorithm, although satisfying real-time constraints, yields low disk utilization due to the excessive disk-seek time. Furthermore, it results in prolonged response time or even starvation for aperiodic tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel rate-based real-time disk-scheduling algorithm called WRR-SCAN (Weighted-Round-Robin SCAN). WRR-SCAN guarantees to meet the deadline of a real-time task by reserving disk bandwidth according to its real-time constraints. WRR-SCAN services scheduled tasks in scan order to minimize the disk-seek time. In addition, WRR-SCAN delivers better response time for aperiodic tasks which are served in best-effort manner by priority based algorithms. We conducted a set of extensive experiments to compare WRR-SCAN and SCAN-EDF, a priority-based algorithm studied extensively in literature. The experimental results show that WRR-SCAN reduces non-transmission overhead significantly and produces a guaranteed minimum data rate for aperiodic tasks while keeping the deadlines of real-time tasks.
