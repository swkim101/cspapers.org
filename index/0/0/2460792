Video segmentation is the task of grouping similar pixels in the spatio-temporal domain, and has become an important preprocessing step for subsequent video analysis. Most video segmentation and supervoxel methods output a hierarchy of segmentations, but while this provides useful multiscale information, it also adds difficulty in selecting the appropriate level for a task. In this work, we propose an efficient and robust video segmentation framework based on parametric graph partitioning (PGP), a fast, almost parameter free graph partitioning method that identifies and removes between-cluster edges to form node clusters. Apart from its computational efficiency, PGP performs clustering of the spatio-temporal volume without requiring a pre-specified cluster number or bandwidth parameters, thus making video segmentation more practical to use in applications. The PGP framework also allows processing sub-volumes, which further improves performance, contrary to other streaming video segmentation methods where sub-volume processing reduces performance. We evaluate the PGP method using the SegTrack v2 and Chen Xiph.org datasets, and show that it outperforms related state-of-the-art algorithms in 3D segmentation metrics and running time.
