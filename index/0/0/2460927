The paper presents a semi-automated technique for feature location in source code. The technique is based on combining information from two different sources: an execution trace, on one hand and the comments and identifiers from the source code, on the other hand. Users execute a single partial scenario, which exercises the desired feature and all executed methods are identified based on the collected trace. The source code is indexed using Latent Semantic Indexing, an Information Retrieval method, which allows users to write queries relevant to the desired feature and rank all the executed methods based on their textual similarity to the query. Two case studies on open source software (JEdit and Eclipse) indicate that the new technique has high accuracy, comparable with previously published approaches and it is easy to use as it considerably simplifies the dynamic analysis.
