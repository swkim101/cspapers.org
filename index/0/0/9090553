This paper presents an extended and unified approach to the interpretation of sentence fragments and elliptical utterances within the context of a plan-based theory of dialogue understanding. The approach integrates knowledge about plans and knowledge about discourse, enabling the treatment of a variety of difficult linguistic phenomena within a single framework while maintaining the computational advantages of the plan-based approach.
