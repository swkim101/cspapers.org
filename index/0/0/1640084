This paper discusses a Circuit Information Processor(CIP), a subsystem of a Packaging Automation System(PAS), currently under development at the University of Tokyo. The CIP is an interactive design system for digital circuits. As an interactive tool for the CIP, a template which is used by the designer to enter the circuit information into the computer data base, has been developed in our laboratory. In the CIP, the data base for the packaging design system is generated by drawing a logic diagram with the template on a digitizer.
