The “Magnet Program” is a concept that has received a great deal of attention, especially in urban school districts. A magnet program is one which is made available to students who live outside of the area which is usually served by the school in which the program is housed. A key requirement of any magnet program is that participation be voluntary. Students attend magnet programs to take advantage of what those programs offer. In many cases, students in magnet programs spend up to an hour traveling to school each day.
