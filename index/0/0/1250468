Data traffic volume including video transmission is increasing exponentially over the past decade. The demand for ultra-high speed wired and wireless communication systems is also growing in an unprecedented pace. In providing ultra-high data transmission rate as well as reliable communications, error correction codes are playing an ever important role. They can ensure received data being highly reliable under different channel environments. Protograph low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes form a specific type of structured LDPC codes that possess not only excellent error correction capabilities, but also capacity-approaching decoding thresholds. Due to their simple representation, protograph LDPC (PLDPC) code designs can be evaluated and optimized efficiently based on, for example, protograph extrinsic information transfer (PEXIT) algorithm. In this talk, we will present some state-of-the-art protograph LDPC code designs and their error performance under various channel conditions. We will also extend the applications of protograph LDPC codes to joint source-and-channel coding and joint channel-and-physical-layer-network coding. Finally we present some open problems in this field.
