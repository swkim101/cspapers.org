Through the investigation of the mathematical model of hologram-based indoor localization system using RFID, this paper reveals two potential deficiencies about accuracy and gives the machine learning interpretation of the model. Exploiting the methods from machine learning and the thought of hierarchy, the output accuracy and the efficiency of the model can be further boosted. Simulation and experiment show that the enhanced model can halve mean error and attain 9x execution speed improvement.
