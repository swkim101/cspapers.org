ProceedingsBuilder is a system that helps the proceedings chair of a scientific conference to carry out his chores. It has features of both workflow management systems (WFMS) and content management systems (CMS), in order to collect the material for the printed proceedings and other products. ProceedingsBuilder has been operational at several conferences, including VLDB 2005. When using Proceedings-Builder, we had a very intense lesson which kinds of work-flow adaptations may become necessary. Existing WFMS do not offer support for most of them. The concern of this article is to describe and classify these various requirements regarding adaptation. ProceedingsBuilder is an example of a broad class of systems, namely editorial systems that collect content in order to publish it. Our findings are of interest to a broader audience, not only to conference organizers.
