The different strategies for feature extraction and synthesis employed by humans and computers are often complementary, hence combining the two into an integrated object recognition system may considerably improve performance over either used in isolation. Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) is one well-established technique that has shown promise integrating human perception into a machine perception system. In this paper, we apply computer vision techniques to image data filtered through human RSVP. We introduce “task conversions” to integrate the two modalities, applying the precise localization capabilities of computer vision with the detection capabilities of RSVP. We employ naive Bayesian fusion and a novel method, dynamic belief fusion (DBF), in a joint scheme as fusion approaches. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that DBF extracts complementary information from both human and machine sources to improve performance for both target classification and object detection.
