We consider the problem of diagnosing and correcting two classes of design errors, called output correspondence and input correspondence errors. Under these errors, the order of the outputs or inputs of the implementation are changed, such that an incorrect matching between specification and implementation outputs or inputs is obtained. These errors were not included in earlier methods proposed to diagnose and correct design errors. We present diagnosis and correction procedures for these errors, and discuss the performance of these procedures in the presence of previously studied design errors. The analysis shows the importance of considering output and input correspondence errors as part of a complete correction procedure.
