Hand therapy is a major sector of physiotherapy and one of great importance. The impairment of the hand and generally of the upper limbs can be the cause of social and financial hardship and a serious cause of physical and emotional deterioration. Major efforts are directed into developing therapy methods and procedures in order to standardise and therefore successfully apply treatment regimes in a wide scale. Although, the lack of scientific measurements of statistical value that the current methods suffer due to the mostly empirical nature of examination, assessment and treatment does not assist this endeavour. This paper presents an exoskeleton based system for the physical and occupational therapy of the hand in an interactive VR environment. This system enhances the existing therapy methods with the introduction of accurate and repeatable finger motion and force measurement, interactivity, potential for great exercise assortment and statistical registration and evaluation.
