Mapping word embeddings of different languages into a single space has multiple applications. In order to map from a source space into a target space, a common approach is to learn a linear mapping that minimizes the distances between equivalences listed in a bilingual dictionary. In this paper, we propose a framework that generalizes previous work, provides an efÔ¨Åcient exact method to learn the optimal linear transformation and yields the best bilingual results in translation induction while preserving monolingual performance in an analogy task.
