We consider in some depth a common exercise for the first session of a typical introductory computer science course: The task of writing instructions to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The exercise, although simple, can engage students and motivate a variety of topics important throughout the semester. We discuss reasons to use such an exercise on the first day of class, present lessons students can learn from the exercise, and give practical advice for the instructor who wishes to make the most of this exercise.
