This paper proposes a system called RerankEverything, which enables users to rerank search results in any search service, such as a Web search engine, an e-commerce site, a hotel reservation site and so on. In conventional search services, interactions between users and services are quite limited and complicated. In addition, search functions and interactions to refine search results differ depending on the services. By using RerankEverything, users can interactively explore search results in accordance with their interests by reranking search results from various viewpoints.
