The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used to distribute routing information between autonomous systems, is an important component of the Internet’s routing infrastructure. Secure BGP (S-BGP) addresses critical BGP vulnerabilities by providing a scalable means of verifying the authenticity and authorization of BGP control traffic. To facilitate widespread adoption, S-BGP must avoid introducing undue overhead (processing, bandwidth, storage) and must be incrementally deployable, i.e., interoperable with BGP. To provide a proof of concept demonstration, we developed a prototype implementation of S-BGP and deployed it in DARPA’s CAIRN testbed. Real Internet BGP traffic was fed to the testbed routers via replay of a recorded BGP peering session with an ISP’s BGP router. This document describes the results of these experiments ‐ examining interoperability, the efficacy of the S-BGP countermeasures in securing BGP control traffic, and their impact on BGP performance, and thus evaluating the feasibility of deployment in the Internet.
