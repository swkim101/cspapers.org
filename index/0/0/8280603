Given the difficulties of conventional object technologies to deal with quality-attribute concerns, software architectures appear as an interesting approach to manage them better. A problem to make this approach feasible is the gap between architectural and object models. Succeeding in bridging these two worlds implies that those design decisions about quality attributes made at the architectural level should be reflected at the object level. Nonetheless, a given architecture usually admits multiple, different materializations. Furthermore, any materialization requires considerable design background and experience from the developer. In this paper, we describe a tool approach, called ArchMatE, to assist developers in the exploration of object-oriented solutions for grounding specific architectural models. An important aspect of the approach is that the materializations are accomplished by means of quality-oriented strategies, so that those concerns prescribed by the original architecture are mostly preserved.
