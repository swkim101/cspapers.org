In this tutorial, we will introduce the SIGMETRICS/Performance community to the vast testbeds, tools and resources openly available through the GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovations) project. We will present details about the distributed computing resources available on GENI for researchers interested in simulation as well as measurement-based performance evaluation experiments. We will demonstrate simple experiments on GENI, and leave them with information on how to run experiments for research and education using GENI resources.
