With the introduction of femtocells, cellular networks are moving from the conventional centralised architecture to a distributed one, where each network cell should make its own radio resource management decisions, while providing inter-cell interference mitigation. However, realising this distributed cellular network architecture is not a trivial task. In this paper, we first introduce a simple self-organisation rule under which a distributed cellular network is able to converge into an efficient resource allocation pattern, then propose a novel resource allocation model taking realistic resource allocation constraints into account, and finally evaluate the performance of the proposed self-organisation rule and resource allocation model using system-level simulations.
