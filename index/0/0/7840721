Hindi and Urdu are two standardized registers of what has been called the Hindustani language, which belongs to the IndoAryan language family. Although, both the varieties share a common grammar, they differ significantly in their vocabulary to an extent where both become mutually incomprehensible (Masica, 1993). Hindi draws its vocabulary from Sanskrit while Urdu draws its vocabulary from Persian, Arabic and even Turkish. In this paper, we present our efforts to adopt frames of nominal and verbal predicates that Urdu shares with either Hindi or Arabic for Urdu PropBanking. We discuss the feasibility of porting such frames from either of the sources (Arabic or Hindi) and also present a simple and reasonably accurate method to automatically identify the origin of Urdu words which is a necessary step in the process of porting such frames.
