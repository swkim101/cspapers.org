The purpose of this work is to investigate the feasibility of sharing non-network applications, running on a network server, across the network. The motivation for this effort is to provide workstation access to applications on the network server which control and provide access to resources on such devices as CD-ROM, Laserdisc, and VCR. The cost of providing copies of the software on each workstation would be a moderate expense, but duplicating the necessary hardware would be prohibitive, particularly in a public school environment.
