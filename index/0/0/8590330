In this paper, we report a deployed data mining application system for Motorola. Originally, its intended use was for identifying causes of cellular phone failures, but it has been found to be useful for many other engineering data sets as well. For this report, the case study is a dataset containing cellular phone call records. This data set is like any dataset used in classification applications, i.e., with a set of attributes which can be continuous or discrete, and a discrete class attribute. In our application, the classes are normally ended calls, calls which failed to setup, and calls which failed while in progress. However, the task is not to predict any failure, but to identify possible causes that resulted in failures. Then, engineering efforts may focus on improvements that can be made to the phones. In the course of the project, various classification techniques, e.g., decision trees, na√Øve Bayesian classification and SVM were tried. However, the results were unsatisfactory. After several demonstrations and interaction with domain experts, we finally designed and implemented an effective approach to perform the task. The final system is based on class association rules, general impressions and visualization. The system has been deployed and is in regular use at Motorola. In this paper, we first describe our experiences with some existing classification systems and discuss why they are not suitable for the task. We then present our techniques. As an illustration, we show several visualization screens in the case study, which reveal some important knowledge. Due to confidentiality, we will not give specifics but only present a general discussion about the results.
