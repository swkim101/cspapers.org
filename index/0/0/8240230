The success of the Semantic Web crucially depends on the easy creation, integration and use of semantic data. For this purpose, we consider an integration scenario that defies core assumptions of current metadata construction methods. We describe a framework of metadata creation when web pages are generated from a database and the database owner is cooperatively participating in the Semantic Web. This leads us to the definition of ontology mapping rules by manual semantic annotation and the usage of the mapping rules and of web services for semantic queries. In order to create metadata, the framework combines the presentation layer with the data description layer -- in contrast to "conventional" annotation, which remains at the presentation layer. Therefore, we refer to the framework as deep annotation 1.We consider deep annotation as particularly valid because, (i), web pages generated from databases outnumber static web pages, (ii), annotation of web pages may be a very intuitive way to create semantic data from a database and, (iii), data from databases should not be materialized as RDF files, it should remain where it can be handled most efficiently -- in its databases.
