We present a tool called GiS for indexing and querying a large database of labeled, undirected graphs. Such graphs can model chemical compounds, represent contact maps constructed from 3D structure of proteins, and so forth. GiS supports exact subgraph matching and approximate graph matching queries. It adopts a suite of new techniques and algorithms for (a) fast construction of disk-based indexes with small index sizes, and (b) efficient query processing with high precision of matching. During the demo, the user can index real graph datasets using a recommendation facility in GiS, pose exact subgraph matching and approximate graph matching queries, and view matching graphs using the Jmol browser.
