The paper presents an analysis of human-like reaching movements in manipulation of parallel flexible objects. To predict the trajectory of human hand, a minimum hand jerk model, based on the minimization of integral of squared hand jerk over the movement duration is established. It is shown that within this model the optimal hand trajectory is composed of a fifth order polynomial and two trigonometric terms depending on the natural frequencies of the system and the movement time. A virtual reality-based experimental setup with a haptic simulator is designed, and the prediction by the minimum hand jerk model is verified against experimental data. The theoretical prediction matches the collected data with a reasonable accuracy. The initial experimental results confirm the applicability of the minimum hand jerk model for modeling of human-like reaching movements in dynamic environments.
