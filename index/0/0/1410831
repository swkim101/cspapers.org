In this demonstration, we present SmartLocAuth: locationbased authentication using space dependent information such as service set identifier (SSID) from WLAN access points. SmartLocAuth is a location-based authentication system. Figure 1 illustrates the concept of SmartLocAuth. SmartLocAuth can realize that an application can be unlocked within a predefined authentication area. There are three features on SmartLocAuth. • Does not need GPS, unlike existing location-based authentication system [1]. Therefore, SmartLocAuth can be used indoor as well as outdoor environment. • Can limit authentication area (within several meters). • Not troublesome to unlock, unlike password.
