Recently, neural network based dependency parsing has attracted much interest, which can effectively alleviate the problems of data sparsity and feature engineering by using the dense features. However, it is still a challenge problem to sufficiently model the complicated syntactic and semantic compositions of the dense features in neural network based methods. In this paper, we propose two heterogeneous gated recursive neural networks: tree structured gated recursive neural network (Tree-GRNN) and directed acyclic graph structured gated recursive neural network (DAG-GRNN). Then we integrate them to automatically learn the compositions of the dense features for transition-based dependency parsing. Specifically, Tree-GRNN models the feature combinations for the trees in stack, which already have partial dependency structures. DAG-GRNN models the feature combinations of the nodes whose dependency relations have not been built yet. Experiment results on two prevalent benchmark datasets (PTB3 and CTB5) show the effectiveness of our proposed model.
