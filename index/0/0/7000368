A toggle map is a set of toggle switches that allows the manipulation of several switches with a single mouse drag interaction. Because toggle switches are functionally equivalent to black and white pixels interaction techniques from paint programs can be adopted for this task. A controlled experiment shows that toggle maps can speed up interfaces containing many toggle switches such as the interactive definition of user profiles. To maximize time savings toggle maps have to be laid-out according to co-occurrences between toggles. Efficiency gains resulting from the paint method open up new application areas such as segmented interval sliders. As an example an efficient timer dialog is presented
