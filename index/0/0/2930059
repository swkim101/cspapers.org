Hashing-based methods provide a very promising approach to large-scale similarity search. To obtain compact hash codes, a recent trend seeks to learn the hash functions from data automatically. In this paper, we study hash function learning in the context of multimodal data. We propose a novel multimodal hash function learning method, called Co-Regularized Hashing (CRH), based on a boosted co-regularization framework. The hash functions for each bit of the hash codes are learned by solving DC (difference of convex functions) programs, while the learning for multiple bits proceeds via a boosting procedure so that the bias introduced by the hash functions can be sequentially minimized. We empirically compare CRH with two state-of-the-art multimodal hash function learning methods on two publicly available data sets.
