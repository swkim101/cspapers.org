As the manager of a manufacturing facility, my perspective and evaluation of Design Automation is naturally oriented toward the impact it has had on manufacturing, on its people, and its ability to accomplish in terms of product manufacture what appeared impossible a few years ago.
 In the mid 1950's we in the Endicott Plant were faced with the challenge of converting a high volume electro mechanical manufacturing facility almost overnight into a high volume electronic manufacturing facility. To add to the problem the product we intended to manufacture, namely the computer, was a highly complex electronic assembly which, while packaged within certain standards, had many variations and extremely critical quality control specifications. The answer to the manufacturing problem, being able to produce in great volume the highly complex portions of the computer, lay obviously in the application of automation to the manufacturing process. ~Te had a dilemma, however, and this was the great number of variations of the product which made the conventional automated manufacturing line impractical because of the high number and cost of setups.
