In this paper we present preliminary work on integrating visual sensing with the more traditional sensing modalities for marine locations. We have deployed visual sensing at one of the Smart Coast WSN sites in Ireland and have built a software platform for gathering and synchronizing all sensed data. We describe how the analysis of a range of different sensor modalities can reinforce readings from a given noisy, unreliable sensor.
