In the client-server database systems, clients can maintain their own cache to reduce the overhead of accessing data objects at server databases. In this case: there should be a protocol which ensures the consistency of cahed data, and it can be divded into two classes: pessimistic protocol and optimistic protocol. In this paper, we propose a new cache management scheme which dyuumically applies an appropriate protocol for each data object based on the degree of contention on each of them. When the contention of data objects is uniformly high or uniformly low, the proposed scheme shows the same performance with conventional algorithms, and when the contention is not uniform, the proposed scheme shows better performance than conventiona alorithms.
