Content-based image retrieval systems have to cope with two different regimes: understanding broadly the categories of interest to the user, and refining the search in this or these categories to converge to specific images among them. Here, in contrast with other types of retrieval systems, these two regimes are of great importance since the search initialization is hardly optimal (i.e. the page-zero problem) and the relevance feedback must tolerate the semantic gap of the image's visual features. We present a new approach that encompasses these two regimes, and infers from the user actions a seamless transition between them. Starting from a query-free approach meant to solve the page-zero problem, we propose an adaptive exploration/exploitation trade-off that transforms the original framework into a versatile retrieval framework with full searching capabilities. Our approach is compared to the state-of-the-art it extends by conducting user evaluations on a collection of 60,000 images from the ImageNet database.
