Despite its importance, walking direction is still a key context lacking a cost-effective and continuous solution that people can access in indoor environments. Recently, device-free sensing has attracted great attention because these techniques do not require the user to carry any device and hence could enable many applications in smart homes and offices. In this paper, we present WiDir, the first system that leverages WiFi wireless signals to estimate a human's walking direction, in a device-free manner. Human motion changes the multipath distribution and thus WiFi Channel State Information at the receiver end. WiDir analyzes the phase change dynamics from multiple WiFi subcarriers based on Fresnel zone model and infers the walking direction. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype using commercial WiFi devices and evaluate it in both home and office environments. Experimental results show that WiDir can estimate human walking direction with a median error of less than 10 degrees.
