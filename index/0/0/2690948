Power grid is reaching its limitations, smart-grid technology will be necessary in the near future to increase the efficiency and reliability. Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a potential solution to develop smart grid system in residential area. In this paper, we describe a WSN and mini-Web Server based low cost energy monitoring system which enables residents monitor and control their domestic energy consumption of appliances to optimize their energy cost. Real time power consumption data of home area systems can be accessed by energy provider; based on this data, online pricing can be applied reduce Peak to Average Ratio of energy consumption. The system can support the development of smart grid which delivers electricity from suppliers to consumers based on two-way communications. The advantages of our system are low cost, robustness and simple deployment.
