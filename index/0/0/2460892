The EXPRESS system has been designed and implemented in order to explore methods for user assistance in accessing complexly structured factual databases, e.g. relational product databases. Terminological support in this area has to take into account that different controlled vocabularies may be used in a variety of attributes spread over several relations. In our approach, traditional thesaurus structures are extended in order to cope with these problems and to encode further domain-specific knowledge. User support in query reformulation is based on this enriched thesaurus as well as on the local evaluation of the retrieved data sets. Concepts for the representation of retrieval strategies in the form of plans and their potential use in future systems are discussed.
