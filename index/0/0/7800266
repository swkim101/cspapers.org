The use of community-based projects has been recognized as having pedagogical and experiential value for computing majors (e.g. [3], [4], [5], [6]). Community-based projects can be valuable learning experiences for computing majors as well as for faculty and community partners. However, these types of projects do present challenges for faculty and should be aligned with desired course outcomes. This panel will discuss the use of community-based projects from multiple perspectives. The expectation is that the panel will serve as a forum for the participants to share the opportunities, challenges, pedagogical motivations, and best practices obtained from prior experience. Exemplar projects will be highlighted. The panel also hopes the session motivates the audience to share their own experiences and sparks the interest of those faculty members who may have no prior experience with community-based projects.
