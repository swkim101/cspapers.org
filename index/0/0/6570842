We present a new translation model integrating the shallow local multi bottomup tree transducer. We perform a largescale empirical evaluation of our obtained system, which demonstrates that we significantly beat a realistic tree-to-tree baseline on the WMT 2009 English! German translation task. As an additional contribution we make the developed software and complete tool-chain publicly available for further experimentation.
