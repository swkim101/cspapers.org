As founder of the original Computer Science for All (CS4All) initiative in the Chicago Public Schools, Brenda Darden Wilkerson set the standard for integrating computer science classes into the curriculum for every student. Now, she's leading the charge to break down barriers for women and members of other underrepresented minorities in the tech industry. She argues that, while many administrators and community leaders see CS4All as merely a key component of a new core curriculum, CS educators are actually sowing the seeds of the next workplace revolution. In this inspirational keynote, Brenda will share the ways that educators on the front lines of this inclusive movement can expect to reap the fruits of their labor -- not just professionally, but personally -- in surprising ways. And she'll spotlight the historic role of women, and people of color, in technology and computer science, offering examples that will better allow us all to reclaim our rightful seats at the table.
