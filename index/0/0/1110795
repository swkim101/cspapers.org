Configurable software lets users customize applications in many ways, and is becoming increasingly prevalent. Regression testing is an important but expensive way to build confidence that software changes introduce no new faults as software evolves, resulting in many attempts to improve its performance given limited resources. Whereas problems such as test selection and prioritization at the test case level have been extensively researched in the regression testing literature, they have rarely been considered for configurations, though there is evidence that we should not ignore the effects of configurations on regression testing. This research intends to provide a framework for configuration aware prioritization techniques, evaluated through empirical studies.
