Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) have been extensively used for compressed manufacturing test. They have been recently employed as a foundation for porting constrained-random stimuli from a pre-silicon verification environment to in-system validation. This work advances this concept by improving both the hardware efficiency and the duration of in-system validation experiments.
