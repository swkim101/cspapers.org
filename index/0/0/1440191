Localization of mobile robots can be challenging in highly dynamic environments (airport terminals, stores, hospitals) yet these areas offer great potential for robotics applications. HighWiFi coverage provides a way to localize even low-cost robots that do not need to be equipped with expensive exteroceptive sensors or excessive computational power to run visual-based SLAM algorithms. Since current trend in robotics is in mass-deployment of low-cost, replaceable robots, we focus our efforts in this direction as well. Possible solution is combination of high-tech robots deployed as support assuring reliable localization for the low-cost robots that are actually doing the job. The proposed scenario is to use one SLAM robot to map WiFi signal strength in the working area and provide it to a low-cost robot to correct drift of its 6-DOF gyro-odometry localization system. For this purpose, we extend Gaussian-processes-based WiFi localization algorithms to full 3D and experimentally evaluate the proposed approach in 2 mapping and 7 localization sorties performed on different dates spanning four months.
