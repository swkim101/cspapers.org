However, they often lack metadata such as user role, age, and gender that can provide valuable context for users' actions. Inferring user attributes automatically has wide ranging implications; among others, for customization (anticipating user needs and priorities), for managing resources (anticipating demand) and for security (interpreting anomalous behavior).
