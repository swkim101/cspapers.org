This paper presents a new soft pattern matching method which aims to improve the recall with minimized precision loss in information extraction tasks. Our approach is based on a local tree alignment algorithm, and an effective strategy for controlling flexibility of the pattern matching will be presented. The experimental results show that the method can significantly improve the information extraction performance.
