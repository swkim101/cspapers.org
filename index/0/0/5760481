Infopipes are building blocks for creating data streaming applications, and it is claimed that Infopipes facilitate code reuse. To evaluate this claim, we have built a significant traffic application in Smalltalk using Infopipes. In this paper and accompanying poster, we present a short introduction to Infopipes, a traffic problem and algorithmic solution, and the types of reuse Infopipes facilitate in our implementation of said traffic algorithm.
