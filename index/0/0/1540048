The growth of the Internet brought a new age for game developers. New exciting, highly interactive Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) may be now deployed on the Web, thanks to new scalable distributed solutions and amazing 3D graphics systems plugged directly into standard browsers. Along this line, taking advantage of a mirrored game server architecture, we developed a 3D car racing multiplayer game for use over the Web, freely inspired to Armagetron. Game servers are kept synchronized through the use of a fast synchronization scheme which is able to drop obsolete game events to uphold the playability degree while preserving the game state consistency. Preliminary results confirm that smart 3D spaces may be created over the Web where the magic of gaming is reproduced for the pleasure of a huge number of players. This result may be obtained only by converging highly accurate event synchronization technologies with 3D scene graph based rendering software.
