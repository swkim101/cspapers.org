This paper studies an extension of the <i>k</i>-median problem where we are given a metric space (<i>V, d</i>) and not just one but <i>m</i> client sets {<i>S<sub>i</sub></i> ⊆ <i>V}<sub>i</sub><sup>m</sup></i>=1, and the goal is to open <i>k</i> facilities <i>F</i> to minimize: max<sub><i>i</i>∈[m]</sub> {Σ<sub>j∈Si</sub> d(j, F)}, i.e., the worst-case cost over all the client sets. This is a "min-max" or "robust" version of the <i>k</i>-median problem; however, note that in contrast to previous papers on robust/stochastic problems, we have only one stage of decision-making---<i>where should we place the facilities?</i> We present an <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i> + log <i>m</i>) approximation for robust <i>k</i>-median: The algorithm is combinatorial and very simple, and is based on reweighting/Lagrangean-relaxation ideas. In fact, we give a general framework for (minimization) facility location problems where there is a bound on the number of open facilities. For <i>robust</i> and <i>stochastic</i> versions of such location problems, we show that if the problem satisfies a certain "projection" property, essentially the same algorithm gives a logarithmic approximation ratio in both versions. We use our framework to give the first approximation algorithms for robust/stochastic versions of <i>k</i>-tree, capacitated <i>k</i>-median, and fault-tolerant <i>k</i>-median.
