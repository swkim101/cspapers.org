When used with physically handicapped and learning disabled children, computer-based LOGO activities can serve diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, as well as provide insights into theories of knowledge representation and cognitive functioning in general. The impact of LOGO flows from the active role taken by the students in initiating and controlling their activities; from the specifically spatial geometric emphasis of these activities: from the ready availability of problem-solution paths for scrutiny by the. student and by the teacher, and from the prosthetic value of the computer in providing a means for the expression of otherwise trapped intelligence in this population.
