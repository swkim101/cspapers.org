In order to achieve implementation control in a dataflow architecture, it is necessary to bring data streams under control and branch them in accord with prevailing conditions. This study suggests methodologies for modeling and formulating the control overhead of data streams. From these methodologies, techniques are derived to minimize overhead. In order to verify the practicality of these techniques, they were first applied to three representative Japanese dataflow architectures to show their basic ability to reduce overhead, and for further verification, they were next applied to several real applications to test their more specific abilities, as well as their value as techniques for optimizing compilation.
