The emergence of the SCORM specification has shed a light toward standardization of e-learning which makes the reusability and interoperability of learning resources feasible. However, the existing SCORM-compliant asset model is over-simplified; only few asset types are defined. On the other hand, W3Câ€™s declarative-style SMIL is becoming prevalent in designing Webbased instructions with the consideration of temporality and spatiality of the presentations. In addition, advances in real-time multimedia technologies can further vitalize these instructions. In this study, we propose a SMIL-enabled asset model with the enhancement of multimedia streaming. To render SCORMcompliant SMIL-enabled streaming contents, a Java applet-based SMIL RTP/RTSP LMS system is designed in the Java EJB environment to tackle the issue of platform interoperability. The resulting system demonstrates an encouraging direction towards more vivid and interactive SCORM-compliant e-learning.
