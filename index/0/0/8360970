Relational world models that can be learned from experience in stochastic domains have received significant attention recently. However, efficient planning using these models remains a major issue. We propose to convert learned noisy probabilistic relational rules into a structured dynamic Bayesian network representation. Predicting the effects of action sequences using approximate inference allows for planning in complex worlds. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach for online planning in a 3D simulated blocksworld with an articulated manipulator and realistic physics. Empirical results show that our method can solve problems where existing methods fail.
