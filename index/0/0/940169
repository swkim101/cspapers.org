The ATTENDING system has been developed to critique a physician's plan of anesthetic management, and is currently being used experimentally for teaching anesthesia residents. ATTENDING's approach, Medical Plan-Analysis, offers a number of potential social, medical, and medicolegal advantages over systems which simulate a physician's decision-making process, and which therefore have the clinical effect of trying to tell a physician how to practice medicine. Central to Medical Plan-Analysis is the need to identify, assess, and discuss any pertinent risks and risk tradeoffs.
