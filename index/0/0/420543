We present a new approach to model-based monitoring and diagnosis of dynamic systems. The presented DIAMON algorithm uses hierarchical models to monitor and diagnose dynamic systems. DIAMON is based on the integration of teleological parameter-based monitoring models and repair-oriented device-based diagnosis models. It combines consistency-based diagnosis with model-based monitoring and uses an extension of the QSIM-language for the representation of qualitative system models. Furthermore, DIAMON is able to detect and localize a broad range of nonpermanent faults and thus extends traditional diagnosis which exclusively deals with permanent faulty behavior. The operation of DIAMON will be demonstrated on a real-world example in a multiple-faults scenario.
