In this paper, we introduce a multilingual access and retrieval system with enhanced query translation and multilingual document retrieval, by mining bilingual terminologies and aligned document directly from the set of comparable corpora which are to be searched upon by users. By extracting bilingual terminologies and aligning bilingual documents with similar content prior to the search process provide more accurate translated terms for the in-domain data and support multilingual retrieval even without the use of translation tool during retrieval time. This system includes a user-friendly graphical user interface designed to provide navigation and retrieval of information in browse mode and search mode respectively.
