Tree-to-string translation rules are widely used in linguistically syntax-based statistical machine translation systems. In this paper, we propose to use deep syntactic information for obtaining fine-grained translation rules. A head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) parser is used to obtain the deep syntactic information, which includes a fine-grained description of the syntactic property and a semantic representation of a sentence. We extract fine-grained rules from aligned HPSG tree/forest-string pairs and use them in our tree-to-string and string-to-tree systems. Extensive experiments on large-scale bidirectional Japanese-English translations testified the effectiveness of our approach.
