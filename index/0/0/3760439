We present RealPen, an augmented stylus for capacitive tablet screens that recreates the physical sensation of writing on paper with a pencil, ball-point pen or marker pen. The aim is to create a more engaging experience when writing on touch surfaces, such as screens of tablet computers. This is achieved by regenerating the friction-induced oscillation and sound of a real writing tool in contact with paper. To generate realistic tactile feedback, our algorithm analyzes the frequency spectrum of the friction oscillation generated when writing with traditional tools, extracts principal frequencies, and uses the actuator's frequency response profile for an adjustment weighting function. We enhance the realism by providing the sound feedback aligned with the writing pressure and speed. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of superposition and fluctuation of several frequencies on human tactile perception, evaluated the performance of RealPen, and characterized users' perception and preference of each feedback type.
