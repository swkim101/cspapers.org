Interaction design is a major issue for mobile information systems in terms of not only the choice of input-output channels and presentation of information, but also the application of context-awareness. To support experimentation with these factors, we have developed a platform that supports the rapid prototyping of multi-channel, multi-modal, context-aware applications. The paper presents the main components of the platform and describes how it was used to develop a tourist information system for an international arts festival where interaction was based on a combination of speech input-output and interactive paper.
