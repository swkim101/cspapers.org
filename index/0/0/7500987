This poster presents <sc>MonitorMethod</sc> which helps Java programmers gain insight in the behavior of their applications. <sc>MonitorMethod</sc> instruments the Java application and relates hardware performance monitors (HPMs) to the methods in the Java application's source code. We present a detailed case study showing that linking microprocessor-level performance characteristics to the source code is helpful for identifying performance bottlenecks and their causes. In addition, we relate our work to a previously proposed time-based HPM profiling framework.
