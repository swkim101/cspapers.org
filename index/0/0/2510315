Underspecification-based algorithms for processing partially disambiguated discourse structure must cope with extremely high numbers of readings. Based on previous work on dominance graphs and weighted tree grammars, we provide the first possibility for computing an underspecified discourse description and a best discourse representation efficiently enough to process even the longest discourses in the RST Discourse Treebank.
