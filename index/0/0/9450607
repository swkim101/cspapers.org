Among other areas, electronic commerce includes the fields of electronic markets and workflow management. Workflow management systems are usually used to specify and manage inter- and intra-organisational business processes. Although workflow management techniques are capable of specifying and conducting at least parts of market transactions, these techniques are not or are very rarely used for this purpose yet. In both fields, users demand security and integrity to protect for example their privacy, their property rights or digital payments. To satisfy these security demands, a variety of existing security services, mechanisms, protocols, and organisational measures may be used. On the one hand, to encourage using these techniques it is necessary to have a tool which enables a firm's executive to formulate market transaction security demands at a high abstraction level. On the other hand, executing market transactions needs a more formal, machine readable description of the transaction and its security requirements. We present a methodology to specify secure protocols, which are usable to automatically conduct business processes, as well as market transactions.
