Models for the local area computer network known as the Cambridge Ring are developed and evaluated. Two different levels of protocol are considered: the hardware and the Basic Block. These require different approaches and, in the second case, an approximate solution method. A limited comparison between the Cambridge Ring and another ring architecture - the token ring - is carried out.
