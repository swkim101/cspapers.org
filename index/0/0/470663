We advance the state of the art in algorithms that exploit symmetry in planning problems by generalizing previous approaches, and applying symmetry reductions to state-based planners. We suggest several algorithms for symmetry exploitation in state-based search, but also provide a comprehensive view through which additional algorithms can be developed and fine-tuned. We evaluate our approach to symmetry exploitation on instances from previous planning competitions, and demonstrate that our algorithms significantly improve the solution time of instances with symmetries.
