We have been investigating an interactive approach for Open-domain QA (ODQA) and have constructed a spoken interactive ODQA system, SPIQA. The system derives disambiguating queries (DQs) that draw out additional information. To test the efficiency of additional information requested by the DQs, the system reconstructs the user's initial question by combining the addition information with question. The combination is then used for answer extraction. Experimental results revealed the potential of the generated DQs.
