Recently, new deep learning approaches have emerged for representing and modeling graph-structured data while the conventional deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have mainly focused on the grid-structured inputs of image and audio. Leveraged by representation learning capabilities, deep learning-based techniques can detect structural characteristics of graphs, giving promising results for graph applications. In this paper, we attempt to advance deep learning for graph-structured data by incorporating another component: transfer learning. By transferring the intrinsic geometric information learned in the source domain, our approach can construct a model for a new but related task in the target domain without collecting new data and without training a new model from scratch. We thoroughly tested our approach with large-scale real-world text data and confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed transfer learning framework for deep learning on graphs. According to our experiments, transfer learning is most effective when the source and target domains bear a high level of structural similarity in their graph representations.
