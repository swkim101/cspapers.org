The production of documents aimed at supporting the flow of information in an office environment is experiencing an evolution based on the most advanced automation systems which concerns substantially four aspects: 1) the production of manipulable documents showing a high quality of representation; 2) the production of documents that can be integrated (or exported) with other workstation formats on the basis of varying approaches (for instance the ISO standards); 3) the production of processable documents for storage or subsequent post-production; 4) the production of immaterial documents, i.e. documents that do not necessarily need a visual medium (paper, screen) representation for their informative content.
