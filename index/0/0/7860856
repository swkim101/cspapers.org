Robot-assisted surgical procedures are perpetually evolving due to potential improvement in patient treatment and healthcare cost reduction. Integration of an imaging modality intraoperatively further strengthens these procedures by incorporating the information pertaining to the area of intervention. Such information needs to be effectively rendered to the operator as a human-in-the-loop requirement. In this work, we propose a guidance approach that uses real-time MRI to assist the operator in performing robot-assisted procedure in a beating heart. Specifically, this approach provides both real-time visualization and force-feedback based guidance for maneuvering an interventional tool safely inside the dynamic environment of a heart's left ventricle. Experimental evaluation of the functionality of this approach was tested on a simulated scenario of transapical aortic valve replacement and it demonstrated improvement in control and manipulation by providing effective and accurate assistance to the operator in real-time.
