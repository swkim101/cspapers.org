Federated login protocols for the Web are intended to increase user security by reducing the proliferation of passwords that users are expected to remember and use on a day to day basis, however these protocols are vulnerable to recent attacks against TLS that allow attackers to extract session cookies and other such authentication tokens from within TLS sessions. A recent technique, TLS-OBC (origin bound certificates), allows these tokens to be hardened against extraction. This paper describes the design and engineering of OBC-based extensions to federated login protocols. We present two OBC-based variants on the popular Persona federated login protocol, formalizing them with BAN logic and using the automated proof checker from the related Nexus Authentication Logic. We also present a proof of concept implementation, exploring the necessary browser extensions and server support.
