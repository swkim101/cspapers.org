We introduce a simple modification of local image descriptors, such as SIFT, based on pooling gradient orientations across different domain sizes, in addition to spatial locations. The resulting descriptor, which we call DSP-SIFT, outperforms other methods in wide-baseline matching benchmarks, including those based on convolutional neural networks, despite having the same dimension of SIFT and requiring no training.
