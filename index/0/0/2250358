This paper describes a language independent method for alignment of parallel texts that makes use of homograph tokens for each pair of languages. In order to filter out tokens that may cause misalignment, we use confidence bands of linear regression lines instead of heuristics which are not theoretically supported. This method was originally inspired on work done by Pascale Fung and Kathleen McKeown, and Melamed, providing the statistical support those authors could not claim.
