The validity of applying paraphrase rules depends on the domain of the text that they are being applied to. We develop a novel method for extracting domainspecific paraphrases. We adapt the bilingual pivoting paraphrase method to bias the training data to be more like our target domain of biology. Our best model results in higher precision while retaining complete recall, giving a 10% relative improvement in AUC.
