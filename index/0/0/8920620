Information Assurance is a critical to the protection of any data or knowledge management system. If implemented correctly, it can ensure (1) the information is kept secret (confidentiality), (2) the information is not maliciously altered or deleted (integrity), (3) the data can be accessed by an authorized user when needed (availability), and (4) the executor of an action cannot later deny they performed the action (non-repudiation). As in any corporation, information is the lifeblood of Boeing. It is fundamental to the success of all business functions, from the daily operations of the various business units to supplying records on any Boeing-built aircraft when requested by the proper authorities. If any of the information is improperly disclosed, manipulated, or deleted, the results can be disastrous.
