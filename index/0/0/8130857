In this paper, we first introduce a new architecture for parsing, bidirectional incremental parsing. We propose a novel algorithm for incremental construction, which can be applied to many structure learning problems in NLP. We apply this algorithm to LTAG dependency parsing, and achieve significant improvement on accuracy over the previous best result on the same data set.
