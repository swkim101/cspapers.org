WebGL leverages the power of OpenGL to present accelerated 3D graphics on a webpage. The ability to put hardware- accelerated 3D content in the browser will provide a means for the creation of new web based applications that were previously the exclusive domain of the desktop environment. It will also allow the inclusion of features that standalone 3D applications do not have. While WebGL succeeds in bringing the power and low- level API of OpenGL to the browser, it also expects a lot of web developers, who are used to the DOM and JavaScript libraries like jQuery. This paper will look at how mid level APIs can help web developers create unique 3D content that is more than just duplicates of a standalone desktop application on a web page. We will present one such web application named Motionview, built with C3DL, that provides a new means for artist and motion capture studios to communicate with each other. We will also highlight some upcoming project ideas that make use of 3D browser technology in a way that would not have been possible in a desktop environment.
