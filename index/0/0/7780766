In this demonstration, we present the ZOOM*UserView system, and focus on the module which generates a "user view" based on what tasks the user perceives to be relevant in the workflow specification. We will show how user views can be used to reduce the amount of information returned by provenance queries, while focusing on information the user finds relevant. User views are based on the notion of composite tasks, and induce a higher-level specification of a workflow.
