For the last decade, the research community and the industry have used TPC-D and its successor TPC-H to evaluate performance of decision support technology. Recognizing a paradigm shift in the industry the Transaction Processing Performance Council has developed a new Decision Support benchmark, TPC-DS, expected to be released this year. From an ease of benchmarking perspective it is similar to past benchmarks. However, it adjusts for new technology and new approaches the industry has embarked on in recent years. This paper describes the main characteristics of TPC-DS, explains why some of the key decisions were made and which performance aspects of decision support system it measures.
