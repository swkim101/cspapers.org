An original numerical method is presented which is suitable for use in a course in numerical analysis. It combines numerical differentiation with numerical integration to extend the solution of a particular kind of partial differential equation throughout a rectangular grid. An implementation of the method together with a friendly user interface is available from the author for instructional use.
