Nomophobia, which refers to discomfort or anxiety caused by being unable to use one's smartphone, has become prevalent among smartphone users. However, the influence of nomophobia on employees' work-related outcomes remains unclear. Drawing on the job demands-resources theory, this study develops a model that explores the interplay between employees' nomophobia, work engagement, emotional exhaustion, work interruption, and job productivity. The proposed model was tested using data collected from 187 employees in one organization. The results demonstrate that some employees with high levels of nomophobia feel more engaged with their work and more productive, yet others tend to be emotionally exhausted and feel they are less productive. By illuminating the dual effects of nomophobia on employees' work-related outcomes, this study extends our understanding of how smartphone use positively and negatively affects employees in the workplace. The notion of nomophobia in the workplace is discussed, along with new directions for research.
