The system described in this article is called ARCHIT. Perhaps the clearest way to understand how the system operates is to give a brief description of a user example. Before we do this we will explain a little about the technical aspects of the system. All of the programs are written in Fortran IV and operate on a PDP-10 time sharing computer. The user communicates to the program via a remote terminal which can be either a teletype or a scope. Most users in our current experiments use a teletype. The user, or client, will sit at the teletype and, following a set of instructions, make connection with the main operating system. All he needs to do is have a user number and type a few simple characters on the teletype, the computer takes it from there. Once having gotten the attention of the computer, the user will then enter into an interactive dialogue with the program. The computer will begin by asking the user questions. An example of the dialogue is indicated below and a sample execution follows the written documentation.
