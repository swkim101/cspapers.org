The Cubetree Storage Organization (CSO)1 logically and physically clusters materialized-views data, multi-dimensional indices on them, and computed aggregate values all in one compact and tight storage structure that uses a fraction of the conventional table-based space. This is a breakthrough technology for storing and accessing multi-dimensional data in terms of storage reduction, query performance and incremental bulk update speed. CSO has been extended with an Active MultiSync controller for synchronizing multiple concurrent access and continuous asynchronous online updates for a non-stop data warehouse.
