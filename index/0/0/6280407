We have designed, developed and administered a course on cloud computing that was taught to over 700 students at our institution over two years. The goal of this project-based course is to provide students with foundational systems concepts as well as experience in developing the required skills to design and deploy viable, robust and elastic web-services within performance and budgetary constraints. We present our objectives, learning outcomes, projects, learning model, outcomes and lessons learned. So far, for this demanding course, our student retention rate is above 80% and enrollment is doubling every year.
