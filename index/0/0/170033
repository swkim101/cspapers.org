Edge and vertex connectivity are fundamental concepts in graph theory. While they have been thoroughly studied in the case of undirected graphs, surprisingly, not much has been investigated for directed graphs. In this article, we study 2-edge connectivity problems in directed graphs and, in particular, we consider the computation of the following natural relation: We say that two vertices v and w are 2-edge-connected if there are two edge-disjoint paths from v to w and two edge-disjoint paths from w to v. This relation partitions the vertices into blocks such that all vertices in the same block are 2-edge-connected. Differently from the undirected case, those blocks do not correspond to the 2-edge-connected components of the graph. The main result of this article is an algorithm for computing the 2-edge-connected blocks of a directed graph in linear time. Besides being asymptotically optimal, our algorithm improves significantly over previous bounds. Once the 2-edge-connected blocks are available, we can test in constant time if two vertices are 2-edge-connected. Additionally, when two query vertices v and w are not 2-edge-connected, we can produce in constant time a “witness” of this property by exhibiting an edge that is contained in all paths from v to w or in all paths from w to v. We are also able to compute in linear time a sparse certificate for this relation, i.e., a subgraph of the input graph that has O(n) edges and maintains the same 2-edge-connected blocks as the input graph, where n is the number of vertices.
