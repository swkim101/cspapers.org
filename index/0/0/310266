A family of low power wireless sensor network devices have been built to enable research and deployments. The devices have featured commercial off the shelf (COTS) components integrated together on a platform commonly referred to as a ”mote”, designed by the University of California, Berkeley. Motes have been used to evaluate wireless sensor network algorithms as well as for environmental monitoring and object tracking deployments. Miniature wireless devices are ideal for high density long term deployments in areas otherwise unsuitable for wired connections or passive devices. We designed and built a new mote platform, Telos (see Figure 1), for use in ultra low power wireless sensor networks [3]. Featuring a TI MSP430 microcontroller, a CC2420 IEEE 802.15.4 compliant radio, and built in sensors, Telos is the lowest power mote to date. IEEE 802.15.4 provides packet handling support and sophisticated channel encoding and encryption not found in previous wireless transceivers. Using these new primitives, we show robust, low power wireless mesh networking using IEEE 802.15.4.
