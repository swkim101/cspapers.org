The TIPSTER collection is unusual because of both its size and detail. In particular, it describes a set of information needs, as opposed to traditional queries. These detailed representations of information need are an opportunity for research on different methods of formulating queries. This paper describes several methods of constructing queries for the INQUERY information retrieval system, and then evaluates those methods on the TIPSTER document collection. Both AdHoc and Routing query processing methods are evaluated.
