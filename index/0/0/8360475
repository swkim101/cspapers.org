I investigate the practices of affinity diagramming, a method for qualitative data analysis and idea generation, and the factors that lead HCI researchers and practitioners to usually perform it on paper rather than on digital devices. Based on my findings, I propose that Ubicomp technology can be used to create an implicit interaction system that allows users to preserve their preferred practices, while offering the benefits of a digital system. Initial prototypes have been built; a more complete prototype system and evaluation of the solution remain to be completed.
