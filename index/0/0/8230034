This paper addresses the problem of designing control schemes for teams of robots engaged in complex highlevel tasks. It presents a method for automatically creating hybrid controllers that ensure that a team of possibly heterogeneous robots satisfies a user-defined high-level task. The proposed approach relaxes constraints on the simultaneous and interleaved motion of the robots, while maintaining constraints on their relative location to guarantee collision-avoidance and prevent deadlock. The approach is demonstrated in the context of a team of robots engaged in sorting objects for recycling.
