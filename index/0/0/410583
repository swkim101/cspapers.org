Robotic coverage path planning describes the problem of determining a configuration space trajectory for successively covering a specified workspace target area with the robot's end-effector. Performing coverage path planning for mobile robots further requires solving the problem of robot placement, i.e. determining of suitable robot base positions to perform the task. Finding an optimal solution is hard as both problems cannot be solved independently. Combined robot placement and coverage planning is particularly interesting if repositioning of the robot is costly or if simultaneous repositioning and end-effector motion is not desired. In this paper, we present a general approach for combined robot placement and coverage path planning that takes constraints like collision avoidance and static stability into account. In contrast to related approaches, we focus on mobile manipulation tasks that require a fixed placement for executing coverage trajectory segments. The approach is evaluated in two scenarios that exemplify the broad range of possible applications: The coverage of a building facade using a robotic manlift and the coverage of an industrial conveyer belt for maintenance tasks using the humanoid robot ARMAR-III.
