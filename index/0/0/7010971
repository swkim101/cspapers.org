Digital simulators are becoming a standard and necessary CAD tool in the circuit design process. The acceptance of this design aid is a result of a number of factors, the predominant one being the over-whelming size and complexity of present day logic circuits and the requirement that a complete test plan be developed for these circuits. Another factor is that recent generation logic simulators have proven to be very flexible tools, capable of simulating very large circuits with a high degree of precision.
