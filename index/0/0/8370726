A multiprocessor system is described which is an experiment in low cost, extensible, multiprocessor architectures. Global issues such as inclusion of a central bus, design of the bus arbiter, and methods of interrupt handling are considered.
 The system initially includes two processor types, based on microprocessors, and these are discussed. Methods for reducing processor demand for the central bus are described.
