Through the use of interpreters it is possible to teach programming languages in an analytic way without the mathematical overhead associated with other formal methods. This is a natural evolution of programming language pedagogy from present approaches that are largely descriptive. As a bonus, students receive training in the use of meta-linguistic abstraction in program design. An example of this approach is presented along with suggested variations and discussion of a number of practical considerations that may be crucial to success in the classroom.
