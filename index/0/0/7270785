A message-switched computer network with end-to-end window flow control is considered. Using recently developed heuristics for the numerical solution of such networks, an algorithm for the selection of “good” flow-control window settings is developed. The criterion of performance is the ratio of the network average throughput versus average network delay. An example network demonstrates the results.
