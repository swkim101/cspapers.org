We present an effective generic communicating rational agent, ARTIMIS, and its application to cooperative spoken dialogue. ARTIMIS' kernel is the implementation of a formal theory of in teraction. This theory involves a set of generic axioms which models, in a homogeneous logi cal framework, principles of rational behaviour, communication, and cooperation. The theory is interpreted by a specifically designed reason ing engine. When applied to the context of natural dialogue, ARTIMIS includes specialised components for speech and natural language processing.
