We are developing support for creativity in learning through information discovery and exploratory search. Users engage in creative tasks, such as inventing new products and services. The system supports evolving information needs. It gathers and presents relevant information visually using images and text. Users are able to search, browse, and explore results from multiple queries and interact with information elements by manipulating design and expressing interest. A field study was conducted to evaluate the system in an undergraduate class. The results demonstrated the efficacy of our system for developing creative ideas. Exposure to diverse information in visual and interactive forms is shown to support students engaged in invention tasks.
