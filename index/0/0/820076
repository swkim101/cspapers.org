Android users can choose from over one million applications (apps) offered through the official Google Play marketplace. Furthermore, a wealth of alternative sources for Android applications is available for users to choose from. These range from curated stores, such as Amazon’s Appstore to less legitimate sources that offer pirated content. The sheer number of mobile applications prompted researchers from academia and industry to develop static analysis techniques that scrutinize these applications for vulnerabilities and malicious functionality. Android applications always execute in the context of the Android framework — a comprehensive collection of functionality that developers can conveniently use from their applications. The prolific use of the framework poses unique challenges for the analysis of Android applications.
