A data base containing pertinent information about the components used in a design is a central part of all digital design aids systems. This paper outlines a data base that has been developed for accomodating a wide variety of integrated circuits (IC's) as well as discrete components. A detailed description of the file structure and access subroutines is included, along with a discussion of the design decisions made during their construction.
