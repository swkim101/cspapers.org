This paper presents the development of a new type of robot capable of vertical and directional jumping. The robot uses soft silicone elastomer based pneumatic actuators as legs that accelerate the platform upwards by rapid pressurization. The robot is able to control and adjust the direction of the jumping by altering the timing patterns in which the individual legs are activated.
