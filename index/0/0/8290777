The logic behind parsers for categorial grammars can be formalized in several different ways. Lambek Calculus (LC) constitutes an example for a natural deduction1 style parsing method.In natural language processing, the task of a parser usually consists in finding derivations for all different readings of a sentence. The original Lambek Calculus, when it is used as a parser/theorem prover, has the undesirable property of allowing for the derivation of more than one proof for a reading of a sentence, in the general case.In order to overcome this inconvenience and to turn Lambek Calculus into a reasonable parsing method, we show the existence of "relative" normal form proof trees and make use of their properties to constrain the proof procedure in the desired way.
