Detecting fraudulent users in online social networks is a fundamental and urgent research problem as adversaries can use them to perform various malicious activities. Global social structure based methods, which are known as guilt-by-association, have been shown to be promising at detecting fraudulent users. However, existing guilt-by-association methods either assume symmetric (i.e., undirected) social links, which oversimplifies the asymmetric (i.e., directed) social structure of real-world online social networks, or only leverage labeled fraudulent users or labeled normal users (but not both) in the training dataset, which limits detection accuracies. In this work, we propose GANG, a guilt-by-association method on directed graphs, to detect fraudulent users in OSNs. GANG is based on a novel pairwise Markov Random Field that we design to capture the unique characteristics of the fraudulent-user-detection problem in directed OSNs. In the basic version of GANG, given a training dataset, we leverage Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) to estimate the posterior probability distribution for each user and uses it to predict a user's label. However, the basic version is not scalable enough and not guaranteed to converge because it relies on LBP. Therefore, we further optimize GANG and our optimized version can be represented as a concise matrix form, with which we are able to derive conditions for convergence. We compare GANG with various existing guilt-by-association methods on a large-scale Twitter dataset and a large-scale Sina Weibo dataset with labeled fraudulent and normal users. Our results demonstrate that GANG substantially outperforms existing methods, and that the optimized version of GANG is significantly more efficient than the basic version.
