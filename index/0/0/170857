This paper deals with Ramsey-type theorems for metric spaces. Such a theorem states that every n point metric space contains a large subspace which can be embedded with some fixed distortion in a metric space from some special class.Our main theorem states that for any ε>0, every n point metric space contains a subspace of size at least n1-ε which is embeddable in an ultrametric with O(log(1/ε)/ε distortion. This in particular provides a bound for embedding in Euclidean spaces. The bound on the distortion is tight up to the log(1/ε) factor even for embedding in arbitrary Euclidean spaces. This result can be viewed as a non-linear analog of Dvoretzky's theorem, a cornerstone of modern Banach space theory and convex geometry.Our main Ramsey-type theorem and techniques naturally extend to give theorems for classes of hierarchically well-separated trees which have algorithmic implications, and can be viewed as the solution of a natural clustering problem.We further include a comprehensive study of various other aspects of the metric Ramsey problem.
