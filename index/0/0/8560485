The structure of the design automation language is examined and the sections of a system specification which can be translated independently of one another are identified. The ability to do incremental translation of changes in a system specification is demonstrated. The tables required for translator operation are defined and an algorithm for generating the required tables from a design language system specification is presented. The procedure for minimization of the system specification prior to logic circuit realization and a method for realization of the various sections of the system specification are described.
