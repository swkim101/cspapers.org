An algorithm is described, whose input is a context-free grammar G and whose output is, if G fulfils a set of conditions, a decision table for a deterministic bottom up parser yielding the syntactic structure of the terminal sentences that belong to L (G). The complexity of the decision table depends on the stringency of the conditions satisfied by G and corresponds to some subsets of context free grammars which are compared with previously defined subsets such as LL(k), BRC (m,k)-i.e bounded right context -, LR(k).
