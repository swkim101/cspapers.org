The hard core model in statistical physics is a probability distribution on independent sets in a graph in which the weight of any independent set I is proportional to λ|I|, where λ > 0 is the vertex activity. We show that there is an intimate connection between the connective constant of a graph and the phenomenon of strong spatial mixing (decay of correlations) for the hard core model; specifically, we prove that the hard core model with vertex activity λ <; λc(Δ+1) exhibits strong spatial mixing on any graph of connective constant Δ, irrespective of its maximum degree, and hence derive an FPTAS for the partition function of the hard core model on such graphs. Here λc(d) ··= dd/(d-1)d+1 is the critical activity for the uniqueness of the Gibbs measure of the hard core model on the infinite d-ary tree. As an application, we show that the partition function can be efficiently approximated with high probability on graphs drawn from the random graph model G (n, d/n) for all λ <; e/d, even though the maximum degree of such graphs is unbounded with high probability. We also improve upon Weitz's bounds for strong spatial mixing on bounded degree graphs [30] by providing a computationally simple method which uses known estimates of the connective constant of a lattice to obtain bounds on the vertex activities λ for which the hard core model on the lattice exhibits strong spatial mixing. Using this framework, we improve upon these bounds for several lattices including the Cartesian lattice in dimensions 3 and higher. Our techniques also allow us to relate the threshold for the uniqueness of the Gibbs measure on a general tree to its branching factor [15].
