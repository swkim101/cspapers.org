In previous work, we have proposed a method of preserving the functional semantics of model-based designs by the use of static checks and a double-buffer protocol [12]. However, this is restricted to static, fixed-priority scheduling and for high-priority to low-priority communications requires a double buffer to be stored for each pair of communicating tasks. In this paper we extend the method to dynamic-priority scheduling in the form of earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling and show that, although scheduling is dynamic, a static buffering scheme can still be used. We also suggest some memory optimizations of our protocol which still preserve the original functional semantics. Finally, we show how model checking can be used to prove correctness of the scheme.
