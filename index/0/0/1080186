For the effective use of a laboratory for teaching parallel processing, it is desirable to have parallel systems that can implement various parallel structures at hardware or software level. Such systems developed in our laboratories are described in this paper. They are a multi-computer with reconfiguration and the PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) with structural implementation. The paper proposes a methodology and several classes of problems for teaching message-passing programming on parallel structures.
