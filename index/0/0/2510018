In this paper we describe work we have done in developing an insertable surgical imaging device with multiple degrees of freedom for minimally invasive surgery. The device is fully insertable into the abdomen using standard 12 mm trocars. It consists of a modular camera and lens system which has pan and tilt capability provided by two small DC servo motors. It also has its own integrated lighting system that is part of the camera assembly. Once the camera is inserted into the abdomen, the insertion port is available for additional tooling, motivating the idea of single-port surgery. A third zoom axis has been designed for the camera as well, allowing close-up and far-away imaging of surgical sites with a single camera unit. In animal tests with the device we have performed surgical procedures including cholecystectomy, appendectomy, running (measuring) the bowel, suturing, and nephrectomy. Preliminary tests suggest that the new device may have advantages over a standard laparoscope including the following. • Low-cost and simple design. • Easier and more intuitive to use than a standard laparoscope. • Joystick operation requires no specialized operator training. • Pan/tilt functions provide a large imaging volume not restricted by the fulcrum point of standard laparoscope. • Time to perform procedures was better than or equivalent to a standard laparoscope. We believe these insertable platforms will be an integral part of future surgical systems. The platforms can be used with tooling as well as imaging devices, allowing many surgical procedures to be performed using such a system.
