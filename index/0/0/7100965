This paper presents a symbol synchronization algorithm in the multi-mode orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Efficient system reconfiguration algorithm applying to the adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) method is also presented. The algorithm for the symbol synchronization uses the shorter repetition period for computing correlation values than existing methods. It can reduce the computational complexity and the estimation delay time. We confirm the performance of the algorithm by using the baseband platform equipped with TMS320C6416 DSP chip. After the synchronization process, we propose the efficient AMC method that use throughput based on the channel characteristic. It changes the modulation process and coding rate dynamically. We measure the throughput of the AMC applied to the system reconfiguration algorithm.
