We describe an approach to domain adaptation that is appropriate exactly in the case when one has enough “target” data to do slightly better than just using only “source” data. Our approach is incredibly simple, easy to implement as a preprocessing step (10 lines of Perl!) and outperforms stateof-the-art approaches on a range of datasets. Moreover, it is trivially extended to a multidomain adaptation problem, where one has data from a variety of different domains.
