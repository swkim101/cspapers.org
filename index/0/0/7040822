We study carding shops that sell stolen credit and debit card information online. By bypassing the anti-scrapping mechanisms they use, we find that the prices of cards depend heavily on factors such as the issuing bank, country of origin, and whether the card can be used in brick-and-mortar stores or not. Almost 70% of cards sold by these outfits are priced at or below the cost banks incur in re-issuing them. Ironically, this makes buying their own cards more economical for the banks than re-issuing. We also find that the monthly revenues for the carding shops we study are high enough to justify the risk fraudsters take. Further, inventory at carding outfits seems to follow data breaches and the impact of delayed deployment of the smart chip technology is evident in the disproportionate share the U.S. commands in the underground card fraud economy.
