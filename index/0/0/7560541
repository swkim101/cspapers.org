This study explores the users' web browsing behaviors that confront phishing situations for context-aware phishing detection. We extract discriminative features of each clicked URL, i.e., domain name, bag-of-words, generic Top-Level Domains, IP address, and port number, to develop a linear chain CRF model for users' behavioral prediction. Large-scale experiments show that our method achieves promising performance for predicting the phishing threats of users' next accesses. Error analysis indicates that our model results in a favorably low false positive rate. In practice, our solution is complementary to the existing anti-phishing techniques for cost-effectively blocking phishing threats from users' behavioral perspectives.
