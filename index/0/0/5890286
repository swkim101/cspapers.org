Mining and searching heterogeneous and large knowledge graphs is challenging under real-world resource constraints such as response time. This paper studies a framework that discover to facilitate knowledge graph search. 1) We introduce a class of summaries characterized by graph patterns. In contrast to conventional summaries defined by frequent subgraphs, the summaries are capable of adaptively summarize entities with similar neighbors up to a bounded hop. 2) We formulate the computation of graph summarization as a bi-criteria pattern mining problem. Given a knowledge graph G, the problem is to discover k diversified summaries that maximizes the informativeness measure. Although this problem is NP-hard, we show that it is 2-approximable. We also introduce an online mining algorithm that trade-off speed and accuracy, under given resource constraints. 3) We develop query evaluation algorithms that make use of the summaries as views. These algorithms efficiently compute (approximate) answers with high accuracy, and only refer to a small number of summaries. Our experimental study verifies that online mining over large knowledge graphs is feasible, and can suggest bounded search in knowledge graphs.
