This paper considers some of the multiplexing issues in communication system design by examining overall system issues. In particular, we distinguish physical multiplexing of resources from logical multiplexing of streams. Both physical-resource multiplexing and logical multiplexing determine the service that can be provided by a communication system. We also discuss two issues affected by logical multiplexing - flow control and the relationship between control and data streams of a connection.
We conclude that the granularity of physical resource sharing must be fine enough to meet the jitter and latency constraints of demanding applications. Also, high speed communication systems should restrict their logical multiplexing to layer 3.
