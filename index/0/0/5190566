The Cubrik Project is an Integrated Project of the 7th Framework Programme that aims at contributing to the multimedia search domain by opening the architecture of multimedia search engines to the integration of open source and third party content annotation and query processing components, and by exploiting the contribution of humans and communities in all the phases of multimedia search, from content processing to query processing and relevance feedback processing. The CUBRIK presentation will showcase the architectural concept and scientific background of the project and demonstrate an initial scenario of human-enhanced content and query processing pipeline.
