In this paper, we present a new algorithm for boosting visual template recall performance through a process of visual expectation. Visual expectation dynamically modifies the recognition thresholds of learnt visual templates based on recently matched templates, improving the recall of sequences of familiar places while keeping precision high, without any feedback from a mapping backend. We demonstrate the performance benefits of visual expectation using two 17 kilometer datasets gathered in an outdoor environment at two times separated by three weeks. The visual expectation algorithm provides up to a 100% improvement in recall. We also combine the visual expectation algorithm with the RatSLAM SLAM system and show how the algorithm enables successful mapping
