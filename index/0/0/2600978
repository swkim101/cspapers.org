Clustering aggregation has emerged as an important extension of the classical clustering problem. It refers to the situation in which a number of different (input) clusterings have been obtained for a particular data set and it is desired to aggregate those clustering results to get a better clustering solution. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to solve the clustering aggregation problem, where the aggregated clustering result is obtained by minimizing the (weighted) sum of the Bregman divergence between it and all the input clusterings. Moreover, under our algorithm framework, we also propose a novel cluster aggregation problem where some must-link and cannot-link constraints are given in addition to the input clusterings. Finally the experimental results on some real world data sets are presented to show the effectiveness of our method.
