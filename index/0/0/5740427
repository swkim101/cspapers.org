Smartphone device inputs, such as inputs from touchscreen, sensors, and GPS, carry sensitive user information, but are vulnerable to passive and active attacks. We present our ongoing design and implementation of SDIF, a Secure Device Input Framework for smartphones. The core components of SDIF are a small and dedicated bare-metal hypervisor built using ARM hardware virtualization support and a user-space sandbox framework. They collectively ensures SDIF's support for unmodified OSes and apps. SDIF guarantees the secure device inputs from hardware to target applications with two key designs. The first is a design of a secure path for input data to be delivered from input device drivers to target applications. The second is a design of trusted device data reading, which ensures input data generated by hardware is faithfully put to device driver memory.
