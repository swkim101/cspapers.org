A Tyranny of Evaluation could be palatable if it wasn’t so impoverished. Henry Lieberman complained at the CHI 2003 Fringe about having to do bad evaluation. As an evaluation evaluator, I sympathise, but rather than banish skinny evaluation warlords, I’m trying to fatten them up and civilise them. Like a hungry wolf, evaluation can savage and devour design, but design must feed evaluation to tame it. I’ve drawn up a new HCI menu for this, but I’ve not managed to cook and taste much yet. It’s a banquet too large for my local research kitchen. Adding a few super chefs and their teams won’t be enough. It’s now time for CHI 2.0 – high bandwidth collaborative social networking for the biggest method bake in HCI history.
