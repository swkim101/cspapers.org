Ten approaches to programming language instruction are summarized. The approaches discussed are: structured programming, modular programming, grammatical versus “whole program”, spiral, problem analysis, computer modeling, computer assisted instruction, instructional television, egoless versus individualistic programming, and team debugging.
 These approaches are discussed in terms of their general characteristics, proposed benefits, and demonstratable effectiveness. It is concluded that the serious lack of empirical research on teaching programming makes it difficult to rationally infer the comparable effectiveness of these pedagogical approaches.
