The paper presents a practical parsing system based on logic programming. A restricted Definite Clause Grammar is assumed as grammar description and the grammar is translated into a parsing program written in Prolog. The system employs a bottom-up parsing strategy with top-down prediction. The major advantages of our system are that the system works in a bottom-up manner so that the left-recursive rules do not cause difficulties, the parsing process does not involve backtracking, and there is no duplicated construction of same syntactic structures. Experiments are shown to estimate the efficiency of the system.
