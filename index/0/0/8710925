SRAM based register file (RF) is one of the major factors limiting the scaling of GPGPU. In this work, we propose to use the emerging nonvolatile domain-wall-shift-write based race-track memory (DWSW-RM) to implement a power-efficient GPGPU RF, of which the power consumption is substantially reduced. A holistic technology set is developed to minimize the high access cost of DWSW-RW caused by the sequential access mechanism. Experiment results show that our proposed techniques can improve the GPGPU performance by 4.6% compared to the baseline with SRAM based RF. The RF energy efficiency is also significantly improved by 2.45Ã—.
