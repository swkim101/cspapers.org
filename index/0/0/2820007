Incremental conceptual clustering is an important area of machine learning. It is concerned with summarizing data in a form of concept hierarchies, which will eventually ease the problem of knowledge acquisition for knowledge-based systems. In this paper we have described INC, a program that generates a hierarchy of concept descriptions incrementally. INC searches a space of classification hierarchies in both top-down and bottom-up fashion. The system was evaluated along four dimensions and tested in two domains: universities and countries.
