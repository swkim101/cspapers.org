Incremental parsing is the task of assigning a syntactic structure to an input sentence as it unfolds word by word. Incremental parsing is more difficult than fullsentence parsing, as incomplete input increases ambiguity. Intuitively, an incremental parser that has access to semantic information should be able to reduce ambiguity by ruling out semantically implausible analyses, even for incomplete input. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by combining an incremental TAG parser with an incremental semantic role labeler in a discriminative framework. We show a substantial improvement in parsing performance compared to the baseline parser, both in full-sentence F-score and in incremental F-score.
