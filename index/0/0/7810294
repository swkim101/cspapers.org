Our previous experiences with deployed intelligent control agents for NASA advanced life support systems (Schreckenghost et al., 2002) inspired us to develop the Distributed Collaboration and Interaction (DCI) system to help humans and mostly-autonomous software agents work together. We discovered many unaddressed needs for human interaction with control agents that operate continuously over months to years to monitor and perform process control for regenerative life support systems. These systems recover usable water or air from the waste products created by biological systems over time. Through the DCI project, we have addressed the needs for interaction between humans and autonomous control systems. This paper describes the software engineering aspects of our experiences, first, in designing and developing a prototype of the DCI system, and later, in adjusting the implementation to make the leap from initial prototype to a system ready to be applied under varying circumstances to meet different needs. The details in the paper focus primarily on the second stage of development. The DCI system is currently deployed, operating 24/7, to assist humans to interact with an advanced Water Recovery System (WRS). In addition, we have demonstrated an application of DCI to support ground personnel in mission support roles.
