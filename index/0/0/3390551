The authors have been using the ZMP (zero moment point) as a criterion to distinguish the stability of walking for a biped walking robot which has a trunk. The authors introduce a control method of dynamic biped walking for a biped walking robot to compensate for the three-axis (pitch, roll and yaw-axis) moment on an arbitrary planned ZMP by trunk motion. The authors developed a biped walking robot and performed a walking experiment with the robot using the control method. The result was a fast dynamic biped walking at the walking speed of 0.54 s/step with a 0.3 m step on a flat floor. This walking speed is about 50% faster than that with the robot which compensates for only the two-axis (pitch and roll-axis) moment by trunk motion.
