A highly integrated array processor (AAP2)-LSI has been developed. After the past 3 years study on the adaptive array processor 1 (AAP1), a challenging improvements on the SIMD's restraints are achieved by using the AAP2-LSI. The AAP2 array system makes it possible to carry out wideband modifiable operation (pseudo MIMD). Furthermore, each PE is capable of supporting a large amount of memory. The AAP2 potential for massively, parallel and pipelined processing is discussed in the field of image processing and CAD applications.
