For over 10 years VLDB has been a leading data base conference where the database research and industry communities present new ideas, indicated new trends, exchanged information about recent technologies and educated newcomers about the state of the art in databases and their applications. This VLDB broadens the link between the database research, industry and applications by introducing the Exhibit Chapter of the Conference which, for this conference, was limited to the industrial exhibits. The exhibits were intended to promote existing products, show new links between databases and applications, and expose a “wish list” of vendors for new database functionality. The exhibits include demos and were intended to illustrate innovative technology, features and implementations of database systems or database applications. We encouraged exhibits from all areas of databases and its applications like Database Engines, Web and Databases, Data Mining, Database Business Applications, OLAP, Data Migration and Transformation Tools, and Metadata tools. The committee accepted eleven exhibits from the industry: “Bridging Heterogeneity: Research and Practice of Database Middleware Technology”. Daimler-Benz.
