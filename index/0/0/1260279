Data analytics has gained more and more focus during recent years and many data processing platforms have been developed. They all provide a powerful but often complex API that users have to learn. Furthermore, results can only be stored or printed, without any possibility for visualization. In this paper we present Piglet, a compiler for the high-level Pig Latin script language that generates code for various platforms like Spark, Flink, Storm, and PipeFabric. Piglet lets users write elegant code with extensions for SPARQL and RDF, as well as support for streaming data. An integration into the notebook-based frontend Zeppelin provides a homogeneous and interactive user interface for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data from different sources and lets users share their scripts and results.
