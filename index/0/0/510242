Large-scale deployment of sensor networks is more and more becoming an issue to researchers and industry alike. The recently revised BTnode architecture provides two wireless radios and facilitates the interconnection of heterogeneous devices. Apart from offering interesting new opportunities in using multi-frontend devices in sensor-network research, this architecture is optimally suited for deployment-support networks as introduced in the following.
