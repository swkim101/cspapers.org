Modern in-memory services rely on large distributed object stores to achieve the high scalability essential to ser-vice thousands of requests concurrently. The independent and unpredictable nature of incoming requests results in random accesses to the object store, triggering frequent remote memory accesses. State-of-the-art distributed memory frameworks leverage the one-sided operations offered by RDMA technology to mitigate the traditionally high cost of remote memory access. Unfortunately, the limited semantics of RDMA one-sided operations bound remote memory access atomicity to a single cache block; therefore, atomic remote object access relies on software mechanisms. Emerging highly integrated rack-scale systems that reduce the latency of one-sided operations to a small multiple of DRAM latency expose the overhead of these software mechanisms as a major latency contributor. This technology-triggered paradigm shift calls for new one-sided operations with stronger semantics. We take a step in that direction by proposing SABRes, a new one-sided operation that provides atomic remote object reads in hardware. We then present LightSABRes, a lightweight hardware accelerator for SABRes that removes all atomicity-associated software overheads. Compared to a state-of-the-art software atomicity mechanism, LightSABRes improve the throughput of a microbenchmark atomically accessing 128B-8KB objects from remote memory by 15-97%, and the throughput of a modern in-memory distributed object store by 30-60%.
