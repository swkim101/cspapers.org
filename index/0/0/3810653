The handoff algorithms in the current generation of 802.11 networks are primarily reactive in nature, because they wait until the link quality degrades substantially to trigger a handoff. They further rely on instantaneous signal strength measurements when choosing the best AP. This approach leads to handoff delays on the order of 1-2 seconds that are unacceptable for delay sensitive applications such as VoIP. We propose a fundamentally new approach to handoffs that is based on continuous monitoring of wireless links. In our approach, a client measures the beacon strengths of all the APs operating on the current, and the overlapping channels, and makes its handoff decisions based on the long-term, and short-term trends in these signals. We show through experiments in a campus wireless network that our proposed algorithms result in more than 50% reduction in average handoff delays, while having the potential to improve overall user performance. Our algorithms have been implemented in today's hardware, and unlike other proposed roaming algorithms in the literature, need no infrastructure support.
