In this paper we present our ongoing study and deployment efforts for enabling FPGAs in datacenters. An important focus is to provide a quantitative evaluation of a wide range of heterogeneous system designs and integration options, from low-power field-programmable SoCs to server-class computer nodes plus high-capacity FPGAs, with real system prototyping and implementation on real-life applications. In the meantime, we develop a cloud-friendly programming interface and a runtime environment for efficient accelerator deployment, scheduling and transparent resource management for integration of FPGAs for large-scale acceleration across different system integration platforms to enable “write once, execute everywhere”.
