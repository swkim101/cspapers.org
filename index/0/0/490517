We introduce a new low-distortion embedding of l<sub>2</sub><sup>d</sup> into l<sub>p</sub><sup>O(log n)</sup> (p=1,2), called the <i>Fast-Johnson-Linden-strauss-Transform</i>. The FJLT is faster than standard random projections and just as easy to implement. It is based upon the preconditioning of a sparse projection matrix with a randomized Fourier transform. Sparse random projections are unsuitable for low-distortion embeddings. We overcome this handicap by exploiting the "Heisenberg principle" of the Fourier transform, ie, its local-global duality. The FJLT can be used to speed up search algorithms based on low-distortion embeddings in l<sub>1</sub> and l<sub>2</sub>. We consider the case of approximate nearest neighbors in l<sub>2</sub><sup>d</sup>. We provide a faster algorithm using classical projections, which we then further speed up by plugging in the FJLT. We also give a faster algorithm for searching over the hypercube.
