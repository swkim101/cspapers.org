Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a general description technology that can be applied to many application domains. Redland is a exible and eAEcient implementation of RDF that complements this power and provides highlevel interfaces allowing instances of the model to be stored, queried and manipulated in C, Perl, Python, Tcl and other languages. Redland is implemented using an object-based API, providing several of the implementation classes as modules which can be added, removed or replaced to allow di erent functionality or application-speci c optimisations. The framework provides the core technology for developing new RDF applications, experimenting with implementation techniques, APIs and representation issues.
