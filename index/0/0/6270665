This paper proposes a novel input technique that aims to switch between relative and absolute coordinates input methods seamlessly based on the "carbon copy" metaphor. We display a small workspace (``carbon copy area'') on a computer screen that corresponds one-to-one with the handy trackpad. The user can input hand-written characters or images using absolute coordinates input on this virtual carbon copy paper and move it anywhere using relative coordinates. Our technique allows a user to call both absolute and relative coordinates input methods and use them appropriately with arbitrary timing. Several advantages can be obtained by combining these methods. We developed a desktop application software to utilize this technique in a real GUI environment based on a user's evaluation.
