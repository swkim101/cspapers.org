We presenta fully-polynomial scheme to approximate the number of independentsets in graphswith maximum degree four. In general, for graphswithmaximum degree A ~ 4, the scheme approximates a weighted sum of independent sets. The weight of each independent set is expressed in terms of a positive parameter A < ~, where the weight of independent set S is Alsl, We also prove complementary hardness of approximation results, which show that it is hard to approximate the weighted sum for values of A > ~ for some constant c > 0.
