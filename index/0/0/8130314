This paper presents a semantically oriented, rule based method for single sentence text generation and discusses its implementation in the Kafka generator. This generator is part of the XCALIBUR natural language interface developed at CMU to provide natural language facilities for a wide range of expert systems and data bases. Kafka takes as input the knowledge representation used in XCALIBUR system and incrementally transforms it first into conceptual dependency graphs and then into English.1
