Combining transfer learning with active learning has attracted much research interest in recent years. Most existing works follow the setting where the class labels in source domain are the same as the ones in target domain. In this paper, we focus on a more challenging cross-class setting where the class labels are totally different in two domains but related to each other in an intermediary attribute space, which is barely investigated before. We propose a novel and effective method that utilizes the attribute representation as the seed parameters to generate the classification models for classes. And we propose a joint learning framework that takes into account the knowledge from the related classes in source domain, and the information in the target domain. Besides, it is simple to perform uncertainty sampling, a fundamental technique for active learning, based on the framework. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.
