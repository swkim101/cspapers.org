Resource management in distributed and heterogeneous databases is an urgent problem nowadays. In this paper, a framework is proposed to give an efficient method to solve this problem. This framework has two main parts. First, the web service architecture is given by analyzing many metadata standards and databases. By using Web service technology, the ontology-based framework of is proposed to address the issues of interoperability and resource integration in e-learning systems. The architecture for management of heterogeneous resources based on semantic web is described.
