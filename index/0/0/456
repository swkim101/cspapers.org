This paper explores the automatic construction of a multilingual Lexical Knowledge Base from pre-existing lexical resources. We present a new and robust approach for linking already existing lexical/semantic hierarchies. We used a constraint satisfaction algorithm (relaxation labeling) to select -among all the candidate translations proposed by a bilingual dictionarythe right English WordNet synset for each sense in a taxonomy automatically derived from a Spanish monolingua] dictionary. Although on average, there are 15 possible WordNet connections for each sense in the taxonomy, the method achieves an accuracy over 80~. Finally, we also propose several ways in which this technique could be applied to enrich and improve existing lexical databases.
