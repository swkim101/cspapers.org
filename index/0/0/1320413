Functional multi-purpose contact lenses have recently attracted attention as suitable means to exploit the characteristics of eyes to diagnose diseases and for drug delivery. In this paper, we provide insights into the design and fabrication of specific prototype contact lenses suitable for wearers with dry eye conditions. The main objective is to integrate a combined system, which constitutes a biosensor for hydration monitoring and a saline solution delivery system, embedded on flexible polymer based substrates. We discuss the state of art and current research progress in smart contact lenses and provide initial hints of the proposed solution and identify specific challenges.
