We describe a tangible interface for building virtual structures using physical building blocks. We demonstrate two applications of our system. In one version, the blocks are used to construct geometric models of objects and structures for a popular game, Quake IIâ„¢. In another version, buildings created with our blocks are rendered in different styles, using intelligent decoration of the building model.
