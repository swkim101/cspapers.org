This paper advocates the incorporation of object oriented framework libraries such as the Standard Template Library (STL) into the first data structures course at the university level. This represents a shift from learning the details of each data structure to an increased emphasis on the use, integration, and extension of these existing frameworks, as well as on the learning of higher-order design and engineering skills.
