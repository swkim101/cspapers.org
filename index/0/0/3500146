Training Arkansas Computing Teachers (TACT) is an NSF-funded three-year project, designed to rapidly address both a) Arkansas' pressing need for computer science (CS) talent and b) the new law requiring all Arkansas high schools to provide access to CS instruction for their students. The goal is to train high school teachers on computational thinking practices and the seven big ideas from the AP CS Principles curriculum framework and to make them CS-certified teachers. The TACT professional development (PD) consists of a two-week face-to-face hands-on workshop for high school teachers during the summer and offers online support throughout the year. During the first week, TACT hosts the UTeach CS Principles course, a classroom-ready curriculum designed in alignment with the CS Principles framework. During the second week, TACT hosts the TACT CS Boot Camp designed to cover CS topics that are typically covered in licensure exams. Effectiveness of the project is measured through the surveys taken by teachers before and after the PD regarding their integration and confidence levels of topics corresponding to seven big ideas. The poster will display details of the PD, example survey questions and our findings in a tabular format. See https://tact.uark.edu.
