Writing patterns is a very important task for leveraging knowledge within an organization or in the software engineering community as a whole. Patterns are more than text, diagrams or source code. Patterns are knowledge that comes from experience. Sharing patterns is sharing knowledge. The creation of a language for pattern meta-specification and a catalog of patterns from different pattern languages described using this language is a clear step towards managing software engineering knowledge. The creation of a web-based visualization tool for the catalog makes this knowledge available to the world, allowing using, searching, linking, and discussing the patterns in the catalog.
