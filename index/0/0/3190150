Blending computational and social elements into software has gained significant attention in key conferences and journals. In this context, "Social Machines" appears as a promising model for unifying both computational and social processes. However, it is a fresh topic, with concepts and definitions coming from different research fields, making a unified understanding of the concept a somewhat challenging endeavor. This paper aims to investigate efforts related to this topic and build a preliminary classification scheme to structure the science of Social Machines. We provide a preliminary overview of this research area through the identification of the main visions, concepts, and approaches; we additionally examine the result of the convergence of existing contributions. With the field still in its early stage, we believe that this work can collaborate to the process of providing a more common and coherent conceptual basis for understanding Social Machines as a paradigm. Furthermore, this study helps detect important research issues and gaps in the area.
