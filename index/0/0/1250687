A family of directed acyclic graphs of vertex indegree 2 is constructed for which there are strategies of the black-white pebble game that use asymptotically fewer pebbles than the best strategies of the black pebble game. This shows that there are straight-line programs that can be evaluated nondeterministically with asymptotically less space than is required by any deterministic evaluation.
