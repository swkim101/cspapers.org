We consider the facility location problem with shortest path distances in a weighted graph. W.h.p., we get an approximation factor of 1.62 in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> + <i>m</i>) time with <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> the number of nodes and edges. Also, as a kind of warm-up, for a metric with a constant-times distance oracle, we get the factor 1.62 deterministically in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> log <i>n</i>) time.Our results build on a recent facility location algorithm of Jain, Mahdian, and Saberi (STOC'02) achieving an approximation factor of 1.61 in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>) time.
