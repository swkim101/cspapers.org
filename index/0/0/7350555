This paper mainly research the probabilistic planning problems based on the creating or destroying objects. Firstly, a new definition on mutex inference is given, because the objects can be created or destroyed and the actions are uncertainty. We adopt the thought of transforming object into proposition. Secondly, we propose a new concept of concurrent action set and give the algorithm for creating concurrent action set too. Thirdly, a novel intelligent planning algorithm, which expanded the planning graph for solving the probabilistic planning problems based on the creating or deleting objects was proposed. The method handles parallel actions in the planning problems and avoids the lengthiness of the solution of the planning problems.
