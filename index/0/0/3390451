In the US, many groups of students are underrepresented in computer science (CS) classes at the K-12 level [23,25]. Many of the activities of TEALS (Technology Education and Literacy in Schools), a national computer science education program, have the potential to impact the diversity of students enrolled in computer science classes, student performance on AP exams, and student attitudes towards CS careers. TEALS works with high schools to build and grow sustainable computer science programs through teaching partnerships between classroom teachers and volunteers who work in the tech industry. In 2016, TEALS initiated a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Working Group (DEIWG) to holistically address the overall impact of the program on increasing diversity in CS, including TEALS' approach to: selection of schools, student recruitment efforts into CS courses, recruitment and training of TEALS volunteers, curriculum design and resources, and instructional support of volunteers and teachers. The working group compared national, regional, and state-wide outcomes and demographics to those of TEALS partner schools, students, volunteers, and teachers to identify best practices and areas in need of investment. This paper describes these findings and presents strategies for future work.
