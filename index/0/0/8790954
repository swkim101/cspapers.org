The Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) is provided by Google to help manufactures to ensure if their Android devices are in compliance with the Android compatibility standards. However, the CTS contains a huge number of test cases and it usually would take several hours to complete the CTS tests. This could seriously affect the development schedule of Android devices, especially when the CTS test is included in the daily system integration. To reduce the time to perform CTS tests and shorten the time-to-market of Android devices, this paper presents an approach for improving the CTS test efficiency. Particularly, the CTS test is decomposed into multiple tasks to be executed on different devices concurrently. In addition, the task scheduling and partitioning methods are considered in the approach. A cloud-based testing platform is developed to support the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the efficiency of CTS test can be much improved as the number of devices increases. Moreover, the results also indicate that the Longest Job First (LJF) scheduling and mixed partitioning methods can result in better test efficiency.
