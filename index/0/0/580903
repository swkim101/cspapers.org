This paper examines whether feature sets which have been developed for authorship attribution can also be used for the sentence extraction task. Experiments show that the feature sets distinguish significantly better between extract and non-extract sentences than a random baseline classifier, but that a careful combination with other features is necessary in order to outperform a positional baseline classifier. Furthermore, it is vital that the training material reflects the intended task.
