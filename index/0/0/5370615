We address relation classification in the context of slot filling, the task of finding and evaluating fillers like “Steve Jobs” for the slot X in “X founded Apple”. We propose a convolutional neural network which splits the input sentence into three parts according to the relation arguments and compare it to state-ofthe-art and traditional approaches of relation classification. Finally, we combine different methods and show that the combination is better than individual approaches. We also analyze the effect of genre differences on performance.
