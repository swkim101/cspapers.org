We have developed a novel technique for injecting and cutting animal cells for an automatic cloning system. Animal cells that have been chemically softened are aspirated into a narrow teflon tube, which is then inserted into a microfluidic chip. The tube's tip is inserted into a microchannel and releases the aspirated cells in the microchannel. The microfluidic chip contains two orthogonal channels. One is a narrow microchannel that aspirates and fixes a cell; in the other channel, a fluid flows at high velocity for cutting the aspirated cell. The thickness of the aspiration channel can be adjusted to fix the aspirated cell. Half the volume of the cell is aspirated into the narrow microchannel and high-speed flow is then generated to cut the cell into two. In this report, the cutting method and the injection method are described. Then an imaging process is also investigated for an automatic cutting.
