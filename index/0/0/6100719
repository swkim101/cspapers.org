A method for parallel morphological and syn tactic analysis of Japanese language is pro posed. Parallel syntactic analysis is based on an efficient parallel LR parsing algorithm for general context-free grammars. It han dles syntactic features as constraints. Each syntactic feature is defined by a verbal sub-categorization and attached to a special set of phrases called bunsetsu in Japanese. The bunsetsu is used as a processing unit for both analyses. All processes act asynchronously, and are coordinated on a P-RAM(Parallel Random Access Machine).
