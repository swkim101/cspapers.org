Prostate cancer biopsy is a routine medical procedure, yet conventional techniques suffer from low sensitivity attributed to suboptimal image guidance and needle placement. Targeting small lesions and foci (5 mm in diameter) is particularly prone to errors. We developed an integrated system to perform robot-assisted transperineal needle insertions into the prostate, under Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guidance. The system provides arbitrary needle trajectories and allows for simultaneous surveillance and correction of the needle path, based on intra-operative MRI. System functionality and data transfer and processing tests were conducted. Five lesions embedded in the gel phantom were targeted successfully, while communication delays (due to higher image frame rates) had no adverse affect on robot-software communication. The system was sufficiently resistant to high network loads and performed with an acceptable transfer rate.
