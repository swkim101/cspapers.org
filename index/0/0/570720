This paper proposes a new algorithm for evaluating the number of chaining variable conditions(CVCs) in the selecting step of a distrubance vector (DV) for the analysis of SHA-1 collision attack. The algorithm is constructed by combining the following four strategies, "Strict Differential Bit Compression", "DV expansion", "Precise Counting Rules in Every Step" and "Differential Path Confirmation for Rounds 2 to 4", that can evaluate the number of CVCs morestrictly compared with the previous approach.
