This paper discusses various strategies for introducing and reinforcing software engineering principles in the undergraduate Computer Science curriculum. These strategies are based on a set of standards for internal/external documentation and organization of software which may be implemented quickly and inexpensively without a complete overhaul of courses. This provides a flexible framework for the development of a wide variety of carefully-planned programming assignments/projects.
