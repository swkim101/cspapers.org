We construct a humans-in-the-loop supervised learning framework that integrates crowdsourcing feedback and local knowledge to detect job-related tweets from individual and business accounts. Using data-driven ethnography, we examine discourse about work by fusing language-based analysis with temporal, geospational, and labor statistics information.
