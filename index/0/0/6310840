This paper describes an alternative approach to software architecture, where the classical division of responsibilities between operating systems, programming languages and compilers, and so forth is revised. Our alternative is organized as a set of self-contained environments which are able to communicate pieces of software between them, and whose internal structure is predominantly descriptive and declarative. The base structure within each environment (its diversified shell) is designed so that it can accomodate such arriving software modules.
 The presentation of that software architecture is done in the context of an operational implementation, the SCREEN system (System of Communicating REsidential ENvironments).
