A new and effective salient region detection method based on local and global saliency information is proposed. To keep the completeness of salient regions, the input image is segmented into several regions firstly. Then for each region, local saliency and global saliency are generated respectively. The local saliency is computed by multi-scale neighborhood contrast, and the global saliency is measured according to global spatial distribution and inter-region isolation of features. Based on the local saliency and global saliency, the final saliency can be obtained by the weighted combination of them. The comparison experiment results demonstrate the effective performance of the proposed algorithm on salient region detection.
