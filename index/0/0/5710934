In this paper we propose a new knowledge management task which aims to map Web pages to their corresponding records in a structured database. For example, the DBLP database contains records for many computer scientists, and most of these persons have public Web pages; if we can map the database record with the appropriate Web page then the new information could be used to further describe the person's database record. To accomplish this goal we employ link paths which contain anchor texts from multiple paths through the Web ending at the Web page in question. We hypothesize that the information from these link paths can be used to generate an accurate Web page to database record mapping. Experiments on two large, real world data sets, DBLP and IMDB for the structured data and computer science faculty members' Web pages and official movie homepages for the Web page data, show that our method does provide an accurate mapping. Finally, we conclude by issuing a call for further research on this promising new task.
