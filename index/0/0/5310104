We fist give a new presentation of an algorithm from Thurston of tiling with lozenges formed from two cells of the triangular lattice A. Secondly we extend the method to get a lineatalgorithm of tiling with leaning dominoes (parallelograms formed from four cells of A) and triangles (formed from four cells of A). Thirdly, we produce a quadratic algorithm of tiling with leaning dominoes.
