In contrast to Virtual Reality (VR) and traditional surgical training, simulation-based training in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), and Augmented Reality (AR) technology, constitute relatively new application fields in surgery. However, between simulation and AR there is a direct link: the utilization of state-of-the art computer graphics tools and techniques. Nevertheless, an integrated research system that introduces AR properties in simulation-based surgical training scenarios has not yet been proposed in the current literature. In this article we provide a survey on the simulation techniques and systems employed for surgical skills training based on traditional as well as more advanced VR technologies. Moreover, we summarize recent experimental results with regard to the design of a novel AR-based simulator developed in our lab for basic skills training in MIS.
