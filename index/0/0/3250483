Music listening is an integral part of many adolescents? everyday lives, but it is also a time when adolescents are uniquely vulnerable. Emotional-oriented and avoidance through listening to unsuitable music may bring negative emotion to adolescents and increase the level of their depression. We propose MeDJ, a multidimensional emotion-aware music delivery application, which turns adolescents' music listening into a health and pleasure way. MeDJ aims at helping adolescents to improve emotional management and prevent depression. It is built on a cloud-based platform that enables adolescents and their peers collaboratively recommend suitable music to each other through smartphones. Prototype implementation and initial results of MeDJ have demonstrated its practicability for real-world deployment.
