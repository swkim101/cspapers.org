Smartphones are playing an increasingly important role in personal life and carrying massive private data. Unfortunately, once the smartphones are stolen, all the sensitive information, such as contacts, messages, photos, credit card information and passwords, may fall into the hands of malicious people. In order to protect the private data, remote deletion mechanism is required to allow owners to wipe the sensitive data on the stolen phone remotely. Existing remote deletion techniques rely on the availability of either WiFi for Internet connection or SIM card for cellular network connection; however, these requirements may not be satisfied when the phones are stolen by some sophisticated adversaries. In this paper, we propose a new remote deletion mechanism that allows the phone owner to delete the private data remotely even if the WiFi is disabled and the SIM card is unplugged. The basic idea is to use emergency call mechanisms to establish a communication connection with a service provider to verify the state of the phone and perform remote deletion. We present a case study of our mechanism with the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) network.
