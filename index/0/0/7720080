Hebbian and competitive Hebbian algorithms are almost ubiquitous in modeling pattern formation in cortical development. We analyse in theoretical detail a particular model (adapted from Piepenbrock & Obermayer, 1999) for the development of Id stripe-like patterns, which places competitive and interactive cortical influences, and free and restricted initial arborisation onto a common footing.
