This paper presents a method to estimate external forces exerted on a manipulator during motion, avoiding the use of a sensor. The method is based on task-oriented dynamics model learning and a robust disturbance state observer. The combination of both leads to an efficient torque observer that can be incorporated to any control scheme. The use of a learning-based approach avoids the need of analytical models of joints' friction or Coriolis dynamics effects.
