It is often difficult to select relevant and reasonable laboratory assignments in an introductory operating systems course. The students are seldom prepared to code intricate portions of an operating system, even if suitable hardware were available for such extensive use. Nevertheless, it is essential that the students gain a quantitative insight into the components and interactions of simple and complex operating systems. An operating system simulator that allows an evaluation of the performances of various operating system configutations without requiring the student to write complicated code would help to solve the dilemma. An operating systems simulator named POPSS is a fine tool for such such use.
