We study an online job scheduling problem motivated by storyboarding in web advertising, where an advertiser derives value from uninterrupted sequential access to a user surfing the web. The user ceases to browse with probability 1 -- Î² at each step, independently. Stories (jobs) arrive online; job s has length ls and per-unit value vs. A value vs is obtained for every unit of the job that is scheduled consecutively without interruption, discounted for the time at which it is scheduled. Jobs can be preempted, but no further value can be derived from the residual unscheduled units of the job. We seek an online algorithm whose total reward is competitive against that of the offline scheduler that knows all jobs in advance. 
 
We consider two models based on the maximum delay that can be allowed between the arrival and scheduling of a job. In the first, a job can be scheduled anytime after its arrival; in the second a job is lost unless scheduled immediately upon arrival, preempting a currently running job if needed. The two settings correspond to two natural models of how long an advertiser retains interest in a relevant user. We show that there is, in fact, a sharp separation between what an online scheduler can achieve in these two settings. In the first setting with no deadlines, we give a natural deterministic algorithm with a constant competitive ratio against the offline scheduler. In contrast, we show that in the sharp deadline setting, no (deterministic or randomized) online algorithm can achieve better than a polylogarithmic ratio.
