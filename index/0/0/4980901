Balancing interpagefault lifetime (L) against page swap time (S) has always been a performance criterion of great intuitive appeal. This paper shows that, under normal conditions, controlling the memory policy parameter to enforce the constraint L ≥ S, and allowing the multiprogramming load to rise as high as demand warrants without violating this constraint, will produce a load slightly higher than optimum. Equivalently, using the criterion L &equil; uS for some u slightly larger than 1 will approximate an optimal load. Using simulations, this criterion is compared with two others reported in the literature, namely the “knee criterion” (operate with L at the knee of the lifetime curve) and the 50% criterion (operate with the paging device at 50% utilization).The knee criterion produced optimal loads more often than the L&equil;S criterion, which in turn produced optimal loads more often than the 50% criterion. Since no practical implementation of the knee criterion is known, the L&equil;S criterion is the most attractive of the three.
