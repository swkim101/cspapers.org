In recent years, data mining researchers have developed efficient association rule algorithms for retail market basket analysis. Still, retailers often complain about how to adopt association rules to optimize concrete retail marketing-mix decisions. It is in this context that, in a previous paper, the authors have introduced a product selection model called PROFSET. This model selects the most interesting products from a product assortment based on their cross-selling potential given some retailer defined constraints. However this model suffered from an important deficiency: it could not deal effectively with supermarket data, and no provisions were taken to include retail category management principles. Therefore, in this paper, the authors present an important generalization of the existing model in order to make it suitable for supermarket data as well, and to enable retailers to add category restrictions to the model. Experiments on real world data obtained from a Belgian supermarket chain produce very promising results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the generalized PROFSET model.
