This poster summarizes the product of the author/s 2016 ACM SIGCSE Special Projects grant. The author created a Reacting to the Past (RTTP) historical role-playing game entitled "Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and the Dawn of Computing." According to the RTTP Web site, RTTP "...consists of elaborate games, set in the past, in which students are assigned roles informed by classic texts in the history of ideas. Class sessions are run entirely by students; instructors advise and guide students and grade their oral and written work. It seeks to draw students into the past, promote engagement with big ideas, and improve intellectual and academic skills." In the Babbage game, students take on the personae of the key figures in early Victorian science and engineering, and debate whether or not the British government should provide funding for the development of Babbage/s Difference and Analytical Engines. Game sessions take place at Babbage/s home, the London Mechanic/s Institute, and the Royal Society. The game can be played in six, seven, or eight class sessions, and includes three optional labs. There are 28 playable characters in the game. The game can be used in history of science or history of computing courses, and also in general-audience first-year seminar courses, to encourage students to study computing. The poster covers the background of RTTP games in general; some of the specifics of the Babbage game in particular; and includes pictures and insights from the first playtesting of the game during the author's fall 2017 first-year seminar course.
