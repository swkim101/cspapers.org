This paper deals with the robot handling of deformable linear objects (DLO), such as hoses, wires or leaf springs, based on contact state transitions and force/moment sensing. First, we describe the characteristic change of force and moment for all single-contact transitions which may occur between the DLO and a rigid polyhedron obstacle. Second, we discuss the sensor data processing for the automated detection of the state transitions.
