This problemis exacerbated when we rely unrealistically on a singletraining data source, which is often insufficient to coverthe intrinsically complex face variations. This paperproposes a principled multi-task learning approachbased on Discriminative Gaussian Process Latent VariableModel (DGPLVM), named GaussianFace, for faceverification. In contrast to relying unrealistically on asingle training data source, our model exploits additional data from multiple source-domains to improve the generalization performance of face verification inan unknown target-domain. Importantly, our model can adapt automatically to complex data distributions, and therefore can well capture complex face variations inherent in multiple sources. To enhance discriminative power, we introduced a more efficient equivalent form of Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis to DGPLVM.To speed up the process of inference and prediction, we exploited the low rank approximation method. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in learning from diverse data sources and generalizing to unseen domains. Specifically, the accuracy of our algorithm achieved an impressive accuracyrate of 98.52% on the well-known and challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark. For the first time, the human-level performance in face verification (97.53%) on LFW is surpassed.
