Constraint-Based Languages and SystemsBjom Freeman-Benson , University of Victoria, CanadaAlan Boming, University of Washington
A constraint is a relation that should be satisfied, forexample, that a line remain horizontal, that a resistor in anelectrical circuit simulation obey Ohms Law, or that the height ofa bar in a bar chart be proportional to some number in anapplication program. Constraints have been used in a variety oflanguages and systems, particularly in user interface tool kits, inplanning and scheduling, and in simulation. They provide anintuitive declarative style of programming that integrates wellwith object-oriented systems.
This tutorial teaches what constraints are, how to use them inapplications such as user interfaces, how to implement them(including how to implement constraint hierarchies), and how toembed them in object-oriented and logic programming languages. Youdont have to know anything about constraints, but it would behelpful to have a strong background in programming languages.
