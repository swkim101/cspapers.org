The AI Lab at Chicago has begun development of a new set of software agents designed to manage the flood of data colloquially called the "information superhighway". Our approach takes its lead from case-based technology [Riesbeck and Schank, 1989; Hammond, 1989; Kolodner, 1993] in that we are building systems that emphasize the use of examples over explicit queries or questions for communicating with the user.
