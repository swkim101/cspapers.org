We develop a Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP) model based on the syntactic representations of Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG). We start by summarizing the original DOP model for tree representations and then show how it can be extended with corresponding functional structures. The resulting LFG-DOP model triggers a new, corpus-based notion of grammaticality, and its probability models exhibit interesting behavior with respect to specificity and the interpretation of ill-formed strings.
