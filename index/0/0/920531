The skyline query, as an important operator in databases for multi-preference analysis and decision making, has received much attention recently due to its wide application backgrounds. In this paper, we consider the skyline query problem in Wireless Sensor Network with an objective to maximize the network lifetime by proposing filter-based distributed algorithms for skyline evaluation and maintenance. We also conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform existing algorithms on various datasets.
