"Developmental robotics" proposes that, instead of trying to build a robot that shows intelligence once and for all, what one must do is to build robots that can develop. These robots should be equipped with behaviors that are simple but enough to bootstrap the system. Then, as the robot interacts with its environment, it should display increasingly complex behaviors. In this paper, we propose such a development scheme for a mobile robot. J.J. Gibson's concept of "affordances" and a formalization of this concept provides the basis of this development scheme. We show that an autonomous robot can start with pre-coded primitive behaviors, and as it executes its behaviors randomly in an environment, it can learn the affordance relations between the environment and its behaviors. We then present two ways of using these learned structures, in achieving more complex, intentional behaviors. In the first case, the sequencing of these primitive behaviors are such that new more complex behaviors emerge. In the second case, the robot makes a "blending" of its pre-coded primitive behaviors to create new behaviors.
