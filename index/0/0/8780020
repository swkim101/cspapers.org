This paper shows how humans and machines can better collaborate to acquire adaptation knowledge (AK) in the framework of a case-based reasoning (CBR) system whose knowledge is encoded in a semantic wiki. Automatic processes like the CBR reasoning process itself, or specific tools for acquiring AK are integrated as wiki extensions. These tools and processes are combined on purpose to collect AK. Users are at the center of our approach, as they are in a classical wiki, but they will now benefit from automatic tools for helping them to feed the wiki. In particular, the CBR system, which is currently only a consumer for the knowledge encoded in the semantic wiki, will also be used for producing knowledge for the wiki. A use case in the domain of cooking is given to exemplify the man-machine collaboration.
