Tourist photographs constitute a large part of the images uploaded to photo sharing platforms. But filtering methods are needed before one can extract useful knowledge from noisy user-supplied metadata. Here we show how to extract clean trip related information (what people visit, for how long, panoramic spots) from Flickr metadata. We illustrate our technique on a sample of metadata and images covering 183 cities of different size and from different parts of the world.
