We present KELVIN, an automated system for processing a large text corpus and distilling a knowledge base about persons, organizations, and locations. We have tested the KELVIN system on several corpora, including: (a) the TAC KBP 2012 Cold Start corpus which consists of public Web pages from the University of Pennsylvania, and (b) a subset of 26k news articles taken from English Gigaword 5th edition. Our NAACL HLT 2013 demonstration permits a user to interact with a set of searchable HTML pages, which are automatically generated from the knowledge base. Each page contains information analogous to the semi-structured details about an entity that are present in Wikipedia Infoboxes, along with hyperlink citations to supporting text.
