Microblogging services have revolutionized the way people exchange information. Confronted with the ever-increasing numbers of microblogs with multimedia contents and trending topics, it is desirable to provide visualized summarization to help users to quickly grasp the essence of topics. While existing works mostly focus on text-based methods only, summarization of multiple media types (e.g., text and image) are scarcely explored. In this paper, we propose a multimedia microblog summarization framework to automatically generate visualized summaries for trending topics. Specifically, a novel generative probabilistic model, termed multimodal-LDA (MMLDA), is proposed to discover subtopics from microblogs by exploring the correlations among different media types. Based on the information achieved from MMLDA, a multimedia summarizer is designed to separately identify representative textual and visual samples and then form a comprehensive visualized summary. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world Sina Weibo microblog dataset to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method against the state-of-the-art approaches.
