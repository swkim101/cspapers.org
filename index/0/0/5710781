Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attacks have cost millions of dollars to online companies. Unfortunately, these attacks are particularly di cult to stop since hackers are able to hide their IP address by IP spoo ng, so that it is often impossible to identify their location. Our proposal, Router Stamping, would help to identify the source of Denial of Service attacks, provided that a signi cant percentage of packets are sent from one subnet. In accomplishing this, Router Stamping imposes only a small increase in the size of the packet header. In addition, it is easy to implement and maintain, and it can function in the presence of some noncompliant or malicious routers.
