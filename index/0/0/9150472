Current trends, such as mixed-criticality real-time systems, boost performance by leveraging system dynamics and adaptivity, but also amplify challenges for control engineering and real-time-system design. Applications behave more adaptively and more applications will be consolidated on the same realtime system competing for the same resources, turning timing properties of single applications more and more unpredictable. A presumption of such adaptive systems is that scheduling timing-sensitive applications with better response times will hopefully provide better but in any case not worse quality on the application level. The experiment discussed disproves this simple assumption: A simulated switch of schedule e.g., when raising criticality, towards better response times for the application induces a short but massive degradation of Quality of Control, as can be deduced from an increase in cost. This demonstrates that the timing sensitivity of control applications is far more complex than anticipated by most realtime engineers and calls for a close collaboration with control researchers. It needs to be analyzed how scheduling and other decisions in the design process of real-time systems relate the Quality of Control. Based on this, the results of this analysis should be made available in the design process to directly optimize systems with respect to the control application.
