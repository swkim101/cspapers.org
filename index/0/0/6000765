Virtual reality (VR) using head-mounted displays (HMDs) is becoming popular. Smartphone-based HMDs (SbHMDs) are so low cost that users can easily experience VR. Unfortunately, their input modality is quite limited. We propose a real-time eye tracking technique that uses the built-in front facing camera to capture the user's eye. It realizes stand-alone pointing functionality without any additional device.
