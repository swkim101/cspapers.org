We show that the point containment problem in the integer hull of a polyhedron, which is defined by m inequalities, with coefficients of at most &phis; bits can be solved in time O(m + &phis;) in the two-dimensional case and in expected time O(m + &phis;2 log m) in any fixed dimension. This improves on the algorithm which is based on the equivalence of separation and optimization in the general case and on a direct algorithm (SODA 97) for the two-dimensional case.
