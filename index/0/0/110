This paper presents a partial solution to a component of the problem of lexical choice: choosing the synonym most typical, or expected, in context. We apply a new statistical approach to representing the context of a word through lexical co-occurrence networks. The implementation was trained and evaluated on a large corpus, and results show that the inclusion of second-order co-occurrence relations improves the performance of our implemented lexical choice program.
