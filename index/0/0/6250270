Recent years have witnessed the explosive growth of online social media. Weibo, a famous "Chinese Twitter", has attracted over 0.5 billion users in less than four years, with more than 1000 tweets generated in every second. These tweets are informative but very fragmented, and thus would be better archived from an event perspective, as done by Weibo itself in the "Micro-Topic" program. This effort, however, is yet far from satisfaction for not providing enough analytical power to events. In light of this, in this demo paper, we propose SEA, a System for Event Analysis on Chinese tweets. In general, SEA is an event-centric, multi-functional platform that conducts panoramic analysis on Weibo events from various aspects, including the semantic information of the events, the temporal and spatial trends, the public sentiments, the hidden sub-events, the key users in the event diffusion and their preferences, etc. These functions are enabled by the integration of various analytical models and by the noSQL techniques adopted purposefully for massive tweets management. Finally, a case study on the "Spring Festival" event demonstrates the effectiveness of SEA. To our best knowledge, SEA is the first third-party system that provides panoramic analysis to Weibo events.
