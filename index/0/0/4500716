As a framework for extractive summarization, sentence regression has achieved state-of-the-art performance in several widely-used practical systems. The most challenging task within the sentence regression framework is to identify discriminative features to encode a sentence into a feature vector. So far, sentence regression approaches have neglected to use features that capture contextual relations among sentences. We propose a neural network model, Contextual Relation-based Summarization (CRSum), to take advantage of contextual relations among sentences so as to improve the performance of sentence regression. Specifically, we first use sentence relations with a word-level attentive pooling convolutional neural network to construct sentence representations. Then, we use contextual relations with a sentence-level attentive pooling recurrent neural network to construct context representations. Finally, CRSum automatically learns useful contextual features by jointly learning representations of sentences and similarity scores between a sentence and sentences in its context. Using a two-level attention mechanism, CRSum is able to pay attention to important content, i.e., words and sentences, in the surrounding context of a given sentence. We carry out extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets. CRSum alone can achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art approaches; when combined with a few basic surface features, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of multiple ROUGE metrics.
