The Papers of recent SIGCSE Technical Symposia on Computer Science Education document en increasing emphasis on student communication skills. Descriptions of successful course modifications span the undergraduate curriculum, from the introductory CS 1 course [Brown88], through the intermediate data structures course [Hertrnan89] and the juniorlevel software engineering course [Sellars85], to the capstone project course [Meinke87]. One department has consciously tried to provide at least one significant writing assignment in every major course [Jackowhz90]. Prescriptions for improving communication skills throughout the undergraduate computer science curriculum have also been presented [Hartman90, Pesante9 1]. For the past four years, the departments of Computer Science and English at Eastern Washington University have engaged in formal collaborations to develop the writing skills of undergraduate computer science and computer information systems majors. The purpose of this paper is to share our experiences with the academic computer science community.
