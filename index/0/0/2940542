In order to share information in the cloud for multi-robot systems, efficient data transmission is essential for real-time operations such as coordinated robotic missions. As a limited resource, bandwidth is ubiquitously required by applications among physical multi-robot systems. In this paper, we proposed a hierarchical auction-based mechanism, namely LQM (Link Quality Matrix)-auction. It consists of multiple procedures, such as hierarchical auction, proxy scheduling. Note that the proposed method is designed for real-time resource retrieval for physical multi-robot systems, instead of simulated virtual agents. We validate the proposed mechanism through real-time experiments. The results show that LQM-auction is suitable for scheduling a group of robots, leading to optimized performance for resource retrieval.
