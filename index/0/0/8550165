We present a neural network algorithm that simultaneously performs segmentation and recognition of input patterns that self-organizes to detect input pattern locations and pattern boundaries. We demonstrate this neural network architecture on character recognition using the NIST database and report on results herein. The resulting system simultaneously segments and recognizes touching or overlapping characters, broken characters, and noisy images with high accuracy.
