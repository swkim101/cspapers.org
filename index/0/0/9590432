The rapid expansion of computer science (CS) education across the United States has left schools struggling to find teachers for CS classrooms. One approach to supplementing school and teacher expertise is to use industry professionals as volunteers in the classroom. This paper outlines the model of recruiting, training, and supporting volunteers in CS classrooms used by TEALS, a national computer science education program that creates co-teaching partnerships between industry experts and educators. This paper presents detailed information about the volunteers and the training the they receive, as well as the impact and outcomes on the students and cooperating teachers. Results from teacher, student, and volunteer surveys show satisfaction with the volunteers, as well as continued growth in perceived volunteer classroom performance over the year.
