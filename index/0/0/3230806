In recent years, the task of recommending hashtags for microblogs has been given increasing attention. Various methods have been proposed to study the problem from different aspects. However, most of the recent studies have not considered the differences in the types or uses of hashtags. In this paper, we introduce a novel nonparametric Bayesian method for this task. Based on the Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM), we incorporate the type of hashtag as a hidden variable. The results of experiments on the data collected from a real world microblogging service demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms stateof-the-art methods that do not consider these aspects. By taking these aspects into consideration, the relative improvement of the proposed method over the state-of-theart methods is around 12.2% in F1- score.
