A new method is emerging in the field of high-rise building in recent years. That is water supply of non-negative pressure. For the reasons of used quantity of water cannot be predicted and non-equilibrium and other reasons, the water pressure is changed notable, it cannot meet the requirements of users by water pressure. The digital PID control is the common control method in the process of manufacture. It has extensive used in the field of machine, metallurgy, chemical etc. But it has shortage in the aspect of control precision and capability of anti-jamming. It has been discussed in this paper that fuzzy PID control use in the process of water supply and it also contrast with the ordinary PID control.
