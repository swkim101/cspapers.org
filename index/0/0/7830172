We present a new neural network model for processing of temporal patterns. This model, the gamma neural model, is as general as a convolution delay model with arbitrary weight kernels w(t). We show that the gamma model can be formulated as a (partially prewired) additive model. A temporal hebbian learning rule is derived and we establish links to related existing models for temporal processing.
