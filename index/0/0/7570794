These late breaking results present a study extending the implementation of a computational model of graded cueing feedback from our previous work (Greczek et al., 2014). The model was extended to a nutrition education task with two sub-goals. Graded cueing helped 92.3% of participants to reach the correct answer, providing further evidence for the potential of the graded cueing model to promote user autonomy in health behavior tasks.
