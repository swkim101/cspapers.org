Most of today's GUIs are designed for the typical, able-bodied user; atypical users are, for the most part, left to adapt as best they can, perhaps using specialized assistive technologies as an aid. In this paper, we present an alternative approach: SUPPLE++ automatically generates interfaces which are tailored to an individual's motor capabilities and can be easily adjusted to accommodate varying vision capabilities. SUPPLE++ models users. motor capabilities based on a onetime motor performance test and uses this model in an optimization process, generating a personalized interface. A preliminary study indicates that while there is still room for improvement, SUPPLE++ allowed one user to complete tasks that she could not perform using a standard interface, while for the remaining users it resulted in an average time savings of 20%, ranging from an slowdown of 3% to a speedup of 43%.
