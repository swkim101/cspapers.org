The automotive industry is introducing novel features, such as seamless vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity to improve in vehicle driver safety (e.g., forward collision warnings) and comfort (e.g., routing to avoid congestion) while facing stricter government regulations, and shortened time-to-markets. As a result, automotive Electronic Control System (ECS) architectures are becoming increasingly complex. To cope with these challenges and opportunities, the entire automotive supply chain is engaged as follows: automotive OEMs are managing complexity by reusing legacy components and enabling new technologies; tier one suppliers are increasingly up-integrating features on the same computing platform; tier two suppliers are providing multi-core and other powerful technologies; academic institutions are doing research in new analysis, synthesis and optimization methods; and tool providers are trying to raise the level of abstraction for system modeling, analysis and optimization. The panel will address the following topics:
