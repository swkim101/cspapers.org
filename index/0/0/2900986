The characteristics of computational processor requirements of a sample of Algol-60 programs have been measured. Distributions are presented for intervals of processor activity as defined by input-output requests and segment allocation requests occurring within the Johnston contour model and within a stack model in which array allocations are treated separately. The results provide new empirical data concerning the behavior of this class of programs. Some implications of the empirical results which may influence computer system design and performance are presented and discussed.
