Current Chinese event extraction systems suffer much from two problems in trigger identification: unknown triggers and word segmentation errors to known triggers. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes two novel inference mechanisms to explore special characteristics in Chinese via compositional semantics inside Chinese triggers and discourse consistency between Chinese trigger mentions. Evaluation on the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus justifies the effectiveness of our approach over a strong baseline.
