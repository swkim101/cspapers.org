A system for automatic test pattern generation for large logic networks is described. The network to be tested is assumed to comply with a set of ground rules for testability. The system includes features for automatic subdivision of the network into easily tested sub-networks, automatic test generation programs, and a post-processor which produces a highly efficient test program. Applications to fault diagnosis, and to fast processing of design changes and variations for machine features are considered.
