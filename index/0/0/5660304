The distortion cost function used in Moses-style machine translation systems has two flaws. First, it does not estimate the future cost of known required moves, thus increasing search errors. Second, all distortion is penalized linearly, even when appropriate re-orderings are performed. Because the cost function does not effectively constrain search, translation quality decreases at higher distortion limits, which are often needed when translating between languages of different typologies such as Arabic and English. To address these problems, we introduce a method for estimating future linear distortion cost, and a new discriminative distortion model that predicts word movement during translation. In combination, these extensions give a statistically significant improvement over a baseline distortion parameterization. When we triple the distortion limit, our model achieves a +2.32 BLEU average gain over Moses.
