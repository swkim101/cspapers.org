The use of data at different levels of information content is essential to the performance of multimedia, scientific, and other large databases because it can significantly decrease I/O and communication costs. The performance advantages of such a multi-resolution scheme can only be fully exploited by a data model that supports the convenient retrieval of data at different levels of information content. In this paper we extend the relational data model to support multi-resolution data retrieval. In particular, we introduce a new partial set construct, called the sandbag, that can support multi-resolution for the types of data used in a wide variety of next-generation database applications, as well as traditional applications. We extend the relational algebra operators to analogous operators on sandbags. The resulting extension of the relational algebra is sound and forms a foundation for future database management systems that support these types of next-generation applications.
