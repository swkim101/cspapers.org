To address the concern that a complete detection scheme for effective hardware Trojan identification is lacking, we have designed an RTL security metric in order to evaluate the quality of IP cores (with the same or similar functionality) and counter Trojan attacks at the pre-fabrication stages of the IP design flow. The proposed security metric is constructed on top of two criteria, from which a quantitative security value can be assigned to the target circuit: 1) Distribution of controllability; 2) Existence of rare events. The proposed metric, called FIGHT, is an automated tool whereby malicious modifications to ICs and/or the vulnerability of the IP core can be identified, by monitoring both internal node controllability and the corresponding control value distribution plotted as a histogram. Experimentation on an RS232 module was performed to demonstrate our dual security criteria and proved security degradation to the IP module upon hardware Trojan insertion.
