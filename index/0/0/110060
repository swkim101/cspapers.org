Most modern software-defined radios are large, expensive, and power-hungry, and this diminishes their utility in low-power, size-constrained settings like sensor networks and mobile computing. We explore the viability of scaling down the software radio in size, cost, and power, and show that an index card-sized, sub-$150, 'AA' battery-powered system is possible using off-the-shelf components. Key to our approach is that we leverage an integrated, reconfigurable, flash-based FPGA with a hard ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor which simultaneously enables lower power and tighter hardware/software integration than prior designs. This architecture allows us to implement timing-critical MAC protocols and validate the speculated performance of several recent MAC/PHY primitives and protocols including Backcast, A-MAC, and Glossy using an IEEE 802.15.4-compliant radio implementation that interoperates with commercial radios. The work also identifies several enhancements in the underlying hardware components that could improve power, performance, and flexibility.
