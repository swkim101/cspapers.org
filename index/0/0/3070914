Many vision tasks such as scene segmentation, or the recognition of materials within a scene, become considerably easier when it is possible to measure the spectral reflectance of scene surfaces. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust approach for recovering spectral reflectance in a scene that combines the advantages of using multiple spectral sources and a multispectral camera. We have implemented a system based on this approach using a cluster of light sources with different spectra to illuminate the scene and a conventional RGB camera to acquire images. Rather than sequentially activating the sources, we have developed a novel technique to determine the optimal multiplexing sequence of spectral sources so as to minimize the number of acquired images. We use our recovered spectral measurements to recover the continuous spectral reflectance for each scene point by using a linear model for spectral reflectance. Our imaging system can produce multispectral videos of scenes at 30fps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through extensive evaluation. As a demonstration, we present the results of applying data recovered by our system to material segmentation and spectral relighting.
