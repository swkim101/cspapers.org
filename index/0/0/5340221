The use of large-scale data mining and machine learning has proliferated through the adoption of technologies such as Hadoop, with its simple programming semantics and rich and active ecosystem. This paper presents LinkedIn's Hadoop-based analytics stack, which allows data scientists and machine learning researchers to extract insights and build product features from massive amounts of data. In particular, we present our solutions to the ``last mile'' issues in providing a rich developer ecosystem. This includes easy ingress from and egress to online systems, and managing workflows as production processes. A key characteristic of our solution is that these distributed system concerns are completely abstracted away from researchers. For example, deploying data back into the online system is simply a 1-line Pig command that a data scientist can add to the end of their script. We also present case studies on how this ecosystem is used to solve problems ranging from recommendations to news feed updates to email digesting to descriptive analytical dashboards for our members.
