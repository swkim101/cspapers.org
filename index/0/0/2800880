We suggest improvements to a previously proposed framework for integrating Conditional Random Fields and Hidden Markov Models, dubbed a Crandem system (2009). The previous authors' work suggested that local label posteriors derived from the CRF were too low-entropy for use in word-level automatic speech recognition. As an alternative to the log posterior representation used in their system, we explore frame-level representations derived from the CRF feature functions. We also describe a weight normalization transformation that leads to increased entropy of the CRF posteriors. We report significant gains over the previous Crandem system on the Wall Street Journal word recognition task.
