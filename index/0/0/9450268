Work in distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) has, since its earliest years, been concerned with negotiation strategies. which can be used in building agents that are able to communicate to reach mutually beneficial agreements. In this paper we suggest a strategic model of negotiation that takes the passage of time during the negotiation process itself into consideration. Changes in the agent's preferences over time will change their strategies in the negotiation and, as a resuit the agreements they are willing to reach. We will show that in this model the delay in reaching agreements can be avoided.
