Faced with the challenge of teaching large numbers of students without sacrificing quality, we have developed a complete “package” for teaching introductory computer science. This package consists of textbooks, notes, problem sets, lab-tutorial arrangements, instructional software, and visual aids for lectures, all developed at the University of Waterloo.
 The textbooks are “FORTRAN IV WITH WATFOR AND WATFIV” and “AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SPECTRE COMPUTER”. The first text provides a thorough introduction to FORTRAN programming, whereas the second describes a hypothetical computer used for teaching purposes to introduce concepts in assembly language programming and machine organization. Notes supplement the texts by covering elementary ideas from boolean algebra, switching and automata theory, and hardware design. Consequently, we endeavour in this course to introduce students to various aspects of computer science, not just programming.
