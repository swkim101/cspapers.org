Lung cancer is the most deadly form of cancer, and survival depends on early-stage diagnosis and treatment. Transoral access is preferable to traditional between-the-ribs needle insertion because it is less invasive and reduces risk of lung collapse. Yet many sites in the peripheral zones of the lung or distant from the bronchi cannot currently be accessed transorally, due to the relatively large diameter and lack of sufficient steerablity of current instrumentation. To remedy this, we propose a new robotic system that uses a tendon-actuated device (bronchoscope) as a first stage for deploying a concentric tube robot, which itself is a vehicle through which a bevel steered needle can be introduced into the soft tissue of the lung outside the bronchi. In this paper we present the various components of the system and the workflow we envision for deploying the robot to a target using image guidance. We describe initial validation experiments in which we puncture ex vivo bronchial wall tissue and also target a nodule in a phantom with an average final tip error of 0.72 mm.
