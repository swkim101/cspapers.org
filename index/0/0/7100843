LEAP is a facility for testing interactive applications that are implemented on IBM System/360 and System/370 computers; it simulates concurrently the actions of several IBM 3270-type terminals and of their operators. LEAP allows one to organize, in a systematic and efficient fashion, a large-scale, repeatable testing program for such an interactive application system. LEAP is one of the tools of the Programmer's Work-bench. It operates under the UNIX Time Sharing System; all test preparation, testing, and test analysis is performed at a UNIX terminal. LEAP can be used for both regression (functional) testing and load (stress and performance) testing. Several post-test analysis tools are provided.
