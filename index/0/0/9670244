We present a novel machine translation framework based on kernel regression techniques. In our model, the translation task is viewed as a string-to-string mapping, for which a regression type learning is employed with both the source and the target sentences embedded into their kernel induced feature spaces. We report the experiments on a French-English translation task showing encouraging results.
