The race to find the weakest possible assumptions on which to base cryptographic primitives such aa oblivious transfer was abruptly baited by Impagliazzo’s and Rudich’s surprising result: basing oblivious transfer or other related problems on a black-box one-way permutation (as opposed to a one-way trapdoor permutation ) is tantamount to showing P#NP. In contrast, we show how to generate OT – in the sense of random number generation – using any one-way function in a black-box manner. That is, an initial “seed” of k OT’S suffices to generate O(kc) OT’S. In turn, we show that such generation is impossible in an information-theoretic setting, thus placing OT on an equal footing with random number generation, and resolving an artificial asymmetry in the analysis of randomness and partiallycorrelated randomness.
