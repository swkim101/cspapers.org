A method of monitoring objects in an interactive object-Â­ oriented database system. Any of a plurality of client programs can request monitoring of attributes of objects in the database. A record is kept of update transactions initiated by a client. When the client commits the changes, any client which has requested monitoring is notified of any change in the value of an attribute being monitored at the request of that client. The notification interrupts the client and invokes a predesignated client procedure. Overhead is minimized by creating partial view materialization paths and defining monitors ahead of time and by localizing the monitoring.
