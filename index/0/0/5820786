In this paper, we propose an approach for efficient approximative RkNN search in arbitrary metric spaces where the value of k is specified at query time. Our method uses an approximation of the nearest-neighbor-distances in order to prune the search space. In several experiments, our solution scales significantly better than existing non-approximative approaches while producing an approximation of the true query result with a high recall.
