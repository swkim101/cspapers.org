This paper introduces a new technique for testing that a distributed real-time system satisfies a formal timed automata specification. It outlines how to write test specifications in the language of Uppaal timed automata, how to translate those specifications into program code for executing the tests, and describes the results of test experiments on a distributed real-time system with limited hardware and software resources.
