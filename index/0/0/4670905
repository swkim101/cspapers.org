This work introduces a novel Convolutional Network architecture (ConvNet) for the task of human pose estimation, that is the localization of body joints in a single static image. We propose a coarse to fine architecture that addresses shortcomings of the baseline architecture in [26] that stem from the fact that large inaccuracies of its coarse ConvNet cannot be corrected by the refinement ConvNet that refines the estimation within small windows of the coarse prediction. We overcome this by introducing a Markov Random Field (MRF)-based spatial model network between the coarse and the refinement model that introduces geometric constraints on the relative locations of the body joints. We propose an architecture in which a) the filters that implement the message passing in the MRF inference are factored in a way that constrains them by a low dimensional pose manifold the projection to which is estimated by a separate branch of the proposed ConvNet and b) the strengths of the pairwise joint constraints are modeled by weights that are jointly estimated by the other parameters of the network. The proposed network is trained in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the baseline model and provides state of the art results on very challenging benchmarks.
