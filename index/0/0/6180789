Emerging resistive-crossbar memory (RCM) technology can be promising for computationally-expensive analog pattern-matching tasks. However, the use of CMOS analog-circuits with RCM would result in large power-consumption and poor scalability, thereby eschewing the benefits of RCM-based computation. We propose the use of low-voltage, fast-switching, magneto-metallic `spin-neurons' for ultra low-power non-Boolean computing with RCM. We present the design of analog associative memory for face recognition using RCM, where, substituting conventional analog circuits with spin-neurons can achieve ~100× lower power. This makes the proposed design ~1000× more energy-efficient than a 45nm-CMOS digital ASIC, thereby significantly enhancing the prospects of RCM based computational hardware.
