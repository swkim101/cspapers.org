We describe an algorithm for converting linear support vector machines and any other arbitrary hyperplane-based linear classifiers into a set of non-overlapping rules that, unlike the original classifier, can be easily interpreted by humans. Each iteration of the rule extraction algorithm is formulated as a constrained optimization problem that is computationally inexpensive to solve. We discuss various properties of the algorithm and provide proof of convergence for two different optimization criteria We demonstrate the performance and the speed of the algorithm on linear classifiers learned from real-world datasets, including a medical dataset on detection of lung cancer from medical images. The ability to convert SVM's and other "black-box" classifiers into a set of human-understandable rules, is critical not only for physician acceptance, but also to reducing the regulatory barrier for medical-decision support systems based on such classifiers.
