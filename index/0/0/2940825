In this paper, we introduce a novel mechanism that identifies abnormal system-wide behaviors using the predictable nature of real-time embedded applications. We introduce Memory Heat Map (MHM) to characterize the memory behavior of the operating system. Our machine learning algorithms automatically (a) summarize the information contained in the MHMs and then (b) detect deviations from the normal memory behavior patterns. These methods are implemented on top of a multicore processor architecture to aid in the process of monitoring and detection. The techniques are evaluated using multiple attack scenarios including kernel rootkits and shellcode. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses aggregated memory behavior for detecting system anomalies especially the concept of memory heat maps.
