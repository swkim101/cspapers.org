An improved ZMP (Zero Moment Point) trajectory for a biped robot is designed in this paper, which imitates a human's actual ZMP trajectory in the walking process. A new method of walking pattern generation based on forward moving ZMP in SSP (Single Support Phase) is also provided. It can keep the ZMP moving forward instead of staying in the center of supporting region during SSP, which is helpful for increasing the walking speed. We have been developing BHR, which has 38 DOFs (degree of freedom). The effectiveness of the method is conducted by simulation and walking experiment on BHR.
