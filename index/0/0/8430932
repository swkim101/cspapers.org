Aesthetic evaluation of Chinese calligraphy is one of the most challenging tasks in Artificial Intelligence. This paper attempts to solve this problem by proposing a number of aesthetic feature representations and feeding them into Artificial Neural Networks. Specifically, 22 global shape features are presented to describe a given handwritten Chinese character from different aspects according to classical calligraphic rules, and a new 10-dimensional feature vector is introduced to represent the component layout information using sparse coding. Moreover, a Chinese Handwriting Aesthetic Evaluation Database (CHAED) is also built by collecting 1000 Chinese handwriting images with diverse aesthetic qualities and inviting 33 subjects to evaluate the aesthetic quality for each calligraphic image. Finally, back propagation neural networks are constructed with the concatenation of the proposed features as input and then trained on our CHAED database for the aesthetic evaluation of Chinese calligraphy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AI system provides a comparable performance with human evaluation. Through our experiments, we also compare the importance of each individual feature and reveal the relationship between our aesthetic features and the aesthetic perceptions of human beings.
