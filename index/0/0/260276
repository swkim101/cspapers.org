This paper addresses modeling issues for a class of nano-robotic systems using piezoelectric stick-slip actuators. The work focuses on the friction force modeling to describe the dynamics of a stick-slip actuator in a wide operating range needed in nano-robotics. Based on the theory of the single state elasto-plastic model and on an experimental analysis, necessary conditions on presiding modeling are highlighted. The conditions allow describing the dynamics of stick-slip type actuators for both scanning mode and stepping mode in the time and the frequency domains and for backward and forward directions of the motion. The proposed dynamic model opens new perspective for closed loop control of nano-robotic system.
