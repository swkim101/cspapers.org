In this paper we propose a novel recrawling method based on navigation patterns called Selective Recrawling. The goal of selective recrawling is to automatically select page collections that have large coverage and little redundancy to a pre-defined vertical domain. It only requires several seed objects and can select a set of URL patterns to cover most objects. The selected set can be used to recrawl the web pages for quite a period of time and renewed periodically. Experiments on local event data show that our method can greatly reduce the downloading of web pages while keep the comparative object coverage.
