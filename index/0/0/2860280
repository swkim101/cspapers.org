We consider the problem of finding a minimum edge cost subgraph of an undirected or a directed graph satisfying given connectivity requirements and degree bounds b(路) on nodes. We present an iterative rounding algorithm for this problem. When the graph is undirected and the connectivity requirements are on the element-connectivity with maximum value k, our algorithm computes a solution that is an O(k)-approximation for the edge cost in which the degree of each node v is at most O(k) 路 b(v). We also consider the no edge cost case where the objective is to find a subgraph satisfying connectivity requirements and degree bounds. Our algorithm for this case outputs a solution in which the degree of each node v is at most 6路b(v)+O(k2). These algorithms can be extended to other well-studied undirected node-connectivity requirements such as uniform, subset and rooted connectivity. When the graph is directed and the connectivity requirement is k-out-connectivity from a root, our algorithm computes a solution that is a 2-approximation for the edge cost in which the degree of each node v is at most 2 路 b(v) + O(k).
