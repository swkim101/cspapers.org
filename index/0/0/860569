Due to the increasing availability and use of digital video data on the Web, video caching will be an important performance factor in the future WWW. We propose an architecture of a video proxy cache that integrates modern multimedia and communication standards. Especially we describe features of the MPEG-4 and MPEG-7 multimedia standards that can be helpful for a video proxy cache. QBIX supports real-time adaptation in the compressed and in the decompressed domain. It uses adaptation to improve the cache replacement strategies in the proxy, but also to realize media gateway functionality driven by the clients' terminal capabilities.
