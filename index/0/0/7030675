In this paper we describe a software system built to coordinate an autonomous vehicle with variable configuration ability operating in rough terrain conditions. The paper describes the system architecture, with an emphasis on the action planning function. This is intended to work with a proprioceptive algorithm that continuously coordinates wheel torques and suspension forces and positions to achieve optimal terrain crossing performance.
