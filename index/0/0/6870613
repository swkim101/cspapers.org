We derive here new generalization bounds, based on Rademacher Complexity theory, for model selection and error estimation of linear (kernel) classifiers, which exploit the availability of unlabeled samples. In particular, two results are obtained: the first one shows that, using the unlabeled samples, the confidence term of the conventional bound can be reduced by a factor of three; the second one shows that the unlabeled samples can be used to obtain much tighter bounds, by building localized versions of the hypothesis class containing the optimal classifier.
