This panel discussion springs from a three-day workshop on the software process and software environments that was held in March 1985. Our intention is to convey some of what was discussed at that workshop and to precipitate discussion of some of the issues that arose during the workshop deliberations. In this paper we briefly summarize the workshop, then list some of the issues that might become foci of the panel discussion.
