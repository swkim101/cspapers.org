60 GHz technology holds tremendous potential to upgrade wireless link throughput to Gbps level. To overcome inherent vulnerability to attenuation, 60 GHz radios communicate by forming highly-directional electronically-steerable beams. Standards like IEEE 802.11ad have tailored MAC/PHY protocols to such flexible-beam 60 GHz networks. However, lack of a reconfigurable platform has thwarted a realistic proof-of-concept evaluation. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth measurement of indoor 60 GHz networks using a first-of-its-kind software-radio platform. Our measurement focuses on the link-level behavior with three major perspectives: (i) coverage and bit-rate of a single link, and implications for 60 GHz MIMO; (ii) impact of beam-steering on network performance, particularly under human blockage and device mobility; (iii) spatial reuse between flexible beams. Our study dispels some common myths, and reveals key challenges in maintaining robust flexible-beam connection. We propose new principles that can tackle such challenges based on unique properties of 60 GHz channel and cognitive capability of 60 GHz links.
