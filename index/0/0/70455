In this paper we present protocols for distributed certified e-mail, which use encryption to ensure both confidentiality and fairness. As with other protocols for certified e-mail, ours achieve fairness by placing trust on an external entity, referred to as the Trusted Third Party (TTP). The TTP can become a bottleneck, however, and we explore scenarios that support a distributed TTP, in the context of both off-line and online protocols. With several servers dividing the TTP responsibilities, the level of confidence placed in individual servers can be reduced without compromising the TTPâ€™s overall trust.
