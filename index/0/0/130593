Encoding and decoding are common practice in data processing. Designing encoder and decoder circuitry manually can be error prone and time consuming. Although great progress has been made on automating decoder synthesis from its encoder specification, prior specification was limited to an uninitialized encoder only, whose decoder in turn cannot depend on the entire execution history of the encoder. Prior decoder existence condition is unnecessarily stringent as encoders are often initialized to some specific starting states. This paper shows how decoders of initialized encoders can be practically synthesized. Experimental results demonstrate effective decoder synthesis of initialized encoders, beyond existing methods' capabilities.
