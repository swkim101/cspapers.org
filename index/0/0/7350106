Computational Thinking Through Mobile Computing is an NSF-funded project for introducing students to computational thinking through creating mobile apps. In this hands-on workshop, which is targeted at undergraduate and secondary school computer science teachers, participants will develop Android apps using MIT App Inventor 2. This is a new version of the visual blocks-based programming environment with additional language features (e.g., local variables) and browser-based blocks editing. The workshop will also present pedagogical materials (lessons, tutorials, assignments), evaluation materials (blocks-based quizzes, surveys, project rubrics), and student projects. All of the pedagogical materials presented in the workshop, as well as all of the materials used by the workshop presenters in their individual courses, are posted on the Web and are available to everyone under a Creative Commons license. A laptop is required for this workshop. Each participant will be provided with an Android mobile device to use during the workshop. Participants who have their own Android phones or tablets can use them if they choose. This workshop is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Numbers 1225680, 1225719, 1225745, 1225976, and 1226216.
