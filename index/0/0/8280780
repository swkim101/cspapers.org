Summary form only given. System level design is nowadays a complex process due to heterogeneity of domains of components in a single system. The language standard, Rosetta, was proposed as a means to help in such designs. An important feature in Rosetta is known as domain interaction and involves the analysis of interaction between models from domain to domain. The resulting iteration models can then be used to ensure correctness of the system at the design level. The goal of my doctoral dissertation is therefore to implement the semantics of domain interactions in Rosetta and to apply it in the specification of real world examples.
