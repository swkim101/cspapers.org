Within the broader scope of underwater biomimetics, in this paper we address the relevance of factors such as shape and elasticity distribution in the ability of a compliant device to imitate the kinematic behaviour of a fish. We assess the viability of myometry as a tool to determine candidate mechanical parameters without relying solely on analytical models; we show that we can obtain elasticity distributions that are both consistent with previous theoretical investigations and experimentally better adherent to the passive kinematics of a biological embodiment (rainbow trout).
