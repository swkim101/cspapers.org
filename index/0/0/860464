We exhibit an n-node graph whose independent set polytope requires extended formulations of size exponential in Ω(n/log n). Previously, no explicit examples of n-dimensional 0/1-polytopes were known with extension complexity larger than exponential in Θ(√n). Our construction is inspired by a relatively little-known connection between extended formulations and (monotone) circuit depth.
