NAND flash-based storage is widely used in embedded systems due to its numerous benefits: low cost, high density, small form factor and so on. However, NAND flash-based storage is still suffering from serious performance degradation for random or small size write access. This degradation mainly comes from the physical constraints of NAND flash: erase-before-program and different unit size of erase and program operations. To overcome these constraints, we propose to use PRAM (Phase-change RAM) which supports advanced features: fast byte access capability and no requirement for erase-before-program.
 In this paper, we focus on developing a high-performance NAND flash-based storage system by maximally exploiting the advanced feature of PRAM, in terms of performance and wearing out. To do this, we first propose a new hybrid storage architecture which consists of PRAM and NAND flash. Second, we devise two novel software schemes for the proposed hybrid storage architecture; FSMS (File System Metadata Separation) and hFTL (hybrid Flash Translation Layer). Finally, we demonstrate that our hybrid architecture increases the performance up to 290% and doubles the lifespan compared to the existing NAND flash only storage systems.
