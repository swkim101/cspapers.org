Moving object databases are required to support queries on a large number of continuously moving objects. A key requirement for indexing methods in this domain is to efficiently support both update and query operations. Previous work on indexing such databases can be broadly divided into categories: indexing the past positions and indexing the future predicted positions. In this paper we focus on an efficient indexing method for indexing the future positions of moving objects.In this paper we propose an indexing method, called STRIPES, which indexes predicted trajectories in a dual transformed space. Trajectories for objects in d-dimensional space become points in a higher-dimensional 2d-space. This dual transformed space is then indexed using a regular hierarchical grid decomposition indexing structure. STRIPES can evaluate a range of queries including time-slice, window, and moving queries. We have carried out extensive experimental evaluation comparing the performance of STRIPES with the best known existing predicted trajectory index (the TPR*-tree), and show that our approach is significantly faster than TPR*-tree for both updates and search queries.
