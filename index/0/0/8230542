Self-adaptivity allows software systems to autonomously adjust their behavior during run-time to reduce the cost complexities caused by manual maintenance. In this paper, an approach for building an external adaptation engine for self-adaptive software systems is proposed. In order to improve the quality of selfadaptive software systems, this research addresses two challenges in self-adaptive software systems. The first challenge is managing the complexity of the adaptation space efficiently and the second is handling the run-time uncertainty that hinders the adaptation process. This research utilizes Case-based Reasoning as an adaptation engine along with utility functions for realizing the managed systemâ€™s requirements and handling uncertainty.
