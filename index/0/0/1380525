This paper presents design aspects of a forcereflecting, motion-scaling teleoperation system for use in microsurgery experiments. A coarse-macro-micro approach is proposed. T w o magnetically levitated wrists a macro-master and a micro-slave would share a common base positioned at the surgical site by a coarse-motion transport robot. The discussion includes features of the proposed system, a detailed slave wrist description, and aspects of coordination and control for the multi-stage teleoperation.
