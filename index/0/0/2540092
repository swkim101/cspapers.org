The development of the IBM 3081 established the methodology for designinc and manufacturing a high-performance computer from an LSI chip technology. The high density packaging of the LSI chip is used to minimize interconnections and to support a fast machine cycle time. This paper will describe the methods used and will highlight some of the design problems that were solved, to offer an understanding of the challenges that LSI brings to the design cycle.
