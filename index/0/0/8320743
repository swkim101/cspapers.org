This paper presents an intermediate meta-model that consists of a set of generic meta-classes that capture and describe the semantics of a variety of data models. A model is described by a set of intermediate model meta-classes (organized in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to achieve extensibility y), while irtst antes of these meta-classes are used to describe a schema in a given data model. The proposed approach supports dynamic meta-schema comparison and transformation by employing special-purpose transformation rules.
