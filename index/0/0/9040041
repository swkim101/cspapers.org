DevOps approaches software engineering by advocating the removal of borders between development and operations. DevOps emphasizes operational resilience, continuous feedback from operations back to development, and rapid deployment of features developed. In this talk we will look at selected (automation) aspects related to DevOps, based on our collaborations with various industrial partners. For example, we will explore (automated) methods for analyzing log data to support deployments and monitor REST API integrations, (search-based) test input generation for reproducing crashes and testing complex database queries, and zero downtime database schema evolution and deployment. We will close by looking at borders beyond those between development and operations, in order to see whether there are other borders we need to remove in order to strengthen the impact of software engineering research.
