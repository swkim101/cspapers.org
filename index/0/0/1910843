We use the term "Grid" to refer to a software system that provides uniform and location independent access to geographically and organizationally dispersed, heterogeneous resources that are persistent and supported. While, in general, Grids will provide the infrastructure to support a wide range of services in the scientific environment (e.g. collaboration and remote instrument control) in this paper we focus on services for high performance computing and data handling. We describe the services and architecture of NASAâ€™s Information Power Grid ("IPG") - an early example of a large-scale Grid - and some of the issues that have come up in its implementation.
