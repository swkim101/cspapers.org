We present a new machine learning method that, given a set of training examples, induces a definition of the target concept in terms of a hierarchy of intermediate concepts and their definitions. This effectively decomposes the problem into smaller, less complex problems. The method is inspired by the Boolean function decomposition approach to the design of digital circuits. To cope with high time complexity of finding an optimal decomposition, we propose a suboptimal heuristic algorithm. The method, implemented in program HINT (HIerarchy Induction Tool), is experimentally evaluated using a set of artificial and real-world learning problems. It is shown that the method performs well both in terms of classification accuracy and discovery of meaningful concept hierarchies.
