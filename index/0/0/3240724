Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) is one of the key causes of reliability degradations of nano-CMOS circuits. While the long-term impact of BTI has been studied since years, the short-term implications of BTI on circuits are unexplored. In fact, in physics short-term BTI effects, i.e. instantaneous (i.e. sub Î¼s) frequency dependent processes, have been recently reported. In order to design circuits with guardbands that are safe for long-term and instantaneous effects, new aging models are required. We are presenting the first approach that in fact considers both long-term as well as instantaneous BTI effects. It can be employed for complex circuits at the micro-architecture level. Designing guardbands based upon our physical BTI model reduces the guardbands by 41% and thus allows for the development of more cost-effective yet reliable designs. We also revisit existing state-of-the-art aging mitigation techniques to investigate how they can be properly adapted to additionally account for instantaneous aging effects. Along with our BTI model this further reduces the guardbands by up to 59%.
