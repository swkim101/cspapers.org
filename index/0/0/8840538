Complicated approaches to fault-tolerant voltage-scalable (FTVS) SRAM cache architectures can suffer from high overheads. We propose static (SPCS) and dynamic (DPCS) variants of power/capacity scaling, a simple and low-overhead fault-tolerant cache architecture that utilizes insights gained from our 45nm SOI test chip. Our mechanism combines multi-level voltage scaling with power gating of blocks that become faulty at each voltage level. The SPCS policy sets the runtime cache VDD statically such that almost all of the cache blocks are not faulty. The DPCS policy opportunistically reduces the voltage further to save more power than SPCS while limiting the impact on performance caused by additional faulty blocks. Through an analytical evaluation, we show that our approach can achieve lower static power for all effective cache capacities than a recent complex FTVS work. This is due to significantly lower overheads, despite the failure of our approach to match the min-VDD of the competing work at fixed yield. Through architectural simulations, we find that the average energy saved by SPCS is 55%, while DPCS saves an average of 69% of energy with respect to baseline caches at 1 V. Our approach incurs no more than 4% performance and 5% area penalties in the worst case cache configuration.
