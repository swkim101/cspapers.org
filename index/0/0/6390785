Wiki content templating enables reuse of content structures among wiki pages. In this paper we present a thorough study of this widespread feature, showing how its two state of the art models (functional and creational templating) are sub-optimal. We then propose a third, better, model called lightly constrained (LC) templating and show its implementation in the Moin wiki engine. We also show how LC templating implementations are the appropriate technologies to push forward semantically rich web pages on the lines of (lowercase) semantic web and microformats.
