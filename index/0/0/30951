Estimating the amount and center of distortion from lines in the scene has been addressed in the literature by the so-called ``plumb-line'' approach. In this paper we propose a new geometric method to estimate not only the distortion parameters but the entire camera calibration (up to an ``angular'' scale factor) using a minimum of 3 lines. We propose a new framework for the unsupervised simultaneous detection of natural image of lines and camera parameters estimation, enabling a robust calibration from a single image. Comparative experiments with existing automatic approaches for the distortion estimation and with ground truth data are presented.
