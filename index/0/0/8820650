Commercially successful autonomous mobile robot systems demand the development of new methodologies for dealing with "real world" requirements of very low cost and very high performance sensing technology for use in the constantly changing, dynamic, unstructured environments in which society expects such robots to operate unsupervised on a daily basis. This paper presents a new modular sensor system which, based on long term real world field trials appear to meet the basic requirements. Examples of test results in a wide variety of applications in unstructured environments are provided as well as future directions.<<ETX>>
