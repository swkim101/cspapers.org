We propose a scalable Internet system for continuous collection of crowd-sourced video from devices such as Google Glass. Our hybrid cloud architecture, GigaSight, is effectively a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in reverse. It achieves scalability by decentralizing the collection infrastructure using cloudlets based on virtual machines~(VMs). Based on time, location, and content, privacy sensitive information is automatically removed from the video. This process, which we refer to as denaturing, is executed in a user-specific VM on the cloudlet. Users can perform content-based searches on the total catalog of denatured videos. Our experiments reveal the bottlenecks for video upload, denaturing, indexing, and content-based search. They also provide insight on how parameters such as frame rate and resolution impact scalability.
