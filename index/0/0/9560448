In aging societies, there is a strong demand for robotics to tackle problems resulting from the aging population. Patient transfer, such as lifting and moving a bedridden patient from a bed to a wheelchair and back, is one of the most physically challenging tasks in nursing care. We have developed a prototype nursing-care assistant robot, RIBA, that can conduct patient transfer using human-type arms. The basic robot motion trajectories are created by interpolating several postures designated in advance. To accomplish more flexible and suitable motion, adjustment using sensor information is necessary, because the patient's posture and positions in contact with the robot may differ slightly in each trial. In this paper, we propose a motion adjustment method in patient lifting using tactile sensors mounted on the robot arms. The results of experiments using a lifesize dummy are also presented.
