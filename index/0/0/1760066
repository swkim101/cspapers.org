Niche Search Engines offer an efficient alternative to traditional search engines when the results returned by general-purpose search engines do not provide a sufficient degree of relevance. By taking advantage of their domain of concentration they achieve higher relevance and offer enhanced features. We discuss a new niche search engine, eBizSearch, based on the technology of CiteSeer and dedicated to e-business and e-business documents. We present the integration of CiteSeer in the framework of eBizSearch and the process necessary to tune the whole system towards the specific area of e-business. We also discuss how using machine learning algorithms we generate metadata to make eBizSearch Open Archives compliant. eBizSearch is a publicly available service and can be reached at [3].
