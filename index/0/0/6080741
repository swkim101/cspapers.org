Images captured in foggy weather conditions often suffer from bad visibility. In this paper, we propose an efficient regularization method to remove hazes from a single input image. Our method benefits much from an exploration on the inherent boundary constraint on the transmission function. This constraint, combined with a weighted L1-norm based contextual regularization, is modeled into an optimization problem to estimate the unknown scene transmission. A quite efficient algorithm based on variable splitting is also presented to solve the problem. The proposed method requires only a few general assumptions and can restore a high-quality haze-free image with faithful colors and fine image details. Experimental results on a variety of haze images demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
