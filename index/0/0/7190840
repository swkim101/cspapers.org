In an argumentation setting, a semantics evaluates the overall acceptability of arguments. Consequently, it reveals the global loss incurred by each argument due to attacks. However, it does not say anything on the contribution of each attack to that loss. This paper introduces the novel concept of contribution measure for evaluating those contributions. It starts by deﬁning a set of axioms that a reasonable measure would satisfy, then shows that the Shapley value is the unique measure that satisﬁes them. Finally, it investigates the properties of the latter under some existing semantics.
