The motivation for this effort includes the immense scale of the task of generating new curriculum recommendations and the difficulty of describing evolving innovative computing programs for purposes of comparison or possible accreditation. The project committee has surveyed lists of computing topics from sources including, but not limited to, the current curriculum recommendations of the ACM, IEEE-CS and AIS. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] The list also includes topics extracted from the current ACM Computing Classification Scheme. [6] Other topic lists are incorporated as they are discovered. The result is a comprehensive list of computing topics covering all of computer engineering, computer science, information systems, information technology, and software engineering. The committee consists of active educators from each of these areas.
