Stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) is a new transport layer protocol, proposed by IETF in RFC 4960. In this paper we have done a simulation-based comparison of important quality of service parameter delay and the impact of packet loss on the throughput using SCTP and TCP Sack as a transport protocol in network simulator (ns-2) in wired network. Our result shows that SCTP and TCP Sack show similar behavior in term of delay in single flow and competing traffic while SCTP achieves higher throughput than TCP when different loss probability is induced in the network.
