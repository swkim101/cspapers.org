STROBE is a system that provides object-oriented programming support tools for INTERLISP. It offers a primitive foundation with which more complex structured object representation schemes can be constructed. STROBE implements multiple resident knowledge bases, tangled generalization hierarchies, flexible inheritance of properties, procedural attachment, and event-sensitive procedure invocation.
