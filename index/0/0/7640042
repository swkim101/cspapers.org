We discuss disciplinary barriers which have traditionally prevented robotics from significantly impacting the built (architectural) environment we inhabit. Specifically, we describe the implementation of, and lessons learned from, a multidisciplinary graduate-level course in Architectural Robotics. The results from class interactions and projects provide insight into novel ways in which robotics expertise can be effectively leveraged in architecture. Conversely, our outcomes suggest ways in which the knowledge and perspective of architects could stimulate significant innovations in robotics.
