In order to detect the presence and location of immunoglobulin (Ig) domains from amino acid sequences we built a system based on a neural network with one hidden layer trained with back propagation. The program was designed to efficiently identify proteins exhibiting such domains, characterized by a few localized conserved regions and a low overall homology. When the National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF) NEW protein sequence database was scanned to evaluate the program's performance, we obtained very low rates of false negatives coupled with a moderate rate of false positives.
