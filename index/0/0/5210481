We introduce two abstraction mechanisms for streamlining the process of semantic interpretation. Configurational descriptions of dependency graphs increase the linguistic generality of interpretation schemata, while interfacing them to lexical and conceptual inheritance hierarchies reduces the amount and complexity of semantic specifications.
