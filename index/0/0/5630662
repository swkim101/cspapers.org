We present in this paper SEMILAR, the SEMantic simILARity toolkit. SEMILAR implements a number of algorithms for assessing the semantic similarity between two texts. It is available as a Java library and as a Java standalone ap-plication offering GUI-based access to the implemented semantic similarity methods. Furthermore, it offers facilities for manual se-mantic similarity annotation by experts through its component SEMILAT (a SEMantic simILarity Annotation Tool).
