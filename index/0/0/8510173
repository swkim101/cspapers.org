We present the first large-scale analysis of Web performance bottlenecks as measured from broadband access networks, using data collected from extensive home router deployments. We analyze the limits of throughput on improving Web performance and identify the contribution of critical factors such as DNS lookups and TCP connection establishment to Web page load times. We find that, as broadband speeds continue to increase, other factors such as TCP connection setup time, server response time, and network latency are often dominant performance bottlenecks. Thus, realizing a "faster Web" requires not only higher download throughput, but also optimizations to reduce both client and server-side latency.
