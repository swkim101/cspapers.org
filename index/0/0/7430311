We focus on algorithmic problems related to deriving gene locations on DNA sequences of closely related species by using comparative mapping data. Conventional genetic mapping generates intervals on the DNA sequence of given species for potential gene positions. The simultaneous analysis of gene intervals in related species, e.g., human and mouse, may eliminate some of the ambiguities and lead to better estimates of gene locations. We address the problem of eliminating the ambiguities in gene orders by means of minimizing the number of conserved regions among the species. This is equivalent to the problem of choosing gene coordi-
