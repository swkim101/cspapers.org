We consider the following <i>k</i>-sparse recovery problem: design an <i>m</i> x <i>n</i> matrix <i>A</i>, such that for any signal <i>x</i>, given <i>Ax</i> we can efficiently recover x satisfying ||<i>x</i> -- x||<sub>i</sub> â‰¤ <i>C</i> min<sub><i>k</i></sub>-sparse <i>x</i>' ||<i>x</i> - <i>x</i>'||<sub>1</sub>. It is known that there exist matrices A with this property that have only <i>O</i>(<i>k</i> log(<i>n/k</i>)) rows.
 In this paper we show that this bound is tight. Our bound holds even for the more general <i>randomized</i> version of the problem, where <i>A</i> is a random variable, and the recovery algorithm is required to work for any fixed x with constant probability (over <i>A</i>).
