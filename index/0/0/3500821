In 2015, it became apparent that the traditional lecture/lab courses were not working for the Computer Science/Software Engineering students at our community college. The students wanted more out of the class, and the lecture model was, frankly, boring for all of us. This began a four-year long project to convert the three major programming courses from standard lecture to a variation on project based learning. In each course, the project would be slowly introduced and appropriately scaffolded, with each new skill tied to the text and lectures. At the end of the term, students presented their work, as a written and oral report, to faculty and staff they did not know. While this project started out as a grand experiment, students were overwhelmingly positive about not only the project, but how much they learned that wasn/t in the text or lectures, and just as important, how much they learned about themselves. The growth in student confidence was clear. The poster will display information about two current projects, typical student artifacts, and an assortment of student comments from their final presentations. We will also discuss how the project idea was scaffolded to balance formal and informal student learning in the classroom.
