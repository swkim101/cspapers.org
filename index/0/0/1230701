The ballbot is a dynamically stable mobile robot that moves on a single spherical wheel and is capable of omnidirectional movement. The ballbot is an underactuated system with nonholonomic dynamic constraints. The authors propose an offline trajectory planning algorithm that provides a class of parametric trajectories to the unactuated joint in order to reach desired static configurations of the system with regard to the dynamic constraint. The parameters of the trajectories are obtained using optimization techniques. A feedback controller is proposed that ensures accurate trajectory tracking. The trajectory planning algorithm and tracking controller are validated experimentally. The authors also extend the offline trajectory planning algorithm to a generalized case of motion between non-static configurations.
