The problem of designing global applications in a Distributed Database is considered, and a multilevel model is developed in order to evaluate different access strategies. File manipulation operations are considered with respect to their possibility of distributed execution and their transmission requirements are defined. The need of an analysis of data is shown in order to quantitatively evaluate costs and delays of transmission operations.
