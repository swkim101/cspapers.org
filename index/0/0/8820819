Thi3 paper describes a man-computer-maninula-tor system for doing a variety of exploration and assembly tasks for space, undersea, hazardous ter-restial environments, warehousing and medical applications. Emphasis is placed upon the alloca­ tion of functions to man and machine and the nature of their on-line interaction. The human operator through a combination of analogic com­ mands (hand movements to specify direction, magni­ tude, time relative to his view of the task) and symbolic commands (typewritten alphanumeric char­ acters) , sets subgoals, subroutines, and stopping conditions in terms of the manipulator's position and touch sensors. The computer interprets the human commands, reads data from the manipulator's own sensors, performs geometric transformations and executes optimal or heuristic procedures to drive the manipulator actuators. Laboratory ex­ periments with such a system are described, and problems of organizing command languages, design­ ing touch sensors and manipulators are detailed.
