The geographical properties of words have recently begun to be exploited for geolocating documents based solely on their text, often in the context of social media and online content. One common approach for geolocating texts is rooted in information retrieval. Given training documents labeled with latitude/longitude coordinates, a grid is overlaid on the Earth and pseudo-documents constructed by concatenating the documents within a given grid cell; then a location for a test document is chosen based on the most similar pseudo-document. Uniform grids are normally used, but they are sensitive to the dispersion of documents over the earth. We define an alternative grid construction using k-d trees that more robustly adapts to data, especially with larger training sets. We also provide a better way of choosing the locations for pseudo-documents. We evaluate these strategies on existing Wikipedia and Twitter corpora, as well as a new, larger Twitter corpus. The adaptive grid achieves competitive results with a uniform grid on small training sets and outperforms it on the large Twitter corpus. The two grid constructions can also be combined to produce consistently strong results across all training sets.
