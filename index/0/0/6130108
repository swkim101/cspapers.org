How can web services that depend on user generated content discern fake social engagement activities by spammers from legitimate ones? In this paper, we focus on the social site of YouTube and the problem of identifying bad actors posting inorganic contents and inflating the count of social engagement metrics. We propose an effective method, Leas (Local Expansion at Scale), and show how the fake engagement activities on YouTube can be tracked over time by analyzing the temporal graph based on the engagement behavior pattern between users and YouTube videos. With the domain knowledge of spammer seeds, we formulate and tackle the problem in a semi-supervised manner --- with the objective of searching for individuals that have similar pattern of behavior as the known seeds --- based on a graph diffusion process via local spectral subspace. We offer a fast, scalable MapReduce deployment adapted from the localized spectral clustering algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our deployment at Google by achieving a manual review accuracy of 98% on YouTube Comments graph in practice. Comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithm CopyCatch, Leas achieves 10 times faster running time on average. Leas is now actively in use at Google, searching for daily deceptive practices on YouTube's engagement graph spanning over a billion users.
