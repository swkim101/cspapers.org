RGBD scene recognition has attracted increasingly attention due to the rapid development of depth sensors and their wide application scenarios. While many research has been conducted, most work used hand-crafted features which are difficult to capture high-level semantic structures. Recently, the feature extracted from deep convolutional neural network has produced state-of-the-art results for various computer vision tasks, which inspire researchers to explore incorporating CNN learned features for RGBD scene understanding. On the other hand, most existing work combines rgb and depth features without adequately exploiting the consistency and complementary information between them. Inspired by some recent work on RGBD object recognition using multi-modal feature fusion, we introduce a novel discriminative multi-modal fusion framework for rgbd scene recognition for the first time which simultaneously considers the inter-and intra-modality correlation for all samples and meanwhile regularizing the learned features to be discriminative and compact. The results from the multimodal layer can be back-propagated to the lower CNN layers, hence the parameters of the CNN layers and multimodal layers are updated iteratively until convergence. Experiments on the recently proposed large scale SUN RGB-D datasets show that our method achieved the state-of-the-art without any image segmentation.
