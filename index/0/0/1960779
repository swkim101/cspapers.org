Feature extraction is an effective step in data mining and machine learning. While many feature extraction methods have been proposed for clustering, classification and regression, very limited work has been done on multi-class classification problems. In fact, the accuracy of multi-class classification problems relies on well-extracted features, the modeling part aside. This paper proposes a new feature extraction method, namely extracting orientation distance-based discriminative (ODD) features, which is particularly designed for multi-class classification problems. The proposed method works in two steps. In the first step, we extend the Fisher Discriminant idea to determine more appropriate kernel function and map the input data with all classes into a feature space. In the second step, the ODD features are extracted based on the one-vs-all scheme to generate discriminative features between a pattern and each hyperplane. These newly extracted features are treated as the representative features and are further used in the subsequent classification procedure. Substantial experiments on both UCI and real-world datasets have been conducted to investigate the performance of ODD features based multi-class classification. The statistical results show that the classification accuracy based on ODD features outperforms that of the state-of-the-art feature extraction methods.
