In this work, we present a novel concept in the area of optimal grasp synthesis, confronting both geometric and mechanical constraints. Initializing from a locally optimal force distribution on some predefined feasible contact points, our method improves gradually the grasp quality avoiding simultaneously singularities and mechanical limitations. The proposed scheme implements sequential perturbations on the contact points and the wrist's position/orientation incorporating a post-optimality method in an iterative process to derive the consecutive optimal states. The main novelty of this work lies in the fact that only local information of the object's surface is required, which can be provided for instance by an appropriate tactile sensor suite. Finally, a simulation study on the DLR/HIT Hand II clarifies and verifies the efficiency of the approach.
