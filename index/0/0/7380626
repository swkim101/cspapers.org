We consider different types of single-hidden-layer feedforward nets: with or without direct input to output connections, and using either threshold or sigmoidal activation functions. The main results show that direct connections in threshold nets double the recognition but not the interpolation power, while using sigmoids rather than thresholds allows (at least) doubling both. Various results are also given on VC dimension and other measures of recognition capabilities.
