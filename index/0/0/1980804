In this paper we are concerned with the PLA folding problem defined by Hachtel, Newton and Sangiovanni-Vincentelli. We propose a depth first branch and bound procedure for optimizing simultaneous row and column folding. With our procedure one can compute such a PLA folding which is optimal with respect to different practical constraints. We present some results of an implemented algorithm that is restricted to row folding.
