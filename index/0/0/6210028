Many houseworks such as cleaning the floor or wiping the windows require to manipulate tools over wide areas. It is necessary to move along a path while manipulating a tool with the whole body and applying exactly the right amount of force to successfully accomplish the task. So mastering such a challenge demands detailed knowledge about the involved objects and the underlying process models. Reasoning about an appropriate parameterization of the task is thereby essential. In this paper we propose a combination of object-centered hybrid reasoning and compliant force control to solve complex whole-body mobile manipulation issues. Depending on the objects involved in the task, an appropriate controller is selected and automatically parameterized. The methods are validated in an elaborate experiment on the humanoid robot Rollin' Justin.
