In this work, we tackle the problem of time-series modeling of video traffic. Different from the existing methods which model the time-series in the time domain, we model the wavelet coefficients in the wavelet domain. The strength of the wavelet model includes (1) a unified approach to model both the long-range and the short-range dependence in the video traffic simultaneously, (2) a computationally efficient method on developing the model and generating high quality video traffic, and (3) feasibility of performance analysis using the model.
