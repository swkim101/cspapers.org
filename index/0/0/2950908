Computer (and human) networks have long had to contend with spreading viruses. Effectively controlling or curbing an outbreak requires understanding the dynamics of the spread. A virus that spreads by taking advantage of physical links or user-acquaintance links on a social network can grow explosively if it spreads beyond a critical radius. On the other hand, random infections (that do not take advantage of network structure) have very different propagation characteristics. If too many machines (or humans) are infected, network structure becomes essentially irrelevant, and the different spreading modes appear identical. When can we distinguish between mechanics of infection? Further, how can this be done efficiently? This paper studies these two questions. We provide sufficient conditions for different graph topologies, for when it is possible to distinguish between a random model of infection and a spreading epidemic model, with probability of misclassification going to zero. We further provide efficient algorithms that are guaranteed to work in different regimes.
