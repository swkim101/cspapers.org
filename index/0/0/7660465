Default and non-monotonic inference rules are not really epistemological statements, but are instead desires or preferences of the agent about, the makeup of its own mental state (episternic or otherwise). The fundamental relation in non-monotonic logic is not so much self-knowledge as self-choire or seIf-determination, and the fundamental justification of the interpretation, and structures involved come from decision theory and economics rather than from logic and epistemology.
