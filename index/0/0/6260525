All popular computer graphics textbooks have chapters on curves and surfaces [1, 5, 6, 7]. Teaching these chapters could be one of the most challenging tasks in a computer graphics course because of the involved mathematics and the difficulty of visualizing the anticipated effects of the theoretical results. We certainly can skip these chapters and only rely on the polyhedron world, because Gouraud’s or Phong’s shading algorithms could make polyhedra objects appear as realistic curvilinear ones. Unfortunately, real world applications such as ship hull and car body design are usually curvilinear and may only be approximated using polyhedron models. Thus, to address this problem and to make teaching surface design easier, we have designed a pedagogical tool as part of our NSF supported project [8]. One of our goals is to provide the students with an interactive environment which is used to visualize, experiment and verify important and fundamental concepts and algorithms. While there are good textbooks on curve and surface design [3, 4, 9], we can only find two pedagogical aids. Yen’s video program [11] only provides one way information flow. Rockwood and Chambers [10] describe a multimedia tutorial on computer aided geometric design which runs on Windows. It is basically a tutorial that introduces concepts using some animation but lacks a
