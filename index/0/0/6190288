Parallel database systems have to support the effective parallelization of complex queries in multi-user mode, i.e. in combination with inter-query~mter-transaction parallelism. For this purpose, dynamic scheduling and load balancing strategiesâ€™ are necessary that umsider the current system state for dekrminhg the degree of intra-query parallelism and for selecting the processors for executing subqueries. We study these issues for parallel hash joinprocessing and show that the two subproblems should be addressed in au integrated way. Even more importantly, however, is the use of a multimannce load balancing approach that considers all potential bottleneck resources. in particular memory, disk and CPU. We discuss basic performance tradeoffs to consider and evalGate the performauce of several oad balancing strategies by means of a detailed simulation model. Simulation results will be analyzed for multiuser configurations with both homogeneous andheterogeneous (query/OLTP) workloads.
