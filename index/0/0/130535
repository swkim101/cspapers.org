In this demonstration paper, we show a novel approach to detect the common placements of a mobile phone, such as "in pocket", "in bag" or "out of pocket or bag", from embedded proximity (IR) and light sensors. We use sensor data fusion and pattern recognition to extract distinct features from sensor signals and classify the boundaries among these three phone placement contexts. The detection results are demonstrated on a Samsung Tizen mobile phone.
