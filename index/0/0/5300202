Many approaches to unsupervised morphology acquisition incorporate the frequency of character sequences with respect to each other to identify word stems and affixes. This typically involves heuristic search procedures and calibrating multiple arbitrary thresholds. We present a simple approach that uses no thresholds other than those involved in standard application of X2 significance testing. A key part of our approach is using document boundaries to constrain generation of candidate stems and affixes and clustering morphological variants of a given word stem. We evaluate our model on English and the Mayan language Uspanteko; it compares favorably to two benchmark systems which use considerably more complex strategies and rely more on experimentally chosen threshold values.
