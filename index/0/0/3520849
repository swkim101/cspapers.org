Among related synchronous programming principles, the model of computation of the POLYCHRONY workbench stands out by its capability to give high-level description of systems where each component owns a local activation clock (such as, typically,distributed real-time systems or systems on a chip). In order to bring the modeling capability of POLYCHRONY to the context of a model-driven engineering toolset for embedded system design, we define a diagramic notation composed of mode automata and data-flow equations on top of the multi-clocked synchronous model of computation supported by the POLYCHRONY workbench. We demonstrate the agility of this paradigm by considering the example of an integrated modular avionics application. Our presentation features the formalization and use of model transformation techniques of the GME environment to embed the extension of POLYCHRONY's meta-model with mode automata.
