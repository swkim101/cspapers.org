Most data base machines use some type of "filter" to perform unary operations on files. This filter processes information "on the fly" during its transfer from mass storage (Disk) to main storage (main memory or buffer). This paper is devoted to the design study of such a filter for relational-type data bases. It is therefore assumed that data are structured as a set of n-ary relations.Using a top-down approach we classify the requirements under two catagories:1) Functional specification of the filter: the filter should perform the unary relational operations i.e. projection and restriction; it should also permit insertion deletion and updates of tuples.2) Performance requirements: in a filtering system access time is a linear function of the space used to the store relations, it becomes therefore of the utmost importance to minimize this space.In order to meet the second requirement, we suggest to structure the n-ary relations into hierarchical free format files. Clearly, such a data structure minimizes space: the remaining problems being the ability to read and update such files. It is then shown that an automaton-like device is sufficient to perform projections and restrictions of relations and insertions, deletions and updates of tuples. That device is described and an algorithm that automatically generates the microprogram realizing that device from the description of the relation and that of the operations to be performed is given.
