We demonstrate a novel dataflow introspection framework called Inspector Gadget, which makes it easy to create custom monitoring and debugging add-ons to an existing dataflow engine such as Pig. The framework is motivated by a series of informal user interviews, which revealed that dataflow monitoring and debugging needs are both pressing and diverse. Of the 14 monitoring/debugging behaviors requested by users, we were able to implement 12 in Inspector Gadget, in just a few hundred lines of (Java) code each.
