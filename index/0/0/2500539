Two important questions in high-speed networking are firstly, how to provide Gbit/s networking at low cost and secondly, how to provide a flexible low-level network interface so that applications can control their data from the instant it arrives. We describe some work that addresses both of these questions. The Jetstream Gbit/s LAN is an experimental, low-cost network interface that provides the services required by delay-sensitive traffic as well as meeting the performance needs of current applications. Jetstream is a combination of traditional shared-medium LAN technology and more recent ATM cell- and switch-based technology. Jetstream frames contain a channel identifier so that the network driver can immediately associate an incoming frame with its application. We have developed such a driver that enables applications to control how their data should be managed without the need to first move the data into the application's address space. Consequently, applications can elect to read just a part of a frame and then instruct the driver to move the remainder directly to its destination. Individual channels can elect to receive frames that have failed their CRC, while applications can specify frame-drop policies on a per-channel basis. Measured results show that both kernel- and user-space protocols can achieve very good throughput: applications using both TCP and our own reliable byte-stream protocol have demonstrated throughputs in excess of 200 Mbit/s. The benefits of running protocols in user-space are well known- the drawback has often been a severe penalty in the performance achieved. In this paper we show that it is possible to have the best of both worlds.
