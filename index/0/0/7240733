The OLDA (Objects in Large Distributed Applications) workshop brought together people from a wide variety of backgrounds to share their insights into scalable object systems. Ranging from academics investigating system-level support mechanisms to industrial researchers restructuring applications, addressing issues from software engineering to memory management, a total of 16 papers were presented to an gathering of two dozen attendees. This report summarises the presentations, with a list of the papers attached as a bibliography. Any errors in presentation are entirely mine, and I apologise to the participâ€˜ants if I have accidentally misrepresented their work.
