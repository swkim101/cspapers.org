The CS10K project is a large-scale, collaborative project bringing together stakeholders from wide-ranging constituencies with the goal of systematically changing the scale, curriculum, and pedagogy of teaching computer science at all levels, but focusing in particular on computer science in U.S. high schools as well as introductory computing at the college level. As part of the systemic changes in teaching computer science the CS10K project aims to have 10,000 teachers in 10,000 high schools teaching a new curriculum by 2015.
