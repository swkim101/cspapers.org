In Web search ranking, the expected results for some queries could vary greatly depending upon location of the user. We name such queries regional sensitive queries. Identifying regional sensitivity of queries is important to meet users' needs. The objective of this work is to identify whether a user expects only regional results for a query. We present three novel features generated from search logs and build a meta query classifier to identify regional sensitive query. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in identifying regional sensitive queries.
