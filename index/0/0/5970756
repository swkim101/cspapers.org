For decades sensing systems have relied solely on battery power for execution of all activities; this has caused the focus of much research to go towards reducing energy consumption to extend the usable lifetime of a sensor. Recently, a new class of batteryless devices has arisen that promise operation in perpetuity, but often at the cost of reliability, and complexity. Programming, profiling, debugging, and building these applications is a significant challenge; designers must often be capable of implementing custom hardware to manage energy, while writing code in an environment that does not guarantee task completion. In this abstract, we motivate batteryless sensing, examine the state of the art, and propose a novel approach to programming, profiling, debugging, and building, tiny, batteryless sensors.
