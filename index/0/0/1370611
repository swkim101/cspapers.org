The Cognitive Science and Machine Intelligence Laboratory (CSMIL) is an interdisciplinary organization, spanning the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and collaboration technology. Its primary mission is to facilitate faculty research, graduate student training, and undergraduate education, with a special focus on cross-college collaborations. It is sponsored by three colleges at the University of Michigan: the Graduate School of Business Administration, the College of Engineering, and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA). research frontier, devoting a specific period of time to the intellectual exploration of an important topic. CSMIL coordinates financial support for faculty projects, and has been a major partner in several substantial University research efforts, including the NSF EXPRES project and the U of M efforts to put together a major program of research on collaboration technology. CSMIL continues to evolve state-of-theart computer-based research facilities. CSMIL takes an active role in disseminating results from the research of U of M faculty through several publication series tailored to either specific technical audiences or a more general readership. CSMIL welcomes corporate partnerships in our programs.
