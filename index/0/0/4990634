This paper presents the mechatronic design and experimental validation of a novel powered knee-ankle orthosis for testing torque-driven rehabilitation control strategies. The modular actuator of the orthosis is designed with a torque dense motor and a custom low-ratio transmission (24:1) to provide mechanical transparency to the user, allowing them to actively contribute to their joint kinematics during gait training. The 4.88 kg orthosis utilizes frameless components and light materials, such as aluminum alloy and carbon fiber, to reduce its mass. A human subject experiment demonstrates accurate torque control with high output torque during stance and low backdrive torque during swing at fast walking speeds. This work shows that backdrivability, precise torque control, high torque output, and light weight can be achieved in a powered orthosis without the high cost and complexity of variable transmissions, clutches, and/or series elastic components.
