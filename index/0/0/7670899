One conjecture in both deep learning and classical connectionist viewpoint is that the biological brain implements certain kinds of deep networks as its backend. However, to our knowledge, a detailed correspondence has not yet been set up, which is important if we want to bridge between neuroscience and machine learning. Recent researches emphasized the biological plausibility of LinearNonlinear-Poisson (LNP) neuron model. We show that with neurally plausible choices of parameters, the whole neural network is capable of representing any Boltzmann machine and performing a semi-stochastic Bayesian inference algorithm lying between Gibbs sampling and variational inference.
