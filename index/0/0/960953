As a fundamental data mining task, frequent pattern mining has widespread applications in many different domains. Research in frequent pattern mining has so far mostly focused on developing efficient algorithms to discover various kinds of frequent patterns, but little attention has been paid to the important nextstep - interpreting the discovered frequent patterns. Although some recent work has studied the compression and summarization of frequent patterns, the proposed techniques can only annotate a frequent pattern with non-semantical information (e.g. support), which provides only limited help for a user to understand the patterns.In this paper, we propose the novel problem of generating semantic annotations for frequent patterns. The goal is to annotate a frequent pattern with in-depth, concise, and structured information that can better indicate the hidden meanings of the pattern. We propose a general approach to generate such anannotation for a frequent pattern by constructing its context model, selecting informative context indicators, and extracting representative transactions and semantically similar patterns. This general approach has potentially many applications such as generating a dictionary-like description for a pattern, finding synonym patterns, discovering semantic relations, and summarizing semantic classes of a set of frequent patterns. Experiments on different datasets show that our approach is effective in generating semantic pattern annotations.
