SRAM design in scaled technologies requires knowledge of phenomena at the process, circuit, and architecture level. Decisions made at various levels of the design hierarchy affect the global figures of merit (FoMs) of an SRAM, such as, performance, power, area, and yield. However, the lack of a quick mechanism to understand the impact of changes at various levels of the hierarchy on global FoMs makes an accurate assessment of SRAM design innovations difficult. Thus, we introduce Virtual Prototyper (ViPro), a tool that helps SRAM designers explore the large design space by rapidly generating optimized virtual prototypes of complete SRAM macros. It does so by allowing designers to describe the SRAM components with varying levels of detail and by incorporating them into a hierarchical model that captures circuit and architectural features of the SRAM to optimize a complete prototype. It generates base-case prototypes that provide starting points for design space exploration, and assesses the impact of process, circuit, and architectural changes on the overall SRAM macro design.
