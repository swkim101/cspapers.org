This paper aims to find errors that lead to dialogue breakdowns in chat-oriented dialogue systems. We collected chat dialogue data, annotated them with dialogue breakdown labels, and collected comments describing the error that led to the breakdown. By mining the comments, we first identified error types. Then, we calculated the correlation between an error type and the degree of dialogue breakdown it incurred, quantifying its impact on dialogue breakdown. This is the first study to quantitatively analyze error types and their effect in chat-oriented dialogue systems.
