This paper presents GuLP a graph query language that enables to declaratively express preferences. Preferences enable to order the answers to a query and can be stated in terms of nodes/edge attributes and complex paths. We present the formal syntax and semantics of GuLP and a polynomial time algorithm for evaluating GuLP expressions. We describe an implementation of GuLP in the GuLP-it system, which is available for download. We evaluate the GuLP-it system on real-world and synthetic data.
