In this dissertation, we propose an online learning technique to predict a value of a continuous variable by (i) integrating a set of data streams from heterogeneous sources with time varying compositions including (a) changing the quality of data streams, (b) addition or deletion of data streams (ii) integrating the results of several analysis algorithms for each data source when the most suitable algorithm for a given data source is not known a priori (iii) dynamically weighting the prediction of each analysis algorithm and data source on the system prediction based on their varying quality.
