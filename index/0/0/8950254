This paper presents an approach that extends the standard approach used for bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora. We focus on the unresolved problem of polysemous words revealed by the bilingual dictionary and introduce a use of a Word Sense Disambiguation process that aims at improving the adequacy of context vectors. On two specialized FrenchEnglish comparable corpora, empirical experimental results show that our method improves the results obtained by two stateof-the-art approaches.
