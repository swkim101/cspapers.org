The Web has grown to be an integral part of modern society offering novel ways for humans to communicate, interact, and share information. New collaborative platforms are forming which are providing individuals with new communities and knowledge bases and, at the same time, offering insights into human activity for researchers, policy-makers and engineers. On a global scale, the role of cultural and language barriers when studying such phenomena becomes particularly relevant and presents significant challenges: due to insufficient information, it is often hard to establish the cultural or language groups in which individuals belong, while there are technical difficulties in establishing the relevance and in analysing resources in different languages. This paper presents a framework to the end of addressing those issues by leveraging data on the use of Wikipedia. Resources available in different languages are explicitly correlated in Wikipedia along with time-stamped logs of access to its articles. This paper provides a framework to enable temporal page views in Wikipedia to be associated with specific geographic profiles. This framework is then used to examine the exchange of information between the English speaking and Chinese speaking localities and reports initial findings on the role of language and culture in diffusion in this context.
