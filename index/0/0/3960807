Structure-mapping is a provably NP-Hard problem which is argued to lie at the core of the human metaphoric and analogical reasoning faculties. This NP-Hardness has meant that early attempts at optimal solutions to the problem have had to be augmented with sub-optimal heuristics to ensure tractable performance. This paper considers various grounds for qualifying the competence of such heuristic approaches, and offers an evaluation of the sub-optimal performance of three different models of analogy, SME, ACME and Sapper.
