We propose a characterization of PSPACE by means of atype assignment for an extension of lambda calculus with a conditional construction. The type assignment STAB is an extension of STA, a type assignment for lambda-calculus inspired by Lafont's Soft Linear Logic.
 We extend STA by means of a ground type and terms for booleans. The key point is that the elimination rule for booleans is managed in an additive way. Thus, we are able to program polynomial time Alternating Turing Machines. Conversely, we introduce a call-by-name evaluation machine in order tocompute programs in polynomial space. As far as we know, this is the first characterization of PSPACE which is based on lambda calculusand light logics.
