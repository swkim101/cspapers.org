Energy management is a critical concern in wireless sensornets. Despite its importance, sensor network operating systems today provide minimal energy management support, requiring applications to explicitly manage system power states. To address this problem, we present ICEM, a device driver architecture that enables simple, energy efficient wireless sensornet applications. The key insight behind ICEMis that the most valuable information an application can give the OS for energy management is its concurrency. Using ICEM, a low-rate sensing application requires only a single line of energy management code and has an efficiency within 1.6% of a hand-tuned implementation. ICEM's effectiveness questions the assumption that sensornet applications must be responsible for all power management and sensornets cannot have a standardized OS with a simple API.
