This poster reports on course materials that have been developed for teaching an Introduction to Web Science course to computing majors at the undergraduate level. This is the first comprehensive collection of resources that we are aware of that targets undergraduates in the exciting new field of Web Science. The course materials include slides, reading assignments, homework assignments, programming projects, and exams. We hope these materials will make adopting a Web Science course easier for a computing department or for creating an interdisciplinary course which could expose computing to a more diverse and broader group of students. Course materials may be obtained from the authors and from the following URLs: http://www.harding.edu/fmccown/classes/comp475-s13/ http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/teaching/cs595-f13/ This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (IIS 1008492).
