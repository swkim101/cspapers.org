We give a definition of the multi-task uniform stability, a generalization of the conventional uniform stability, which measures the maximum difference between the loss of a multi-task algorithm trained on a data set and that of the multi-task algorithm trained on the same data set but with a data point removed in each task. In order to analyze multi-task algorithms based on multi-task uniform stability, we prove a generalized McDiarmid's inequality which assumes the difference bound condition holds by changing multiple input arguments instead of only one in the conventional McDiarmid's inequality. By using the generalized McDiarmid's inequality as a tool, we can analyze the generalization performance of general multi-task algorithms in terms of the multi-task uniform stability. Moreover, as applications, we prove generalization bounds of several representative regularized multi-task algorithms.
