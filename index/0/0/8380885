This paper investigates the stability analysis problem of teleoperation system. Compared with previous work, the communication delays are assumed to be both time-varying and unsymmetric. The stability analysis is performed on two classes of controllers: delayed position error feedback and delayed force feedback. By choosing Lyapunov Krasovskii functional, we show that the master-slave teleoperation system is asymptotically stable under specific LMI conditions. With the given controller design parameters, the proposed stability criteria can be used to compute the allowable maximum delay values. Finally, the simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
