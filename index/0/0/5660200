There is a growing interest in software applications that allow several users to simultaneously interact with computer applications either in the same room or at a distance. Much early work focused on sharing exnting single-user applications across a network. The Multi-Device Multi-User Multi-Editor (MMM) project is developing a user interface and software architecture to support a new generation of editors specifically designed to be used by groups, including groups who share a single screen. Each user has his or her own modes, style settings, msertlon points, and feedback. Screen space is conserved by reducing the size and number of on-screen tools. The editors use per-user data structures to respond to multiuser input.
