Object-oriented programming is an emerging technology in both the research and industrial communities. At the School of Computer Science at Carleton UniversiQ, we have moved to an object-oriented paradigm to teach our introductory courses. This paradigm was chosen because it is more suitable for teaching the basic concepts of computer science such as data abstraction and encapsulation. Smalltalk has been chosen as the fundamental teaching language. In this paper, many of the experiences gained while teaching the introductory programming course are described. The structure of this course is outlined and the effects it has had on the program are identified. The problems encountered as well as a summary of studentsâ€™ reactions to the course are discussed. A description of further modi~cations to the course is given.
