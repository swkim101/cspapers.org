The ability to move energy around makes it feasible to build distributed energy storage systems that can robustly extend the lifetime of networked sensor systems. eShare supports the concept of energy sharing among multiple embedded sensor devices by providing designs for energy routers (i.e., energy storage and routing devices) and related energy access and network protocols. In a nutshell, energy routers exchange energy sharing control information using their data network while sharing energy freely among connected embedded sensor devices using their energy network. To improve sharing efficiency subject to energy leakage, we develop an effective energy charging and discharging mechanism using an array of ultra-capacitors as the main component of an energy router. We extensively evaluate our system under six real-world settings. Results indicate our charging and discharging control can effectively minimize the energy leaked away. Moreover, the energy sharing protocol can quantitatively share 113J energy with 96.82% accuracy in less than 2 seconds.
