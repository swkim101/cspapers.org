A model is presented that describes natural language parsing in terms of a uniform activation algorithm which operates over an interconnected, declarative structure of nodes and node instances. The algorithm directs the flow of activation and expectation using only local information and, hence, supports substantial concurrency. A representation is introduced to express node relationships and activation agreement Examples of several linguistic processes and their interrelationships are described.
