Paper Augmented Digital Documents (PADDs) are digital documents that can be manipulated either on a computer screen or on paper. PADDs, and the infrastructure supporting them, can be seen as a bridge between the digital and the paper worlds. As digital documents, PADDs are easy to edit, distribute and archive; as paper documents, PADDs are easy to navigate, annotate and well accepted in social settings. The chimeric nature of PADDs make them well suited for many tasks such as proofreading, editing, and annotation of large format document like blueprints.We are presenting an architecture which supports the seamless manipulation of PADDs using today's technologies and reports on the lessons we learned while implementing the first PADD system.
