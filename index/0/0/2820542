Since the discovery of a fully homomorphic cryptographic scheme by Gentry, a number of different schemes have been proposed that apply the bootstrap technique of Gentry's original approach. However, to date no implementation of fully homomorphic encryption has been publicly released. This poster presents a working implementation of the Smart-Vercauteren scheme that will be freely available and gives substantial implementation hints.
