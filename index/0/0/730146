Mining sentiment from user generated content is a very important task in Natural Language Processing. An example of such content is threaded discussions which act as a very important tool for communication and collaboration in the Web. Threaded discussions include e-mails, e-mail lists, bulletin boards, newsgroups, and Internet forums. Most of the work on sentiment analysis has been centered around finding the sentiment toward products or topics. In this work, we present a method to identify the attitude of participants in an online discussion toward one another. This would enable us to build a signed network representation of participant interaction where every edge has a sign that indicates whether the interaction is positive or negative. This is different from most of the research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on positive links. The method is experimentally tested using a manually labeled set of discussion posts. The results show that the proposed method is capable of identifying attitudinal sentences, and their signs, with high accuracy and that it outperforms several other baselines.
