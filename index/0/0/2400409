All Computer Science Departments that offer graduate degrees share a common problem---many students, with degrees in other disciplines, apply to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science, but have to make up a large number of undergraduate deficiencies before taking graduate classes. These students are typically above traditional age, have jobs and families, and cannot easily afford to make the time commitment that is necessary to be able to complete the deficiencies before taking the classes that become their graduate program. The Computer Science Department at Montana State University has a solution to this problem.We have developed two accelerated introductory courses, CS 252 and 254, where enrollment is restricted to students who already have degrees in other disciplines. These classes, which have two lectures and six hours of laboratory work each week, replace 26 semester credits of regular coursework, and let potential graduate students remove their required undergraduate deficiencies about a year faster than would otherwise be possible.
