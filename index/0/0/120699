There are several consistency control algorithms for managing replicated files in the face of network partitioning due to site or communication link failures. In this paper, we consider the popular voting scheme along with three enhancements: voting with a primary site, dynamic voting, and dynamic voting with linearly ordered copiee. We develop a stochastic model which compares the file availabilities afforded by each of these schemes. We show that in this model dynamic voting with linearly ordered copies provides the greatest availability.
