We give, a deterministic polynomial time approximation algorithm for a minmax integer programming problem, achieving the best existential bound given by Srinivasan [17]. Such a minmax integer programming problem arises naturally from a classical problem on routing to minimize congestion. It also has a hypergraph coloring problem as its special case, which can be applied to support divide and conquer approaches for numerous problems.
