System D is a distributed transaction-processing system which addresses the problems of data integrity, system availability, and incremental growth. It is an experimental research vehicle and has been prototyped on a local network of loosely coupled minicomputers. This paper describes the architecture of the system. Novel features of System D include the distributed Resource Manager that provides high availability by diagnosing and taking corrective actions against software-induced crashes, the two-phase Direct Commit protocols that require fewer messages and I/OS than conventional two-phase commit protocols, the datagram-based communications architecture, and the modular storage system.
