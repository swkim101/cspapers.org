The accuracy of document clustering depends on the user’s viewpoints. We make use of queries as the user’s viewpoints to enhance cluster-based browsing for a large amount of search results, reflecting the user’s interests. Here the queries are incrementally expanded in the process of cluster-based browsing. We present an application of the proposed method to an IR system on the WWW and evaluate its performance by basic experiments.
