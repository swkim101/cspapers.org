This work characterizes the generalization ability of algorithms whose predictions are linear in the input vector. To this end, we provide sharp bounds for Rademacher and Gaussian complexities of (constrained) linear classes, which directly lead to a number of generalization bounds. This derivation provides simplified proofs of a number of corollaries including: risk bounds for linear prediction (including settings where the weight vectors are constrained by either L2 or L1 constraints), margin bounds (including both L2 and L1 margins, along with more general notions based on relative entropy), a proof of the PAC-Bayes theorem, and upper bounds on L2 covering numbers (with Lp norm constraints and relative entropy constraints). In addition to providing a unified analysis, the results herein provide some of the sharpest risk and margin bounds. Interestingly, our results show that the uniform convergence rates of empirical risk minimization algorithms tightly match the regret bounds of online learning algorithms for linear prediction, up to a constant factor of 2.
