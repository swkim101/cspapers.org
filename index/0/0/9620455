This paper describes the BlackBox framework, an object-oriented application development environment, and our experience with its use over the past several years in the CS1/CS2 course. This little-known framework features: (1) a graphical user interface that is simple enough for beginning students to program, (2) true cross-platform capability, (3) guaranteed memory-safe pointers with automatic garbage collection, (4) a new language, Component Pascal, that combines the best of Java and Pascal, (5) fast, native-code compilation, and (6) lowest possible cost (free to educational users). The paper concludes with a guide to further resources for those who wish to pursue this promising new framework in their curricula for the first year.
