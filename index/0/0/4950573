The RAM complexity of deterministic linear space sorting of integers in words is improved from O(n p logn) to O(n(log logn) 2 ). No better bounds are known for polynomial space. In fact, the techniques give a deterministic linear space priority queue supporting insert and delete in O((log logn) 2 ) amortized time and nd-min in constant time. The priority queue can be implemented using addition, shift, and bit-wise boolean operations.
