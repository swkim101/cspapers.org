The ubiquitous location sensing trend has increased the demand for low-cost GPS receivers; but their energy needs are still too high. For delay-tolerant applications, investigations show that significant energy saving can be obtained by offloading a few milliseconds of raw signal samples and leveraging the greater processing power of the cloud for obtaining a position fix. In an attempt to reduce the energy cost of this data offloading operation, we propose SparseGPS+. Based on the sparse decomposition model, it overcomes many limitations of SparseGPS [1] to yield better signal-to-noise ratio and detection accuracy; which translates to 30% more energy savings compared to the state-of-the-art.
