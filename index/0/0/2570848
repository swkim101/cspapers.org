Available bandwidth estimation is useful for route selection in overlay networks, QoS verification, and traffic engineering. Recent years have seen a surge in interest in available bandwidth estimation. A few tools have been proposed and evaluated in simulation and over a limited number of Internet paths, but there is still great uncertainty in the performance of these tools over the Internet at large.This paper introduces Spruce, a simple, light-weight tool for measuring available bandwidth, and compares it with two existing tools, IGI and Pathload, over 400 different Internet paths. The comparison focuses on accuracy, failure patterns, probe overhead, and implementation issues. The paper verifies the measured available bandwidth by comparing it to Multi-Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG) data and by measuring how each tool responds to induced changes in available bandwidth.The measurements show that Spruce is more accurate than Pathload and IGI. Pathload tends to overestimate the available bandwidth whereas IGI becomes insensitive when the bottleneck utilization is large.
