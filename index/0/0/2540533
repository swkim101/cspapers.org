SEAFACT (Semantic Analysis For the Animation of Cooking Tasks) is a natural language interface to a computer-generated animation system operating in the domain of cooking tasks. SEAFACT allows the user to specify cooking tasks using a small subset of English. The system analyzes English input and produces a representation of the task which can drive motion synthesis procedures. This paper describes the semantic analysis of verbal modifiers on which the SEAFACT implementation is based.
