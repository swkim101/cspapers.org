We present initial results of our effort to build an extensive and complete taxonomy of events described in news articles. By crawling Wikipedia's current events portal we identified nine top-level event types. Using articles referenced by the portal we built a event type classification model for news articles using lexical and semantic features and present a small-scale manual evaluation of its results. Results show that our model can accurately distinguish between event types but its coverage could still be significantly improved.
