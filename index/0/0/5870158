Proper place recognition on an environment that can change over time is fundamental for long-term SLAM. In such scenarios the observations obtained in the same region can drastically differ due to changes caused by semi-static objects, such as doors, furniture, etc. In this work, we extend a strategy that represents environment regions using words, based on spatial density information extracted from laser readings. This time, in order to deal with changes in the environment, our method not only builds words representing the real observations made by the robot, but also alternative multi-level words to account for possible changes in a place's observations generated by non-static objects. Place recognition is made by searching matches of sequences of N consecutive words (both real or alternatives). Experiments performed in real and simulated scenarios are shown, and demonstrate the advantages associated to the use of multi-level words.
