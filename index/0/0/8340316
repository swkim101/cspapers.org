How to realize targeted advertising in digital signage is an interesting question. This paper proposed an Intelligent Advertising Framework (IAF), which pioneers the integration of Anonymous Viewer Analytics (AVA) and Data Mining technologies to achieve Targeted and interactive Advertising. IAF correlates AVA viewership information with point-of-sale (POS) data, and establishes a link between the response time to an ad by a certain demographic group and the effect on the sale of the advertised product. With the advertising models learned based on this correlation, IAF can provide advertisers and retailers with intelligence to show the right ads to right audience in right location at right time. Preliminary results indicate that IAF will greatly improve the effect and utility of advertising and maximize the Return on Investment (ROI) of advertisers and retailers. The demo shows Intel's leadership regarding intelligent advertising in the Digital Signage industry.
