Rising demand for high school computer science courses in the United States has created pressure to increase the number of computer science(CS) teachers in a short amount of time[3]. In this experience report, we present the TEALS program as a unique, high-touch, professional development model, pairing computing industry professionals with classroom teachers. By combining the relative strengths of the team (content and pedagogy) TEALS has been able to successfully train new CS teachers. We present the history of the TEALS program, the volunteer and teacher recruitment process, the volunteer training program, data from a study of the pedagogical content knowledge of the TEALS volunteers, and program growth and efficacy data. Additionally, we offer achievement of students on the AP CS A exam as an externally valid measurement of learning outcomes in TEALS classrooms.
