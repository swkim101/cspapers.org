In this paper we propose one explanation of why some novice programs are buggier than others. Central to our explanation is the notion of merged goals/plans in which multiple goals are achieved in a single integrated plan. Our arguments are based on our theory of the knowledge — plans and goals — used by a novice in creating a program, and an analysis of actual buggy novice programs.
