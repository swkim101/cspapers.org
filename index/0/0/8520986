Distributed Database (DDB) and Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) technologies have been conceived to addresses a variety of inherently complex problems involving spatial distribution. Although the types of problems addressed by these two technologies are quite different the technologies themselves present many similarities. In this paper we argue that DDB and DAI systems may be considered as duals of each other. The principal conclusion is that neither discipline has reached the point of maturity and that it would be useful to think in terms of systems developed by using a crossfertilization of these two disciplines. This paper focuses predominantly on DAI to DDB systems. 1 Mot ivat ion the technology transfer from for Coordinated Problem Solving To function effectively large organizations have to handle large volumes of information. To this end autcmated information servers have been deployed at an ever increasing rate within organizational functions or departments as the most effective way of dealing with this task. Typically, large companies (such as banks, corporate organizations, multi-nationals, etc) have developed over time independent information sysPermission to copy without fee all or part of this material is granted provided that the copies are not made or distributed for direct commercial edventqje, tha ACM copyright notice end the title of the publication and its data appaar, and notice is given that copying ia by permission of the Association for Computing Machinery.
