Attributes are mid-level semantic properties of objects. Recent research has shown that visual attributes can benefit many traditional learning problems in computer vision community. However, attribute learning is still a challenging problem as the attributes may not always be predictable directly from input images and the variation of visual attributes is sometimes large across categories. In this paper, we propose a unified multiplicative framework for attribute learning, which tackles the key problems. Specifically, images and category information are jointly projected into a shared feature space, where the latent factors are disentangled and multiplied for attribute prediction. The resulting attribute classifier is category-specific instead of being shared by all categories. Moreover, our method can leverage auxiliary data to enhance the predictive ability of attribute classifiers, reducing the effort of instance-level attribute annotation to some extent. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance on both instance-level and category-level attribute prediction. For zero-shot learning based on attributes, our method significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance on AwA dataset and achieves comparable performance on CUB dataset.
