The inclusion of robotic systems in physiotherapy allows developing new solutions for the rehabilitation and support of disabled people. Our research addresses the core problem for the advancement of such applications: the availability of a human machine interface offering intuitive control of robotic devices. In this paper we present an EMG-driven model of the human lower limb based on that previously developed by Lloyd et al [1]. We then introduce a set of enhancements that allow reducing time and memory requirements and provide real-time performances for the control of a lower limb powered orthosis.
