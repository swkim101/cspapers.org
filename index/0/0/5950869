In this paper we define a novel similarity measure between examples of textual entailments and we use it as a kernel function in Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This allows us to automatically learn the rewrite rules that describe a non trivial set of entailment cases. The experiments with the data sets of the RTE 2005 challenge show an improvement of 4.4% over the state-of-the-art methods.
