During OOPSLA/ECOOP’90, the first workshop on “Reflection and Metalevel Architectures in ObjectOriented Programming” was organized to provide researchers in this field with a forum through which they can discuss related issues, present their work, and explore new ideas. Based on the success of the the first workshop, a second workshop on the same subject was held in conjunction with OOPSLA’9 1, in Phoenix, Arizona, October 7, 1991.
