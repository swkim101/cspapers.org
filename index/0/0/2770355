This paper presents a network layer Internet topology collection tool called tracenet. Compared to traceroute, tracenet can collect a more complete topology information on an end-to-end path. That is, while traceroute returns a list of IP addresses each representing a router on a path, tracenet attempts to return all the IP addresses assigned to the interfaces on each visited subnetwork on the path. Consequently, the collected information (1) includes more IP addresses belonging to the traced path; (2) represents "being on the same LAN" relationship among the collected IP addresses; and (3) annotates the discovered subnets with their observed subnet masks. Our experiments on Internet2, GEANT, and four major ISP networks demonstrate promising results on the utility of tracenet for future topology measurement studies.
