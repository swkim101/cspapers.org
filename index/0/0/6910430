Application Driven Network(ADN) is a new paradigm that provides on-demand differentiated services for applications. A physical network in ADN is sliced into various logically isolated sub-networks. Each network slice can have its own network architecture and protocol to serve one application exclusively. ADN enhances the user experience while keeping the resource efficiency by further imposing multiplexing among these logically isolated sub-networks.
