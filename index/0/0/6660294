We present several introductory computer science laboratory assignments designed to reinforce the use of the scientific method. These assignments require students to make predictions, write simulations, perform experiments, collect data and analyze the results. The assignments are specifically designed to place student predictions in conflict with the observed results, thus producing a disequilibration. As a result, students are motivated to critically examine their simulations, consider their assumptions, and repeat their experiments. These potential benefits of disequilibration are discussed and additional ways to apply disequilibration in computer science education are suggested.
