Several algorithms to predict the next place visited by a user have been proposed in the literature. The accuracy of these algorithms -- measured as the ratio of the number of correct predictions and the number of all computed predictions -- is typically very high. In this paper, we show that this good performance is due to the high predictability intrinsic in human mobility. We also show that most algorithms fail to correctly predict transitions, i.e. situations in which users move between different places. To this end, we analyze the performance of 18 prediction algorithms focusing on their ability to predict transitions. We run our analysis on a data set of mobility traces of 37 users collected over a period of 1.5 years. Our results show that even algorithms achieving an overall high accuracy are unable to reliably predict the next location of the user if this is different from the current one. Building upon our analysis we then present a novel next-place prediction algorithm that can both achieve high overall accuracy and reliably predict transitions. Our approach combines all the 18 algorithms considered in our analysis and achieves its good performance at the cost of a higher computational and memory overhead.
