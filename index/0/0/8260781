We present a method for calculation of disparity maps from stereo sequences. Disparity map from previous frame is first transferred to the new frame using estimated motion of the calibrated stereo rig. The predicted disparities are validated for the new frame and areas where prediction failed are matched with a traditional stereo matching algorithm. This method produces very fast and temporally stable stereo matching suitable for real-time applications even on non-parallel hardware.
