In this paper we study the importance of image based features on the click-through rate (CTR) in the context of a large scale product search engine. Typically product search engines use text based features in their ranking function. We present a novel idea of using image based features, common in the photography literature, in addition to text based features. We used a stochastic gradient boosting based regression model to learn relationships between features and CTR. Our results indicate statistically significant correlations between the image features and CTR. We also see improvements to NDCG and mean standard regression.
