Skyline query has been received much attention due to its wide application backgrounds for multi-preference and decision making. In this paper we consider skyline query evaluation and maintenance in wireless sensor networks. We devise an evaluation algorithm for finding skyline points progressively and a maintenance algorithm for skyline maintenance incrementally. We also conduct extensive experiments by simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms on various datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform existing algorithms in terms of network lifetime prolongation.
