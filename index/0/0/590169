We propose an intermediary-level semantic representation, providing a higher level of abstraction than syntactic parse trees, while not committing to decisions in cases such as quantification, grounding or verbspecific roles assignments. The proposal is centered around the proposition structure of the text, and includes also implicit propositions which can be inferred from the syntax but are not transparent in parse trees, such as copular relations introduced by appositive constructions. Other benefits over dependency-trees are explicit marking of logical relations between propositions, explicit marking of multiword predicate such as light-verbs, and a consistent representation for syntacticallydifferent but semantically-similar structures. The representation is meant to serve as a useful input layer for semanticoriented applications, as well as to provide a better starting point for further levels of semantic analysis such as semantic-rolelabeling and semantic-parsing.
