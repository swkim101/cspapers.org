The main challenge in photo privacy detection is how to generate discriminant features to accurately detect privacy at risk photos. Existing photo privacy detection works, which rely on low-level vision features, are non-informative to the users regarding what privacy information is leaked from their photos. In this paper, we propose a new framework called Privacy-CNH that utilizes hierarchical features which include both object and convolutional features in a deep learning model to detect privacy at risk photos. The generation of object features enables our model to better inform the users about the reason why a photo has privacy risk. The combination of convolutional and object features provide a richer model to understand photo privacy from different aspects, thus improving photo privacy detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art work and the standard convolutional neural network (CNN) with low-level features on photo privacy detection tasks.
