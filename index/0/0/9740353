Illumination estimation is the process of determining the chromaticity of the illumination in an imaged scene in order to remove undesirable color casts through white-balancing. While computational color constancy is a well-studied topic in computer vision, it remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. One class of techniques relies on low-level statistical information in the image color distribution and works under various assumptions (e.g. Grey-World, White-Patch, etc). These methods have an advantage that they are simple and fast, but often do not perform well. More recent state-of-the-art methods employ learning-based techniques that produce better results, but often rely on complex features and have long evaluation and training times. In this paper, we present a learning-based method based on four simple color features and show how to use this with an ensemble of regression trees to estimate the illumination. We demonstrate that our approach is not only faster than existing learning-based methods in terms of both evaluation and training time, but also gives the best results reported to date on modern color constancy data sets.
