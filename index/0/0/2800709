Integrating soft and hard activities in a real-time environment has been an active area of research both under fixed priority scheduling and dynamic priority scheduling. Most of the existing work, however, has been done under the assumption that soft real-time tasks and hard real-time tasks are independent. The paper presents an efficient method that allows soft realtime aperiodic tasks and hard real-time tasks to share resources.
