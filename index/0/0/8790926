The study of situated systems that are capable of reactive and goal-directed behaviour has received increased attention in recent years. One approach to the design of such systems is based upon agent-oriented architectures. This approach has led to the development of expressive, but computationally intractable, logics for describing or specifying the behaviours of agent-oriented systems. In this paper, we present three propositional variants of such logics, with different expressive power, and analyze the computational complexity of verifying if a given property is satisfied by a given abstract agent-oriented system. We show the complexity to be linear time for one of these logics and polynomial time for another, thus providing encouraging results with respect to the practical use of such logics for verifying agent-oriented systems.
