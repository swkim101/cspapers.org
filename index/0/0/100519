Animation can be a very effective mechanism to convey information in visualization and user interface settings. However, integrating animated presentations into user interfaces has typicadly been a difficult task since, to date, there has been little or no explicit support for animation in window systems or user interface toolkits. This paper describes how the Artkit user interface toolkit has been extended with new animation support abstractions designed to overcome this problem. These abstractions provide a powerful but convenient base for building a range of animations, supporting techniques such as simple motion-blur, “squash and stretch”, use of arcing trajectories, anticipation and follow through, and “slow-in / slow-out” transitions. Because these
