MailCall is a telephone-based messaging system using speech recognition and synthesis. Its nonvisual interaction approaches the usability of visual systems through a combination of message categorization, presentation, and random access. MailCall monitors conversational context in order to improve feedback, error-correction, and help. Studies suggest that its nonvisual approach to handling messages is especially effective when the user has a large number of messages.
