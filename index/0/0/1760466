Neuromorphic computing using post-CMOS technologies is gaining immense popularity due to its promising abilities to address the memory and power bottlenecks in von-Neumann computing systems. In this paper, we propose RESPARC - a reconfigurable and energy efficient architecture built-on Memristive Crossbar Arrays (MCA) for deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Prior works were primarily focused on device and circuit implementations of SNNs on crossbars. RESPARC advances this by proposing a complete system for SNN acceleration and its subsequent analysis. RESPARC utilizes the energy-efficiency of MCAs for inner-product computation and realizes a hierarchical reconfigurable design to incorporate the data-flow patterns in an SNN in a scalable fashion. We evaluate the proposed architecture on different SNNs ranging in complexity from 2k–230k neurons and 1.2M–5.5M synapses. Simulation results on these networks show that compared to the baseline digital CMOS architecture, RESPARC achieves 500× (15×) efficiency in energy benefits at 300× (60×) higher throughput for multi-layer perceptrons (deep convolutional networks). Furthermore, RESPARC is a technology-aware architecture that maps a given SNN topology to the most optimized MCA size for the given crossbar technology.
