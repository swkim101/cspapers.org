This paper proposes an optimization method for dual-arm robots, inspired by a study on human asymmetric bimanual action called Guiard's principle which states that when humans perform asymmetric bimanual tasks, the right hand (as the lateral preference) performs a fine motion (and force) resolution, while the left hand performs a coarse resolution. To effectively transfer the human bimanual-task knowledge to dual-arm robots, we proposed a cost function, based on task-compatibility index, which is used to set the desired motion and force resolution for each end-effector of the dual-arm according to its role in the bimanual action. Thus the right-arm posture is optimized such that the tool attached to its end-effector can exert fine motion and force. And the left-arm posture is optimized to assume a strong and dynamic structural support for the right arm action. We experimentally compare the proposed cost function against previous methods for dual-arm robots using two six degrees-of-freedom torque-controlled manipulators. The control performance, when mimicking Guiard's principle shows considerably better results.
