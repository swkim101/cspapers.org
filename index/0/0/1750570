Performance models may be conveniently classified into three categories: Predictive, Synthesis and Correctness models. Predictive models attempt to predict the behavior of well-defined systems, while synthesis models are helpful in designing systems. Correctness models are concerned with demonstrating the correctness of protocols to handle various functions. These three classes of models are reviewed very briefly and in a very intuitive manner. No prior knowledge of modeling theory is assumed.
