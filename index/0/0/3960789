Cross-Technology Communication is a promising solution proposed recently to the coexistence problem of heterogeneous wireless technologies in the ISM bands. The existing works use only the coarse-grained packet-level information for cross-technology modulation, suffering from a low throughput (e.g., 10bps). Our approach, called BlueBee, proposes a new direction by emulating legitimate ZigBee frames using a Bluetooth radio. Uniquely, BlueBee achieves dual-standard compliance and transparency by selecting only the payload of Bluetooth frames, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes at the Bluetooth senders and ZigBee receivers. Our implementation on both USRP and commodity devices shows that BlueBee can achieve a more than 99% accuracy and a throughput 10,000x faster than the state-of-the-art CTC reported so far.
