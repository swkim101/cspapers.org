Since the advent of the electronic computer, revolutionary changes have been made in modern society. As a natural consequence, modernization of the curricula has been called for in our educational system, which includes the grade schools, high schools, and colleges. In the last decade, mathematics courses in the grade schools have been completely overhauled by the introduction of the basic concepts of set theory, group theory and the Boolean algebra. Thus, a good mathematics foundation has been laid for the students for their future computer application. On the other hand, courses which contain computer oriented methods and theories have also been instituted in the college curricula of many academic disciplines such as engineering, medicine, mathematics, economics, business, science, management, etc. However, the initiation of an introductory computer course in the high schools is surprisingly sparse.
