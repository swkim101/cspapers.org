High utility itemsets refer to the sets of items with high utility like profit in a database, and efficient mining of high utility itemsets plays a crucial role in many real-life applications and is an important research issue in data mining area. To identify high utility itemsets, most existing algorithms first generate candidate itemsets by overestimating their utilities, and subsequently compute the exact utilities of these candidates. These algorithms incur the problem that a very large number of candidates are generated, but most of the candidates are found out to be not high utility after their exact utilities are computed. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, called HUI-Miner (High Utility Itemset Miner), for high utility itemset mining. HUI-Miner uses a novel structure, called utility-list, to store both the utility information about an itemset and the heuristic information for pruning the search space of HUI-Miner. By avoiding the costly generation and utility computation of numerous candidate itemsets, HUI-Miner can efficiently mine high utility itemsets from the utility-lists constructed from a mined database. We compared HUI-Miner with the state-of-the-art algorithms on various databases, and experimental results show that HUI-Miner outperforms these algorithms in terms of both running time and memory consumption.
