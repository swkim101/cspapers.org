This paper examines the efficacy of the application of a pre-existing technique in the area of event-event temporal relationship identification. We attempt to both reproduce the results of said technique, as well as extend the previous work with application to a newlycreated domain of biographical data. We find that initially the simpler feature sets perform as expected, but that the final improvement to the feature set underperforms. In response, we provide an analysis of the individual features and identify differences existing between two corpora.
