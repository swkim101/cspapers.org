Motivated by the problem of searching in the presence of adversarial errors, we consider a version of the game “Twenty Questions” played on the set {0,…,N-1} where the player giving answers may lie in her answers. The questioner is allowed <italic>Q</italic> questions and the responder may lie in upto [<italic>rQ</italic>] of the answers, for some fixed and previously known fraction <italic>r</italic>. Under three different models of this game and for two different question classes, we give precise conditions (i.e. tight bounds on <italic>r</italic> and, in most cases, optimal bounds on <italic>Q</italic> under which the questioner has a winning strategy in the game.
