In this paper, we incorporate concrete domain and action theory into a very expressive Description Logic (DL), called ALCQO. Notably, this extension can significantly augment the expressive power for modeling and reasoning about dynamic aspects of services contracting. Meanwhile, the original nature and advantages of classical DLs are also preserved to the extent possible.
