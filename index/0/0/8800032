Abstrac t Many applications call for exhaustive lists of strings subject to various constraints, such as inequivalence under group actions. A k-ary necklace is an equivalence class of k-ary strings under rotation (the cyclic group). A k-ary unlabeled necklace is an equivalence class of kary strings under rotation and permutation of alphabet symbols. We present new, fast, simple, recursive algorithms for generating (i.e., listing) all necklaces and binary unlabeled necklaces. Generalization is made to the case where no substring 0 t occurs, for fixed t. These algorithms have optimal running times in the sense that their running times are proportional to the number of necklaces produced. The algorithm for generating necklaces can be used as the basis for efficiently generating many other equivalence classes of strings under rotation, and has been applied to generating bracelets, fixed density necklaces, and irreducible polynomials.
