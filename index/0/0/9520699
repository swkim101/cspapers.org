where θ, θ′ ∈ Θ are the solutions returned by Ak(S1), Ak(S2), and S1, S2 are random samples, each of size m, drawn i.i.d from the underlying distribution D. The scaling by the square root of the sample size will allow us to analyze the non-trivial asymptotic behavior of these distance measures, which without scaling simply converge to zero in probability as m → ∞. For some ǫ > 0 and a set S ⊆ R, let Bǫ(S) be the ǫ-neighborhood of S, namely
