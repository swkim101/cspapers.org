In this paper, we present an approach to compose linked services on the Web based on the principles of linked data and REST. Our contribution is a unified method for discovering both the interaction possibilities a service offers and the available semantic links to other services. Our composition engine is implemented as a generic client that allows exploring a service API and interacting with other services to answer user's goal. We rely on a typical scenario in order to illustrate the benefits of our composition approach. We implemented a prototype to demonstrate the applicability of our proposal, experiment and discuss the results obtained.
