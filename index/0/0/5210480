Current translation models are mainly designed for languages with limited morphology, which are not readily applicable to agglutinative languages as the difference in the way lexical forms are generated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for translating agglutinative languages by treating stems and affixes differently. We employ stem as the atomic translation unit to alleviate data spareness. In addition, we associate each stemgranularity translation rule with a distribution of related affixes, and select desirable rules according to the similarity of their affix distributions with given spans to be translated. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the translation performance on tasks of translating from three Turkic languages to Chinese.
