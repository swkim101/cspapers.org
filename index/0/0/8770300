In this paper, we adopt the representation learning approach to align users across multiple social networks where the social structures of the users are exploited. In particular, we propose to learn a network embedding with the followership/ followee-ship of each user explicitly modeled as input/output context vector representations so as to preserve the proximity of users with "similar" followers/followees in the embedded space. For the alignment, we add both known and potential anchor users across the networks to facilitate the transfer of context information across networks. We solve both the network embedding problem and the user alignment problem simultaneously under a unified optimization framework. The stochastic gradient descent and negative sampling algorithms are used to address scalability issues. Extensive experiments on real social network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach compared with several state-of-the-art methods.
