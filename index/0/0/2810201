A great variety of techniques has been developed to optimize and enhance query processing for relational, client/server, distributed, parallel, and heterogeneous database systems (DBS). Based on that work and experience, we investigate how far those techniques are applicable to query processing in Knowledge Base Management Systems (KBMS). Our reference system is the KRISYS KBMS that consists of a knowledge-processing system at the client (clientbased processing) and a data-processing system at the server (database backend). We describe a unifying framework for query processing incorporating both processing systems (as realized in KRISYS). This allows to distribute and balance the amount of work done in the client and in the server. Based on an evaluation of that framework, several approaches to further enhance knowledge processing are reported.
