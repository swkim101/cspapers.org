The research reported in this paper presents a solution to an open problem which arises in sys-tems that use recursive production rules to re-present knowledge. The problem can be stated as follows: "Given a recursive definition, how can we derive an equivalent non-recursive program with well-defined termination conditions". Our solution uses connection graphs to first detect occurrences of recursive definitions and then synthesizes a non-recursive program from such a definition.
