Students often encounter assembly language during the course of their education as part of learning about the low-level operation of computer systems. While there are many assembly languages ranging from simple to complex, x86-64 is widely used in introductory level computer systems courses. Unfortunately, students often have difficulty visualizing the execution of an x86-64 program. Interactions between instructions, relevant registers, and the effect that instructions have on memory are all concepts that students struggle to understand. While students can use GDB or other debuggers to help them step through the execution of a program, there are currently no x86-64 simulators aimed at introductory computing students. Below C Level (BCL) is an x86-64 simulator aimed at helping novices overcome the barriers to learning this challenging language. BCL visualizes program state, specifically the program stack and register file in order to assist novice x86-64 programmers in tracing the execution of their programs. One of the primary motives for the creation of BCL was the desire for a simulator with a simple and intuitive interface that enables the user to spend more time focusing on the task at hand rather than attempting to understand a complex program. BCL provides this simple interface, which allows users to view firsthand the effects their code has upon the program stack and registers.
