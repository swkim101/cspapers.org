This paper proposes a method of building a 3D map from straight line segments using a parallel stereo camera. In the proposed method, 3D lines are reconstructed using 3D edge points obtained by edge-based SLAM. This is effective for longitudinal lines, e.g., in a corridor, which are hard to reconstruct due to degeneracy and small disparities. A parallel stereo camera cannot reconstruct horizontal lines in the images, and we reconstruct them using the points of intersection with nearby lines. Furthermore, we propose 1D occupancy cell representation for a 3D line segment to determine its range from multiple view images. Experiments show our approach successfully built line-based maps of indoor environments.
