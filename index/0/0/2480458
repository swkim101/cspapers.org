This paper proposes a design for our entry into the 2006 AAAI Scavenger Hunt Competition and Robot Exhibition. We will be entering a scalable two agent system consisting of off-the-shelf laptop robots, capable of monocular vision. Each robot will demonstrate the ability to localize itself, recognize a set of objects, and communicate with peer robots to share location and coordinate exploration.
