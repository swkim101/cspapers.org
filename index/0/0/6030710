Top-k processing in uncertain databases is semantically and computationally different from traditional top-k processing. The interplay between query scores and data uncertainty makes traditional techniques inapplicable. We introduce URank, a system that processes new probabilistic formulations of top-k queries inuncertain databases. The new formulations are based on marriage of traditional top-k semantics with possible worlds semantics. URank encapsulates a new processing framework that leverages existing query processing capabilities, and implements efficient search strategies that integrate ranking on scores with ranking on probabilities, to obtain meaningful answers for top-k queries.
