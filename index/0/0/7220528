We present a web search interface designed to encourage users to interact more fully with the results of a web search. Wrapping around a major commercial search engine, the system combines three main features; real-time query-biased web document summarisation, the presentation of sentences highly relevant to the searcher's query, and evidence captured from searcher interaction with the retrieval results.
