We consider the problem of estimating the spatial layout of an indoor scene from a monocular RGB image, modeled as the projection of a 3D cuboid. Existing solutions to this problem often rely strongly on hand-engineered features and vanishing point detection, which are prone to failure in the presence of clutter. In this paper, we present a method that uses a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) in conjunction with a novel optimization framework for generating layout estimates. We demonstrate that our method is robust in the presence of clutter and handles a wide range of highly challenging scenes. We evaluate our method on two standard benchmarks and show that it achieves state of the art results, outperforming previous methods by a wide margin.
