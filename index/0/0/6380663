Cloud computing is used to describe a collection of (remote) data centers (the hardware and the software) and applications delivered from them as a service (SaaS, Software as a Service). Its success is driven by the cost-effective on-demand availability of large, scalable amounts of computing resources. The cloud has become an established paradigm for many enterprise and consumer applications such as email, web servers, productivity applications, customer relationship management, etc. However, in IC design its success is still limited.This panel will discuss the real and perceived hurdles that currently prevent a broad adoption of cloud computing in IC design, and several scenarios on how this could happen.
