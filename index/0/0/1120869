The underlying processes that enable database query execution are fundamental to understanding database management systems. However, these processes are complex and can be difficult to explain and illustrate. To address this problem, we have developed a Java-based query simulation system that enables students to visualize the steps involved in processing DML queries. We performed a field experiment to evaluate the system, and the results suggest that the system improves student comprehension of the query execution process.
