In this paper, we propose an efficient multipath multicast routing algorithm in wormhole-routed 2D torus networks. We first introduce a Hamiltonian cycle model for exploiting the feature of torus networks. Based on this model, we find a Hamiltonian cycle in torus networks. Then, an efficient multipath multicast routing algorithm with Hamiltonian cycle model (mulitpath-HCM) is presented. The proposed multipath multicast routing algorithm utilizes communication channels more uniformly in order to reduce the path length of the routing messages, making the multicasting more efficient. Simulation results show that the multicast latency of the proposed multipath-HCM routing algorithm is superior to that of fixed and dual-path routing algorithms.
