We report on a course, entitled "How Computers Work: Logic in Action", which we have offered the past few years at the University of Oklahoma, and which will be offered soon at the University of Wyoming. Intended for non-CS majors, this course is our answer to the question, What would you teach if you had only one course to help students grasp the essence of computation and perhaps inspire a few of them to make computing a subject of further study? Assuming no prior knowledge of computers or mathematics beyond high school algebra, the course is compatible with the "Computer Science: Principles" approach proposed by the College Board, although it is a significant departure from the pilot courses that are currently following this approach.
