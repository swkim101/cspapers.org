We present the Haptic Shading Framework (HSF), a framework for procedurally defining haptic texture. HSF haptic texture shaders are short procedures allowing an application-programmer to easily define interesting haptic surface interaction and the parameters that control the surface properties. These shaders provide the illusion of surface characteristics by altering previously calculated forces from object collision in the haptic pipeline.HSF can be used in an existing haptic application with few modifications. The framework consists of user-programmable modules that are dynamically loaded. This framework and all user-defined procedures are written in C++, with a provided library of useful math and geometry functions. These functions are meant to mimic RenderMan functionality, creating a familiar shading environment. As we demonstrate, many procedural shading methods and algorithms can be directly adopted for haptic shading.
