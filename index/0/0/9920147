The dramatic improvements in global interconnectivity due to intranets, extranets, and the Internet has led to an explosion in the number and variety of new data-intensive applications. Along with the proliferation of these new applications have come increased problems of scale. This is demonstrated by frequent delays and service, disruptions when accessing networked data sources. Recently, push-based techniques have been proposed as a solution to scalability problems for distributed applications. This paper argues that push indeed has its place, but that it is just one aspect of a much larger design space for distributed information systems. We propose the notion of a Dissemination-Based Information System (DBIS) which integrates a variety of data delivery mechanisms and information broker hierarchies. We discuss the properties of such systems and provide some insight into the architectural imperatives that will influence their design. The DBIS framework can serve as the basis for development of a toolkit for constructing distributed information systems that better match the technology they employ to the characteristics of the applications they are intended to support.
