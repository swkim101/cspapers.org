In this paper we present a novel control architecture for realizing human-friendly behaviors and intuitive state based programming. The design implements strategies that take advantage of sophisticated soft-robotics features for providing reactive, robust, and safe robot actions in dynamic environments. Quick access to the various functionality of the robot enables the user to develop flexible hybrid state automata for programming complex robot behaviors. The real-time robot control takes care of all safety critical aspects and provides reactive reflexes that directly respond to external stimuli.
