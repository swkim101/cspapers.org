To reduce the cost and delay caused by transferring data to the remote cloud, the trend is to design an intelligent Edge Device (ED) for preliminary data processing, i.e., edge computing. Some EDs usually form a group where they wirelessly communicate with each other. Different ED groups are interconnected by optical fiber cables. Through coordinating the use of ED groups, we can perform a collaborative edge computing in a hybrid network where a cost-efficient optical-wireless convergence is achieved by virtualization. In this paper, we use the virtual network to describe one computing-application's requirement for the substrate resource, and we investigate how embed multiple virtual networks onto the common network infrastructure. In our approach, a graph-cutting algorithm is firstly utilized to embed as many virtual networks as possible onto the specified EDs within the same group. However, a single ED group cannot handle all computing applications competing for limited wireless and computing resources. To solve this challenging problem, we transform the virtual networks-impossibly embedded onto the same ED group into new ones processed by ED groups. Simulations results demonstrate the green feature of our solution: 1) the total transmitting power assigned for EDs is effectively reduced using the graph cutting algorithm provided that all of computing applications can be solved by a single ED group; 2) our method accepts more virtual networks with the improvement ratio of 77%, through the coordination of ED groups. In addition, there is a good match between the algorithm result and the optimal number of consumed wavelengths per optical fiber cable.
