In order to represent uncertain knowledge especially inference rules matching uncertain knowledge structures-several extensions of a representation schema are described. first a two-dimensional evidence space is introduced to express positive and negative evidence. It is shown how indicators of evidence (as parts of NL-utterances) modify evidence values by modification rules. Evidence values (points of the evidence space) can be used in place of truth values in order to represent inference rules. To do this the extensions deal with the goal point concept for redefining 'verify' (together with the concepts of neighborhood, deviation, and direction), and the concept of relevance reflecting the relationship between a single premise and the conclusion.
