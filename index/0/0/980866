In this paper, we propose a high-accuracy object detector based on co-occurrence features. Firstly, we introduce three kinds of local co-occurrence features constructed by the traditional Haar, LBP, and HOG respectively. Then the boosted detectors are learned, where each weak classifier corresponds to a local image region with a co-occurrence feature. In addition, we propose a Generalization and Efficiency Balanced (GEB) framework for boosting training. In the feature selection procedure, the discrimination ability, the generalization power, and the computation cost of the candidate features are all evaluated for decision. As a result, the boosted detector achieves both high accuracy and good efficiency. It also shows performance competitive with the state-of-the-art methods for pedestrian detection and general object detection tasks.
