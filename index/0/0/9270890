This paper demonstrates the use of three-dimensional electromagnetic field solvers to accurately model the interconnect for a 2.4 GHz RF to IF converter integrated circuit under development at Harris Semiconductor. Lumped element RLC models for the package leads, bondwires, die attach plane, and on-chip interconnect are shown to provide accurate simulation versus measurement and prove the importance of modeling the entire packaged IC.
