This paper describes the student modeler of the GUIDON2 tutor, which understands plans by a dual search strategy. It first produces multiple predictions of student behavior by a model-driven simulation of the expert. Focused, data-driven searches then explain incongruities. By supplementing each other, these methods lead to an efficient and robust plan understander for a complex domain.
