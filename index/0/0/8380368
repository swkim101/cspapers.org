Most undergraduate robotics courses introduce reactive behaviors, behaviors that are not mediated by world knowledge or a world model. What is missing from these courses, however, is the experience of combining reactive behaviors to create emergent behavior, behavior that is not anticipated by the robotocist but generated by the interaction of behaviors and the environment. We discuss two laboratory exercises that introduce reactive behaviors and combine them to produce emergent behaviors.
