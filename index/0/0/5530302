FM91 is an invitational workshop that is to bring together representatives from the research, commercial and governmental spheres of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. An earlier workshop, FM89 [1, 2, 3], focused on the role of Formal Methods in the development of trustworthy computer systems; FM91 is to focus on the synergism between Formal Methods and software engineering. As this article is being written prior to the holding of the workshop, we are able only to outline the intent of the workshop. The results of the workshop will be presented at this conference and a full workshop report will be prepared. Electronic mail may be sent to fm91@ora. on. ca for information pertaining to the availability of the report.
