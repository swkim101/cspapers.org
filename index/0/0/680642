Thii paper describes a new protocol to support IP multicast for mobile hosts in an IP internetwork. It uses the basic unicast routing capability of IETF Mobile IP as a foundation, and leverages existing IP multicast to provide multicast services for mobile hosts as well. We believe that the resulting scheme is simple, scalable, transparent, and to the extent possible, independent of the underlying multicast routing facility. Discrete-event simulation was used as the vehicle for a LLproof of concept‚Äù debugging of the protocol, as well as to determine its performance characteristics. A key feature of the new protocol is the use of designated multicast service providers (DMSPs) to address the scalability issues of mobile multicast. Our simulation results suggest distinct performance advantages of our protocol using DMSPs over two other approaches proposed for the mobile multicast problem, namely remote subscription and bi-directional tunnelling, particularly as the number of mobile group members increases.
