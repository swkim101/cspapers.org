We address the problem of smoothing translation probabilities in a bilingual N-gram-based statistical machine translation system. It is proposed to project the bilingual tuples onto a continuous space and to estimate the translation probabilities in this representation. A neural network is used to perform the projection and the probability estimation. Smoothing probabilities is most important for tasks with a limited amount of training material. We consider here the B TEC task of the 2006 I WSLT evaluation. Improvements in all ofÔ¨Åcial automatic measures are reported when translating from Italian to English. Using a continuous space model for the translation model and the target language model, an improvement of 1.5 BLEU on the test data is observed.
