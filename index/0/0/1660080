The separation of logic and control In logic pro­ grams allows the programmer to write programs whose execution Is determined by the Interpreter. This charac­ teristic of logic programs spurred research towards diversifying the means for controlling the execution of logic programs, and towards understanding and explor­ ing the value of parallelism In logic programming. Much of these efforts belong to the study of A N D / O R parallellsm, I.e., parallel execution of conjunctive/disjunctive goals respectively.
