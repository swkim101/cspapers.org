The shared control system is a modular real-time system designed to execute complex tasks through the intelligent coordination of task modules. A state machine is used to control task sequencing, and due to the automatic switching, the accuracy and reliability with which tasks are executed, is greatly improved. Tasks consist of sets of independent, modular, and reusable subtasks whose outputs are combined to create the control. This system has proved itself useful for rapid development of reliable high level multiple sensor based manipulation and control tasks. Additionally, we have integrated a neural network based visual servoing system, a semi-compliant Cartesian trajectory following heuristics, and a real-time graphical user interface in the system. The shared control system was implemented for the Self-Mobile Space Manipulator (SM2) to handle a range of tasks associated with locomotion, manipulation, and material transportation on Space-Station Freedom.
