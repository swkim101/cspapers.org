Fog computing, the distribution of computing resources closer to the end devices along the cloud-to-things continuum, is recently emerging as an architecture for scaling of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networking applications. Fog computing requires novel computing program decompositions for heterogeneous hierarchical settings. To evaluate these new decompositions, we designed, developed, and instrumented a fog computing testbed that includes cloud computing and computing gateway execution points collaborating to finish complex data analytics operations. In this interactive demonstration we present one fog-specific algorithmic decomposition we recently examined and adapted for fog computing: a multi-execution point linear regression decomposition that jointly optimizes operation latency, quality, and costs. The demonstration highlights the role fog computing can play in future sensor networking architectures, and highlights some of the challenges of creating computing program decompositions for these architectures. An annotated video of the demonstration is available at [5].
