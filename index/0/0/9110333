This paper will discuss a family of CAD tools supporting automatic diagnosis and the usage of those tools in Western Electric Company (WECo) testing. The CAD tools described in this paper are part of a package developed at the Engineering Research Center (ERC), Princeton, New Jersey. The Diagnostic Organization and Retrieval Algorithms (DORA) System is a complex of programs which provide audited test programs and diagnostic data files from the results of LAMP (Logic Analyzer for Maintenance Planning) [1] circuit simulation. DORA supports manufacturing and repair test facilities in all Divisions of Western Electric that produce circuit packs or digital custom devices. Improved engineering productivity in Bell Laboratories and Western Electric, efficient use of capital intensive test hardware, and reduced diagnostic costs are the goals of this package.
