Hybrid reactive-deliberative architectures in robotics combine reactive sub-policies for fast action execution with goal sequencing and deliberation. The need for replanning, however, presents a challenge for reactivity and hinders the potential for guarantees about the plan quality. In this paper, we argue that one can integrate abstract planning provided by symbolic dynamic programming in first order logic into a reactive robotic architecture, and that such an integration is in fact natural and has advantages over traditional approaches. In particular, it allows the integrated system to spend off-line time planning for a policy, and then use the policy reactively in open worlds, in situations with unexpected outcomes, and even in new environments, all by simply reacting to a state change executing a new action proposed by the policy. We demonstrate the viability of the approach by integrating the FODD-Planner with the robotic DIARC architecture showing how an appropriate interface can be defined and that this integration can yield robust goal-based action execution on robots in open worlds.
