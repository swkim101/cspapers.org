In this write-up, we describe series parallel graphs, a simple class of general graphs, and show how to compute their minimum spanning tree or shortest path. The problem is intended to be used as an assignment in an undergraduate course on Data Structures. It is a simple problem, yet non-trivial, and allows the students to implement several interesting data structures in one programming assignment.
