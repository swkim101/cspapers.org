Data files for scientific and engineering codes typically consist of a series of raw data values whose description is buried in the programs that interact with these files. In this situation, making even minor changes in the file structure or sharing files between programs (interoperability) can only be done after careful examination of the data files and the I/O statements of the programs interacting with this file. In short, scientific data files lack self-description, and other self-describing data techniques are not always appropriate or useful for scientific data files. By applying an object-oriented methodology to data files, we can add the intelligence required to improve data interoperability and provide an elegant mechanism for supporting complex, evolving, or multidisciplinary applications, while still supporting legacy codes. As a result, scientists and engineers should be able to share datasets with far greater ease, simplifying multidisciplinary applications and greatly facilitating remote collaboration between scientists.
