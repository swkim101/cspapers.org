The human-elephant conflict is causing significant damages to the life of human and elephants in Sri Lanka. Minimizing encounters between humans and elephants is hence crucial in alleviating the human-elephant conflict. We have earlier introduced Eloc, a cost-effective localization system that is based on infrasonic emissions from wild elephants. One of the remaining challenges is a resource-efficient method to detect the elephants' infrasonic emissions. We present our efforts on devising a support vector machine (SVM) that is able to detect elephant rumbles on Eloc nodes.
