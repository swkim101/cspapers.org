The CORBA Event Service provides a flexible model for asynchronous communication among objects. However, the standard CORBA Event Service specification lacks important features required by real-time applications. For instance, operational flight programs for fighter aircraft have complex real-time processing requirements. This paper describes the design and performance of an object-oriented, real-time implementation of the GORBA Event Service that is designed to meet these requirements.This paper makes three contributions to the design and performance measurement of object-oriented real-time systems. First, it illustrates how to extend the CORBA Event Service so that it is suitable for real-time systems. These extensions support periodic rate-based event processing and efficient event filtering and correlation. Second, it describes how to develop object-oriented event dispatching and scheduling mechanisms that can provide real-time guarantees. Finally, the paper presents benchmarks that demonstrate the performance tradeoffs of alternative concurrent dispatching mechanisms for real-time Event Services.
