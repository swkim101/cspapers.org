We consider the problem of embedding a metric into low-dimensional Euclidean space. The classical theorems of Bourgain and of Johnson and Lindenstrauss imply that <i>any</i> metric on <i>n</i> points embeds into an <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>)-dimensional Euclidean space with <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>) distortion. Moreover, a simple "volume" argument shows that this bound is nearly tight: the uniform metric on <i>n</i> points requires Ω(log <i>n</i>/log log <i>n</i>) dimensions to embed with logarithmic distortion. It is natural to ask whether such a volume restriction is the only hurdle to low-dimensional low-distortion embeddings. Do <i>doubling</i> metrics, which do not have large uniform submetrics, embed in low dimensional Euclidean spaces with small distortion? In this paper, we answer the question positively and show that any <i>doubling metric</i> embeds into <i>O</i>(log log <i>n</i>) dimensions with <i>o</i>(log <i>n</i>) distortion. In fact, we give a suite of embeddings with a smooth trade-off between distortion and dimension: given an <i>n</i>-point metric <i>(V,d)</i> with doubling dimension dim<i><sub>D</sub></i>, and any target dimension <i>T</i> in the range Ω(dim<i><sub>D</sub></i> log log <i>n) ≤ T ≤ O</i>(log <i>n</i>), we embed the metric into Euclidean space <b>ℝ</b><i><sup>T</sup></i> with <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>√dim<i><sub>D</sub>/T</i>) distortion.
