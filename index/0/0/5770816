True understanding of natural language text requires the inclusion of generalization and long-term memory. This paper describes the generalization â€¢ process and! memory used in the Integrated Partial Parser (IPP), a computer program that reads and remembers news stories. The need for generalization and generalization-based memory as an integral part of understanding natural language text is illustrated with examples from IPP. In addition, the nature of generalization is discussed.
