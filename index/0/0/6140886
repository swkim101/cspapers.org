When applying rules induced from training examples to a test example, there are three possible cases which demand different actions: (1) no match, (2) single match, and (3) multiple match. Existing techniques for dealing with the first and third cases are exclusively based on probability estimation. However, when there are continuous attributes in the example space, and if these attributes have been discretised into intervals before induction, fuzzy interpretation of the discretised intervals at deduction time could be very valuable. This paper introduces the idea of using fuzzy borders for interpretation of discretised intervals at deduction time, and outlines the results we have obtained with the HCV (Version 2.0) software.
