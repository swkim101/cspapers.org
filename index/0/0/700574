The aim of this work is to show the ability of finite-state transducers to simultaneously translate speech into multiple languages. Our proposal deals with an extension of stochastic finite-state transducers that can produce more than one output at the same time. These kind of devices offer great versatility for the integration with other finite-state devices such as acoustic models in order to produce a speech translation system. This proposal has been evaluated in a practical situation, and its results have been compared with those obtained using a standard mono-target speech transducer.
