Meta-models play a cornerstone role in Model-Driven Engineering as they are used to define the abstract syntax of Domain-Specific Modelling Languages, and so models and all sorts of model transformations depend on them. However, there are scarce tools and methods supporting their validation and verification, which are essential activities for the proper engineering of meta-models. In this paper we present an Eclipse-based tool that aims to fill this gap by providing two complementary meta-model testing languages. The first one has similar philosophy to the xUnit framework, enabling the definition of meta-model unit test suites comprising model fragments and assertions on their (in-)correctness. The second one is directed to verify expected properties of the meta-model, including domain and design properties, quality criteria and platform-specific requirements. Both tools are integrated within a framework for example-based, incremental meta-model development.
