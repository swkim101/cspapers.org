Borealis is a distributed stream processing engine that is being developed at Brandeis University, Brown University, and MIT. Borealis inherits core stream processing functionality from Aurora and inter-node communication functionality from Medusa.We propose to demonstrate some of the key aspects of distributed operation in Borealis, using a multi-player network game as the underlying application. The demonstration will illustrate the dynamic resource management, query optimization and high availability mechanisms employed by Borealis, using visual performance-monitoring tools as well as the gaming experience.
