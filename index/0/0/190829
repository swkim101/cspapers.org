Each processor in a uniform multiprocessor machine is characterized by a speed or computing capacity, with the interpretation that a job executing on a processor with speed s for t time units completes (s/spl times/t) units of execution. The on-line scheduling of hard-real-time systems, in which all jobs must complete by specified deadlines, on uniform multiprocessor machines is considered It is known that online algorithms tend to perform very poorly in scheduling such hard-real-time systems on multiprocessors; resource-augmentation techniques are presented here that permit online algorithms to perform better than may be expected given the inherent limitations. Results derived here are applied to the scheduling of periodic task systems on uniform multiprocessor machines.
