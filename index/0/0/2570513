The aim of this work is to propose a cloud computing architecture simulation platform for social human-robot interaction. This paper explains the design and development of this system named SIGVerse in four main components, namely (1) SIGServer as the central server, (2) Agent Controller for user applications, (3) Service Provider, and (4) SIGViewer as the client terminal, and web based development interface, in addressing the two main “human” issues in human-robot interaction with cloud computing architecture, (a) Distributed development platform, and (b) Large scale of human-robot simulation. Three current applications are discussed for the validation of the cloud computing architecture in social human-robot interaction simulations.
