Given <i>n</i> points in a <i>d</i> dimensional Euclidean space, the Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB) problem is to find the ball with the smallest radius which contains all <i>n</i> points. We give two approximation algorithms for producing an enclosing ball whose radius is at most ε away from the optimum. The first requires <i>O</i>(<i>nd</i>£/√ε) effort, where £ is a constant that depends on the scaling of the data. The second is a <i>O</i>*(<i>nd</i>Q/√ε) approximation algorithm, where Q is an upper bound on the norm of the points. This is in contrast with <i>coresets</i> based algorithms which yield a <i>O</i>(<i>nd</i>/ε) greedy algorithm. Finding the Minimum Enclosing Convex Polytope (MECP) is a related problem wherein a convex polytope of a fixed shape is given and the aim is to find the smallest magnification of the polytope which encloses the given points. For this problem we present <i>O</i>(<i>mnd</i>£/ε) and <i>O</i>* (<i>mnd</i>Q/ε) approximation algorithms, where <i>m</i> is the number of faces of the polytope. Our algorithms borrow heavily from convex duality and recently developed techniques in non-smooth optimization, and are in contrast with existing methods which rely on geometric arguments. In particular, we specialize the excessive gap framework of Nesterov [19] to obtain our results.
