This paper focuses on the RIME system aimed to the indexing of medical reports in a multimedia environment. This particular application is viewed as representative of a large set of still unanswered needs of large communities of users: domain experts dealing with on-line specialized documentation such as software engineers, medical specialists and so on. In this application textual information appears as an interesting media to access related pictures in the data base. After the presentation of the application and a study of the particular corpus involved we define a semantic model for the documents which is based on a Conceptual Language. Then we detail the indexing process and its various linguistic components which perform the translation of every medical report according to this semantic model.
