This paper presents the design of a novel robotic system capable of long-term benthic sampling along a transect. The robot is built to traverse back and forth along a mechanical guide-rail at the bottom of a water body. We present results from localization tests with the robot in a laboratory tank and a shallow swimming pool. A pilot deployment was made at a marina to accurately observe the rate and direction of water flow across a section of the marina inlet. Results from the experiment demonstrate the potential of this platform for monitoring various aquatic phenomena of interest.
