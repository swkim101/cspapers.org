Abstract : Large corpora of parsed sentences with semantic role labels (e.g. PropBank) provide training data for use in the creation of high-performance automatic semantic role labeling systems. Despite the size of these corpora, individual verbs (or rolesets) often have only a handful of instances in these corpora, and only a fraction of English verbs have even a single annotation. In this paper, we describe an approach for dealing with this sparse data problem, enabling accurate semantic role labeling for novel verbs (rolesets) with only a single training example. Our approach involves the identification of syntactically similar verbs found in Prop-Bank, the alignment of arguments in their corresponding rolesets, and the use of their corresponding annotations in Prop-Bank as surrogate training data.
