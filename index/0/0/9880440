Distributions of segment sizes have been measured under routine operating conditions on a computer system which utilizes variable-sized segments (the Burroughs B5500). The most striking feature of the measurements is the large number of small segments - about 60% of the segments in use contain less than 40 words. Although the results are certainly not installation-independent, they should be relevant to the design of new computer systems, especially with respect to the organization of paging schemes.
