A method for the efficient computation of accurate reduced-order models of large linear circuits is described. The method, called MPVL, employs a novel block Lanczos algorithm to compute matrix Pad√© approximations of matrix-valued network transfer functions. The reduced-order models, computed to the required level of accuracy, are used to speed up the analysis of circuits containing large linear blocks. The linear blocks are replaced by their reduced-order models, and the resulting smaller circuit can be analyzed with general-purpose simulators, with significant savings in simulation time and, practically, no loss of accuracy.
