The paper describes a new algorithm to generate minimal, stable, and symbolic corrections to an input that will cause a neural network with ReLU neurons to change its output. We argue that such a correction is a useful way to provide feedback to a user when the neural network produces an output that is different from a desired output. Our algorithm generates such a correction by solving a series of linear constraint satisfaction problems. The technique is evaluated on a neural network that has been trained to predict whether an applicant will pay a mortgage.
