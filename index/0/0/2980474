This paper presents a new embodied approach for object segmentation by a humanoid robot. It relies on interactions with a human teacher that drives the robot through the process of segmenting objects from arbitrarily complex, non-static images. Objects from a large spectrum of different scenarios were successfully segmented by the proposed algorithms.
