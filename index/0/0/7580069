This paper shows that discriminative reranking with an averaged perceptron model yields substantial improvements in realization quality with CCG. The paper confirms the utility of including language model log probabilities as features in the model, which prior work on discriminative training with log linear models for HPSG realization had called into question. The perceptron model allows the combination of multiple n-gram models to be optimized and then augmented with both syntactic features and discriminative n-gram features. The full model yields a state-of-the-art BLEU score of 0.8506 on Section 23 of the CCGbank, to our knowledge the best score reported to date using a reversible, corpus-engineered grammar.
