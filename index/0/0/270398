Domain-specific search engines are becoming increasingly popular because they offer increased accuracy and extra features not possible with general, Web-wide search engines. Unfortunately, they are also difficult and time-consuming to maintain. This paper proposes the use of machine learning techniques to greatly automate the creation and maintenance of domain-specific search engines. We describe new research in reinforcement learning, text classification and information extraction that enables efficient spidering, populates topic hierarchies, and identifies informative text segments. Using these techniques, we have built a demonstration system: a search engine for computer science research papers available at www.cora.justrcsettrch.com.
