To most of the hundreds of millions of computer users around the world, the inner workings of a computer are an utter mystery. Opening the box holds as much attraction as lifting the hood of a modern car. Users expect computing professionals to help them with their needs for designing, locating, retrieving, using, configuring, programming, maintaining, and understanding computers, networks, applications, and digital objects. They expect academic computer science to educate and train computing professionals to be familiar with the changing technologies and to maintain research programs that contribute to these ends. Students of computing look to faculty for a comprehensive, up-todate view of a world with many fragments, for making sense of rapidly changing technologies, for assistance in framing and answering important questions, and for training in effective professional practices.
