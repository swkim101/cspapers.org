In this paper, we study a novel problem of staring people discovery from social networks, which is concerned with finding people who are not only authoritative but also sociable in the social network. We formalize this problem as an optimization programming problem. Taking the co-author network as a case study, we define three objective functions and propose two methods to combine these objective functions. A genetic algorithm based method is further presented to solve this problem. Experimental results show that the proposed solution can effectively find the staring people from social networks.
