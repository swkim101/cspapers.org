We efficiently represent the distributions by using the framework of kernel embeddings of distributions that can hold high-order moment information of distributions without need for explicit density estimation.By learning latent vectors so as to maximize the posterior probability, kernels that reflect relations between words are obtained, and also words are visualized in a low-dimensional space.In experiments using 25 item review datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the GP-LVSM in prediction and visualization.
