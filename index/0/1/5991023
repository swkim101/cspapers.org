This paper strengthens the low-error PCP characterization of NP, coming closer to the upper limit of the BGLR conjecture. Consider the task of verifying a written proof for the membership of a given input in an NP language. In this paper, this is achieved by making a constant number of accesses to the proof, obtaining error probability that is exponentially small in the total number of bits that are read.
