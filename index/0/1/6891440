Legged robots come in a range of sizes and capabilities. By combining these robots into heterogeneous teams, joint locomotion and perception tasks can be achieved by utilizing the diversified features of each robot. In this work we present a framework for using a heterogeneous team of legged robots to detect slippery terrain. StarlETH, a large and highly capable quadruped uses the VelociRoACH as a novel remote probe to detect regions of slippery terrain. StarlETH localizes the team using internal state estimation. To classify slippage of the VelociRoACH, we develop several Support Vector Machines (SVM) based on data from both StarlETH and VelociRoACH. By combining the team's information about the motion of VelociRoACH, a classifier was built which could detect slippery spots with 92% (125/135) accuracy using only four features.
