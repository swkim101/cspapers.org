Topic tracking and information filtering are models of interactive tasks, but their evaluations are generally done in a way that does not reflect likely usage. The models either force frequent judgments or disallow any at all, assume the user is always available to make a judgment, and do not allow for user fatigue. In this study we extend the evaluation framework for topic tracking to incorporate those more realistic issues. We demonstrate that tracking can be done in a realistic interactive setting with minimal impact on tracking cost and with substantial reduction in required interaction.
