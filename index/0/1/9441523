Many tools have been developed to aid in the systems analysis and design process. These same tools are used in teaching to help students better understand the process. This paper will discuss ways in which one tool, Entity Relationship (ER) models, can be used in teaching data analysis and design. The role of ER models in database design will be reviewed. ER models will be considered as a framework for also dealing with file design. An example of an ER model will be given with a description of how it might be used in discussing file design issues with students.
