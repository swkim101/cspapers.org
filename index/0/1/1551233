As typically specified, background knowledge is available in the form of generic processes that serve as the building blocks for candidate model structures. In this paper, we present a more flexible approach that, when available processes are insufficient to construct an acceptable model, automatically produces new generic processes that let it complete the task. We describe FPM, a system that implements this idea by composing knowledge about algebraic rate expressions and about conceptual processes like predation and remineralization in ecology. We demonstrate empirically FPM's ability to construct new generic processes when necessary and to transfer them later to new modeling tasks. We also compare its failure-driven approach with a naive scheme that generates all possible processes at the outset. We conclude by discussing prior work on equation discovery and model construction, along with plans for additional research.
