This paper discusses the problem of calibrating posterior class probabilities from partially labelled data. Each instance is assumed to be labelled as belonging to one of several candidate categories, at most one of them being true. We generalize the concept of proper loss to this scenario, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a loss function to be proper, and we show a direct procedure to construct a proper loss for partial labels from a conventional proper loss. The problem can be characterized by the mixing probability matrix relating the true class of the data and the observed labels. The full knowledge of this matrix is not required, and losses can be constructed that are proper for a wide set of mixing probability matrices.
