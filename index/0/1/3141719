Avian flight far exceeds our best aircraft control systems. We have conducted a series of experiments at the Concord Field Station demonstrating the extraordinary maneuverability of the common pigeon, showing it darting through tight spaces and recovering from large disturbances with ease. Our goal is to understand how to make small fixed-wing aircraft achieve similar feats in equally challenging environments.
