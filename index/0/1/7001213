We present a 2-cloud oblivious storage (ORAM) system that achieves 2.6X bandwidth cost between the client and the cloud. Splitting an ORAM across 2 or more non-colluding clouds allows us to reduce the client-cloud bandwidth cost by at least one order of magnitude, shifting the higher-bandwidth communication to in-between the clouds where bandwidth provisioning is abundant. Our approach makes ORAM practical for bandwidth-constrained clients such as home or mobile Internet connections. We provide a full-fledged implementation of our 2-cloud ORAM system, and report results from a real-world deployment over Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure.
