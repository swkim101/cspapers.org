The popularity of long-tail search engine optimization (SEO) brings with new security challenges: incidents of long-tail keyword poisoning to lower competition and increase revenue have been reported. The emergence of cloud web hosting services provides a new and effective platform for long-tail SEO spam attacks. There is growing evidence that large-scale long-tail SEO campaigns are being carried out on cloud hosting platforms because they offer low-cost, high-speed hosting services. In this paper, we take the first step toward understanding how long-tail SEO spam is implemented on cloud hosting platforms. After identifying 3,186 cloud directories and 318,470 doorway pages on the leading cloud platforms for long-tail SEO spam, we characterize their abusive behavior. One highlight of our findings is the effectiveness of the cloud-based long-tail SEO spam, with 6% of the doorway pages successfully appearing in the top 10 search results of the poisoned long-tail keywords. Examples of other important discoveries include how such doorway pages monetize traffic and their ability to manage cloud platform's countermeasures. These findings bring such abuse to the spotlight and provide some insights to eliminating this practice.
