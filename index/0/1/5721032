Video streaming, in conjunction with social networks, have given birth to a new traffic pattern over the Internet: transient, localized traffic surges, known as flash crowds. Traditional traffic-engineering methods can hardly cope with these surges, as they are unpredictable by nature. Consequently, networks either have to be over-provisioned, which is expensive and wastes resources, or risk to periodically incur congestion, which infuriates customers. This demonstration shows how Fibbing can improve network performance and preserve usersâ€™ quality of experience when accessing video streams, by implementing a fine-grained load-balancing service. This service leverages two unique features of Fibbing: programming per destination load-balancing and implementing uneven splitting ratios.
