This paper describes the English explanation facility of the OWL Digitalis Advisor, a program designed to advise physicians regarding digitalis therapy. The program is written in OWL, an English-based computer language being developed at MIT. The system can explain, in English, both the methods it uses and how those methods were applied during a particular session. In addition, the program can explain how it acquires information and tell the user how it deals with that information either in general or during a particular session.
