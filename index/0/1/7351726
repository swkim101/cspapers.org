A new computer system organization and implementation is described and its application to problems in both clinical and research laboratory biomedical applications is outlined. This system, called a Conjoined Computer System to emphasize the idea of computer coordination, consists of a few storedprogram computers, each with a fixed assigned task, and inter-connected with combined data and control paths which may be easily changed. Such systems appear to be useful in situations where a) one or more major laboratory peripheral devices are included, b) operational speed is required which is greater than that which can be obtained from a single processor implementation, and c) the algorithms utilized can be partitioned into two or more machines such that only moderate intercomputer communication rates are needed. This architecture offers the possibility of simplifying the peripheral interfacing, reducing total computation time, allowing rapid system reconfiguration, enforcing the discipline required for structured programming, and, by means of a centralized program development console, increasing the efficiency of program development.
