Several organizations have collected massive amounts of data. These data sets are usually stored on tertiary storage and are very slowly migrating to database systems. One of the reasons for the limited success of database systems in this area is that current database systems do not provide the necessary functionality for a user interested in taking advantage of this information. Database mining refers to the efficient construction and verification of models of patterns embedded in large databases, and is emerging as a major application area for databases. The goal of the Quest project is to enhance database technology to address this problem.
