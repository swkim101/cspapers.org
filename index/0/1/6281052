This study clarified that a robot tracking a user can influence user decision-making. Two types of robot were used and the robots tracked or did not track the user. A laboratory experiment (n = 118) tested differences in selection ratios corresponding to a color name recommended by the robots. Subjects selected the recommended color name significantly more often when the robot tracked subjects' faces than in the no-recommendation situation, however, when the robot did not track subjects' faces with recommendation, there was no significant difference. The physiological data also showed that the tracking condition generated higher levels of arousal than the non-tracking condition. This suggests that tracking the user's face influences user decision-making.
