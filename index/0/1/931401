We describe an approach to retrieval of documents that contain of both free text and semantically enriched markup. In particular, we present the design and implementation prototype of a framework in which both documents and queries can be marked up with statements in the DAML+OIL semantic web language. These statements provide both structured and semi-structured information about the documents and their content. We claim that indexing text and semantic markup together will significantly improve retrieval performance. Our approach allows inferencing to be done over this information at several points: when a document is indexed, when a query is processed and when query results are evaluated.
