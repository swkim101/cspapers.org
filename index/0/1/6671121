This paper presentsa general and highly efficient method for query recommendation. Given query sessions, we automatically generate many similar and dissimilar query-pairs as the prior knowledge. Then we learn a transformation from the prior knowledge to move similar queries closer such that similar queries tend to have similar hash values.This is formulated as minimizing the empirical error on the prior knowledge while maximizing the gap between the data and some partition hyperplanes randomly generated in advance. In the recommendation stage, we search queries that have similar hash values to the given query, rank the found queries and return the top K queries as the recommendation result. All the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves encouraging results in terms of efficiency and recommendation performance.
