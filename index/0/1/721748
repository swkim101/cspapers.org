Inter-carrier interference (ICI) power PICI of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems using channel information and distributed Doppler spread is computed. Selective combining (SC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) diversity techniques in Rayleigh fading environments without channel noise are employed. Performance of SC and MRC in OFDM systems is assessed. Detailed discussions are given.
