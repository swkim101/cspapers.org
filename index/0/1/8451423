Developing effective methods for fusing multiple ranked lists of documents is crucial to many applications. Federated web search, for instance, has become a common practice where a query is issued to different verticals and a single ranked list of blended results is created. While federated search is regarded as collection fusion, data fusion techniques aim at improving search coverage and precision by combining multiple search runs on a single document collection. In this paper, we study in depth and extend a neural network-based approach, LambdaMerge, for merging results of ranked lists drawn from one (i.e., data fusion) or more (i.e., collection fusion) verticals. The proposed model considers the impact of the quality of documents, ranked lists and verticals for producing the final merged result in an optimization framework. We further investigate the potential of incorporating deep structures into the model with an aim of determining better combinations of different evidence. In the experiments on collection fusion and data fusion, the proposed approach significantly outperforms several standard baselines and state-of-the-art learning-based approaches.
