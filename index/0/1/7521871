With the increasing popularity of mobile computing devices, the need to access information in mobile environments has grown rapidly. Since the information has to be accessed over wireless networks, mobile information systems often have to deal with problems like low bandwidth, high delay, and frequent disconnections. Information hoarding is a method that tries to overcome these problems by transferring information, which the user will probably need, in advance. The hoarding mechanism that we describe in this paper exploits the location dependence of the information access, which is often found in mobile information systems. Our simulation results show that it is beneficial to do so and that we achieve higher hit ratios than with a caching mechanism.
