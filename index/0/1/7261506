A gesture-based interaction framework is presented for controlling mobile robots. This natural interaction paradigm has few physical requirements, and thus can be deployed in many restrictive and challenging environments. We present an implementation of this scheme in the control of an underwater robot by an on-site human operator. The operator performs discrete gestures using engineered visual targets, which are interpreted by the robot as parametrized actionable commands. By combining the symbolic alphabets resulting from several visual cues, a large vocabulary of statements can be produced. An iterative closest point algorithm is used to detect these observed motions, by comparing them with an established database of gestures. Finally, we present quantitative data collected from human participants indicating accuracy and performance of our proposed scheme.
