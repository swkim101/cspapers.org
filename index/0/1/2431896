Modular robots, which are systems made of many robotic modules, can utilize various types of locomotion. Different approaches can be used to generate these basic motion skills - motion primitives. To move in a complex environment, several motion primitives are needed and a mechanism to switch them is required. This can be realized using a high-level motion planning. To enable autonomous operation of modular robots equipped with limited computational resources, it is necessary to generate the motion plans on-board, i.e., without external computers. In this paper, we propose a novel simplified motion model of a modular robot, which allows the robot to employ the motion planner as a fast on-board replanner. The proposed approach has been verified both in simulations as well as with real robots.
