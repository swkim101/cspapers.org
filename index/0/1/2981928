This paper examines the role that summaries can play in document retrieval. Thirty searches are applied to full-text and summaries only in large document collections, and the results are evaluated using two different evaluation scopes. The results support the view that those customer segments who want smaller answer sets focused on highly relevant documents benefit from limiting their searches to summaries. On the other hand, those customer segments who wish to retrieve all references to some topic should continue to search full-text.
