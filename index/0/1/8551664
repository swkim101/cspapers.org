Motivation: Amouse is widely popular for controlling the graphic user interface due to its ease of use. Its attraction will soon penetrate well beyond just computers. There already have been mice designed for game consoles and smart TVs. A smart TV allows a user to run popular computer programs and smartphone applications. More and more devices in the future, such as Google Glasses, baby monitors, and new generation of home appliances, will all desire mouse functionalities, which allow users to choose from a wide variety of options and easily click on different parts of the view. However, a traditional mouse, which requires a flat and smooth surface to operate, cannot satisfy many new usage scenarios. A user wants to interact with the remote device on the move. For example, a speaker wants to freely move around and click on different objects in his slide; a smart TV user wants to watch TV in any part of a room; a Google Glass user wants to query about objects while touring around. Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if a user can simply turn his smartphone or smart watch into a mouse by moving it in the air?
