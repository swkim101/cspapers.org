Qualitative shape descriptions are important in a number of fields in AI, such as in qualitative reasoning, and especially in robotics and vision. Current approaches are confined to describing local features while walking along the shapesâ€™ boundaries. Shapes exist, however, which cannot be distinguished by these methods even though there are obvious distinctions between them. We shall introduce the notion of a global feature scheme in order to compensate for the shortcomings of present techniques. This approach is then applied to a class of shapes which have previously been shown to be difficult to distinguish, and proves capable of telling them apart. The method is based on a representation of intersection-free relations which complements existing qualitative representations for which intersections are virtually fundamental.1
