ABSTRACT In this paper, we introduce structural join index hierarchy (SJIH)mechanisms that mimic the class composition hierarchy of thecomplex objects to provide direct access to complex objects and/ortheir component objects. SJIH extends the work on join index hier-archies by providing efficient and flexible access to complexobjects, thus unifying various previous indexing methods proposedfor object oriented database (OODB). A cost model for processingthe queries and maintaining the indices is developed. A heuristicalgorithm is designed to select appropriate indices to efficientlyprocess a given set of queries. We show that SJIH indexing mech-anisms facilitate efficient retrieval of complex objects. Given a setof queries and a limited index storage space, the heuristic algo-rithm facilitates fast selection of near-optimal set of indices forefficiently executing the queries.
