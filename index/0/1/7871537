In response to interest expressed at the second SIGCSE symposium in St. Louis in March, 1972, on the subject of computer science education appropriate for the liberal arts college, a workshop was held at the campus of Wheaton College, Wheaton, Illinois, July 12-14, 1972. The object of the workshop was to involve representatives from liberal arts colleges in a discussion of computer science curricula that would be relevant for such schools. In the past most of the work on computer science curricula has been done by representatives from large universities, and there has been some question as to whether such a committee could deal effectively with the problems of limited resources and talent that characterize computer science in most liberal arts colleges.
