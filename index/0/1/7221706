Interactive image segmentation is an important problem in computer vision with many applications including image editing, object recognition and image retrieval. Most existing interactive segmentation methods only operate on color images. Until recently, very few works have been proposed to leverage depth information from low-cost sensors to improve interactive segmentation. While these methods achieve better results than color-based methods, they are still limited in either using depth as an additional color channel or simply combining depth with color in a linear way. We propose a novel interactive segmentation algorithm which can incorporate multiple feature cues like color, depth, and normals in an unified graph cut framework to leverage these cues more effectively. A key contribution of our method is that it automatically selects a single cue to be used at each pixel, based on the intuition that only one cue is necessary to determine the segmentation label locally. This is achieved by optimizing over both segmentation labels and cue labels, using terms designed to decide where both the segmentation and label cues should change. Our algorithm thus produces not only the segmentation mask but also a cue label map that indicates where each cue contributes to the final result. Extensive experiments on five large scale RGBD datasets show that our proposed algorithm performs significantly better than both other color-based and RGBD based algorithms in reducing the amount of user inputs as well as increasing segmentation accuracy.
