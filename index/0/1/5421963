This paper describes a commercially ,vailable multiple processor system that lelivers mainframe class performance for high volume transaction processing. Multiple systems of up to sixteen processors each are configured in a ring structure using fiber optics. This structure allows from two to over two hundred processors to be applied to a single on-line application. We discuss the tradeoffs in selecting a large number of small processors versus a small number of large processors. Benchmark results are presented to demonstrate the linearity in system performance as processors are
