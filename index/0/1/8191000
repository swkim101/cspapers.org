The problems of area patrol, perimeter surveillance, and target tracking are combined into a single reconnaissance framework. This integration is based on application of ordered upwind methods to track the propagation of the target position boundary. The ordered upwind methods provide a computationally efficient method for computing the target track boundary over a discretized nonuniform mesh of the environment. Planning methods based on the target track boundary are discussed. Simulation results demonstrate the use of ordered upwind methods for reconnaissance tasks.
