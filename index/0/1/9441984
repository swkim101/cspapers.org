In a beautiful result, Raghavendra established optimal Unique Games Conjecture (UGC)-based inapproximability for a large class of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). In the class of CSPs he considers, of which Maximum Cut is a prominent example, the goal is to find an assignment which maximizes a weighted fraction of constraints satisfied. He gave a generic semi-definite program (SDP) for this class of problems and showed how the approximability of each problem is determined by the corresponding SDP (upto an arbitrarily small additive error) assuming the UGC. He noted that his techniques do no apply to CSPs with strict constraints (all of which must be satisfied) such as Vertex Cover.
 In this paper we address the approximability of these strict-CSPs. In the class of CSPs we consider, one is given a set of constraints over a set of variables, and a cost function over the assignments, the goal is to find an assignment to the variables of minimum cost which satisfies all the constraints. We present a generic linear program (LP) for a large class of strict-CSPs and give a systematic way to convert integrality gaps for this LP into UGC-based inapproximability results. Some important problems whose approximability our framework captures are Vertex Cover, Hypergraph Vertex Cover, k-partite-Hypergraph Vertex Cover, Independent Set and other covering and packing problems over q-ary alphabets, and a scheduling problem. For the covering and packing problems, which occur quite commonly in practice as well, we provide a matching rounding algorithm, thus settling their approximability upto an arbitrarily small additive error.
