This paper is the first paper reporting the SHRIMP project at Princeton [l]. It describes the design of a network interface that implements a virtual memory-mapped communication model for protected, user-level communication. The vision of the SHRIMP project was to investigate how to use commodity PCs and commodity software (including operating systems) as building blocks to construct scalable, inexpensive servers that can deliver performance comparable to or better than custom-designed multicomputers. A challenge was to deliver communication performance to applications that was close to the hardware limit. This paper was the result of our effort to design network interfaces to support protected, user-level communication. In this retrospective, we would like to describe where our ideas came from, how the research project started, how we wrote the paper, how well the ideas worked out, and the current state of the SHRIMP project.
