Let r be an integer. Let us call a polynomial f as a multi-r-ic polynomial if the degree of f with respect to any variable is at most r (this generalizes the notion of multilinear polynomials). We investigate arithmetic circuits in which the output is syntactically forced to be a multi-r-ic polynomial and refer to these as multi-r-ic circuits. Specifically, first define the formal degree of a node a with respect to a variable x inductively as follows. For a leaf it is 1 if a is labelled with x and zero otherwise; for an internal node labelled with * (respectively +) it is the sum of (respectively the maximum of) the formal degrees of the children with respect to x. We call an arithmetic circuit as a multi-r-ic circuit if the formal degree of the output node with respect to any variable is at most r. We prove lower bounds for various subclasses of multi-r-ic circuits.
