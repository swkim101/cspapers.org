This paper proposes a machine-learning based approach to predict accurately, given a syntactic and semantic context, which preposition is most likely to occur in that context. Each occurrence of a preposition in an English corpus has its context represented by a vector containing 307 features. The vectors are processed by a voted perceptron algorithm to learn associations between contexts and prepositions. In preliminary tests, we can associate contexts and prepositions with a success rate of up to 84.5%.
