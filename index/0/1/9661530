Over the years, there has been tremendous progress in developing new methods for modeling and diagnosing reliability at the level of individual transistors and interconnects. The thrust to propagate these models to higher levels of abstraction to predict the reliability of larger circuits is much more recent. This paper addresses the intersection of physics, circuits, and architecture for reliability modeling and optimization that must come together for cross-layer optimization. For various device reliability phenomena, this paper shows how physical models can be leveraged at the circuit level, or circuit models at the architecture level, to deliver composite solutions that comprehend chip-level design goals.
