In this paper, we present a lightweight, multi-axis compliant tensegrity joint that is biologically inspired by the human elbow. This tensegrity elbow actuates by shortening and lengthening cables in a method inspired by muscular actuation in a person. Unlike many series elastic actuators, this joint is structurally compliant not just along each axis of rotation, but along other axes as well. Compliant robotic joints are indispensable in unpredictable environments, including ones where the robot must interface with a person. The joint also addresses the need for functional redundancy and flexibility, traits which are required for many applications that investigate the use of biologically accurate robotic models.
