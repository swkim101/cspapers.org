At a time when less than twenty percent of AP Computer Science test-takers are female, Girls Who Code [GWC] has developed a unique teaching philosophy and effective curriculum to engage young women in CS early in their careers. This curriculum is built around cultivating exposure, interest, community and support, and technical skills. More than 500 young women have participated in GWC's Summer Immersion Programs, a seven-week, full-time computer science program for high school students. Ninety-five percent of participants said they are definitely or more likely to consider a major / minor in computer science after participation. This workshop shares GWC's best practices with educators looking for new ways to effectively teach computer science. At the end of this workshop, participants will have concrete examples of how to effectively teach students who are underrepresented in computer science. Participants will also have the opportunity to practice teaching in the style and spirit of the GWC Summer Immersion Program, with the goal of engaging young women, and expanding this knowledge to reach minorities and other diverse populations.
