Transient voltage noise, including resistive and reactive noise, causes timing errors at runtime. We introduce a heuristic framework-Walking Pads-to minimize transient voltage violations by optimizing power supply pad placement. We show that the steady-state optimal design point differs from the transient optimum, and further noise reduction can be achieved with transient optimization. Our methodology significantly reduces voltage violations by balancing the average transient voltage noise of the four branches at each pad site. When we optimize pad placement using a representative stressmark, voltage violations are reduced 46-80% across 11 Parsec benchmarks with respect to the results from IR-drop-optimized pad placement. We also show that the allocation of on-chip decoupling capacitance significantly influences the optimal locations of pads.
