With the record growth in computing classes, it has been challenging for faculty to keep up with the logistics of the classroom, particularly in assessment. Automatic grading software and unit tests have been employed successfully in many settings to help ensure proper scoring of programming assignments. However, assignments that are not necessarily complete programs (in-class short quizzes, homework problems or worksheets, exams) present different challenges for scoring. In this session, we propose some tips and techniques for scoring such assessment items quickly and consistently, with the added benefit that grading criteria are clearer to the students.
