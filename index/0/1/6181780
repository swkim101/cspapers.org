Current Referring Expression Generation algorithms rely on domain dependent preferences for both content selection and linguistic realization. We present two experiments showing that human speakers may opt for dispreferred properties and dispreferred modifier orderings when these were salient in a preceding interaction (without speakers being consciously aware of this). We discuss the impact of these findings for current generation algorithms.
