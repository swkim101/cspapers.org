An undergraduate elective course in data mining provides a strong opportunity for students to learn research skills, practice data structures, and enhance their understanding of algorithms. I have developed a data mining course built around the idea of using research-level papers as the primary reading material for the course, and implementing data mining algorithms for the assignments. Such a course is accessible to students with no prerequisites beyond the traditional data structures course, and allows students to experience both applied and theoretical work in a discipline that straddles multiple areas of computer science. This paper provides detailed descriptions of the readings and assignments that one could use to build a similar course.
