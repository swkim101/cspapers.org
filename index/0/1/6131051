We investigate the automatic generation of topic pages as an alternative to the current Web search paradigm. We describe a general framework, which combines query log analysis to build aspect models, sentence selection methods for identifying relevant and non-redundant Web sentences, and a technique for sentence ordering. We evaluate our approach on biographical topics both automatically and manually, by using Wikipedia as reference.
