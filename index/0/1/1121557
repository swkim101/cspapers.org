Bitmaps are popular indexes for data warehouse (DW) applications and most database management systems offer them today. This paper proposes query optimization strategies for selections using bitmaps. Both continuous and discrete selection criteria are considered. Query optimization strategies are categorized into static and dynamic. Static optimization strategies discussed are the optimal design of bitmaps, and algorithms based on tree and logical reduction. The dynamic optimization discussed is the approach of inclusion and exclusion for both bit-sliced indexes and encoded bitmap indexes.
