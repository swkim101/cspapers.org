This special session will present an historical look at all past SIGCSE conferences, beginning with 2008. If possible, the conference chair, from each conference will present a brief synopsis of his/her conference. This synopsis may include a photo of the conference site, the number of attendees, the paper acceptance ratio, any special awards and the awardees, the "theme" of the conference, any special issues relevant at that conference, and one or two "interesting" events that occurred during that conference.
