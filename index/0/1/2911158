We bound the Hamming distance of a multivariate function from the space of polynomials of max-degree 5 I; in terms of its distances from functions that are polynomials of degree 5 k in one of their variables. The latter quantities can be estimated easily by statistical tests. The result conceptualizes an algorithm analysis of M. Szegedy and incorporates improvements based on a result of S. Arora and S. Safra. The bound results in a query-efficient BFL/FGLSStype maxdegree test, an ingredient of transparent proofs. We also describe another variant of the BFL mm-degree test which works over smaller domains. The analysis of this version follows the ideas of [12] and uses a combinatorial isoperimetric inequality.
