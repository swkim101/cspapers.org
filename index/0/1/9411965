Recent work in computer graphics has resulted in new techniques for rendering so-called nonphotorealistic images. While such features are now already appearing in commercially available software, little is known about the effect of nonphotorealistic images on users and their usefulness in specific contexts. In this paper we report on an empirical study with 54 architects who compared the output of a sketch-renderer for producing pencil-like drawings with standard output of CAD systems for architectural designs. The results show that the different kinds of renditions actually have a very different effect on viewers and that non-photorealistic images actually do deserve their place in the repertoire of CAD systems.
