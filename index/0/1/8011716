Multi-task clustering and multi-view clustering have severally found wide applications and received much attention in recent years. Nevertheless, there are many clustering problems that involve both multi-task clustering and multiview clustering, i.e., the tasks are closely related and each task can be analyzed from multiple views. In this paper, for non-negative data (e.g., documents), we introduce a multi-task multi-view clustering (MTMVC) framework which integrates within-view-task clustering, multi-view relationship learning and multi-task relationship learning. We then propose a specific algorithm to optimize the MT-MVC framework. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over either multi-task clustering algorithms or multi-view clustering algorithms for multi-task clustering of multiview data.
