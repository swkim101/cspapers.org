In this paper, we first propose a global unsupervised feature selection approach for text, based on frequent itemset mining. As a result, each document is represented as a set of words that co-occur frequently in the given corpus of documents. We then introduce a locally adaptive clustering algorithm, designed to estimate (local) word relevance and, simultaneously, to group the documents. We present experimental results to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Furthermore, the analysis of the weights credited to terms provides evidence that the identified keywords can guide the process of label assignment to clusters. We take into consideration both spam email filtering and general classification datasets. Our analysis of the distribution of weights in the two cases provides insights on how the spam problem distinguishes from the general classification case.
