The perception of the dynamic aspects of the environment is a highly relevant precondition for the realization of autonomous robot system acting in the real world. In this paper, we propose a novel method for estimating dense rigid scene flow in 3D LiDAR scans. We formulate the problem as an energy minimization problem, where we assume local geometric constancy and incorporate regularization for smooth motion fields. Analyzing the dynamics at point level helps in inferring the fine-grained details of motion. We show results on multiple sequences of the KITTI odometry dataset, where we seamlessly estimate multiple motions pertaining to different dynamic objects. Furthermore, we test our approach on a dataset with pedestrians to show how our method adapts to a case with non-rigid motion. For comparison we use the ground truth from KITTI and show how our method outperforms different ICP-based methods.
