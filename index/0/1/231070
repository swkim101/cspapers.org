This paper presents a novel robot swarming navigation algorithm in order to find the odor sources in an unknown environment, based on the ability of each swarm member to sense the odor. Each robot in the swarm has a cooperative localization system which uses wireless network as a mean of measuring the distance from the other robots. In this method, at least three robots act as stationary measurement beacons while the other robots of the swarm navigate in the environment towards the odor source. In the next step, the roles of the robots will be switched and some other robots will act as beacons. The experimental tests report a good result in finding the odor source and also the accuracy of localization system1.
