We propose efficient particle smoothing methods for generalized state-spaces models. Particle smoothing is an expensive O(N2) algorithm, where N is the number of particles. We overcome this problem by integrating dual tree recursions and fast multipole techniques with forward-backward smoothers, a new generalized two-filter smoother and a maximum a posteriori (MAP) smoother. Our experiments show that these improvements can substantially increase the practicality of particle smoothing.
