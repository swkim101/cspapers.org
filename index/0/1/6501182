This demo describes the summarization of textual material about locations in the context of a geo-spatial information display system. When the amount of associated textual data is large, it is organized and summarized before display. A hierarchical summarization framework, conditioned on the small space available for display, has been fully implemented. Snapshots of the system, with narrative descriptions, demonstrate our results.
