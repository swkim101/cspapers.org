Much prior work has studied cache replacement, but a large gap remains between theory and practice. The design of many practical policies is guided by the optimal policy, Belady's MIN. However, MIN assumes perfect knowledge of the future that is unavailable in practice, and the obvious generalizationsof MIN are suboptimal with imperfect information. What, then, is the right metric for practical cache replacement?We propose that practical policies should replace lines based on their economic value added (EVA), the difference of their expected hits from the average. Drawing on the theory of Markov decision processes, we discuss why this metric maximizes the cache's hit rate. We present an inexpensive implementation ofEVA and evaluate it exhaustively. EVA outperforms several prior policies and saves area at iso-performance. These results show that formalizing cache replacement yields practical benefits.
