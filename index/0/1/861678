For outdoor navigation, GPS provides the most widely-used means of node localization; however, the level of accuracy provided by low-cost receivers is typically insufficient for use in high-precision applications. Additionally, many of these applications do not require precise absolute Earth coordinates, but rather rely on relative positioning to infer information about the geometric configuration of the constituent nodes in a system. This paper presents a novel approach that uses GPS to derive relative location information for a scalable network of single-frequency receivers. Networked nodes share their raw satellite observations, enabling each node to localize its neighbors in a pairwise fashion as opposed to computing its own standalone position. Random and systematic errors are mitigated in novel ways, challenging long-standing beliefs that precision GPS systems require extensive stationary calibration times or complex equipment configurations. In addition to presenting the mathematical basis for our technique, a working prototype is developed, enabling experimental evaluation of several real-world test scenarios. The results of these experiments indicate sub-meter relative positioning accuracy under various conditions and in varying environments. This represents up to order of magnitude increase in precision over existing absolute positioning techniques or other unimodal GPS-based solutions.
