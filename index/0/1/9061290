We examine the volumes and varieties of data sources of the Open Directory Project (ODP), which can endure, regenerate and flourish with new knowledge. The ODP motivates us in building a knowledge base smarter multidimensional data constructs and models. We articulate the models with new artefacts, addressing the heterogeneity and multidimensionality of the data. The conceptualization and contextualization of various entities and dimensions have emerged with innovation that led us to develop a digital ecosystem-based inventory. The ODP based domain ontologies support the warehouse repository, which accommodates multidimensional data relationships. The concept of a digital ecosystem in the ODP context is to bring the dimensions together and unite with multidimensional schemas. We explore the Big Data, incorporating their characteristics in the ODP constructs and models. The volumes and varieties of the ODP data are logically organized and integrated in the warehouse repositories. The multidimensional data modelling makes the ODP more smart and flexible in an environment, where varieties of business rules and constraints change rapidly. The visualization and interpretation are the other artefacts of the Big Data facilitating us use, reuse, test the interoperability and effectiveness of the data models for sustainable ODP digital ecosystem. We compute the polynomial regressions, based on the data fluctuations of the ODP as observed in the scatter plots, providing new data mining models for knowledge interpretation.
