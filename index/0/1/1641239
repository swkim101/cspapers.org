This paper addresses a method for stabilizing the attitude of a quadrotor-like Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Towards this end, a new fuzzy control technique based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) is proposed, relying on a simple Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model when compared to others found in the Literature. This strategy guarantees prescribed performance criteria, such as exponential decay rate, allowing stability under aggressive disturbances. The designed local gains are combined through membership functions of the model and are used to regulate the attitude of the vehicle on the hovering operating point, an important flight mode for this kind of robot. Numerical analysis reveal how the transient response can be tuned and tests with disturbances show the stability of the vehicle starting from different initial conditions, illustrating the merits of the proposed approach.
