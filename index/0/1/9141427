We consider a stream outsourcing setting, where a data owner delegates the management of a set of disjoint data streams to an untrusted server. The owner authenticates his streams via signatures. The server processes continuous queries on the union of the streams for clients trusted by the owner. Along with the results, the server sends proofs of result correctness derived from the owner's signatures, which are easily verifiable by the clients. We design novel constructions for a collection of fundamental problems over streams represented as linear algebraic queries. In particular, our basic schemes authenticate dynamic vector sums and dot products, as well as dynamic matrix products. These techniques can be adapted for authenticating a wide range of important operations in streaming environments, including group by queries, joins, in-network aggregation, similarity matching, and event processing. All our schemes are very lightweight, and offer strong cryptographic guarantees derived from formal definitions and proofs. We experimentally confirm the practicality of our schemes.
