Methods for acquisition and maintenance of an environment model are central to a broad class of mobility and navigation problems. Towards this end, various metric, topological or hybrid models have been proposed. Due to recent advances in sensing and recognition, acquisition of semantic models of the environments have gained increased interest in the community. In this work, we will demonstrate a capability of using weak semantic models of the environment to induce different topological models, capturing the spatial semantics of the environment at different levels. In the first stage of the model acquisition, we propose to compute semantic layout of the street scenes imagery by recognizing and segmenting buildings, roads, sky, cars and trees. Given such semantic layout, we propose an informative feature characterizing the layout and train a classifier to recognize street intersections in challenging urban inner city scenes. We also show how the evidence of different semantic concepts can induce useful topological representation of the environment, which can aid navigation and localization tasks. To demonstrate the approach, we carry out experiments on a challenging dataset of omnidirectional inner city street views and report the performance of both semantic segmentation and intersection classification.
