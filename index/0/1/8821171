PCIe-based Flash is commonly deployed to provide datacenter applications with high IO rates. However, its capacity and bandwidth are often underutilized as it is difficult to design servers with the right balance of CPU, memory and Flash resources over time and for multiple applications. This work examines Flash disaggregation as a way to deal with Flash overprovisioning. We tune remote access to Flash over commodity networks and analyze its impact on workloads sampled from real datacenter applications. We show that, while remote Flash access introduces a 20% throughput drop at the application level, disaggregation allows us to make up for these overheads through resource-efficient scale-out. Hence, we show that Flash disaggregation allows scaling CPU and Flash resources independently in a cost effective manner. We use our analysis to draw conclusions about data and control plane issues in remote storage.
