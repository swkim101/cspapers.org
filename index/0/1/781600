RANSAC algorithm is often used to calculate the homography matrix by randomly selecting a set of features iteratively. CS-RANSAC algorithm in this paper converts RANSAC algorithm into two-layers. The first layer is addressing sampling problem which we can describe our knowledge about degenerate features by mean of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). By dividing the input image into a N X N grid and making feature points into discrete domains, we can model the image into the CSP model to efficiently filter out degenerate feature samples using CSP in the first layer, so that computer has knowledge about how to skip computing the homography matrix in the model estimation step for the second layer. The experimental results show that the proposed CS-RANSAC algorithm can outperform the most of variants of RANSAC without sacrificing its execution time.
