This paper describes some preliminary results about Word Domain Disambiguation, a variant of Word Sense Disambiguation where words in a text are tagged with a domain label in place of a sense label. The English WORDNET and its aligned Italian version, MULTIWORDNET, both augmented with domain labels, are used as the main information repositories. A baseline algorithm for Word Domain Disambiguation is presented and then compared with a mutual help disambiguation strategy, which takes advantages of the shared senses of parallel bilingual texts.
