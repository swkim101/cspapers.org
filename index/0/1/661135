Existing recurrent net learning algorithms are inadequate. We introduce the conceptual framework of viewing recurrent training as matching vector fields of dynamical systems in phase space. Phase-space reconstruction techniques make the hidden states explicit, reducing temporal learning to a feed-forward problem. In short, we propose viewing iterated prediction [LF88] as the best way of training recurrent networks on deterministic signals. Using this framework, we can train multiple trajectories, insure their stability, and design arbitrary dynamical systems.
