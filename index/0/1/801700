The growing infrastructure for Web Services assumes a ”programmer in the loop” that hardcodes the connections between Web Services and directly programs Web Service composition. Emerging technology based on DAML-S and the Semantic Web allows Web Services to connect and transact automatically with minimal or no intervention from programmers. In this paper we discuss the problems related with autonomous Web Services, and how DAMLS provides the information to solve them. Furthermore, we describe the implementation of two demonstration systems that use such technology: the first system is a B2B application in which a business that assembles computers automatically finds partners providing parts and automatically transacts with them; the second describes an e-commerce application that helps a user to organize a trip to a meeting automatically interacting with different Web Services and the calendar of the user stored in MS Outlook. The results of these experiments show how Web Services can be deployed on the Web to interact and provide information dynamically; second, how the transaction can be carried on automatically with no programmer intervention.
