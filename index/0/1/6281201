We present a tool that performs real time analysis and priority assignment for software tasks in a mixed hardware software system with a custom run time scheduler. The tasks in hardware and software have precedence constraints, resource constraints, relative timing constraints, and a rate constraint. A dynamic programming formulation assigns the static priorities such that a hard real time rate constraint can be predictably met. We describe the task control/data flow extraction, runtime scheduler implementation, real time analysis and priority scheduler template. We show how our approach fits into an overall tool flow and target architecture. Finally, we conclude with a sample application of the system to a design example.
