This work presents a comparison of the five observability indices used for robot calibration. The comparison is realized in order to determine the most appropriate observability index, which allows for the best parameter identification of a calibrated robot, and therefore leading to the best improvement of the robot accuracy. In this study, the accuracy analysis is based on the robot end-effector errors, which are expressed in term of Euclidean errors. The parameter identification process is based on minimizing the residual of the position errors. The actual values of these positions are usually measured by an external measurement device and have measurement noise. The position residuals are calculated in all the calibration configurations, which are selected by using observability indices. An optimal set of configurations is the one reducing the impact of the measurement noise on the parameter identification efficacy. Our study is carried out for the calibration of four robots: two degrees of freedom (DOF) and 6-DOF serial robots, and 2-DOF and 3-DOF planar parallel robots. The comparison of the observability indices was achieved through a Monte Carlo simulation, using 100 different cases for each of the four robots considered. The position measurement noise was assumed to be within a range of ± 200 μm. Investigations led to conclude that there is a specific index that may be considered the best observability index for robot calibration. Finally, an experimental study has been applied to a LR Mate 200ic FANUC robot and confirms the simulated results.
