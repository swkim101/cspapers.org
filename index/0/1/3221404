An important aspect of making the Web accessible to blind users is ensuring that all important web page elements such as links, clickable buttons, and form fields have explicitly assigned labels. Properly labeled content is then correctly read out by screen readers, a dominant assistive technology used by blind users. In particular, improperly labeled form fields can critically impede online transactions such as shopping, paying bills, etc. with screen readers. Very often labels are not associated with form fields or are missing altogether, making form filling a challenge for blind users. Algorithms for associating a form element with one of several candidate labels in its vicinity must cope with the variability of the element's features including label's location relative to the element, distance to the element, etc. Probabilistic models provide a natural machinery to reason with such uncertainties. In this paper we present a Finite Mixture Model (FMM) formulation of the label association problem. The variability of feature values are captured in the FMM by a mixture of random variables that are drawn from parameterized distributions. Then, the most likely label to be paired with a form element is computed by maximizing the log-likelihood of the feature data using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We also adapt the FMM approach for two related problems: assigning labels (from an external Knowledge Base) to form elements that have no candidate labels in their vicinity and for quickly identifying clickable elements such as add-to-cart, checkout, etc., used in online transactions even when these elements do not have textual captions (e.g., image buttons w/o alternative text). We provide a quantitative evaluation of our techniques, as well as a user study with two blind subjects who used an aural web browser implementing our approach.
