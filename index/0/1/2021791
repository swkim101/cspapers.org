An information display system is described which uses eye-tracking to monitor user looking about its graphics screen. The system analyzes the user's patterns of eye movements and fixations in real-time to make inferences about what item or collection of items shown holds most relative interest for the user. Material thus identified is zoomed-in for a closer look, and described in more detail via synthesized speech.
