E ective retrieval in a distributed environment is an important but di cult problem. Lack of e ectiveness appears to have three causes. First, collection selection based on word histograms is not appropriate for heterogeneous collections. Second, relevant documents are scattered over many collections and searching a few collections misses many relevant documents. Third, most existing collection selection metrics lack sound theoretical justi cations and hence may not be well tuned to the problem. We propose a new approach to distributed retrieval based on document clustering and language modeling. Document clustering is used to organize collections around topics. Language modeling is used to properly represent topics and e ectively select the right topics for a query. Based on these ideas, three methods are proposed to suit di erent environments. We show that all three methods improve e ectiveness of distributed retrieval.
