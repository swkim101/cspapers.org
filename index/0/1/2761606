We present a novel system to support active reading. Utilizing a mobile device the user can add digital annotations to physical documents like papers and posters. We present first prototype implementations of the mobile phone interface with and without server support. Server support let's you share annotations with your friends. We discuss findings from an initial user evaluation and present an improved prototype. We believe annotating paper using document image retrieval is a promising technology for active reading support.
