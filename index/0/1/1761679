We present an updated report on the NYU Ultracomputer design emphasizing recent results on programming, operating systems, caching, demand paging, and I/O. The user's view of the Ultracomputer is presented along with the hardware and software implementation. Freedom from serial bottlenecks in both hardware and software allows the Ultracomputer to obtain performance that scales nearly linearly in the size of the machine for a broad spectrum of problems.
