Due to spatial diversity, RF signals derived from a FM broadcast station differ when they arrive at the receivers placed in various locations. Also, the FM signals will be altered by the change of ambient environment. Previous works focuse either the FM-based localization or activity recognition. In this study, we propose to simultaneously classify and localize activities conducted in proximity of an FM receiver. We conducted experiments and demonstrated that the location and activities of an individual can be distinguishable with a reasonable overall accuracy in a typical indoor environment from FM broadcast signals.
