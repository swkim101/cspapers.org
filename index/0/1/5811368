We study the operational characteristics of the DNS infrastructure: transitive-trust, coresidence and servers placement. We discuss how these factors impact resilience, stability and security of the DNS services. As our study indicates, common configuration choices, that domain operators make, result in a fragile DNS infrastructure, susceptible to malicious attacks and benign failures. We provide recommendations for improving robustness of DNS.
