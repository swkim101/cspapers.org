This demonstration presents a novel software defined platform for achieving collaborative and energy-aware WiFi offloading. The platform consists of an extensible central controller, programmable offloading agents, and offloading extensions on mobile devices. Driven by our extensive measurements of energy consumption on smartphones, we propose an effective energy-aware offloading algorithm and integrate it to our platform. By enabling collaboration between wireless networks and mobile users, our solution can make optimal offloading decisions that improve offloading efficiency for network operators and achieve energy saving for mobile users. To enhance deployability, we have released our platform under open-source licenses on GitHub.
