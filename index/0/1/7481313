This paper presents our attempt in designing intuitive and interesting materials for teaching NURBS in an undergraduate course with the help of our tool DesignMentor. This approach does not require tedious mathematics and is based on learning-by-doing and visualization. Our approach was classroom tested and used world-wide in the last seven years.
