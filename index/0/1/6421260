The paper presents the work of the Elena project. The contribution of this paper is twofold: The first part of the paper elaborates on the notion of educational services. Educational services are differentiated from learning objects and put in context of web services. A model for educational services is introduced and current limitations of metadata standards are addressed. In the second part of the paper a mediation infrastructure for educational services, so called smart learning space, is sketched. The architecture of smart learning spaces is based on P2P and semantic web technologies.
