Computer simulation methods enable the architech to accurately analyze the performance of specified elevator systems, thus facilitating more careful evaluation of alternative system designs than previously achievable. Simulation improves analysis because it involves replication of real-time elevator performance and does not rely on the rules of thumb and statistical assumptions incorporated into traditional analytical methods. The development of a computer simulation program for elevators requires caution to ascertain that the assumptions incorporated into the program are satisfactory and that the resulting program performs reliably and accurately. An acceptable simulation program, such as the one presented in this paper, facilitates a variety of research efforts encompassing sky lobby and express car layout strategies, dynamic peak control procedures, and cost/benefit studies of system design goals.
