A system for private stream searching allows a client to retrieve documents matching some search criteria from a remote server while the server evaluating the request remains provably oblivious to the search criteria.

We demonstrate the practical applicability of the scheme by considering its performance in the demanding scenario of providing a privacy preserving version of the Google News Alerts service
