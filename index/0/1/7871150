In this paper, we exploit non-local features as an estimate of long-distance dependencies to improve performance on the statistical spoken language understanding (SLU) problem. The statistical natural language parsers trained on text perform unreliably to encode non-local information on spoken language. An alternative method we propose is to use trigger pairs that are automatically extracted by a feature induction algorithm. We describe a light version of the inducer in which a simple modification is efficient and successful. We evaluate our method on an SLU task and show an error reduction of up to 27% over the base local model.
