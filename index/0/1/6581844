Online folksonomies are modeled as tripartite hypergraphs, and detecting communities from such networks is a challenging and well-studied problem. However, almost every existing algorithm known to us for community detection in hypergraphs assign unique communities to nodes, whereas in reality, nodes in folksonomies belong to multiple overlapping communities e.g. users have multiple topical interests, and the same resource is often tagged with semantically different tags. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to detect overlapping communities in folksonomies by customizing a recently proposed edge-clustering algorithm (that is originally for traditional graphs) for use on hypergraphs.
