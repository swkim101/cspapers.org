This paper presents the main ideas behind the language LSL. The purpose of LSL is to provide a compromise between different data base approaches and attitudes. The hierarchical, network and relational models of data can coexist within the LSL environment. LSL is being implemented on a PDP-11/45 running the UNIX operating system. It will be interfaced both to a host language and a conversational graphical facility.
