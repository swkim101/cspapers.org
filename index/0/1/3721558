This paper addresses the problem of path following for a biomimetic underwater vehicle (BUV) propelled by undulatory fins with uncertain model and unknown disturbance. The mechanical structure of the BUV is briefly described. Moreover, the general kinematics and dynamics models of the vehicle are presented and the path following problem is formulated. The controller combining line-of-sight (LOS) guidance system with active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) technique is designed to maneuver the BUV to follow a predefined parameterized curve. Specifically, a guidance system based on LOS principle is implemented to decouple the multi-variable system to steer the surge speed and the course respectively. Furthermore, in order to deal with model uncertainty, ADRC is used in development of the surge speed controller and the course controller. Finally, simulations and experimental results validated the performance of the proposed path following control scheme.
