In this paper, a distributed approach for the estimation of kinematic and inertial parameters of an unknown rigid body is presented. The body is manipulated by a pool of ground mobile manipulators. Each robot retrieves a noisy measurement of its velocity and the contact forces applied to the body. Kinematics and dynamics arguments are used to distributively estimate the relative positions of the contact points. Subsequently, distributed estimation filters and nonlinear observers are used to estimate the body mass, the relative position between its geometric center and its center of mass, and its moment of inertia. The manipulation strategy is functional to the estimation process, and is suitably designed to satisfy nonlinear observability conditions that are necessary for the success of the estimation. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings.
