System state restoration after detection of an error is discussed for producer-consumer systems, with emphasis on the control of the domino effect. Recovery primitives MARK, RESTORE, and PURGE are proposed that, in conjunction with the use of SEND-RECEIVE interprocess communication primitives, allow bounds to be placed on the amount of unnecessary restoration that can occur as a result of system state restoration.
