Foun&tion sponsored a week long workshop at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on teaching computer ethicsl. These workshops were led by Deborah Johnson, a philosopher at Rensselaer, and Keith Miller, a computer scientist at Sangamon University. The goal of the workshop was to educate undergraduate computer science teachers in some of the relevant ethical issues in computer science and to train them in how to teach these issues to their students. Twenty-five computer scientists, philosophers and sociat scientists from undergraduate institutions attended the first summer and twenty-six attended the second. Eighteen of the first group met again in the summer of 1995 to assess and discuss their experiences. As members of the first group of educators, we would like to report on which activities were particularly successful, which ones were not Before students can start discussing ethical issues that arise in computer science, such as privacy, intellectual property rights, reliability and responsibility, it is imperative that they be given an understanding of the fundamentals of the major ethical theories. Most computer ethics texts [8] [10] [12] offer brief descriptions of utilitarianism, relativism, and Kantâ€™s deontological theory. These are illustrated by presenting varying solutions to a problem witbin a scenario as argued by a utilitarian, Kantian or relativist. It often helps to give outside readings on Mill and Kant, either as primary or secondary sources, to further explicate the theory behind the solutions. While philosophical readings can be complex, they can be clarified by classroom discussions and interactive activities.
