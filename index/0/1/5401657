We study probabilistic inference in large, layered Bayesian networks represented as directed acyclic graphs. We show that the intractability of exact inference in such networks does not preclude their effective use. We give algorithms for approximate probabilistic inference that exploit averaging phenomena occurring at nodes with large numbers of parents. We show that these algorithms compute rigorous lower and upper bounds on marginal probabilities of interest, prove that these bounds become exact in the limit of large networks, and provide rates of convergence.
