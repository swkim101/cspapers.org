In this paper, we illustrate how User Generated Mobile Location Data (UGMLD) like Foursquare check-ins can be used in Trade Area Analysis (TAA) by introducing a new framework and corresponding analytic methods. Three key processes were created: identifying the activity center of a mobile user, profiling users based on their location history, and modeling users' preference probability. Extensions to traditional TAA are introduced, including customer-centric distance decay analysis and check-in sequence analysis. Adopting the rich content and context of UGMLD, these methods introduce new dimensions to modeling and delineating trade areas. Analyzing customers' visits to a business in the context of their daily life sheds new light on the nature and performance of the venue. This work has important business implications in the field of mobile computing.
