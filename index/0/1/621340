In this paper, we consider the computation of the D-optimality criterion as a metric for the uncertainty of a SLAM system. Properties regarding the use of this uncertainty criterion in the active SLAM context are highlighted, and comparisons against the A-optimality criterion and entropy are presented. This paper shows that contrary to what has been previously reported, the D-optimality criterion is indeed capable of giving fruitful information as a metric for the uncertainty of a robot performing SLAM. Finally, through various experiments with simulated and real robots, we support our claims and show that the use of D-opt has desirable effects in various SLAM related tasks such as active mapping and exploration.
