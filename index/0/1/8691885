We describe our experiments using the DeSR parser in the multilingual and domain adaptation tracks of the CoNLL 2007 shared task. DeSR implements an incremental deterministic Shift/Reduce parsing algorithm, using specific rules to handle non-projective dependencies. For the multilingual track we adopted a second order averaged perceptron and performed feature selection to tune a feature model for each language. For the domain adaptation track we applied a tree revision method which learns how to correct the mistakes made by the base parser on the adaptation domain.
