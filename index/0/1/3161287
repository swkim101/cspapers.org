We present a framework for quadrupedal locomotion over highly challenging terrain where the choice of appropriate footholds is crucial for the success of the behaviour. We use a path planning approach which shares many similarities with the results of the DARPA Learning Locomotion challenge and extend it to allow more flexibility and increased robustness. During execution we incorporate an on-line force-based foothold adaptation mechanism that updates the planned motion according to the perceived state of the environment. This way we exploit the active compliance of our system to smoothly interact with the environment, even when this is inaccurately perceived or dynamically changing, and update the planned path on-the-fly. In tandem we use a virtual model controller that provides the feed-forward torques that allow increased accuracy together with highly compliant behaviour on an otherwise naturally very stiff robotic system. We leverage the full set of benefits that a high performance torque controlled quadruped robot can provide and demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of our approach on a set of experimental trials of increasing difficulty.
