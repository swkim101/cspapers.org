Wo show simple constantround interactive proof systems for pcoblcms capturing the appcoximabiity, to within a factor of &, of optimization problems in integer lattices; specifically, the closest vector problem (CVP), and the shortest vector pcoblom @VP), These interactive proofs are for the “coNP direction”; that is, we give an interactive protocol showing that a vector is “far” from the lattice (for CVP), and an interactive protocol showing that the shortest-lattice-vector la Ulong” (for SVP). Furthermore, these interactive proof systems ace Honest-Verifier Perfect Zero-Knowledge. We conclude that approximating CVP (resp., SVP) within a factor of fi is in NP n codM. Thus, it seems unlikely that approximating these problems to within a fi factor is NP-hard, Pccviously, for the CVP (resp., SVP) problem, La&arias et, ol,, H&tad and Banaszczyk showed that the gap problem corresponding to approximating CVP (resp., SVP) within n is in NP n con/p. On the other hand, Arora et. al. showed that the gap problem corresponding to approximating CVP within 2’0so*ooo n is quasi-NP-hard.
