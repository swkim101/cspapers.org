The two-processor scheduling problem is perhaps the most basic problem in scheduling theory, and several efficient algorithms have been discovered for it. However, these algorithms are inherently sequential in nature. We give a fast parallel (R-NC) algorithm for this problem. Interestingly enough, our algorithm for this purely combinatoric-looking problem draws on some powerful algebraic methods.
