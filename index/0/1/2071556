A large-scale interoperable database system operating in a dynamic environment should provide uniform access user interface to its components, scalability to larger networks, evolution of database schema and applications, composability of client and server components, and preserve component autonomv. To address the research issues rxesented by such systems, we introduce the Distributed I;teroperable Object Model (DIOM). DIOMâ€™S main features include the explicit representation of and access to semantics in data sources through the D1OM base interfaces, the use of interface abstraction mechanisms such as import, specialization, generalization, and aggregation.
