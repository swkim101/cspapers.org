This research demonstration presents the tool, Dynamic Interactive Views for Reverse Engineering (Diver). Diver supports software understanding through a trace focused user interface. The trace focused user interface is a method of re-organizing the user interface of integrated development environments so that developers can focus their attention on artifacts related to the run-time behaviour of the software that they are investigating. The tool combines concepts from research in software visualization, dynamic analysis, software reconnaissance, and task focused user interfaces.
