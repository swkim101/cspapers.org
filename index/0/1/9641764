We propose an object clique potential for semantic segmentation. Our object clique potential addresses the misclassified object-part issues arising in solutions based on fully-convolutional networks. Our object clique set, compared to that yielded from segment-proposal-based approaches, is with a significantly smaller size, making our method consume notably less computation. Regarding system design and model formation, our object clique potential can be regarded as a functional complement to local-appearance-based CRF models and works in synergy with these effective approaches for further performance improvement. Extensive experiments verify our method.
