Patch-based low-rank models have shown effective in exploiting spatial redundancy of natural images especially for the application of image denoising. However, two-dimensional low-rank model can not fully exploit the spatio-temporal correlation in larger data sets such as multispectral images and 3D MRIs. In this work, we propose a novel low-rank tensor approximation framework with Laplacian Scale Mixture (LSM) modeling for multi-frame image denoising. First, similar 3D patches are grouped to form a tensor of d-order and high-order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) is applied to the grouped tensor. Then the task of multiframe image denoising is formulated as a Maximum A Posterior (MAP) estimation problem with the LSM prior for tensor coefficients. Both unknown sparse coefficients and hidden LSM parameters can be efficiently estimated by the method of alternating optimization. Specifically, we have derived closed-form solutions for both subproblems. Experimental results on spectral and dynamic MRI images show that the proposed algorithm can better preserve the sharpness of important image structures and outperform several existing state-of-the-art multiframe denoising methods (e.g., BM4D and tensor dictionary learning).
