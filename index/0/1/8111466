Management of todayâ€™s IT is a challenging task that requires a profound understanding of both the IT landscape and the relevant business context. Numerous relations and dependencies between business and IT exist, which have to be accounted for, e.g., for better IT/business alignment. This paper presents ITML (IT domain specific Modeling Language) integrated with a comprehensive method for enterprise modeling. The language advantages are illustrated in terms of support for profound analyses, development of sophisticated IT Management tools (build-time), and use of corresponding models at run-time, e.g., as part of IT Dashboards.
