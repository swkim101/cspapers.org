We describe some challenges of adaptation in the 2007 CoNLL Shared Task on Domain Adaptation. Our error analysis for this task suggests that a primary source of error is differences in annotation guidelines between treebanks. Our suspicions are supported by the observation that no team was able to improve target domain performance substantially over a state of the art baseline.
