Person re-identification is an open and challenging problem in computer vision. Existing re-identification approaches focus on optimal methods for features matching (e.g., metric learning approaches) or study the inter-camera transformations of such features. These methods hardly ever pay attention to the problem of visual ambiguities shared between the first ranks. In this paper, we focus on such a problem and introduce an unsupervised ranking optimization approach based on discriminant context information analysis. The proposed approach refines a given initial ranking by removing the visual ambiguities common to first ranks. This is achieved by analyzing their content and context information. Extensive experiments on three publicly available benchmark datasets and different baseline methods have been conducted. Results demonstrate a remarkable improvement in the first positions of the ranking. Regardless of the selected dataset, state-of-the-art methods are strongly outperformed by our method.
