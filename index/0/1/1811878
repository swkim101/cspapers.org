A smartphoneâ€™s display is one of its most energy consuming components. Modern smartphones use OLED displays that consume more energy when displaying light colors as op- posed to dark colors. This is problematic as many popular mobile web applications use large light colored backgrounds. To address this problem we developed an approach for auto- matically rewriting web applications so that they generate more energy efficient web pages. Our approach is based on program analysis of the structure of the web application im- plementation. In the evaluation of our approach we show that it can achieve a 40% reduction in display power con- sumption. A user study indicates that the transformed web pages are acceptable to users with over 60% choosing to use the transformed pages for normal usage.
