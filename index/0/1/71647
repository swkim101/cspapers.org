With the growth of the World Wide Web, a large amount of music data is available on the Internet. In addition to searching expected music objects for users, it becomes necessary to develop a recommendation service. In this paper, we design the Music Recommendation System (MRS) to provide a personalized service of music recommendation. The music objects of MIDI format are first analyzed. For each polyphonic music object, the representative track is first determined, and then six features are extracted from this track. According to the features, the music objects are properly grouped. For users, the access histories are analyzed to derive user interests. The content-based, collaborative and statistics-based recommendation methods are proposed, which are based on the favorite degrees of the users to the music groups. A series of experiments are carried out to show that our approach is feasible.
