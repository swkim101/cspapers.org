The paper presents a rule-based information extraction (IE) system for Polish medical texts. We select the most important information from diabetic patients' records. Most data being processed are free-form texts, only a part is in table form. The work has three goals: to test classical IE methods on texts in Polish, to create relational database containing the extracted data, and to prepare annotated data for further IE experiments.
