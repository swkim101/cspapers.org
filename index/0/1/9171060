In many applications, such as metropolitan area, campus, and local area networks, multicomputer interconnection networks, and the interconnection of cabinets, shelves, and boards, optical interconnection is increasingly favored over electrical. Recently, ShuffleNet multihop lightwave networks were proposed as a way to tap the vast bandwidth potential of optical fiber for multiuser packet communications. We consider the use of ShuffleNet multihop networks for optical interconnection, and study their implementation in ring topologies with each node connected to several other nodes of the ring (i.e., multi-connected ring topologies). To minimize fiber cabling congestion, the design procedure uses a new representation of the ShuffleNet connectivity graph and a generalization of Gray code patterns. As an example, only six fibers (without wavelength-division multiplexing) are required to interconnect 24 Network Interface Units (NIUs), providing a total network throughput of 1.47 Gb/s for an optical transmission rate of 100 Mb/s. The design also provides for easy, modular growth of multi-connected rings.
