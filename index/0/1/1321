In this paper we analyze two question answering tasks: the TREC-8 question answering task and a set of reading comprehension exams. First, we show that Q/A systems perform better when there are multiple answer opportunities per question. Next, we analyze common approaches to two subproblems: term overlap for answer sentence identification, and answer typing for short answer extraction. We present general tools for analyzing the strengths and limitations of techniques for these sub-problems. Our results quantify the limitations of both term overlap and answer typing to distinguish between competing answer candidates.
