We present a polynomial time algorithm for the 3-Compatible colouring problem, where we are given a complete graph with each edge assigned one of 3 possible colours and we want to assign one of those 3 colours to each vertex in such a way that no edge has the same colour as both of its endpoints. Consequently we complete the proof of a dichotomy for the k-Compatible Colouring problem.
 The tractability of the 3-Compatible colouring problem has been open for several years and the best known algorithm prior to this paper is due to Feder et al. [SODA'05] --- a quasipolynomial algorithm with a nO(logn/log log n) time complexity.
 Furthermore our result implies a polynomial algorithm for the Stubborn problem which enables us to finish the classification of all List Matrix Partition variants for matrices of size at most four over subsets of {0, 1} started by Cameron et al. [SODA'04].
