In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed load shedding optimization for disaster recovery in smart grids. We develop distributed second-order interior-point based load shedding algorithms that enjoy a fast quadratic convergence rate. Our main contributions are two-fold: (i) We propose a rooted spanning tree based reformulation that enables our distributed algorithm design; (ii) Based on the spanning tree reformulation, we design distributed computation schemes for our proposed second-order interior-point based load shedding. Collectively, these results serve as an important first step in load shedding and disaster recovery that uses second-order distributed techniques.
