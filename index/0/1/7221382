Many institutions offer either a Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Arts degree program to computer science majors, often depending on what type of college or department houses the major. However, an increasing number of institutions have created dual degree tracks wherein students may choose to pursue either a BS or a BA, with a different set of requirements for each and possibly different credentialing as well. This BOF provides a forum for educators and administrators who currently offer dual degree options to share their experiences with those who are considering adding a second track. Issues of interest such as requirements within and outside the major, enrollment, accreditation, student outcomes, and possibly different career options may be discussed.
