Realizing the full potential of a multi-radio mesh network involves two main challenges: how to assign channels to radios at each node to minimize interference and how to choose high throughput routing paths in the face of lossy links, variable channel conditions and external load. This paper presents ROMA, a practical, distributed channel assignment and routing protocol that achieves good multi-hop path performance between every node and one or more designated gateway nodes in a dual-radio network. ROMA assigns non-overlapping channels to links along each gateway path to eliminate intra-path interference. ROMA reduces inter-path interference by assigning different channels to paths destined for different gateways whenever possible. Evaluations on a 24-node dual-radio testbed show that ROMA achieves high throughput in a variety of scenarios.
