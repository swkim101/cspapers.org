The computing industry is currently facing a major architectural shift. Extra computing power is not coming anymore from higher processor frequencies, but from a growing number of computing cores and processors. For AI, and constraint solving in particular, this raises the question of how to scale current solving techniques to massively parallel architectures. 
 
While prior work focusses mostly on small scale parallel constraint solving, we conduct the first study on scalability of constraint solving on 100 processors and beyond in this paper. We propose techniques that are simple to apply and show empirically that they scale surprisingly well. These techniques establish a performance baseline for parallel constraint solving technologies against which more sophisticated parallel algorithms need to compete in the future.
