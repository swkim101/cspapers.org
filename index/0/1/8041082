Security kernels are now emerging from the R&D community. Unfortunately the quality of these systems has not lived up to original expectations. While useful for allowing users of various security levels to share common hardware, the original problem that they were designed to solve, security kernels are less than ideal for solving applications that are truly multi-level, the problem that now needs to be addressed. Based upon experience gained in both the use and limitations of security kernels, recommendations are provided as to where the next thrust for providing secure systems should proceed.
