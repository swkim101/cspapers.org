Sudden variations in current (large di/dt) can lead to significant power supply voltage droops and timing errors in modern microprocessors. Several papers discuss the complexity involved with developing test programs, also known as stress marks, to stress the system. Authors of these papers produced tools and methodologies to generate stress marks automatically using techniques such as integer linear programming or genetic algorithms. However, nearly all of the previous work took place in the context of single-core systems, and results were collected and analyzed using cycle-level simulators. In this paper, we measure and analyze di/dt issues on state-of-the-art multi-core x86 systems using real hardware rather than simulators. We build on an existing single-core stress mark generation tool to develop an Automated DI/dT stress mark generation framework, referred to as AUDIT, to generate di/dt stress marks quickly and effectively for multicore systems. We showcase AUDIT's capabilities to adjust to micro architectural and architectural changes. We also present a dithering algorithm to address thread alignment issues on multi-core processors. We compare standard benchmarks, existing di/dt stress marks, and AUDIT-generated stress marks executing on multi-threaded, multi-core systems with complex out-of-order pipelines. Finally, we show how stress analysis using simulators may lead to flawed insights about di/dt issues.
