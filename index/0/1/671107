Gathering accurate training data for recognizing a set of attributes or tags on images or videos is a challenge. Obtaining labels via manual effort or from weakly-supervised data typically results in noisy training labels. We develop the FlipSVM, a novel algorithm for handling these noisy, structured labels. The FlipSVM models label noise by "flipping" labels on training examples. We show empirically that the FlipSVM is effective on images-and-attributes and video tagging datasets.
