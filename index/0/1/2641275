A high quality hierarchical organization of the concepts in a dataset at different levels of granularity has many valuable applications such as search, summarization, and content browsing. In this paper we propose an algorithm for recursively constructing a hierarchy of topics from a collection of content-representative documents. We characterize each topic in the hierarchy by an integrated ranked list of mixed-length phrases. Our mining framework is based on a phrase-centric view for clustering, extracting, and ranking topical phrases. Experiments with datasets from three different domains illustrate our ability to generate hierarchies of high quality topics represented by meaningful phrases.
