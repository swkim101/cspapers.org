A new software reliability model is developed that predicts expected failures (and hence related reliability quantities) as well or better than existing software reliability models, and is simpler than any of the models that approach it in predictive validity. The model incorporates both execution time and calendar time components, each of which is derived. The model is evaluated, using actual data, and compared with other models.
