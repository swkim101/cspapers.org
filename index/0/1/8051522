Finding the sparsest, or minimuml0-norm, representation of a signal given an overcomplete dictionary of basis vectors is an impo rtant problem in many application domains. Unfortunately, the requir ed optimization problem is often intractable because there is a combina torial increase in the number of local minima as the number of candidate basis vectors increases. This deficiency has prompted most researchers to instead minimize surrogate measures, such as the l1-norm, that lead to more tractable computational methods. The downside of this procedure is th at we have now introduced a mismatch between our ultimate goal and our o bjective function. In this paper, we demonstrate a sparse Bayesian le ar ing-based method of minimizing thel0-norm while reducing the number of troublesome local minima. Moreover, we derive necessary condit i s for local minima to occur via this approach and empirically demo nstrate that there are typically many fewer for general problems of inter est.
