In this paper, we consider the design of a system in which Internet-connected mobile users contribute sensor data as training samples, and collaborate on building a model for classification tasks such as activity or context recognition. Constructing the model can naturally be performed by a service running in the cloud, but users may be more inclined to contribute training samples if the privacy of these data could be ensured. Thus, in this paper, we focus on privacy-preserving collaborative learning for the mobile setting, which addresses several competing challenges not previously considered in the literature: supporting complex classification methods like support vector machines, respecting mobile computing and communication constraints, and enabling user-determined privacy levels. Our approach, Pickle, ensures classification accuracy even in the presence of significantly perturbed training samples, is robust to methods that attempt to infer the original data or poison the model, and imposes minimal costs. We validate these claims using a user study, many real-world datasets and two different implementations of Pickle.
