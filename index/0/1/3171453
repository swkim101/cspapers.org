We are developing a teaching package that can be used in a college course that would fill a gap among current science majors and teach senior-level undergraduate students theory and practice of real-time operating systems, including their requirements, characteristics, internals, and specification. This course has two components: (1) a theoretical part, and (2) a practical hands-on implementation component achieved with DORITOS (Distributed Object-Based Real-time InsTructional Operating System) as the implementation environment. DORITOS' design is based on UC-Berkeley's NACHOS. The DORITOS package will be distributed with DKaffe (a modified version of Kaffe JVM) and a basic system which allows students to run simple threads.In this paper, we focus on the practical, hands-on system that allows students to learn the internals of a Real-time Operating Systems (RTOS). Throughout the term, assignments require students to use and modify DORITOS to implement real-time elements as well as to analyze the performance of implemented algorithms.
