The pace of technology for use in computing education is staggering. In the last five years, the following tools / websites have completely transformed our teaching: Piazza, Google Docs, PandaGrader, YouTube, Doodle and whenisgood.net, Skype and Google Hangout, and Khan Academy among others. Hardware has also played a part -- we love our Zoom H2 digital voice recorder (for recording CD-quality lecture audio), Blue Yeti USB mike (for audio/videoconferences), and iClickers (for engaging students in class). Do you wish you could easily share your favorites? Want to find out what the others know that you don't? Have a tool you've built and want to get some users' Come to this BOF! We'll also show the TECH website we've built that attempts to collect all of these tools in one place.
