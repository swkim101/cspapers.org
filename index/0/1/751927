Fingerprinting schemes deter people from illegally redistributing digital data by enabling the original merchant of the data to identify the original buyer of a redistributed copy. So-called traitor-tracing schemes have the same goal for keys that can be used to decrypt information that is broadcast in encrypted form. Recently, asymmetric fingerprinting and traitor-tracing schemes were introduced. Here, only the buyer knows the fingerprinted copy after a sale, and if the merchant finds this copy somewhere, he obtains a proof that he found the copy of this particular buyer. First constructions showed the validity of the concept. However, essentially all these constructions use so-called memory-less symmetric schemes as building blocks, whereas the better ones among the known symmetric schemes are not memory-less in this sense. Consequently, the previous asymmetric constructions did not reach the same level of tolerance against collusions as symmetric schemes. We now show asymmetric constructions without this restriction.
