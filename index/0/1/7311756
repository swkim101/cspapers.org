Current online social networking (OSN) sites pose severe risks to their users' privacy. Facebook in particular is capturing more and more of a user's past activities, sometimes starting from the day of birth. Instead of transiently passing on information between friends, a user's data is stored persistently and therefore subject to the risk of undesired disclosure. Traditionally, a regular user of a social network has little awareness of her privacy needs in the Web or is not ready to invest a considerable effort in securing her online activities. Furthermore, the centralised nature of proprietary social networking platforms simply does not cater for end-to-end privacy protection mechanisms. In this paper, we present a non-disruptive and lightweight integration of a confidentiality mechanism into OSNs. Additionally, direct integration of visual security indicators into the OSN UI raise the awareness for (un)protected content and thus their own privacy. We present a fully-working prototype for Facebook and an initial usability study, showing that, on average, untrained users can be ready to use the service in three minutes.
