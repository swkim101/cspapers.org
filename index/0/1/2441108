This paper discusses similarities and differences in autonomous helicopters developed at USC and CSIRO. The most significant differences are in the accuracy and sample rate of the sensor systems used for control. The USC vehicle, like a number of others, makes use of a sensor suite that costs an order of magnitude more than the vehicle. The CSIRO system, by contrast, utilizes low-cost inertial, magnetic, vision and GPS to achieve the same ends. We describe the architecture of both autonomous helicopters, discuss the design issues and present comparative results.
