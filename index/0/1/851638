This paper presents a rapid and robust parsing system currently used to learn from large bodies of unedited text. The system contains a multivalued part-of-speech disambiguator and a novel parser employing bottom-up recognition to find the constituent phrases of larger structures that might be too difficult to analyze. The results of applying the disambiguator and parser to large sections of the Lancaster/Oslo-Bergen corpus are presented.
