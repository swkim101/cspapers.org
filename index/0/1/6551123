With the increased abilities for automated data collection made possible by modern technology, the typical sizes of data collections have continued to grow in recent years. In such cases, it may be desirable to store the data in a reduced format in order to improve the storage, transfer time, and processing requirements on the data. One of the challenges of designing effective data compression techniques is to be able to preserve the ability to use the reduced format directly for a wide range of database and data mining applications. In this paper, we propose the novel idea of hierarchical subspace sampling in order to create a reduced representation of the data. The method is naturally able to estimate the local implicit dimensionalities of each point very effectively, and thereby create a variable dimensionality reduced representation of the data. Such a technique has the advantage that it is very adaptive about adjusting its representation depending upon the behavior of the immediate locality of a data point. An interesting property of the subspace sampling technique is that unlike all other data reduction techniques, the overall efficiency of compression improves with increasing database size. This is a highly desirable property for any data reduction system since the problem itself is motivated by the large size of data sets. Because of its sampling approach, the procedure is extremely fast and scales linearly both with data set size and dimensionality. Furthermore, the subspace sampling technique is able to reveal important local subspace characteristics of high dimensional data which can be harnessed for effective solutions to problems such as selectivity estimation and approximate nearest neighbor search.
