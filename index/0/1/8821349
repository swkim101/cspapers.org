Our original work on the Code Bubbles environment demonstrated that a working-set based framework for software development showed promise. We have spent the past several years extending the underlying concepts into a fully-functional system. In our demonstration, we will show the current Code Bubbles environment for Java, how it works, how it can be used, and why we prefer it over more traditional programming environments. We will also show how we have extended the framework to enhance software development tasks such as complex debugging, testing, and collaboration. This paper describes the features we will demonstrate.
