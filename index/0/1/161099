The well-known word analogy experiments show that the recent word vectors capture fine-grained linguistic regularities in words by linear vector offsets, but it is unclear how well the simple vector offsets can encode visual regularities over words. We study a particular image-word relevance relation in this paper. Our results show that the word vectors of relevant tags for a given image rank ahead of the irrelevant tags, along a principal direction in the word vector space. Inspired by this observation, we propose to solve image tagging by estimating the principal direction for an image. Particularly, we exploit linear mappings and nonlinear deep neural networks to approximate the principal direction from an input image. We arrive at a quite versatile tagging model. It runs fast given a test image, in constant time w.r.t. the training set size. It not only gives superior performance for the conventional tagging task on the NUSWIDE dataset, but also outperforms competitive baselines on annotating images with previously unseen tags.
