The rise of Twitter, blogs, review sites and social sites has motivated people to express their opinions publicly and more frequently than ever before. This has fueled the emerging field known as sentiment analysis whose goal is to translate the vagaries of human emotion into hard data. LivePulse is a tool that taps into the growing business interest in what is being said online with the particular characteristic of doing so in real-time. LivePulse integrates novel algorithms for sentiment analysis and a configurable dashboard with different kinds of dynamic charts that change as new data is ingested. It also provides support to drill down and visually explore the sentiment scores to understand how they were computed and what are the emotions expressed about a given aspect or topic. Our tool has been researched and prototyped at HP Labs in close interaction with internal and external customers whose valuable feedback has been crucial for improving the tool. This paper presents an overview of LivePulse's architecture and functionality, and illustrates how it would be demoed.
