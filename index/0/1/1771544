OntoSearch, a full-text search engine that exploits ontological knowledge for document retrieval, is presented in this paper. Different from other ontology based search engines, OntoSearch does not require a user to specify the associated concepts of his/her queries. Domain ontology in OntoSearch is in the form of a semantic network. Given a keyword based query, OntoSearch infers the related concepts through a spreading activation process in the domain ontology. To provide personalized information access, we further develop algorithms to learn and exploit user ontology model based on a customized view of the domain ontology. The proposed system has been applied to the domain of searching scientific publications in the ACM Digital Library. The experimental results support the efficacy of the OntoSearch system by using domain ontology and user ontology for enhanced search performance.
