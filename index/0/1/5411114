Due to the need for fast design cycles and low production cost, programmable targets like DSP processors are becoming increasingly popular. Design planning, detailed design as well as updating such designs requires mapping existing algorithms onto these targets. Instead of writing target-specific mappers, we propose using retargetable mappers. The technique reported in this paper is based on pattern matching. Binary code is generated as a result of this matching process. This paper describes the techniques of our mapper MSSV and identifies areas for improvements. As a result, it shows that efficient handling of alternative mappings is crucial for an acceptable performance.
