We propose a tele-operating system to achieve continuous operation such as nonstop traveling of lunar rover. In this system, the rover in the remote site synchronously moves with some constant delay from the rover in the local site. The real-time self-localizing vision system is used for position estimation of the rover and providing geographical information to an operator in the local site. By using the proposed system, the test-bed rover in the remote site can successfully run continuously without feeling influence of either time delay or bandwidth limitation of communication.
