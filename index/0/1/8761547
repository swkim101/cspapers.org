We describe a self-configuring neuromorphic chip that uses a model of activity-dependent axon remodeling to automatically wire topographic maps based solely on input correlations. Axons are guided by growth cones, which arc modeled in analog VLSI for the first time. Growth cones migrate up neurotropin gradients, which arc represented by charge diffusing in transistor channels. Virtual axons move by rerouting address-events. We refined an initially gross topographic projection by simulating retinal wave input.
