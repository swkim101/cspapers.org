This paper describes the architecture and performance of a massively parallel computer system for “Digital Signal Processing” called NOVI-II. The computer will have a peak arithmetic rate of 50 GFLOPS and 1.024 Gbyte of memory. NOVI-II is intended mainly for the video signal processing of high quality moving pictures, and for developing programs for a programmable video CODEC. NOVI-II adopts multicomputer-type architecture which allows the combination of more than 512 processing elements(PEs). In each PE, a Transputer(T800) is used as a CPU, along with a vector processor, 2MB external RAM and a Parallel Program Development Assistant (PDA) probe fabricated on two gate arrays. Its PDA system facilitates powerful debugging functions to observe all program states. Optical links and optical networks are introduced to provide stable and flexible communications between PEs. The expected performance of the system with a large grain scheduling technique for real-time video processing is also discussed.
