This paper presents a technique for using execution traces to mine parametric temporal specifications in the form of quantified event automata (QEA) - previously introduced as an expressive and efficient formalism for runtime verification. We consider a pattern-based mining approach that uses a pattern library to generate and check potential properties over given traces, and then combines successful patterns. By using predefined models to measure the tool's precision and recall we demonstrate that our approach can effectively and efficiently extract specifications in realistic scenarios.
