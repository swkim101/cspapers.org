This paper proposes a controller for the stable grasp of an arbitrary-shaped object on the horizontal plane by two robotic fingers with rigid hemispherical fingertips. The controller stabilizes the grasp with optimal force angles and desired finger shaping determined through the choice of a control constant without requiring the utilization of any contact information regarding contact locations and contact angles or any estimates of them. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller and show its clear advantages with respect to other known control schemes.
