In this paper we present a simple deterministic algorithm for testing whether a multivariate polynomial <i>f</i>(<i>x</i><inf>1</inf>, ..., <i>x<inf>n</inf></i>) is identically zero, in time polynomial in <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, log(<i>d</i> + 1) and <i>H</i>. Here <i>m</i> is the number of monomials in <i>f</i>, <i>d</i> is the maximum degree of a variable in <i>f</i> and 2<sup><i>H</i></sup> is the least upper bound on the magnitude of the largest coefficient in <i>f</i>. We assume that <i>f</i> has integer coefficients.The main feature of our algorithm is its conceptual simplicity. The proof uses Linnik's Theorem which is a deep fact about distribution of primes in an arithmetic progression.
