Abstract We present a new efficient channel routing algorithm in the knock-knee mode. Most investigations in the past were concerned only with the solution of the layout problem but especially if no or only few boundary points are free, the resulting layout contains a lot of wires making unnecessarily long detours. Our algorithm (I) routes every solvable channel routing problem; (2) uses minimum area; (3) runs in time linear in the size of the routing area; and (4) produces a layout with minimum total wire length if the channel is dense, i.e., all upper and lower boundary points are occupied by starting or ending wires. We also modify our algorithm in order to guarantee that every single wire has at most twice its minimum length.
