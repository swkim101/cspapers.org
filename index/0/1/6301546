Although multi-frame super resolution has been extensively studied in past decades, super resolving real-world video sequences still remains challenging. In existing systems, either the motion models are oversimplified, or important factors such as blur kernel and noise level are assumed to be known. Such models cannot deal with the scene and imaging conditions that vary from one sequence to another. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to adaptive video super resolution via simultaneously estimating underlying motion, blur kernel and noise level while reconstructing the original high-res frames. As a result, our system not only produces very promising super resolution results that outperform the state of the art, but also adapts to a variety of noise levels and blur kernels. Theoretical analysis of the relationship between blur kernel, noise level and frequency-wise reconstruction rate is also provided, consistent with our experimental results.
