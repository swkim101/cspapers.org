It is shown that for any fixed number of variables, the linear programming problems with <italic>n</italic> linear inequalities can be solved deterministically by <italic>n</italic> parallel processors in sub-logarithmic time. The parallel time bound is O((log log <italic>n</italic>)<supscrpt><italic>d</italic></supscrpt>) where <italic>d</italic> is the number of variables. In the one-dimensional case this bound is optimal.
