This paper gives an overview of the ongoing research in the Active Data Bases project at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. In this project we are specifying and building a system that helps a user in his search for useful and interesting information in large, complex information systems. The system is able to do this, because it learns from the interaction about the users and the data it contains. The indications of the users are expressed in terms of interests in the data, which serve as building blocks for user and data models. These models are then used to improve the search for interesting data.
