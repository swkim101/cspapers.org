Theorems in automated theorem proving are usually proved by logical formal proofs. However, there is a subset of problems which humans can prove in a different way by the use of geometric operations on diagrams, so called diagrammatic proofs. Insight is more clearly perceived in these than in the corres- ponding algebraic proofs: they capture an intuitive notion of truthfulness that humans find easy to see and understand. We are identifying and automating this diagrammatic reasoning on mathematical theor- ems. The user gives the system, called DIAMOND, a theorem and then interactively proves it by the use of geometric manipulations on the diagram. These oper- ations are the "inference steps" of the proof. DIA- MOND then automatically derives from these example proofs a generaJised proof. The constructive w-rule is used as a mathematical basis to capture the general- ity of inductive diagrammatic proofs. In this way, we explore the relation between diagrammatic and algeb- raic proofs.
