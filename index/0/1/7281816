We consider the problem of finding a stable matching of maximum size when both ties and unacceptable partners are allowed in preference lists. This problem is known to be APX-hard, and the current best known approximation algorithm achieves the approximation ratio 2-c 1/âˆšN, where c is some positive constant. In this paper, we give a 1.875-approximation algorithm, which is the first result on the approximation ratio better than two.
