As part of its commitment to developing a strong community of computer science educators, the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) supports the development of regional CSTA chapters. A CSTA chapter is a local branch of CSTA designed to facilitate discussion of local issues, to provide member services at the local level, and to promote CSTA membership on the national level [1]. With the recently announced APÂ® Computer Science Principles Course to Launch in Academic Year 2016--17, local CS communities are vital. This BOF will provide a platform for the discussion of CSTA chapter formation, CS education community building, and tools and techniques used to successfully host professional development for K-12 CS teachers.
