The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft (FhG) engages in applied research and development in the fields of science and engineering. Named after the well-known 19th century physicist, FhG is a non-profit organisation which finances its work by government and industry contracts on top of some 30% basic public funding. The objective of this model is to achieve a rapid transfer from research into industrial application. With the increasing success of this model, there are now 36 Fraunhofer Institutes with a staff of more than 6000, making it one of the largest research organisations in Europe. The institutes are located in a decentralised manner all over Germany, trying to make them particularly attractive for small and mediumsized companies which may have little research capacities of their own.
