We introduce a body-based identification system that leverages individual differences in body segment lengths and hand waving gesture patterns. The system identifies users based on a two-second hand waving gesture captured by a Microsoft Kinect. To evaluate our system, we collected 8640 gesture measurements from 75 participants through two lab studies and a field study. In the first lab study, we evaluated the feasibility of our concept and basic properties of features to narrow down the design space. In the second lab study, our system achieved a 1% equal error rate in user identification among seven registered users after two weeks following initial registration. We also found that our system was robust even when lower body segments could not be measured because of occlusions. In the field study, our system achieved 0.5 to 1.6% equal error rates, demonstrating that the system also works well in ecologically valid situations. Lastly, throughout the studies, our participants were positive about the system.
