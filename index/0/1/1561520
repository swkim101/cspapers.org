The increasing interest in Semantic Web technologies has led not only to a rapid growth of semantic data on the Web but also to an increasing number of backend applications relying on efficient query processing. Confronted with such a trend, existing centralized state-of-the-art systems for storing RDF and processing SPARQL queries are no longer sufficient. In this paper, we introduce Partout, a distributed engine for fast RDF processing in a cluster of machines. We propose an effective approach for fragmenting RDF data sets based on a query log and allocating the fragments to hosts in a cluster of machines. Furthermore, Partout's query optimizer produces efficient query execution plans for ad-hoc SPARQL queries.
