In this paper, we propose an efficient embedding for modeling higher-order (n-gram) phrases that projects the n-grams to low-dimensional latent semantic space, where a classification function can be defined. We utilize a deep neural network to build a unified discriminative framework that allows for estimating the parameters of the latent space as well as the classification function with a bias for the target classification task at hand. We apply the framework to large-scale sentimental classification task. We present comparative evaluation of the proposed method on two (large) benchmark data sets for online product reviews. The proposed method achieves superior performance in comparison to the state of the art.
