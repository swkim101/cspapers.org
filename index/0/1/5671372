In software design it is highly desirable to be able to deal with the structures of both the algorithm and the record of execution. A design methodology called SARA is being developed at UCLA. SARA's models are able to deal with the record of execution structure. This paper proposes the addition of a Module Interconnection Language to enable SARA to deal with the algorithm structure. An example illustrates how this combination can assist in the software design process.
