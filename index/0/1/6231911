We describe an interllngua-based methodology for translating encoded knowledge and present a formalism for declaratively specifying vocabulary translations within a predicate logic interlingua. In this paper we (1) use the formalism to provide a semantics for translation, (2) show that the formalism enables translation to be done as deduction by a standard theorem prover, (3) describe a proof technique for determining whether a given set of rules for translating from one vocabulary to another is sufficient for performing that translation for any theory, and (4) describe techniques for precompiling translation rules that translate directly between two given vocabularies.
