With the rapid growth in mobile and wireless technologies and the availability, pervasiveness and cost effectiveness of wireless networks, mobile computers are quickly becoming the normal front-end devices for accessing enterprise data. In this paper, we are addressing the issue of efficient delivery of business decision support data in the form of summary tables to mobile clients equipped with OLAP front-end tools. Towards this, we propose a new on-demand scheduling algorithm, called SBS, that exploits both the derivation semantics among OLAP summary tables and the mobile clients' capabilities of executing simple SQL queries. It maximizes the aggregated data sharing between clients and reduces the broadcast length compared to the already existing techniques. The degree of aggregation can be tuned to control the tradeoff between access time and energy consumption. Further, the proposed scheme adapts well to different request rates, access patterns and data distributions. The algorithm effectiveness with respect to access time and power consumption is evaluated using simulation.
