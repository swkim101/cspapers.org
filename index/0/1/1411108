Previous research in novelty detection has focused on the task of finding novel material, given a set or stream of documents on a certain topic. This study investigates the more difficult two-part task defined by the TREC 2002 novelty track: given a topic and a group of documents relevant to that topic, 1) find the relevant sentences from the documents, and 2) find the novel sentences from the collection of relevant sentences. Our research shows that the former step appears to be the more difficult part of this task, and that the performance of novelty measures is very sensitive to the presence of non-relevant sentences.
