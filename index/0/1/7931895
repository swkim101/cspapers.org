Parsing@SLE is a workshop on parsing programming languages, now in its third edition, and collocated with SLE and SPLASH 2015. It is held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA on October 25h 2015. The goal is to bring together today's experts in the field of parsing, in order to hear about ongoing research, explore open questions and possibly forge new collaborations. Parsing@SLE 2015 will have an invited talk and eight regular talks. We expect to attract participants that have been or are developing theory, techniques and tools in the broad area of parsing non-natural languages such as programming languages.
