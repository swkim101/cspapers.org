In order to satisfy the Chinese enterprisesâ€™ demand for the import of hi-tech equipment and reduction of costs during the import process, we need to construct an electronic alliance import platform for hi-tech equipment. This article attempts to apply the advantages of a large-scale electronic purchase platform for hi-tech equipment through the implementation of an "online reverse auction" and an "enterprise group purchase" system by creating an electronic alliance import platform for hi-tech equipment whereby suppliers bid for contracts via the Internet. By analyzing the performance of the electronic alliance import platform, we have reached the conclusion that the implementation of the electronic alliance import platform can optimize the benefits of both, the importers as well as the suppliers. The implementation of an electronic alliance import platform has its advantages as well as risks, thus, we need to assess and analyze the possible ways to prevent and minimize risks during the implementation process.
