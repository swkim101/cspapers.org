This paper addresses the problem of computing the area complexity of a multi-output combinational logic circuit, given only its functional description, i.e., Boolean equations, where area complexity is measured in terms of the number of gates required for an optimal multilevel implementation of the combinational logic. The proposed area model is based on transforming the given, multi-output Boolean function description into an equivalent single-output function. The model, is empirical, and results demonstrating its feasibility and utility are presented. Also, a methodology for converting the gate count estimates, obtained from the area model, into capacitance estimates is presented. High-level power estimates based on the total capacitance estimates and average activity estimates are also presented.
