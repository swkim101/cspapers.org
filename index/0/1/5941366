This demonstration illustrates how a comprehensive database reconciliation tool can provide the ability to characterize data-quality and data-reconciliation issues in complex real-world applications. Telcordiaâ€™s data reconciliation and data quality analysis tool includes rapid generation of appropriate pre-processing and matching rules applied to a training set created from samples of the data. Once tuned, the appropriate rules can be applied efficiently to the complete data sets. The tool uses a modular Java-based architecture that allows for customized matching functions and iterative runs that build upon previously learned information. It has been applied to several real database reconciliation problems. Telcordia has been able to provide significant insights to clients who recognize that they have data reconciliation problems but cannot determine root causes effectively using currently available off-the-shelf tools. A description of the analysis of a duplicate-record problem in a set of taxpayer databases is included in this report to illustrate the effective use of the tool.
