The 8th SafeConfig Workshop is held in Denver, Colorado USA on October 12, 2015 and being run with the conjunction of the 22nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). The title of this year's SafeConfig is "Automated Decision Making for Cyber Security". Today, the use of cyber technology is evolving rapidly. The computing and networking is everywhere, public to private organizations, large enterprises to individuals, and data centers to smart phones and Internet-of-Things. The highly growing use of the Internet also leads to newly evolving security threats. The automated decision making should be able to determine the security and resiliency of networked information systems and services. The integration of security requirements, capabilities, and deployment constraints in a unified framework will enable intelligent response, automated defense, and network resiliency.
