In this paper, we discuss the important problem of invisibility that is inherent in the task of developing large software systems. There are no direct solutions to this problem; however, there are several categories of systemsrelational code analyzers, reuse librarians, and project management databases, that can be seen as addressing aspects of the invisibility problem. We argue that these systems do not adequately deal with certain important aspects of the problem of invisibility-seman2ic prolzferation, multiple views, and the need f o r intelligent indexing. We have built a system called LaSSIE, which uses knowledge representation and reasoning technology to directly address each of these three issues and thereby help with the invisibility problem. We conclude with an evaluation of the system, and a discussion of open problems and ongoing work.
