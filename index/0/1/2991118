We describe a novel randomized method, the method of color-coding for finding simple paths and cycles of a specified length k, and other small subgraphs, within a given graph G = (V,E). The randomized algorithms obtained using this method can be derandomized using families of perfect hash functions. Using the color-coding method we obtain, among others, the following new results: • For every fixed k, if a graph G = (V,E) contains a simple cycle of size exactly k, then such a cycle can be found in either O(V ω) expected time or O(V ω log V ) worst-case time, where ω < 2.376 is the exponent of matrix multiplication. (Here and in what follows we use V and E instead of |V | and |E| whenever no confusion may arise.) • For every fixed k, if a planar graph G = (V,E) contains a simple cycle of size exactly k, then ∗Work supported in part by The basic research foundation administrated by The Israel academy of sciences and humanities and by grant No. 93-6-6 of the Sloan foundation. †Institute for Advanced study, school of Mathematics, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA. ‡School of Mathematical Sciences, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, ISRAEL.

The same algorithm applies, in fact, not only to planar graphs, but to any minor closed family of graphs which is not the family of all graphs. • If a graph G = (V,E) contains a subgraph isomorphic to a bounded tree-width graph H = (VH , EH) where |VH | = O(log V ), then such a copy of H can be found in polynomial time. This was not previously known even if H were just a path of length O(log V ). These results improve upon previous results of many authors. The third result resolves in the affirmative a conjecture of Papadimitriou and Yannakakis that the LOG PATH problem is in P. We can even show that the LOG PATH problem is in NC.
