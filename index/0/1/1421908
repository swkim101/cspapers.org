We present an implicit discourse relation classifier in the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB). Our classifier considers the context of the two arguments, word pair information, as well as the arguments' internal constituent and dependency parses. Our results on the PDTB yields a significant 14.1% improvement over the baseline. In our error analysis, we discuss four challenges in recognizing implicit relations in the PDTB.
