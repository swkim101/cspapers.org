The first sublinear space universal compact routing schemes for directed graphs are presented. The first scheme uses O(filog* n)-sized routing tables on average at each node, and the second achieves O(n2j3 log4j3 n)-sized routing tables maximum space at every node. Both use O(log n) bit vertex addresses and achieve roundtrip routes of stretch at most 3 compared to the optimal roundtrip shortest paths, in any strongly connected weighted or unweighted digraph.
