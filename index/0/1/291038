This paper presents work in progress towards a program development and maintenance aid called the Intelligent Program Editor (IPE), which applies artificial intelligence techniques to the task of manipulating and analyzing programs. The IPE is a knowledge based tool: it gains its power by explicitly representing textual, syntactic, and many of the semantic (meaning related) and pragmatic (application oriented) structures in programs. To demonstrate this approach, we implement a subset of this knowledge base, and a search mechanism called the Program Reference Language (PRL), which is able to locate portions of programs based on a description provided by a user.
