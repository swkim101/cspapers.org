In this paper, we examine how user ratings of content produced for an online community are taken into account by administrators when they decide whether to delete content. Incorporating about 10 years of server data from the online peer-production community Everything2, we looked at how specific features of voting predicted deletion of posts. We found that not all types of voting are the same: negative voting of users was the strongest factor explaining deletion of a Write-up. Receiving a positive vote from a member with higher status decreases the chances of deletion, while receiving a positive vote from a user with neutral status has a very little effect on the deletion of content.
