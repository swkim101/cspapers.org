We present the lazy strategy implemented in a compiler of cryptographic protocols, Casrul. The purpose of this compiler is to verify protocols and to translate them into rewrite rules that can be used by several kinds of automatic or semi-automatic tools for finding flaws, or proving properties. It is entirely automatic, and the efficiency of the generated rules is guaranteed because of the use of a lazy model of intruder behavior. This efficiency is illustrated on several examples.
