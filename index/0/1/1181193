We investigated the applicability of probabilistic context-free grammars to syllabi cation and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. The results show that the standard probability model of context-free grammars performs very well in predicting syllable boundaries. However, our results indicate that the standard probability model does not solve grapheme-to-phoneme conversion su ciently although, we varied all free parameters of the probabilistic reestimation procedure.
