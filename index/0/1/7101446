We describe language- and code generation-based approaches to providing access to architecture-specific vectorization support for high-performance data stream processing applications. We provide an experimental performance evaluation of several stream operators, contrasting our code generation approach with the native auto-vectorization support available in the GNU gcc and Intel icc compilers.
