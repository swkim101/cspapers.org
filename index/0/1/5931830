The recent release of UML 2.0 has corrected a lot of design difficulties encountered in the 1.x revisions. The biggest change which allows UML to really attack embedded systems is the implementation of true object diagram and business process diagram. For embedded systems, at analysis stage, use cases and business processes express system requirements. At design time, class diagrams store operations of generic objects and object diagrams show all instantiated objects participating in macroscopic processes. Normally, dynamic studies are supported by sequence suite, activity and state diagrams. Unfortunately, dynamic support undergoes only cosmetic changes. Based on UML version 2.0 diagrams, uniform object modeling methodology shown hereafter handles indifferently any object in the model: a user, a mechanical button or a piece of software program. This uniform abstraction is necessary to implement easily simulation and test. A design of a very simple load elevator going through two levels with security system is used here to illustrate the uniform process and serve as a basic design for discussion.
