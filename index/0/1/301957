This paper is approaching the computer aided design problem only from the programming point of view. Let us begin with two remarks to explain this approach:
 [i] very often computer aided design is heavily technology oriented; we mean that very often in a design process, the computer is used for the only phase of technological design of the object.
 [ii] moreover, until quite recently, CAD was considered only through application areas as, for example: aeronautics, electronics (circuits analysis), layout of printed circuits, civil engineering, ship building, etc...
