The role of computers in the modern office has divided ouractivities between virtual interactions in the realm of thecomputer and physical interactions with real objects within thetraditional office infrastructure. This paper extends previous workthat has attempted to bridge this gap, to connect physical objectswith virtual representations or computational functionality, viavarious types of tags. We discuss a variety of scenarios we haveimplemented using a novel combination of inexpensive, unobtrusiveand easy to use RFID tags, tag readers, portable computers andwireless networking. This novel combination demonstrates theutility of invisibly, seamlessly and portably linking physicalobjects to networked electronic services and actions that arenaturally associated with their form.
