Cyber-Physical Systems are immersed in an environment in which they are expected to operate reliably. The specificity of the target scenario has, however, a unique impact on the system behaviour that is hard to foresee. Therefore, the deployment of these systems often results in a trial and error task. To address this challenge, we have realised a system design framework based on the ability of modelling the target environment through the fusion of in situ measurements and descriptions, e.g., maps, of the scenario. We demonstrate the ability of our solution to accurately perform the situated analysis of the spatial and temporal characteristics of wireless communication in an indoor testbed.
