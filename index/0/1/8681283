A k ey challenge facing wireless networking is t o u t i lize the spectrum as eeciently a s p o ssible g iven current c hannel conditions and in the most eeective w ay f o r e a ch a pplication. This is d i cult t o a c hieve w i th existing wireless devices because physical layer functionality i s xed, while c hannel conditions and applications can change r a pidly. I n s t e a d, we a r-gue that R adioActive n e t works, an adaptable w i reless network architecture which d r a ws on the strengths of s o ftware radios and active n e t works, are needed to meet this c hal-lenge. Active networks provide a framework for programming network services, and software radios extend this p r o-grammability i nto the physical layer. We b e l ieve t h a t t h i s approach w i ll ooer signicant i m provements in functional-ity and performance over today's wireless networks because it i s n o l onger necessary to design a p r i ori with pessimistic assumptions that describeworst case conditions. In this p a-per, we o u t l ine our vision, the opportunities i t a ords, and the challenges that m u s t b e t a c kled before it c an become a reality. 1 Introduction In a wireless network, channel conditions can vary signi-cantly o ver time and tend to be dicult to predict, especially when nodes are mobile ES96, DR92, NKNS96. This is problematic because conventional communications designs are static i n t h a t t hey tend target a single design point t h a t is t h e w or s t c a s e t h a t can be tolerated, rather than the channel conditions that are currently b e i ng encountered. The result is i necient use of the available spectrum. A network based on software radio t e c hnology enables a much m ore dynamic o r g anization of resources. Software radios enable the characteristics of all communication layers, including the physical layer that is normally i mplemented in hardware, t o b e c hanged at essentially a ny t i me.
