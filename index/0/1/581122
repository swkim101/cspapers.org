We propose the Local Split Decision tree (LSD tree, for short), a data structure supporting efficient spatial access to geometric objects. Its main advantages over other structures are that it performs well for all reasonable data distributions, cover quotients (which measure the overlapping of the data objects), and bucket capacities, and that it maintains multidimensional points as well as arbitrary geometric objects. These properties demonstrated by an extensive performance, evaluation make the LSD tree extremely suitable for the implementation of spatial access paths in geometric databases. The paging algorithm for the binary tree directory is interesting in its own right because a practical solution for the problem of how to page a (multidimensional) binary tree without access path degeneration is presented.
