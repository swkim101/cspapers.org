Let I be a random 3CNF formula generated by choosing a truth assignment ϕ for variables x1, xn uniformly at random and including every clause with i literals set true by ϕ with probability pi, independently. We show that for any constants 0 ≤ η2,η3 ≤ 1 there is a constant dmin so that for all d ≥ dmin a spectral algorithm similar to the graph coloring algorithm of Alon and Kahale will find a satisfying assignment with high probability for p1 = d/n2, p2 = η2d/n2, and p3 = η3d/n2. Appropriately setting the ηi's yields natural distributions on satisfiable 3CNFs, not‐all‐equal‐sat 3CNFs, and exactly‐one‐sat 3CNFs. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct. Alg., 2008
