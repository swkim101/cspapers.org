This paper presents an innovative approach of utilising visual feedback to determine physical interaction forces with soft tissue during Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS). This novel force sensing device is composed of a linear retractable mechanism and a spherical visual feature. The sensor mechanism can be adapted to endoscopic cameras used in MIS. As the distance between the camera and feature varies due to the sliding joint, interaction forces with anatomical surfaces can be computed based on the visual appearance of the feature in the image. Hence, this device allows the measurement of forces without introducing new stand-alone sensors. A mathematical model was derived based on validation data tests and preliminary experiments were conducted to verify the model's accuracy. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our vision based approach.
