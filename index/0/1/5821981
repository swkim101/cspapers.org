In web query result caching, staleness of queries are often bounded via a time-to-live (TTL) mechanism, which expires the validity of cached query results at some point in time. In this work, we evaluate the performance of three alternative TTL mechanisms: time-based TTL, frequency-based TTL, and click-based TTL. Moreover, we propose hybrid approaches obtained by pair-wise combination of these mechanisms. Our results indicate that combining time-based TTL with frequency-based TTL yields superior performance (i.e., lower stale query traffic and less redundant computation) than using a particular mechanism in isolation.
