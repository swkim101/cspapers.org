Push technology has recently generated a tremendous amount of media attention, commercial activity, and contro versy. The wide range of opinions on push is understandable given that it represents a major departure from the way distributed information systems have traditionally been b Adding to the noise, however, is confusion about the basic principles of push and where it fits in to the world of data delivery. For example, many discussions on the topic blur the distinction between push and broadcast. We argue that this confusion stems from two fundamental causes: First, push is just one dimension of a larger design space of data delivery mechanisms. Second, networked information systems can employ different data delivery options between different s ets of information producers and consumers. In this short paper we characterize the design space for dissemination-based i nformation systems and applications, and show how current “push” solutions fit into this space. We then use this framework highlight how the implementation of current Internetbased push solutions differs from the appearance that they present to users.
