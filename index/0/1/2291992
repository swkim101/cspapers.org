Advanced data models and knowledge models together with their powerful query and manipulation languages have already proven to be essential for systems that support non-standard applications such as engineering and knowledge-based application systems. In order to raise their usability and acceptability, it is overly important to provide adequate implementation techniques that guarantee extensible and efficient processing for this advanced DBMS scenario. In this paper we present design alternatives and implementation techniques for such kinds of advanced DBMS, strongly focussing on query and knowledge processing in client/server architectures. To discuss our considerations and implementation technologies, we refer to the knowledge-processing framework of the KBMS KRISYS, although our ideas are generally applicable to (advanced) DBMS.
