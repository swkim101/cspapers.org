TR: 98-047 Title: A TCP-Friendly Rate Adjustment Protocol for Continuous Media Flows over Best Effort Networks Authors: Jitendra Padhye, Jim Kurose, Don Towsley and Rajeev Koodli Address: Department of Computer Science University of Massachusetts LGRC, Box 34610. Amherst MA 01003-4610 Date: October 23, 1998 As networked multimedia applications become widespread, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that these applications can coexist with current TCP-based applications. The TCP protocol is designed to reduce its sending rate when congestion is detected. Networked multimedia applications should exhibit similar behavior, if they wish to co-exist with TCP-based applications [1]. Using TCP for multimedia applications is not practical, since the protocol combines error control and congestion control, in order to ensure reliability. In this paper we present a protocol that operates by measuring loss rates and round trip times and then sets the transmission rate to that which TCP would achieve under similar conditions. The analysis in [2] is used to determine this "TCP-friendly" rate. We evaluate the protocol under various traffic conditions, using simulations and implementation. References: [1] J. Madhavi and S.
