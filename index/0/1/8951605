This paper presents a collision-free path planning method for an aerial vehicle sharing airspace with other aerial vehicles. It is based on grid models and genetic algorithms to find safe trajectories. Monte-Carlo method is used to evaluate the best predicted trajectories considering different sources of uncertainty such as the wind, the inaccuracies in the vehicle model and limitations of on-board sensors and control system.
