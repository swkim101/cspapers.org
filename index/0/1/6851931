The emergence of personal computing devices offers both a challenge and opportunity for displaying text: small screens can be hard to read, but also support higher resolution. To fit content on a small screen, text must be small. This small text size can make computing devices unusable, in particular to low-vision users, whose vision is not correctable with glasses. Usability is also decreased for sighted users straining to read the small letters, especially without glasses at hand. We propose animated scripts called livefonts for displaying English with improved legibility for all users. Because paper does not support animation, traditional text is static. However, modern screens support animation, and livefonts capitalize on this capability. We evaluate our livefont variations' legibility through a controlled lab study with low-vision and sighted participants, and find our animated scripts to be legible across vision types at approximately half the size (area) of traditional letters, while previous smartfonts (static alternate scripts) did not show a significant legibility advantage for low-vision users. We evaluate the learnability of our livefont with low-vision and sighted participants, and find it to be comparably learnable to static smartfonts after two thousand practice sentences.
