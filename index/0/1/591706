This paper presents a novel method for logic minimization in large-scale multi-level networks. It accomplishes its great reductions on the basis of multi-signal implications and the relationships among these implications. Both are handled on a transitive implication graph, proposed in this paper, which realizes high-speed, high-quality minimization. This proposed method holds great promise for the achievement of an interactive logic design environment for large-scale networks.
