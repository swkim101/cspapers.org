Mobile manipulation planning is a hard problem composed of multiple challenging sub-problems, some of which require searching through large high-dimensional state-spaces. The focus of this work is on computing a trajectory to safely maneuver an object through an environment, given the start and goal configurations. In this work we present a heuristic search-based deterministic mobile manipulation planner, based on our recently-developed algorithm for planning with adaptive dimensionality. Our planner demonstrates reasonable performance, while also providing strong guarantees on completeness and suboptimality bounds with respect to the graph representing the problem.
