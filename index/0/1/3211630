At the Center for Information Technology Integration, we are experimenting with algorithms and protocols for building secure applications. In our security testbed, we have modified VIC, an off-the-shelf videoconferencing application, to support GSS, a generic security interface. We then layered these interfaces onto a smartcard-based key distribution algorithm and a fast cipher. Because these components are accompanied by rigorous mathematical proofs of security and are accessed through narrowly-defined interfaces, we have confidence in the strength of the system's security.
