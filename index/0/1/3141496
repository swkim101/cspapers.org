Underwater installations require regular inspection and maintenance. We are exploring the idea of performing these tasks using an autonomous underwater vehicle, achieving persistent autonomous behaviour in order to avoid the need for frequent human intervention. In this paper we consider one aspect of this problem, which is the construction of a suitable plan for a single inspection tour. In particular we generate a temporal plan that optimises the time taken to complete the inspection mission. We report on physical trials with the system at the Diver and ROV driver Training Center in Fort William, Scotland, discussing some of the lessons learned.
