This paper represents a new method for enhancing Computed Tomography (CT) image. In this proposed method, the entropy-based algorithm was applied to detach significant values in the original CT image to produce a detached image. In addition, a decomposition wavelet transform was employed for both the original CT image and the detached image to create image fusion. An enhanced image with tumor region was obtained for diagnosis using an inverse wavelet transform. The result is that processed region in the enhanced image shows more prominent points than that in the original image. This result can allow physicians or doctors diagnose and predict accurately tumor regions in the CT image.
