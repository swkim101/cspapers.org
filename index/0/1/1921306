In 2000, Dimitrov, Jullien, and Miller proposed a efficient multi-exponentiation algorithm based on signed-digit recoding algorithm. The average joint Hamming ratio (AJHR) can be reduced from 0.556 to 0.534 by the recoding algorithm. In this article, we preciously extend the recoding step of the DJM algorithm to three cases: the fixed-windows, the right-to-left sliding windows, and the left-to-right sliding windows. We prove that the AJHR of the three cases are 0.521, 0.515, and 0.511, respectively.
