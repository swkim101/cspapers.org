This paper proposes a scheduling strategy and an automatic scheduling flow that enable the simultaneous execution of multiple hard-real-time dataflow jobs. Each job has its own execution rate and starts and stops independently from other jobs, at instants unknown at compile-time, on a multiprocessor system-on-chip. We show how a combination of Time-Division Multiplex (TDM) and static-order scheduling can be modeled as additional nodes and edges on top of the dataflow representation of the job using Single-Rate Dataflow semantics to enable tight worst-case temporal analysis. We also propose algorithms to find combined TDM/static order schedules for jobs that guarantee a requested minimum throughput and maximum latency, while minimizing the usage of processing resources. We illustrate the usage of these techniques for a combination of Wireless LAN and TD-SCDMA radio jobs running on a prototype Software-Defined Radio platform.
