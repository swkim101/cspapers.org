The use and prevalence of cloud and large-scale computing infrastructures is increasing. They are projected to be a dominant trend in computing for the foreseeable future: major cloud operators are now estimated to house millions of machines each and to host substantial (and growing) fractions of corporate and government IT and web infrastructure. CCSW is a forum for bringing together researchers and practitioners to discuss the challenges and implications of current and future trends to the security of cloud operators, tenants, and the larger Internet community. Of special interest are the security challenges from the integration of cloud infrastructures with IoT and mobile application deployments. CCSW welcomes submissions on new threats, countermeasures, and opportunities brought about by the move to cloud computing, with a preference for unconventional approaches, as well as measurement studies and case studies that shed light on the security implications of cloud infrastructure and use cases.
