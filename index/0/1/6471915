Intersecting inverted indexes is a fundamental operation for many applications in information retrieval and databases. Efficient indexing for this operation is known to be a hard problem for arbitrary data distributions. However, text corpora used in Information Retrieval applications often have convenient power-law constraints (also known as Zipf's Law and long tails) that allow us to materialize carefully chosen combinations of multi-keyword indexes, which significantly improve worst-case performance without requiring excessive storage. These multi-keyword indexes limit the number of postings accessed when computing arbitrary index intersections. Our evaluation on an e-commerce collection of 20 million products shows that the indexes of up to four arbitrary keywords can be intersected while accessing less than 20% of the postings in the largest single-keyword index.
