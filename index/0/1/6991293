In this paper, we propose to address the problem of domain adaptation for sequence labeling tasks via distributed representation learning by using a log-bilinear language adaptation model. The proposed neural probabilistic language model simultaneously models two different but related data distributions in the source and target domains based on induced distributed representations, which encode both generalizable and domain-specific latent features. We then use the learned dense real-valued representation as augmenting features for natural language processing systems. We empirically evaluate the proposed learning technique on WSJ and MEDLINE domains with POS tagging systems, and on WSJ and Brown corpora with syntactic chunking and named entity recognition systems. Our primary results show that the proposed domain adaptation method outperforms a number of comparison methods for cross domain sequence labeling tasks.
