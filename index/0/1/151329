Because it is more intuitively understandable than the previously existing convolution algorithms, Mean Value Analysis (MVA) has gained great popularity as an exact solution technique for separable queueing networks. However, the derivations of MVA presented to date apply only to closed queueing network models. Additionally, the problem of the storage requirement of MVA has not been dealt with satisfactorily. In this paper we address both these problems, presenting MVA solutions for open and mixed load independent networks, and a storage maintenance technique that we postulate is the minimum possible of any “reasonable” MVA technique.
