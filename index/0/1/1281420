Traditional computer vision and machine learning algorithms have been largely studied in a centralized setting, where all the processing is performed at a single central location. However, a distributed approach might be more appropriate when a network with a large number of cameras is used to analyze a scene. In this paper we show how centralized algorithms based on linear algebraic operations can be made distributed by using simple distributed averages. We cover algorithms such as SVD, least squares, PCA, GPCA, 3-D point triangulation, pose estimation and affine SfM.
