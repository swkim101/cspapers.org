IT security education is an important activity in computer science education. The broad range of existing security threats makes it necessary to teach students the principles of IT security as well as to let them gain hands-on experience. In order to enable students to practice IT security anytime anywhere, a novel tutoring system is being developed at the University of Trier, Germany, which allows them to get familiar with security technologies and tools via the Internet. Based on virtual machine technology, users are able to perform exercises on a Linux system instead of in a restricted simulation environment. This paper describes the user interface of the Tele-Lab IT Security, its system architecture and its functional components.
