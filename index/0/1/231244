A semi-autonomous mobile self-leveling landing platform designed to launch, recover and re-launch VTOL UAVs without the need for human intervention is described. The landing platform is rugged, lightweight and inexpensive, making it ideal for civilian applications that require a base station from which a rotorcraft UAV can be launched and/or recovered on terrain that is normally unsuitable for UAV take-off and landing. This landing platform is capable of autonomously self-leveling on rough terrain and inclines up to 25Â°, and can operate in isolated remote locations for extended periods of time using large onboard lithium batteries and wireless communication. The unique design aspects of this landing platform are that it is mobile, self-leveling, and man-portable. A fully-operational prototype has been designed, constructed and evaluated. Design details and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the landing platform's functionality, and that all primary design requirements have been met.
