This paper describes a tool at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory which aids a programmer in converting FORTRAN to a structured syntax. The program is a highly interactive system using computer graphics techniques to facilitate the operations necessary for such a conversion. Editing and structure recognition capabilities, including the ability to handle arbitrary levels of block structure, have been combined into a system that reduces the effort involved in updating old software.
