Previous work shows that a web page can be partitioned into multiple segments or blocks, and often the importance of those blocks in a page is not equivalent. Also, it has been proven that differentiating noisy or unimportant blocks from pages can facilitate web mining, search and accessibility. However, no uniform approach and model has been presented to measure the importance of different segments in web pages. Through a user study, we found that people do have a consistent view about the importance of blocks in web pages. In this paper, we investigate how to find a model to automatically assign importance values to blocks in a web page. We define the block importance estimation as a learning problem. First, we use a vision-based page segmentation algorithm to partition a web page into semantic blocks with a hierarchical structure. Then spatial features (such as position and size) and content features (such as the number of images and links) are extracted to construct a feature vector for each block. Based on these features, learning algorithms are used to train a model to assign importance to different segments in the web page. In our experiments, the best model can achieve the performance with Micro-F1 79% and Micro-Accuracy 85.9%, which is quite close to a person's view.
