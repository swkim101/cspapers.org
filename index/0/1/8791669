This demonstration will show describe the construction and application of Cross-Domain Information Servers using features of the standard Z39.50 information retrieval protocol[Z39.50]. The system is currently being used to build and search distributed indexes for databases with disparate structured data (SGML and XML). We use the Z39.50 Explain Database to determine the databases and indexes of a given server, then use the Z39.50 SCAN facility to extract the contents of the indexes. This information is used to build collection documents that can be retrieved using probabilistic retrieval algorithms.
