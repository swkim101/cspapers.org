In this paper we present limitations of conventional faceted search in the way data, facets, and queries are modelled. We discuss how these limitations can be addressed with Semantic Web technologies such as RDF, OWL 2, and SPARQL 1.1. We also present a system, SemFacet, that is a proof-of-concept prototype of our approach implemented on top of Yago knowledge base, powered by the OWL 2 RL triple store RDFox, and the full text search engine Lucene.
