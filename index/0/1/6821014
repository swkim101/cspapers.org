We describe reference implementations for selected configurations of the user authentication protocol defined by the Information Card Profile V1.0. Our code can interoperate with existing implementations of the roles of the protocol (client, identity provider, and relying party). We derive formal proofs of security properties for our code using an automated theorem prover. Hence, we obtain the most substantial examples of verified implementations of cryptographic protocols to date, and the first for any federated identity-management protocols. Moreover, we present a tool that downloads security policies from services and identity providers and compiles them to a verifiably secure client proxy.
