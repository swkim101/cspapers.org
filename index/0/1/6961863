Online shoppers are generally highly task-driven: they have a certain goal in mind, and they are looking for a product with features that are consistent with that goal. Unfortunately, finding a product with specific features is extremely time-consuming using the search functionality provided by existing web sites.In this paper, we present a new search system called Red Opal that enables users to locate products rapidly based on features. Our fully automatic system examines prior customer reviews, identifies product features, and scores each product on each feature. Red Opal uses these scores to determine which products to show when a user specifies a desired product feature. We evaluate our system on four dimensions: precision of feature extraction, efficiency of feature extraction, precision of product scores, and estimated time savings to customers. On each dimension, Red Opal performs better than a comparison system.
