In a non-uniform Constraint Satisfaction problem CSP(&#x0393;), where G is a set of relations on a finite set A, the goal is to find an assignment of values to variables subject to constraints imposed on specified sets of variables using the relations from &#x0393;. The Dichotomy Conjecture for the non-uniform CSP states that for every constraint language \Gm the problem CSP(&#x0393;) is either solvable in polynomial time or is NP-complete. It was proposed by Feder and Vardi in their seminal 1993 paper. In this paper we confirm the Dichotomy Conjecture.
