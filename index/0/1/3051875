The growing field of human-robot interaction (HRI) demands robots that move fluidly, gracefully, compliantly and safely. This paper describes our recent work in the design and evaluation of long-travel voice coil actuators (VCAs) for use in robots intended for interacting with people. The basic advantages and shortcomings of electromagnetic actuators are discussed and evaluated in the context of human-robot interaction, and are compared to alternative actuation technologies. Voice coil actuators have been chosen for their controllability, ease of implementation, geometry, compliance, biomimetic actuation characteristics, safety, quietness, and high power density.
