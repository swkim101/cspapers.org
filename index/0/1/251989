As of now, it is not uncommon for one to use multiple computers in separate places such as at home, office or school. A number of applications currently exist to allow a user to easily access and control these computers remotely via a notebook computer or web page. Unfortunately, even with such solutions, it is rather inconvenient, for example, to try accessing your computer while walking downtown or riding a train. On the other hand, considering that cellular phones have been accepted as multi-function devices capable of karaoke, digital photography and web browsing in countries like Japan, it may prove beneficial to support remote PC access on a cellular phone. With this in mind, we created Rajicon, a system to provide an easy to use interface to remotely operate a PC's GUI operating system via a cellular phone. Rajicon supports image based navigation of a remote PC's desktop and mouse/key operations. In addition, Rajicon provides functions for keyboard shortcuts, specialized window adjustment operations and text extraction. We have performed extensive evaluations with five subjects and discuss the results in this paper. We also discuss the lead author's latest adaption of Rajicon to a PDA.
