Software engineering researchers develop great techniques consisting of practices and tools that improve efficiency and quality of software development. Prior work evaluates developers' use of techniques such as Test-Driven-Development and refactoring by measuring actions in the development environment. What we still lack is a method to communicate effectively and motivate developers to adopt best practices and tools. This work proposes a game-like system to motivate adoption while continuously measuring developers' use of more efficient development techniques.
