The (∆+1)-coloring problem is a fundamental symmetry breaking problem in distributed computing. We give a new randomized coloring algorithm for (∆+1)-coloring running in O(√log ∆)+ 2^O(√log log n) rounds with probability 1-1/n^Ω(1) in a graph with n nodes and maximum degree ∆. This implies that the (∆+1)-coloring problem is easier than the maximal independent set problem and the maximal matching problem, due to their lower bounds by Kuhn, Moscibroda, and Wattenhofer [PODC'04]. Our algorithm also extends to the list-coloring problem where the palette of each node contains ∆+1 colors.
