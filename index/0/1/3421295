Let X be a set of n points of norm at most 1 in the Euclidean space R^k, and suppose &#x2265;0. An &#x2265;-distance sketch for X is a data structure that, given any two points of X enables one to recover the square of the (Euclidean) distance between them up to an additive} error of &#x2265;. Let f(n,k,&#x2265;) denote the minimum possible number of bits of such a sketch. Here we determine f(n,k,&#x2265;) up to a constant factor for all n &#x2265; k &#x2265; 1 and all &#x2265; &#x2265; \frac{1}{n^{0.49}}. Our proof is algorithmic, and provides an efficient algorithm for computing a sketch of size O(f(n,k,&#x2265;)/n) for each point, so that the square of the distance between any two points can be computed from their sketches up to an additive error of &#x2265; in time linear in the length of the sketches. We also discuss the case of smaller &#x2265;2/&#x221A; n and obtain some new results about dimension reduction in this range. In particular, we show that for any such &#x2265; and any k &#x2264; t=\frac{\log (2+&#x2265;^2 n)}{&#x2265;^2} there are configurations of n points in R^k that cannot be embedded in R^{&#x2113;} for &#x2113;
