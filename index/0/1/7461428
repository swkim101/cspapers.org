The number of natural language queries submitted to search engines is increasing as search environments get diversified. However, legacy search engines are still optimized for short keyword queries. Thus, the use of natural language queries at legacy search engines degrades the retrieval performance of the engines. This paper proposes a novel method to translate a natural language query into a keyword query relevant to the natural language query for retrieving better search results without change of the engines. The proposed method formulates the translation as a generation task. That is, the method generates a keyword query from a natural language query by preserving the semantics of the natural language query. A recurrent neural network encoder-decoder architecture is adopted as a generator of keyword queries from natural language queries. In addition, an attention mechanism is also used to cope with long natural language queries.
