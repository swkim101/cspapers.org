This paper reports an array of measuring tools devised to aid in the implementation of a prototype computer utility. These tools include special hardware clocks and data channels, general purpose programmed probing and recording tools, and specialized measurement facilities. Some particular measurements of interest in a system which combines demand paging with multi-programming are described in detail. Where appropriate, insight into effectiveness (or lack thereof) of individual tools is provided.
