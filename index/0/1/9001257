In this paper we study the problem of scheduling a set of independent tasks on m â‰¥ 1 processors to minimize the mean finishing-time (mean time in system). The importance of the mean finishing-time criterion is that its minimization tends to reduce the mean number of unfinished tasks in the system. In the paper we give a reduction of our scheduling problem to a transportation problem and thereby extend the class of known non enumerative scheduling algorithms [1]. Next we show that the inclusion of weights (weighted mean finishing-time) complicates the problem and speculate that there may be no non enumerative algorithm for this case. For the special case of identical processors we study the maximum finishing-time properties of schedules which are optimal with respect to mean finishing-time. Finally we give a scheduling algorithm having desirable properties with respect to both maximum finishing-time and mean finishing-time.
