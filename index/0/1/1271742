Party A<sub>i</sub> of k parties A<sub>1</sub>,...,A<sub>k</sub> receives on its forehead a t-tuple (a<sub>i1</sub>,...,a<sub>it</sub>) of elements from the group G = SL(2, q). The parties are promised that the interleaved product a<sub>11</sub>...a<sub>k1</sub>a<sub>12</sub>...a<sub>k2</sub>...a<sub>1t</sub>...a<sub>kt</sub> is equal either to the identity e or to some other fixed element g ∈ G. Their goal is to determine which of e and g the interleaved product is equal to, using the least amount of communication. We show that for all fixed k and all sufficiently large t the communication is Ω(t log |G|), which is tight. As an application, we establish the security of the leakage-resilient circuits studied by Miles and Viola (STOC 2013) in the "only computation leaks" model. Our main technical contribution is of independent interest. We show that if X is a probability distribution on G<sup>m</sup> such that any two coordinates are uniform in G<sup>2</sup>, then a pointwise product of s independent copies of X is nearly uniform in G<sup>m</sup>, where s depends on m only.
