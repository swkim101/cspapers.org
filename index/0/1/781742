Data flow concepts provide a new framework for finding solutions to interrelated problems of exploiting parallelism in the architecture of high-performance multiple processor computers, and of programming and structuring distributed systems. A computer based on data flow principles is a radically different form of stored-program computer in which instructions are activated by arrival of their operands rather than by flow of “control.” These machines have no program counter and no concept of sequential instruction execution. Highly concurrent program execution is a natural consequence of data flow program execution, because many instructions may be activated by data at the same time.
 Several laboratories in the United States, Japan, England, and France are currently building prototypes of data flow computers. In this tutorial, we will describe the programming and the architecture of machines being developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
