We study the problem of recognizing the cluster structure of a graph in the framework of property testing in the bounded degree model. Given a parameter ε, a d-bounded degree graph is defined to be (k, φ)-clusterable, if it can be partitioned into no more than k parts, such that the (inner) conductance of the induced subgraph on each part is at least φ and the (outer) conductance of each part is at most cd,kε4φ2, where cd,k depends only on d,k. Our main result is a sublinear algorithm with the running time ~O(√n ⋅ poly(φ,k,1/ε)) that takes as input a graph with maximum degree bounded by d, parameters k, φ, ε, and with probability at least 2/3, accepts the graph if it is (k,φ)-clusterable and rejects the graph if it is ε-far from (k, φ*)-clusterable for φ* = c'd,kφ2 ε4}/log n, where c'd,k depends only on d,k. By the lower bound of Ω(√n) on the number of queries needed for testing graph expansion, which corresponds to k=1 in our problem, our algorithm is asymptotically optimal up to polylogarithmic factors.
