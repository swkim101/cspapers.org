Cybersecurity is a significant challenge facing our society, and the industry is in desperate need of more talent. With a projected worker shortage of 1.8 million by 2022, it is imperative to recruit more young people to study and work in this critical field. One time-tested method of engaging young people to explore prospective careers is through Scouting's advancement program. The Girl Scouts of the USA has recognized this need, and recently announced that they will be introducing a series of cybersecurity badges for their programs. This poster outlines a proposal for a Cybersecurity merit badge for the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). A background on the merit badge program is presented, including research supporting the idea that badges can be an effective method at engaging young people in experiential learning. A set of draft recommended requirements is presented. The authors have drafted a proposal for consideration by the BSA, and this poster reports the status of that proposal and the authors' efforts at engaging the BSA.
