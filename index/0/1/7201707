This study explores the existing blacklists to discover suspected URLs that refer to on-the-fly phishing threats in real time. We propose a PhishTrack framework that includes redirection tracking and form tracking components to update the phishing blacklists. It actively finds phishing URLs as early as possible. Experimental results show that our proactive phishing update method is an effective and efficient approach for improving the coverage of the blacklists. In practice, our solution is complementary to the existing anti-phishing techniques for providing secured web surfing.
