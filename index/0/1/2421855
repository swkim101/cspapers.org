We propose a new notion of surprising temporal patterns in market basket data, and algorithms to (cid:12)nd such patterns. This is distinct from (cid:12)nding frequent patterns as addressed in the common mining literature. We argue that once the analyst is already familiar with prevalent patterns in the data, the greatest incremental bene(cid:12)t is likely to be from changes in the relationship between item frequencies over time. A simple measure of surprise is the extent of departure from a model, estimated using standard multivariate time series analysis. Unfortunately, such estimation involves models, smoothing windows and parameters whose optimal choices can vary dramatically from one application to another. In contrast, we propose a precise characterization of surprise based on the number of bits in which a basket sequence can be encoded under a carefully chosen coding scheme. In this scheme it is inexpensive to encode sequences of itemsets that have steady, hence likely to be well-known, correlation between items. Conversely, a sequence with large code length hints at a possibly surprising correlation. Our notion of surprise also has the desirable property that the score of a set of items is o(cid:11)set by anything surprising that the user may already know from the marginal distribution of any proper subset. No parameters, such as support, con(cid:12)dence, or smoothing windows, need to be estimated or speci(cid:12)ed by the user. We experimented with real-life market basket data. The algorithm successfully rejected a large number of frequent sets of items that bore obvious and steady complementary relations to each other, such as cereal and milk. Instead, our algorithm found itemsets that showed statistically strong (cid:13)uctuations in correlation over time. These items had no obviously complementary roles.
