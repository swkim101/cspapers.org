We deal with the problem of finding profit-maximizing prices for a finite number of distinct goods, assuming that of each good an unlimited number of copies is available, or that goods can be reproduced at no cost (e.g., digital goods). Consumers specify subsets of the goods and the maximum prices they are willing to pay. In the considered single-minded case every consumer is interested in precisely one such subset. If the goods are the edges of a graph and consumers are requesting to purchase paths in this graph, then we can think of the problem as pricing computer network connections or transportation links.We start by showing weak NP-hardness of the very restricted case in which the requested subsets are nested, i.e., contained inside each other or non-intersecting, thereby resolving the previously open question whether the problem remains NP-hard when the underlying graph is simply a line. Using a reduction inspired by this result we present an approximation preserving reduction that proves APX-hardness even for very sparse instances defined on general graphs, where the number of requests per edge is bounded by a constant B and no path is longer than some constant l. On the algorithmic side we first present an O(log l + log B)-approximation algorithm that (almost) matches the previously best known approximation guarantee in the general case, but is especially well suited for sparse problem instances. Using a new upper bounding technique we then give an O(l2)-approximation, which is the first algorithm for the general problem with an approximation ratio that does not depend on B.
