We describe an extensible query optimizer for objectbase management systems. Since these systems are expected to serve data management needs of a wide range of application domains with possibly different query optimization requirements, extensibtity is essential. Our work is conducted within the context of TIGUKAT, which is a uniform behavioral system that models every system component as a first-class object. Consistent with this philosophy, we model ever y component of the optimizer M a first-class object, providing ultimate extensibfity. We describe the optimizer architecture and how the optimizer components are modeled as extensions of a uniform type system.
