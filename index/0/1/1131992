Many previous works simulate cube-shaped modular robots to explain their systems and algorithms. This paper explores a cube-shaped, self-reconfigurable system composed of EM-Cube robot modules. The paper describes the system's design, implementation, movement algorithms, and experimentation. It reports on the hardware and software, and presents the algorithms of linear walking, convex and concave transition, and locomotion. Finally, it discusses EM-Cube locomotion experiments.
