This paper proposes a new method how to construct the reduced-order model of rotor system with gyroscopic effect used for control system design of closed loop system. In order to demonstrate the validity of this method, the controlled model and zero power control of a 0.5 KWh class flywheel system using magnetic bearing with gyroscopic effect are given in this paper. The proposed method is verified by experiment in this paper.
