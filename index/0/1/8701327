A planar sinusoidally modulated reactive metasurface is excited through an aperture and a parametric analysis on the variation of its radiation properties is performed due to the variation in coupling coefficient of the aperture. The aperture coupling varies with the position and size of the aperture, the properties of the dielectric substrates and the propagating leaky-wave modes. The propagation of the fundamental leaky-wave mode is considered for this study.
