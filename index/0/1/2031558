Sorted Neighborhood is an established blocking method for relational databases. It has not been applied on graph-based data models such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF). This poster presents a modular workflow for applying Sorted Neighborhood to RDF. Real-world evaluations demonstrate the workflow's utility against a popular baseline.
