This paper studies the compressibility of RDF data sets. We show that big RDF data sets are highly compressible due to the structure of RDF graphs (power law), organization of URIs and RDF syntax verbosity. We present basic approaches to compress RDF data and test them with three well-known, real-world RDF data sets.
