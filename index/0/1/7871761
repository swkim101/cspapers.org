The transformation or derivation problem treated by most "problem-solving" programs is expressed in a formal notation, and various methods for "problem-solving" are reviewed. The conventional search tree is generalized in to a search lattice which can accomodate multiple-input operators, e.g. resolution. The paper argues that descriptions of heuristic methods can be significantly compacted if a higher degree of formalization is used. This point is illustrated with two practical examples.
