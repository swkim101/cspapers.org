We study a number of protection schemes with respect to their effectiveness in providing security for statistical data bases, their feasibility and their ease of implementation. A new method is proposed, and two implementations presented. One implementation guarantees perfect protection against leakage of information about individuals; the other requires very little implementation effort, but has a small probability of leakage.
