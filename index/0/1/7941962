Even though local search heuristics are the method of choice in practice for many well-studied optimization problems, most of them behave poorly in the worst case. This is, in particular, the case for the Maximum-Cut Problem, for which local search can take an exponential number of steps to terminate and the problem of computing a local optimum is PLS-complete. To narrow the gap between theory and practice, we study local search for the Maximum-Cut Problem in the framework of smoothed analysis in which inputs are subject to a small amount of random noise. We show that the smoothed number of iterations is quasi-polynomial, that is, it is bounded from above by a polynomial in nlog n and φ, where n denotes the number of nodes and φ denotes the perturbation parameter. This shows that worst-case instances are fragile, and it is a first step in explaining why they are rarely observed in practice.
