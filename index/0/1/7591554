The demands on a natural language understanding system used for spoken language differ somewhat from the demands of text processing. For processing spoken language, there is a tension between the system being as robust as necessary, and as constrained as possible. The robust system will a t tempt to find as sensible an interpretation as possible, even in the presence of performance errors by the speaker, or recognition errors by the speech recognizer. In contrast, in order to provide language constraints to a speech recognizer, a system should be able to detect that a recognized string is not a sentence of English, and disprefer that recognition hypothesis from the speech recognizer. If the coupling is to be tight, with parsing and recognition interleaved, then the parser should be able to enforce as many constraints as possible for partial utterances. The approach taken in Gemini is to tightly constrain language recognition to limit overgeneration, but to extend the language analysis to recognize certain characteristic patterns of spoken utterances (but not generally thought of as part of grammar) and to recognize specific types of performance errors by the speaker.
