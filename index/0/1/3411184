Trusted computing plays a pivotal role to facilitate a party to evaluate the integrity of others or to ensure desired security assurance, which is a very challenging task in large-scale and heterogeneous computing environments. Built upon the success from 2006 to 2011, the seventh ACM Workshop on Scalable Trusted Computing continues to serve as a forum for researchers as well as practitioners to disseminate and discuss recent advances and emerging issues. This proceedings includes selected papers that focus on system architectures, enabling mechanisms, and novel applications of trusted computing.
