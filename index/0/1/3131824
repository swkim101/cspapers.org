The RAGS proposals for generic specification of NLG systems includes a detailed account of data representation, but only an outline view of processing aspects. In this paper we introduce a modular processing architecture with a concrete implementation which aims to meet the RAGS goals of transparency and reusability. We illustrate the model with the RICHES system -- a generation system built from simple linguistically-motivated modules.
