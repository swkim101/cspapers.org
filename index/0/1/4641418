When designing a user-friendly Mobility Assistive Device (MAD) for mobility constrained people, it is important to take into account the diverse spectrum of disabilities, which results to completely different needs to be covered by the MAD for each specific user. An intelligent adaptive behavior is necessary. In this work we present experimental results, using an in house developed methodology for assessing the gait of users with different mobility status while interacting with a robotic MAD. We use data from a laser scanner, mounted on the MAD to track the legs using Particle Filters and Probabilistic Data Association (PDA-PF). The legs' states are fed to an HMM-based pathological gait cycle recognition system to compute in real-time the gait parameters that are crucial for the mobility status characterization of the user. We aim to show that a gait assessment system would be an important feedback for an intelligent MAD. Thus, we use this system to compare the gaits of the subjects using two different control settings of the MAD and we experimentally validate the ability of our system to recognize the impact of the control designs on the users' walking performance. The results demonstrate that a generic control scheme does not meet every patient's needs, and therefore, an Adaptive Context-Aware MAD (ACA MAD), that can understand the specific needs of the user, is important for enhancing the human-robot physical interaction.
