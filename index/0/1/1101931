The emerging SOI technologies provide an increased body bias range compared to traditional bulk technologies, opening new opportunities. From the power management perspective, a new degree of freedom is added to the supply voltage and clock frequency variation, increasing the complexity of the power optimization problem. In this paper, a method is proposed to manage the power consumed in an FD-SOI circuit through supply and body bias voltages, and clock frequency variation. Results for a Digital Signal Processor in STMicroelectronics 28nm FD-SOI technology show that the power reduction ratio can reach 17%.
