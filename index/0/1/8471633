Lazy Initialization Multilayer Modeling (LIMM) is an object oriented modeling language targeted to the declarative definition of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) for Model Driven Engineering. It focuses on the precise definition of modeling frameworks spanning over multiple layers. In particular, it follows a two dimensional architecture instead of the linear architecture followed by many other modeling frameworks. The novelty of our approach is to use lazy initialization for the definition of mapping between different modeling abstractions, within and across multiple layers, hence providing the basis for exploiting the potential of metamodeling.
