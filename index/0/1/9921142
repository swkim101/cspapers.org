This paper proposes a cooperation mechanism among seller agents and builds a model based on multi-agent system. In the model, a manger agent has been set to watch activities of other agents. It will encourage the cooperative sellers and punish the non-cooperative seller agents by adjust the seller’s reputation in the repository. With this mechanism, a seller would complete the trade with the buyer although he doesn't have enough items and the stock of the seller need not too much. The model is simulated in a Multi-Agent simulation platform——JADE. The experimental results show that this cooperation mechanism widens the bound of cooperation among the sellers and saves the stock cost of the sellers.
