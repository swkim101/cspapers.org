This paper investigates the role of trust metrics in attack-resistant public key certification. We present an analytical framework for understanding the effectiveness of trust metrics in resisting attacks, including a characterization of the space of possible attacks. Within this framework, we establish the theoretical best case for a trust metric. Finally, we present a practical trust metric based on network flow that meets this theoretical bound.
