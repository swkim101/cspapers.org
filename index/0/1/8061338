We present an evaluation of a flexible framework and runtime software system for the dynamic load balancing of asynchronous and highly adaptive and irregular applications. These applications, which include parallel unstructured and adaptive mesh refinement, serve as building blocks for a large class of scientific applications. Extensive study has lead to the development of solutions to the dynamic load balancing problem for loosely synchronous and computation intensive programs; however, these methods are not suitable for asynchronous and highly adaptive applications. We evaluate a new software framework which includes support for an Active Messages style communication mechanism, global name space, transparent object migration, and preemptive decision making. Our results from both a 3-dimensional parallel advancing front mesh generation program, as well as a synthetic microbenchmark, indicate that this new framework out-performs two existing general-purpose, well-known, and widely used software systems for the dynamic load balancing of adpative and irregular parallel applications.
