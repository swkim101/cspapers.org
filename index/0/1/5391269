Researchers typically evaluate word prediction using keystroke savings, however, this measure is not straightforward. We present several complications in computing keystroke savings which may affect interpretation and comparison of results. We address this problem by developing two gold standards as a frame for interpretation. These gold standards measure the maximum keystroke savings under two different approximations of an ideal language model. The gold standards additionally narrow the scope of deficiencies in a word prediction system.
