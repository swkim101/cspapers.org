While legged locomotion is a rapidly advancing area in robotics, several issues regarding the performance of such robots on deformable ground are still open. In this paper, we generate a pronking gait on a quadruped robot using a controller, which takes into account the effects of ground deformation. The controller, initially developed for monopods, is modified appropriately to operate for quadrupeds. The robot uses a reaction wheel to retain a desired body pitch. The dynamic models of leg motor drivetrains and of the reaction wheel are incorporated and their importance in the design of legged robots is highlighted. Simulation results show good performance in reaching commanded apex heights and forward velocities when traversing various deformable terrains, demonstrating that the developed controller is quite promising.
