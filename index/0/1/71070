Most existing content-based image retrieval systems do not support translation, scale, and rotation invariance. Our earlier experience in implementing an image database suggests that supporting rotation invariance in particular entails serious performance cost. Despite e cient content-based image indexing schemes, the response time for nearest-neighbor queries to a polygonal shape image database remains high, because the expensive cost of computing the distance metric. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution approach to speed up the query processing by calculating an approximate distance range rather than an exact distance value between two shape images. The indexing scheme needs to be modi ed accordingly so that it can use the approximate distance ranges to prune away irrelevant parts of the database, and only resorts to the exact distance function when the list of candidates is reduced to a small set. We developed two such approximation techniques, one is called the conversion approach while the other is called the sampling approach. Through a detailed performance experiment, we show that the conversion and sampling approaches are about 3.49 and 8.61 times faster than the original single resolution method respectively, while returning identical query results. When both multi-resolution methods are applied in combination, the overall speedup jumps to 21, indicating that these two techniques are orthogonal and complementary to each other.
