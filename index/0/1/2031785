The concept of the genealogical approach to the layout problem is presented. The system pursues the idea of flexible modules and is capable of dealing with arbitrarily complex tasks. The genealogical tree of the system provides a mainframe for organizing the information flow. Results of the system routines are described in terms of transitions between flexibility classes of modules.
