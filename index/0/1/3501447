Equity is a core component of many computer science teacher preparation programs. One promising approach is addressing unconscious bias in teachers related to the race, ethnicity or gender of students. These biases may impact teacher expectations and interactions with students in a variety of classroom scenarios. Early literature on interventions targeting unconscious bias suggests that asking individuals to suppress biases is counterproductive. Our work uses the affordances of interactive online practice spaces to instead focus on specific teaching decisions that may be impacted by unconscious bias. We developed practice spaces and embedded them within CS teacher preparation programs. Our early findings indicate that practice spaces produce rich learning opportunities and analysis yields insight into what biases or beliefs may be interfering with teachers enacting principles of equity like disrupting preparatory privilege. In this workshop, we'll use online practice spaces to examine how we approach different classroom situations related to equity, and practice how we respond. We'll try two different variations on these practice spaces, and create space for participants to try a variety of other iterations on their own. We'll close by inviting folks to share their own stories of important classroom moments that problematized how they approached equitable teaching, and prototype creating practice spaces from those experiences. Participants will leave with links to practice spaces, and related curriculum materials they can use in CS teacher preparation courses, in teacher-led PLC groups, online CS teacher groups, or with local CSTA chapters.
