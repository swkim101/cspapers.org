We prove that every graph has a spectral sparsifier with a number of edges linear in its number of vertices. As linear-sized spectral sparsifiers of complete graphs are expanders, our sparsifiers of arbitrary graphs can be viewed as generalizations of expander graphs. In particular, we prove that for every d > 1 and every undirected, weighted graph G = (V,E,w) on n vertices, there exists a weighted graph H=(V,F,~{w}) with at most ⌈d(n-1)⌉ edges such that for every x ∈ R<sup>V</sup>, [x<sup>T</sup> L<sub>G</sub> x ≤ x<sup>T</sup> L<sub>H</sub> x ≤ ((d+1+2√d)/(d+1-2√d)) • x<sup>T</sup> L<sub>G</sub> x] where L<sub>G</sub> and L<sub>H</sub> are the Laplacian matrices of G and H, respectively. Thus, H approximates G spectrally at least as well as a Ramanujan expander with dn/2 edges approximates the complete graph. We give an elementary deterministic polynomial time algorithm for constructing H.
