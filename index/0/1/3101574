The goal of this paper was to model a specification language and its analyser using axiomatic methods derived from those applied previously to abstract data type and state transition specifications. The models attempt to cover many interesting features of PSL/PSA, a widely used specification language and analyser for information systems. Simple properties expected to hold for actual PSL/PSA were formalized and proved about some models, with assumptions about undefined parts. Both model formulation and property proofs were performed within the AFFIRM Specification and Verification System. The results show (1) the applicability of axiomatic methods for modeling a new kind of software system, (2) insights into the PSL/PSA class of specification system, (3) a possible route for formal definition of such analysers, and (4) additional lessons on the art of specification, modeling, verification, and validation.
