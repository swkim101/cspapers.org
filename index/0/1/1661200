In this paper, we propose an adaptive ontology-based approach for related paper identification, to meet most researchers' practical needs. By searching ontology, we can return a diverse set of papers that are explicitly and implicitly related to an input paper. Moreover, our approach does not rely on known ontology. Instead, we build and update ontology for a collection with any domain of interest. Being independent from known ontology, our approach is much more adaptive for different domains.
