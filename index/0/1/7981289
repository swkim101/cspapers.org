Today's rapid advances in the physical implementation of quantum computers demand for scalable synthesis methods in order to map practical logic designs to quantum architectures. We present a synthesis algorithm for quantum computing based on k-LUT networks, which can be derived from Verilog netlists using state-of-the-art and of-the-shelf mapping algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in automatically synthesizing several floating point networks up to double precision. As many quantum algorithms target scientific simulation applications, they can make rich use of floating point arithmetic components. But due to the lack of quantum circuit descriptions for those components, it is not possible to find a realistic cost estimation for the algorithms. Our synthesized benchmarks provide cost estimates that allow quantum algorithm designers to provide the first complete cost estimates for a host of quantum algorithms. This is an essential step towards the goal of understanding which quantum algorithms will be practical in the first generations of quantum computers.
