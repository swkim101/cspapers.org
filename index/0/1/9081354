There has been significant interest in MOOCs, both inside and outside the educational community. Some of this interest focuses on how they could be used to replace traditional brick-and-mortar education while others are interested in using them to supplement more traditional courses. Instructors can also use MOOCs to gain new insight into teaching and learning by taking on a student perspective. This paper describes how taking several MOOCs has given me a better understanding of student motivation, time commitment issues, and student perception of grading and describes how I am feeding this knowledge back into my own courses.
