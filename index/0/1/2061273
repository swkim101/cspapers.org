We present YETI, an Eclipse plug-in providing support for TinyOS development. YETI provides features well-known from development environments for other languages such as syntax highlighting, code completion and error detection. Furthermore, it includes an additional set of tools which are designed to ease the TinyOS development process for both newcomers and experienced developers. The plugin seamlessly integrates with the existing TinyOS toolchain and provides debugging support on the target platform using a JTAG hardware adapter.
