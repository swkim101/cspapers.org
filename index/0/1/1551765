Online forums host a rich information exchange, often with contributions from many subject matter experts. In this work we evaluate algorithms for thread retrieval in a large and active online forum community. We compare methods that utilize thread structure to a na√Øve method that treats a thread as a single document. We find that thread structure helps, and additionally selective methods of thread scoring, which only use evidence from a small number of messages in the thread, significantly and consistently outperform inclusive methods which use all the messages in the thread.
