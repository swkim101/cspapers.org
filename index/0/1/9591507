Reducing data communication cost is a critical performance consideration and the need is more acute when using libraries like the OpenSHMEM Reference library which has to sacrifice some performance optimizations for portability. Being a Partitioned Global Address Space library the OpenSHMEM reference library provides more control over data placement, yet, some communication intensive applications would benefit from the libraries prior knowledge of its communication pattern. In this poster we discuss a low cost portable methodology to provide PE re-numbering to facilitate maximum on-node communication. We validate our method using the well-documented 2D heat transfer application.
