In order to realize their full potential, multimodal systems need to support not just input from multiple modes, but also synchronized integration of modes. Johnston et al (1997) model this integration using a unification operation over typed feature structures. This is an effective solution for a broad class of systems, but limits multimodal utterances to combinations of a single spoken phrase with a single gesture. We show how the unification-based approach can be scaled up to provide a full multimodal grammar formalism. In conjunction with a multidimensional chart parser, this approach supports integration of multiple elements distributed across the spatial, temporal, and acoustic dimensions of multimodal interaction. Integration strategies are stated in a high level unification-based rule formalism supporting rapid prototyping and iterative development of multimodal systems.
