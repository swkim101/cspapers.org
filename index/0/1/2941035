A fitted bed sheet and a method of making the sheet from a rectangular blank of sheet material are disclosed. Resiliently extensibile strips having catches positioned at predetermined locations along the strips are enclosed within longitudinal, open-ended sheaths extending along opposite marginal edges of the blank. One end of each strip extends out of the open end of the sheath and the other end is anchored to the sheath. The blank is folded inwardly upon itself along fold lines to dispose the sheaths in a spaced-apart, generally parallel relationship on the blank to form laterally opposed double-layered panels. Seams are then formed diagonally across the corners of the panels from adjacent the end of the sheaths to points along the fold lines so that a fitted sheet is formed. When the sheet is placed on a mattress, it is drawn into fitting engagement by pulling on the extended ends of the extensible strips and placing the catches over edges of the open ends of the sheaths.
