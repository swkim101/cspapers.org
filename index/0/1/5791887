Image Based Rendering (IBR) allows interactive scene exploration from images alone. However, despite considerable development in the area, one of the main obstacles to better quality and more realistic visualizations is the occurrence of visually disagreeable artifacts. In this paper we present a methodology to map out the perception of IBR-typical artifacts. This work presents an alternative to traditional image and video quality evaluation methods by using an EEG device to determine the implicit visual processes in the human brain. Our work demonstrates the distinct differences in the perception of different types of visual artifacts and the implications of these differences.
