With the rapid growth of event-based social networks, the demand of event recommendation becomes increasingly important. While, the existing event recommendation approaches are batch learning fashion. Such approaches are impractical for real-world recommender systems where training data often arrive sequentially. Hence, we present an online event recommendation method. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of our method.
