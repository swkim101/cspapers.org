Logic synthesis systems are complex systems and algorithmic research in synthesis has become highly specialized. This creates a gap where it is often not clear how an advance in a particular algorithm translates into a better synthesis system. This tutorial starts by describing a set of constraints which synthesis algorithms must satisfy to be useful. A small set of established techniques are reviewed relative to these criteria to understand their applicability and the potential for further research in these areas.
