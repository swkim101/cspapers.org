This paper describes a novel methodology for programming grinding tool-paths, tool-path orientations and grinding strategies based on the captured trajectories of a surface finishing tool operated by the Skilled-Operator. In order to extract the grinding parameters and strategy from the trajectory of the skilled operator, the manual tool-path is first segmented into tool-path primitives. The order of the manual tool-path primitives will form the grinding strategy. Next, the robotic tool-path primitives are then generated based on the boundaries of the manual tool-path primitive in a computer-aided-manufacturing software. The orientations of the manual tool-path are used to anchor the orientations of the robotic tool-path. Spherical linear interpolation and spherical spline quaternion interpolation are used to interpolate the orientations for the robotic tool-path points along the cross curves, followed by the flow curves respectively. The programmed robotic tool-paths generated were subsequently applied and proven to be able to grind the work-piece to the desired profile within the desired tolerance.
