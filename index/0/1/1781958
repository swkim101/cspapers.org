Classic resource recommenders like Collaborative Filtering (CF) treat users as being just another entity, neglecting non-linear user-resource dynamics shaping attention and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid recommendation strategy that refines CF by capturing these dynamics. The evaluation results reveal that our approach substantially improves CF and, depending on the dataset, successfully competes with a computationally much more expensive Matrix Factorization variant.
