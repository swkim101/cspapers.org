My PhD research has been on the algorithmic and formal aspects of computational linguistics, esp. in the areas of parsing and machine translation. I am interested in developing efficient algorithms for formalisms with rich expressive power, so that we can have a better modeling of human languages without sacrificing efficiency. In doing so, I hope to help integrating more linguistic and structural knowledge with modern statistical techniques, and in particular, for syntax-based machine translation (MT) systems.Among other projects, I have been working on k-best parsing, synchronous binarization, and syntax-directed translation.
