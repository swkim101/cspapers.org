This paper develops a new approach for extremely fast detection in domains where the distribution of positive and negative examples is highly skewed (e.g. face detection or database retrieval). In such domains a cascade of simple classifiers each trained to achieve high detection rates and modest false positive rates can yield a final detector with many desirable features: including high detection rates, very low false positive rates, and fast performance. Achieving extremely high detection rates, rather than low error, is not a task typically addressed by machine learning algorithms. We propose a new variant of AdaBoost as a mechanism for training the simple classifiers used in the cascade. Experimental results in the domain of face detection show the training algorithm yields significant improvements in performance over conventional AdaBoost. The final face detection system can process 15 frames per second, achieves over 90% detection, and a false positive rate of 1 in a 1,000,000.
