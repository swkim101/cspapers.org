In this paper a novel approach to the problem of decentralized agreement toward a common point in space in a multi-agent system is proposed. Our method allows the agents to agree on the relative location of the network centroid respect to themselves, on a common reference frame and therefore on a common heading. Using this information a global positioning system for the agents using only local measurements can be achieved. In the proposed scenario, an agent is able to sense the distance between itself and its neighbors and the direction in which it sees its neighbors with respect to its local reference frame. Furthermore only point-to-point asynchronous communications between neighboring agents are allowed thus achieving robustness against random communication failures. The proposed algorithms can be thought as general tools to locally retrieve global information usually not available to the agents.
