Thorup and Zwick [2001a] proposed a landmark distance oracle with the following properties. Given an n-vertex undirected graph G = (V, E) and a parameter k = 1, 2, …, their oracle has size O(kn1 + 1/k), and upon a query (u, v) it constructs a path Π between u and v of length δ(u, v) such that dG(u, v) ⩽ δ(u, v) ⩽ (2k − 1)dG(u, v). The query time of the oracle from Thorup and Zwick [2001a] is O(k) (in addition to the length of the returned path), and it was subsequently improved to O(1) [Wulff-Nilsen 2012; Chechik 2014]. A major drawback of the oracle of Thorup and Zwick [2001a] is that its space is Ω(n · logn). Mendel and Naor [2006] devised an oracle with space O(n1 + 1/k) and stretch O(k), but their oracle can only report distance estimates and not actual paths. In this article, we devise a path-reporting distance oracle with size O(n1 + 1/k), stretch O(k), and query time O(nε), for an arbitrarily small constant ε > 0. In particular, for k = logn, our oracle provides logarithmic stretch using linear size. Another variant of our oracle has size O(nloglogn), polylogarithmic stretch, and query time O(loglogn). For unweighted graphs, we devise a distance oracle with multiplicative stretch O(1), additive stretch O(β(k)), for a function β(·), space O(n1 + 1/k), and query time O(nε), for an arbitrarily small constant ε > 0. The tradeoff between multiplicative stretch and size in these oracles is far below Erdős’s girth conjecture threshold (which is stretch 2k − 1 and size O(n1 + 1/k)). Breaking the girth conjecture tradeoff is achieved by exhibiting a tradeoff of different nature between additive stretch β(k) and size O(n1 + 1/k). A similar type of tradeoff was exhibited by a construction of (1 + ε, β)-spanners due to Elkin and Peleg [2001]. However, so far (1 + ε, β)-spanners had no counterpart in the distance oracles’ world. An important novel tool that we develop on the way to these results is a distance-preserving path-reporting oracle. We believe that this oracle is of independent interest.
