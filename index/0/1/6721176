Two concurrency control mechanisms, the SDD-1 system and Dynamic Timestamping Method, are evaluated in terms of protocol synchronization delays and average transaction response time by using simulation. Relationship among average protocol synchronization delay, average transaction response time, average 10 service delay, communication delay, and other system parameters is analyzed by using regression analysis. The statistical distribution functions of transaction response times and synchronization delays are then examined to see if they fit exponential, erlangian, or some other distribution functions.
