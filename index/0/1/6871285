A geometric construction is presented which is shown to be an effective tool for understanding and implementing multi-category support vector classification. It is demonstrated how this construction can be used to extend many other existing two-class kernel-based classification methodologies in a straightforward way while still preserving attractive properties of individual algorithms. Reducing training times through incorporating the results of pairwise classification is also discussed and experimental results presented.
