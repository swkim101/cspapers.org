Research in artificial intelligence ranges over many subdisciplines, such as Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and MultiAgent Systems. Recently, AI techniques have become increasingly robust and complex, and there has been enhanced interest in research at the intersection of seemingly disparate research areas. Such work is motivated by the observation that there is actually a great deal of commonality among areas, that can be exploited within subfields. One example of a successful combination is the intersection of machine learning and multiagent systems. For example, [Kearns et al., 2001] proposed an efficient graphical model-based algorithm for calculating Nash equilibria. Going in the other direction, [Datta et al., 2015] showed that solution concepts from cooperative game theory can be used to uniquely characterize the influence measure of classifiers.
