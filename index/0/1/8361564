The VDL system for the description of programming languages which was originally used for the definition of PL/I is extended to the description of processors. This paper shows the relationship between the language of definition and the abstract machine over which the semantics of the language are specified. It is demonstrated that the level of description can be chosen to suit the various needs of the computing community, each level being well nested within its outer level, whilst using only one language of definition.
 From the point of view of processor design, indications are given of the means by which a description can be transformed into an implementable system of data paths, registers and drivers.
