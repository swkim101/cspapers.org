An experiment was conducted to examine the utility of conducting an intensively mathematical FORTRAN program course by the use of interactive terminals. IBM'S TSO operating system was the chosen vehicle. In addition to text editing, students were required to gain as much FORTRAN knowledge as before. It was found that students at the lower end of the class did better. In addition, there were fewer student withdrawals from the class. Lastly, interactive skills were used in following classes.
