Whereas a number of semantics-based concurrency control schemes for objector~ented systems haue been proposed in the literature, each scheme has approached the issue jrom fairly narrow considerations. In this paper, we have made an @Ort to di8coveT, jTom .l%st principles, the natuTe oj concurrency semantics inherent in objects. Towards this end, we identify the dimensions along which object and opeTatzon semantics can be modeled. These dimensions are then used to classify and unify existing semantic-based concurrency control schemes. To formalize thig classification, we pTopose a gTaph representation for objects that can be derived .fTom the abstract specification o.f an object, Based on thz8 Tepvesentatzon, which helps to identify the semantic information inherent in an object, we propose a methodology that shows how varioru semantic notions applicable to concurrency control can be etiectively combined to improve concurrency. In this process, we identijy and exploit a new souTce of semantic information, namely, the oTde?ing among component objects, to further enhance concurrency. Lastly, we present a gcheme, based on this methodology, foT deriving compatibility tables fo~ oper-ations on objects.
