We propose an improvement on a state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction algorithm, Topical PageRank (TPR), incorporating topical information from topic models. While the original algorithm requires a random walk for each topic in the topic model being used, ours is independent of the topic model, computing but a single PageRank for each text regardless of the amount of topics in the model. This increases the speed drastically and enables it for use on large collections of text using vast topic models, while not altering performance of the original algorithm.
