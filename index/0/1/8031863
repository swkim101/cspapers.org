This paper presents a framework for planning safe and efficient paths for a legged robot in rough and unstructured terrain. The proposed approach allows to exploit the distinctive obstacle negotiation capabilities of legged robots, while keeping the complexity low enough to enable planning over considerable distances in short time. We compute typical terrain characteristics such as slope, roughness, and steps to build a traversability map. This map is used to assess the costs of individual robot footprints as a function of the robot-specific obstacle negotiating capabilities for steps, gaps and stairs. Our sampling-based planner employs the RRT* algorithm to optimize path length and safety. The planning framework has a hierarchical architecture to frequently replan the path during execution as new terrain is perceived with onboard sensors. Furthermore, a cascaded planning structure makes use of different levels of simplification to allow for fast search in simple environments, while retaining the ability to find complex solutions, such as paths through narrow passages. The proposed navigation planning framework is integrated on the quadrupedal robot StarlETH and extensively tested in simulation as well as on the real platform.
