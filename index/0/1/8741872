Garbage Collection (GC) has critical impact on the performance and robustness of Java Application Servers. We proposed a Service-Oriented Garbage Collector (SOGC), which exploits the fact that remote objects live longer than local objects. SOGC allocates remote and local objects in different spaces in the young generation. The experimental results showed that SOGC increases the performance and robustness of Java Application Servers compared to traditional generational approaches.
