Spurious results are an inherent problem of most static analysis methods. These methods, in an effort to produce conservative results, overestimate the executable behavior of a program. Infeasible paths and imprecise alias resolution are the two causes of such inaccuracies. In this paper we present an approach for improving the accuracy of Petri net-based analysis of concurrent programs by including additional program state information in the Petri net. We present empirical results that demonstrate the improvements in accuracy and, in some cases, the reduction in the search space that result from applying this approach to concurrent Ada programs.
