This paper describes a study of the patterns of translational equivalence exhibited by a variety of bitexts. The study found that the complexity of these patterns in every bitext was higher than suggested in the literature. These findings shed new light on why "syntactic" constraints have not helped to improve statistical translation models, including finite-state phrase-based models, tree-to-string models, and tree-to-tree models. The paper also presents evidence that inversion transduction grammars cannot generate some translational equivalence relations, even in relatively simple real bitexts in syntactically similar languages with rigid word order.
