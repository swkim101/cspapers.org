This collaborative learning pilot project was in support of a major revision of computer information science (CIS)-oriented curricula. The entire CIS project, sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), will develop detailed curriculum guidelines, supporting laboratory material, original learning and teaching paradigms, and methodology for dealing with complex information systems. The pilot project addressed many of the issues in the latter two areas: new paradigms for teaching and learning and dealing with complex information systems.Specifically, the many aspects of having CIS students gain experience with large information systems problems in industry environment are addressed. This pilot project was developed and supported by Boeing Information &amp; Support Services and the University of Washington Department of Computer Science and Engineering (UWCSE).
