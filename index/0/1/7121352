Vulnerability management, often used as a generic term for any organizational and technical security controls in the context of identifying, assessing, and mitigating security-relevant software and network weaknesses, has specific challenges in decentralized communication networks such as research and education networks operated by higher education institutions. While many large organizations perform professional vulnerability management and related activities, especially risk management, which are supported by commercial and open source software products, universities and other academic environments still often struggle with ad-hoc and scope-limited approaches due to often unclear responsibilities and a lack of suitable tool support. This poster presents VUDEC, an integrated vulnerability management framework tailored for the requirements of decentrally operated networks; besides organizational aspects of the vulnerability management process, its implementation supports, among other functionality, a highly distributed vulnerability scan architecture and full multi-tenancy capability.
