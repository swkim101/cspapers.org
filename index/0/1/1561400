The author implements the relatively new enterprise of adapting formal methods for security to work on code instead of abstract models. The goal is to lower the practical cost of security protocol verification by eliminating the need to write a separate formal model. The main technical content is on extracting pi-calculus models from protocol implementation code. Our software is developed in the functional language F#, a dialect of ML
