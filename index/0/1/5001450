We will demonstrate a novel graphical interface for correcting search errors in the output of a speech recognizer. This interface allows the user to visualize the word lattice by "pulling apart" regions of the hypothesis to reveal a cloud of words simlar to the "tag clouds" popular in many Web applications. This interface is potentially useful for dictation on portable touchscreen devices such as the Nokia N800 and other mobile Internet devices.
