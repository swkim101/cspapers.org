The Scenario-based Engineering Process (SEP) is a novel approach to developing complex systems (Haddock & Harbison 1994). SEP builds new application systems through a selection process that groups primitive components into application specific components. The selection of primitive components and the construction of interfaces among components in an application system is currently a tedious manual undertaking. The automation of this process will require a configuration system that can support the complex interactions of the components, the dynamic requirements of users, and the capabilities of providing multiple viewpoints and managing extensive domains.
