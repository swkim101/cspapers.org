Twitter, the most famous micro-blogging service and online social network, collects millions of tweets every day. Due to the length limitation, users usually need to explore other ways to enrich the content of their tweets. Some studies have provided findings to suggest that users can benefit from added hyperlinks in tweets. In this paper, we focus on the hyperlinks in Twitter and propose a new application, called hyperlink recommendation in Twitter. We expect that the recommended hyperlinks can be used to enrich the information of user tweets. A three-way tensor is used to model the user-tweet-hyperlink collaborative relations. Two tensor-based clustering approaches, tensor decomposition-based clustering (TDC) and tensor approximation-based clustering (TAC) are developed to group the users, tweets and hyperlinks with similar interests, or similar contexts. Recommendation is then made based on the reconstructed tensor using cluster information. The evaluation results in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) shows the advantages of both the TDC and TAC approaches over a baseline recommendation approach, i.e., memory-based collaborative filtering. Comparatively, the TAC approach achieves better performance than the TDC approach.
