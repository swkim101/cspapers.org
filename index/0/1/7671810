In this paper, we adopt general-sum stochastic games as a framework for multiagent reinforcement learning. Our work extends previous work by Littman on zero-sum stochastic games to a broader framework. We design a multiagent Q-learning method under this framework, and prove that it converges to a Nash equilibrium under speci ed conditions. This algorithm is useful for nding the optimal strategy when there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in the game. When there exist multiple Nash equilibria in the game, this algorithm should be combined with other learning techniques to nd optimal strategies.
