Many handheld applications receive data from a primary database server and operate in an intermittently connected environment these days. They maintain data consistency with data sources through sychronization. In certain applications such as sales force automation, it is highly desirable if updates on the data source can be reflected at the handheld applications immediately. This paper proposes an efficient method to synchronize XML data on multiple mobile devices. Each device retrieves and caches a local copy of data from the database source based on a regular path expression. These local copies may be overlapping or disjoint with each other. An efficient mechanism is proposed to find all the disjoint copies to avoid unnecessary synchronizations. Each update to the data source will then be checked to identify all handheld applications which are affected by the update. Communication costs can be further reduced by eliminating the forwarding of unnecessary operations to groups of mobile clients.
