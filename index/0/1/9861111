Recent trends on advanced AGV are reviewed and discussed with examples. Special concern is made for automated position finding, guidance and multivehicle strategies, as well as communication systems. Focused are on engineering, electromechanical and optical problems. In addition to conventional manufacturing and advanced industrial applications, service vehicles such as floor cleaning, blind aids and off-road uses are described. New electric power supply systems are also presented.<<ETX>>
