The title of my talk comes from a Hollywood executive's comments on Fred Astaire's screen test. Much later, Katherine Hepburn remarking on Fred's eventual success with his most frequent partner said, "Fred gave Ginger [Rogers] class, and Ginger gave Fred sex [appeal]". I was surprised and delighted to win this award, and it started me thinking about how I got to where I am today. In my talk, I'll look back at 36 years of learning and teaching programming, and reflect on my many "dancing" partners. Some were around for a short time, some I dance with still, and some I dance with only in my dreams. In some cases, I led; in other cases I followed. Some dances were as graceful as a waltz, while others were more like an apache dance. During this talk I'll find some time to discuss "a view from the trenches" of four decades of teaching introductory programming, and if I can muster the courage, speculate on the future.
