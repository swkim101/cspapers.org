TMEAS is a program that implements a testability measure for digital circuits. In this paper important features of TMEAS are described, including the circuit models it assumes, the testability measure it applies, and the various commands for analyzing the information generated by the testability measure. In addition, a discussion is provided of possible use modes for TMEAS and some examples of its use so far.
