Reducing power consumption has become one of the primary challenges in chip design, and therefore significant efforts are being devoted to find holistic solutions on power reduction from the device level up to the system level. Among a plethora of low power devices that are being explored, single-electron transistors (SETs) at room temperature are particularly attractive. Although prior work has proposed a binary decision diagram-based reconfigurable logic architecture using SETs, it lacks an automated synthesis tool for the device. Consequently, in this work, we develop a product-term-based approach that synthesizes a logic circuit by mapping all its product terms into the SET architecture. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach on a set of MCNC benchmarks.
