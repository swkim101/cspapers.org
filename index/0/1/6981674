We propose a label propagation approach to geolocation prediction based on Modified Adsorption, with two enhancements:(1) the removal of "celebrity" nodes to increase location homophily and boost tractability, and (2) he incorporation of text-based geolocation priors for test users. Experiments over three Twitter benchmark datasets achieve state-of-the-art results, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhancements.
