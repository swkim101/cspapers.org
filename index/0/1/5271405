A model of auditory grouping is described in which auditory attention plays a key role. The model is based upon an oscillatory correlation framework, in which neural oscillators representing a single perceptual stream are synchronised, and are desynchronised from oscillators representing other streams. The model suggests a mechanism by which attention can be directed to the high or low tones in a repeating sequence of tones with alternating frequencies. In addition, it simulates the perceptual segregation of a mistuned harmonic from a complex tone.
