The display names that an individual uses in various online social networks always contain some redundant information because some people tend to use the similar names across different networks to make them easier to remember or to build their online reputation. In this paper, we aim to measure the redundant information between different display names of the same individual. Based on the crosssite linking function, we first develop a specific distributed crawler to extract the display names that individuals select for different social networks, and we give an overview on the display names we extracted. Then we measure and analyze the redundant information in three ways: length similarity, character similarity and letter distribution similarity, comparing with display names of different individuals. We also analyze the evolution of redundant information over time. We find 45% of users tend to use the same display name across OSNs. Our findings also demonstrate that display names of the same individual show high similarity. The evolution analysis results show that redundant information is time-independent. Awareness of the redundant information between the display names can benefit many applications, such as user identification across social networks.
