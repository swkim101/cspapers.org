A technique for simulating incomplete systems is given which allows performance prediction during system design. This technique, called integrated simulation, allows the system design to itself be a simulation model, thus avoiding the overhead of maintaining a separate, valid simulation model for the system. The paper presents integrated simulation in the framework of a system modeling language called the Program Process Modeling Language, PPML. This language provides a means for describing systems of concurrent processes in both abstract and explicit terms, thus lending itself well to a top-down design method. In the design process, any PPML representation of the system can be simulated directly, from the most abstract design to the completely elaborated system. Simulation of the completely elaborated system is, in fact, simply the system in execution. The paper defines PPML and describes the techniques required to simulate PPML systems given various underlying machines. It concludes with a discussion of the limitations of the integrated simulation method.
