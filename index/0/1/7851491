In contrast to traditional binocular or multi-view stereo approaches, the adequately sampled space of observations in light-field imaging allows, to obtain dense and high quality depth maps. It also extends capabilities beyond those of traditional methods. Previously, constant intensity has been assumed for estimating disparity of orientation in most approaches to analyze epipolar plane images (EPIs). Here, we introduce a modified structure tensor approach which improves depth estimation. This extension also includes a model of non-constant intensity on EPI manifolds. We derive an approach to estimate high quality depth maps in luminance-gradient light fields, as well as in color-filtered light fields. Color-filtered light fields pose particular challenges due to the fact that structures can change significantly in appearance with wavelength and can completely vanish at some wavelength. We demonstrate solutions to this challenge and obtain a dense sRGB image reconstruction in addition to dense depth maps.
