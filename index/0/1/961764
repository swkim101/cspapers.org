An iterative predict and match system renders CAD models to re ne predictions about detectable features in both optical and range sensor data Predicted features adapt to a scene speci c interpretation which includes a time of day lighting model and reasoning about un modeled occluding surfaces During rendering links between the rendered image and the D CAD model are retained to propagate information between object model scene and sensors coordinate reference frames Precise geometric matching of objects occluded by as much as is demonstrated
