This paper presents an approach to text categorization that i) uses no machine learning and ii) reacts on-the-fly to unknown words. These features are important for categorizing Blog articles, which are updated on a daily basis and filled with newly coined words. We categorize 600 Blog articles into 12 domains. As a result, our categorization method achieved an accuracy of 94.0% (564/600).
