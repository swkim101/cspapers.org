We define the Diverse Action Manipulation (DAMA) problem in which we are given a mobile robot, a set of movable objects, and a set of diverse, possibly non-prehensile manipulation actions, and the goal is to find a sequence of actions that moves each of the objects to a goal configuration. We show that the DAMA problem can be framed as a multi-modal planning problem and describe a hierarchical algorithm that takes advantage of this multi-modal nature. We also extend our earlier forward search sampling algorithm to a bi-directional version. We give results on a complicated manipulation domain and demonstrate that both new algorithms are significantly more efficient than the original, and that the hierarchical algorithm is usually much more efficient than the forward or bi-directional searches.
