ALI is a procedural language to specify VLSI layouts. It allows the designer to describe layouts without reference to the sizes and positions of the layout elements or to the distances between them. Among the interesting characteristics of ALI are that it does not need design rule checking, is easy to extend, facilitates the division of labor and permits the easy update of a layout to new design rules or to new processes. The general features of the language and the experience gained with a preliminary implementation of it are described.
