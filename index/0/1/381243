In this paper we present a generative latent variable model for rating-based collaborative filtering called the User Rating Profile model (URP). The generative process which underlies URP is designed to produce complete user rating profiles, an assignment of one rating to each item for each user. Our model represents each user as a mixture of user attitudes, and the mixing proportions are distributed according to a Dirichlet random variable. The rating for each item is generated by selecting a user attitude for the item, and then selecting a rating according to the preference pattern associated with that attitude. URP is related to several models including a multinomial mixture model, the aspect model [7], and LDA [1], but has clear advantages over each.
