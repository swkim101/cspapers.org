In most network models for quality of service support, the communication links interconnecting the switches and gateways are assumed to have fixed bandwidth and zero error rate. This assumption of steadiness, especially in a heterogeneous internet-working environment, might be invalid owing to subnetwork multiple-access mechanism, link-level flow/error control, and user mobility. Techniques are presented in this paper to characterize and analyze work-conserving communication nodes with varying output rate. In the deterministic approach, the notion of "fluctuation constraint," analogous to the "burstiness constraint" for traffic characterization, is introduced to characterize the node. In the statistical approach, the variable-rate output is modelled as an "exponentially bounded fluctuation" process in a way similar to the "exponentially bounded burstiness" method for traffic modelling. Based on these concepts, deterministic and statistical bounds on queue size and packet delay in isolated variable-rate communication server-nodes are derived, including cases of single-input and multiple-input under first-come-first-serve queueing. Queue size bounds are shown to be useful for buffer requirement and packet loss probability estimation at individual nodes. Our formulations also facilitate the computation of end-to-end performance bounds across a feedforward network of variable-rate server-nodes. Several numerical examples of interest are given in the discussion.
