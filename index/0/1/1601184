EuroPARC is a systems research laboratory supported by Rank Xerox Limited and allied with the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). The decision to create EuroPARC was announced in November of 1986, and the lab was officially dedicated in June of 1988. EuroPARC's research charter is human-computer interaction. The research program is coordinated with PARC's, but the goal is to combine PARC-style systems research with European points of view, issues, and approaches.
