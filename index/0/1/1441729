We present an efficient algorithm for computing the weakest readings of semantically ambiguous sentences. A corpus-based evaluation with a large-scale grammar shows that our algorithm reduces over 80% of sentences to one or two readings, in negligible runtime, and thus makes it possible to work with semantic representations derived by deep large-scale grammars.
