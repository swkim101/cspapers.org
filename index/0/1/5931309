In this paper we present preliminary outcomes concerning the design of a support system for midwives in the Netherlands to carry out daily activities. The purpose of our design is to make the workflow of mid-wives more efficient. Our user studies confirm that the current workflows of midwives to support pregnant women lack efficiency. The most obvious barrier is the lack of an integrated IT system to provide daily care to pregnant women. Based on the findings we propose some solutions that may help midwives to perform their daily tasks more efficiently.
