In this paper we study the problem of controlling a number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide convoy protection to a group of ground vehicles. The UAVs are modeled as Dubins vehicles flying at a constant altitude with bounded turning radius. This paper first presents timeoptimal paths for providing convoy protection to static ground vehicles. Then this paper addresses paths and control strategies to provide convoy protection to ground vehicles moving on a straight line. Minimum numbers of UAVs required to provide perpetual convoy protection for both cases are derived.
