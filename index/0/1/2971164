We describe our experiences porting and tuning three scientific programs to the Cray MTA-2, paying particular attention to the problems posed by I/O. We have measured the performance of each of the programs over many different machine configurations and we report on the scalability of each program. In addition, we compare the performance of the MTA with that of an SGI Origin running all three programs.
