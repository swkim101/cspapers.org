In this paper we focus on the issue of normalization of the affinity matrix in spectral clustering. We show that the difference between N-cuts and Ratio-cuts is in the error measure being used (relative-entropy versus L1 norm) in finding the closest doubly-stochastic matrix to the input affinity matrix. We then develop a scheme for finding the optimal, under Frobenius norm, doubly-stochastic approximation using Von-Neumann's successive projections lemma. The new normalization scheme is simple and efficient and provides superior clustering performance over many of the standardized tests.
