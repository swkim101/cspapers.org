A method for producing a plastic material from a water-in-oil emulsion of an unsaturated polyester resin dissolved in a hardenable compound containing an ethylenically unsaturated group. The emulsion has an adjusted viscosity of 1600-5000 cp. The plastic material is suitable as a replacement for plaster in the shaping of ceramics. The emulsion may contain an alkali-reactive water-binding material to increase the ceramic forming capability of the plastic material.
