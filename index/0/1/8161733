While it is generally held that network management is tedious and error-prone, it is not well understood which specific management practices increase the risk of failures. Indeed, our survey of 51 network operators reveals a significant diversity of opinions, and our characterization of the management practices in the 850+ networks of a large online service provider shows significant diversity in prevalent practices. Motivated by these observations, we develop a management plane analytics (MPA) framework that an organization can use to: (i) infer which management practices impact network health, and (ii) develop a predictive model of health, based on observed practices, to improve network management. We overcome the challenges of sparse and skewed data by aggregating data from many networks, reducing data dimensionality, and oversampling minority cases. Our learned models predict network health with an accuracy of 76-89%, and our causal analysis uncovers some high impact practices that operators thought had a low impact on network health. Our tool is publicly available, so organizations can analyze their own management practices.
