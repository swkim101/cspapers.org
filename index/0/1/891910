UPPAAL-TRON is a new tool for model based online black-box conformance testing of real-time embedded systems specified as timed automata. In this paper we present our experiences in applying our tool and technique on an industrial case study. We conclude that the tool and technique is applicable to practical systems, and that it has promising error detection potential and execution performance.
