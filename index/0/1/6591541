We present a discriminative, latent variable approach to syntactic parsing in which rules exist at multiple scales of refinement. The model is formally a latent variable CRF grammar over trees, learned by iteratively splitting grammar productions (not categories). Different regions of the grammar are refined to different degrees, yielding grammars which are three orders of magnitude smaller than the single-scale baseline and 20 times smaller than the split-and-merge grammars of Petrov et al. (2006). In addition, our discriminative approach integrally admits features beyond local tree configurations. We present a multiscale training method along with an efficient CKY-style dynamic program. On a variety of domains and languages, this method produces the best published parsing accuracies with the smallest reported grammars.
