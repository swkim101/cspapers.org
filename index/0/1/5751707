A self-organizing Hopfield network has been developed in the context of Vector Quantization, aiming at compression of television images. The metastable states of the spin glass-like network are used as an extra storage resource using the Minimal Overlap learning rule (Krauth and Mezard 1987) to optimize the organization of the attractors. The self-organizing scheme that we have devised results in the generation of an adaptive codebook for any qiven TV image.
