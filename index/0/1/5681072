Today, Pareto-optimal objects finding has been applied in various fields, such as group decision making and opinion collection. Many of the existing solutions to this problem require explicit attributes for objects. However, these attributes cannot be obtained sometimes. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm, which uses preference relations given by crowdsourcing, to find Pareto-optimal objects with shorter latency and lower monetary costs. It employs two multi-pairwise-comparison question models: BEST-form and BETTER-form questions. Multiple BEST (or BETTER) questions can be sent to crowds concurrently. Extensive experimental results show that the number of questions reduces greatly. In addition, the numerical results show that the latency is significantly shortened at a reasonable monetary cost, compared with the existing methods.
