The incorporation of context-awareness capabilities into pervasive applications allows them to leverage contextual information to provide additional services while maintaining an acceptable quality of service. These added capabilities, however, introduce a distinct input space that can affect the behavior of these applications at any point during their execution, making their validation quite challenging. In this paper, we introduce an approach to improve the test suite of a context-aware application by identifying context-aware program points where context changes may affect the application's behavior, and by systematically manipulating the context data fed into the application to increase its exposure to potentially valuable context variations. Preliminary results indicate that the approach is more powerful than existing testing approaches used on this type of application.
