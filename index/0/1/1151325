Frequent-pattern mining has been studied extensively on scalable methods for mining various kinds of patterns including itemsets, sequences, and graphs. However, the bottleneck of frequent-pattern mining is not at the efficiency but at the interpretability, due to the huge number of patterns generated by the mining process.In this paper, we examine how to summarize a collection of itemset patterns using only K representatives, a small number of patterns that a user can handle easily. The K representatives should not only cover most of the frequent patterns but also approximate their supports. A generative model is built to extract and profile these representatives, under which the supports of the patterns can be easily recovered without consulting the original dataset. Based on the restoration error, we propose a quality measure function to determine the optimal value of parameter K. Polynomial time algorithms are developed together with several optimization heuristics for efficiency improvement. Empirical studies indicate that we can obtain compact summarization in real datasets.
