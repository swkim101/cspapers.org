The Descartes specification language and support software provides a tool for developing and executing functional specifications. A variety of specifications have been developed to support the language design and evaluation. In addition, the language has been applied to the development of a large specification. Current research efforts include: specification development, support software enhancements, and software life cycle impact. An overview of the specification language is included in this paper. The language processor for Descartes is described in relation to providing the capability for executing specifications. Program development and testing with respect to utilizing Descartes is outlined.
