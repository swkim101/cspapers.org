We introduce a grocery retrieval system that maps shopping lists written in natural language into actual products in a grocery store. We have developed the system using nine months of shopping basket data from a large Finnish supermarket. To evaluate the system, we used 70 real shopping lists gathered from customers of the supermarket. Our system achieves over 80% precision for products at rank one, and the precision is around 70% for products at rank 5.
