We propose an approach for verifying non-linear hybrid systems using higher-order Taylor models that are a combination of bounded degree polynomials over the initial conditions and time, bloated by an interval. Taylor models are an effective means for computing rigorous bounds on the complex time trajectories of non-linear differential equations. As a result, Taylor models have been successfully used to verify properties of non-linear continuous systems. However, the handling of discrete (controller) transitions remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we provide techniques for handling the effect of discrete transitions on Taylor model flow pipe construction. We explore various solutions based on two ideas: domain contraction and range over-approximation. Instead of explicitly computing the intersection of a Taylor model with a guard set, domain contraction makes the domain of a Taylor model smaller by cutting away parts for which the intersection is empty. It is complemented by range over-approximation that translates Taylor models into commonly used representations such as template polyhedra or zonotopes, on which intersections with guard sets have been previously studied. We provide an implementation of the techniques described in the paper and evaluate the various design choices over a set of challenging benchmarks.
