We present Yottos, an event driven operating system for wireless embedded devices that reduces energy consumption by coalescing tasks into workloads with similar resource requirements thereby reducing time and energy consumed from power cycling peripherals. With Yottos we target a different group of programmers than the ones well-versed in embedded C, TinyOS and Contiki, namely web and app developers who on one hand are familiar with event driven programming in the form of user interaction events, but on the other have no experience with low-level hardware access. We trade off memory footprint (both data and code) in support of a programming environment more akin to iOS and Android development by supporting Objective-C and C/C++.
