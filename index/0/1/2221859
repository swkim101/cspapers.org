This paper describes an advanced search engine that supports users in querying documents by means of keywords, entities, and categories. Users simply type words, which are automatically mapped onto appropriate suggestions for entities and categories. Based on named-entity disambiguation, the search engine returns documents containing the query's entities and prominent entities from the query's categories.
