The focus of this workshop is the application of scientific practices to cyber security research. The objective of this workshop is examine the implementation of science practices in cyber defense research and understand the ramification of tradeoffs between simplifications to obtain interpretable results vs. observational studies of systems in the wild where the results can lead to ambiguous interpretations. The research papers accepted addressed a wide variety of technical questions in the cyber domain and the maturity of the work spanned the range of initial ideas and proofs of concept to mature work that is ready for operational implementation. Papers were evaluated for the reproducibility of the work as represented by the documentation of methods and testing environments.
