We describe the dmign and implementation of our Stratosphere project, a framework which unifias distributed objects and mobile code applications. We begin by first examining dfierent mobile code parad]gms that distribute pr~ cessing of code and data resource components across a network. After analyzing these paradigms, and prwenting a lattice of functionality, we then develop a layered architecture for Stratosphere, incorporating higher levels of m~ bilit.y and interoperabifity at each successive layer. In our design, we provide an object model that permiti objects to migrate to different sites, select among different method implementations, and provide new methods and behavior. We describe how we build new semantics in each software layer, and finally, we present sample objects developed for Stratosphere.
