Automated geolocation of social media messages can beneﬁt a variety of downstream applications. However, these geolocation systems are typically evaluated without attention to how changes in time impact geolocation. Since different people, in different locations write messages at different times, these factors can signiﬁcantly vary the performance of a ge-olocation system over time. We demonstrate cyclical temporal effects on geolocation accuracy in Twitter, as well as rapid drops as test data moves beyond the time period of training data. We show that temporal drift can effectively be countered with even modest online model updates.
