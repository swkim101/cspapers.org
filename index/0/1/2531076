We study the so-called Generalized Median graph problem where the task is to to construct a prototype (i.e., a 'model') from an input set of graphs. The problem finds applications in many vision (e.g., object recognition) and learning problems where graphs are increasingly being adopted as a representation tool. Existing techniques for this problem are evolutionary search based; in this paper, we propose a polynomial time algorithm based on a linear programming formulation. We present an additional bi-level method to obtain solutions arbitrarily close to the optimal in non-polynomial time (in worst case). Within this new framework, one can optimize edit distance functions that capture similarity by considering vertex labels as well as the graph structure simultaneously. In context of our motivating application, we discuss experiments on molecular image analysis problems - the methods will provide the basis for building a topological map of all pairs of the human chromosome.
