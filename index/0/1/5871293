We present a logic which allows us to reason about acting, and more specifically about sensing, i.e. actions that acquire information from the real world, and planning, i.e. actions that generate and execute plans of actions. This logic takes into account the fact that, as it happens in real systems, actions may fail, and provides the ability of reasoning about failure handling in acting, sensing and planning. We see this work as a first step towards a formal account of systems which are able to plan to act, plan to sense and plan to plan, and therefore, to integrate action, perception and reasoning.
