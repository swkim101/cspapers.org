This paper revisits the communication complexity of large-scale 3D fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and asks what impact trends in current architectures will have on FFT performance at exascale. We analyze both memory hierarchy traffic and network communication to derive suitable analytical models, which we calibrate against current software implementations; we then evaluate models to make predictions about potential scaling outcomes at exascale, based on extrapolating current technology trends. Of particular interest is the performance impact of choosing high-density processors, typified today by graphics co-processors (GPUs), as the base processor for an exascale system. Among various observations, a key prediction is that although inter-node all-to-all communication is expected to be the bottleneck of distributed FFTs, intra-node communication---expressed precisely in terms of the relative balance among compute capacity, memory bandwidth, and network bandwidth---will play a critical role.
