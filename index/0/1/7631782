This paper presents a localization strategy for robotic assemblies with position uncertainty. The assembly of parts whose position uncertainty exceeds assembly clearance has to rely on either visual assistance or searching to achieve parts mating. We present a general strategy, applicable to arbitrary peg-in-hole assemblies, that localizes the misalignment of the mating parts in an efficient manner. The strategy explores the assembly contact configuration space and matches its observations to a pre-acquired C-space map. Simulations and experiments for various assembly scenarios are presented.
