In this paper, we propose a web-based bilingual concordancer, DOMCAT, for domain-specific computer assisted translation. Given a multi-word expression as a query, the system involves retrieving sentence pairs from a bilingual corpus, identifying translation equivalents of the query in the sentence pairs (translation spotting) and ranking the retrieved sentence pairs according to the relevance between the query and the translation equivalents. To provide high-precision translation spotting for domain-specific translation tasks, we exploited a normalized correlation method to spot the translation equivalents. To ranking the retrieved sentence pairs, we propose a correlation function modified from the Dice coefficient for assessing the correlation between the query and the translation equivalents. The performances of the translation spotting module and the ranking module are evaluated in terms of precision-recall measures and coverage rate respectively.
