To succeed in today's computer information systems (CIS) environment, CIS professionals need far more than traditional technical skills. Managers seek technical staff with the ability to communicate effectively and understand an organization's primary mission. Industry would like CIS professionals to have strong backgrounds in a broad variety of skills such as oral and written communication, team work, and an awareness of international issues. Current computer science and information system curricula often do not provide our students with the opportunity to learn these critical skills.By adding a variety of simple activities to existing technical courses we can provide students with valuable opportunities to develop these critical skills. A variety of teaching techniques can re-enforce skills in both arenas at the same time. Some assignments can assist students in understanding the technical material by requiring them to apply advanced critical thinking skills. Active learning can reach students with different learning styles and increase the understanding and retention of technical material. A mixture of activities also provides a variety of forms of assessment which may more accurately reflect students' understanding of the material. As a bonus, these skills will enable our students to continue to thrive in a field fraught with constant change.The seminar will expand on these themes and provide examples and practice developing assignments that can help prepare well-rounded students for success in computer information systems.
