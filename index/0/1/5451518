We present an enriched version of the Penn Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al., 2004), where latent features necessary for modeling morpho-syntactic agreement in Arabic are manually annotated. We describe our process for efficient annotation, and present the first quantitative analysis of Arabic morpho-syntactic phenomena.
