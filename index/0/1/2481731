This paper presents a connectionist syntactic parser which uses Structure Unification Grammar as its grammatical framework. The parser is implemented in a connectionist architecture which stores and dynamically manipulates symbolic representations, but which can't represent arbitrary disjunction and has bounded memory. These problems can be overcome with Structure Unification Grammar's extensive use of partial descriptions.
