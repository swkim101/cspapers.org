Increasing need for computing expertise in our everyday lives and in the workforce, paired with declining enrollments in computing by women and underrepresented minorities have made it critical to provide students with experiences in computing before college. CS10K is a national effort to engage 10,000 high school teachers in teaching computer science across the United States. With CS10K projects working on this goal since 2012 having prepared less than 1000 teachers for teaching computer science in high school, there is a need to scale professional development opportunities to local communities. College and university computing faculty have the unique preparation and call for community engagement that make it a win-win to support local high school teachers in learning to teach computer science. We will use the STARS model of building university-based communities that broaden participation in computing, adapted to the context of supporting K12 teachers to become change agents and educators prepared to teach computer science. In this workshop, participants will learn how to implement scalable team-based professional development for K12 teachers new to teaching computer science. We will provide resources to recruit, plan, and support small groups of new teachers to teach the new CS Principles course that will become an Advanced Placement course in 2016-2017. Laptops for attendees are optional.
