Many tools have been developed to help users query, extract and integrate data from web pages generated dynamically from databases, i.e., from the Hidden Web. A key prerequisite for such tools is to obtain the schema of the attributes of the retrieved data. In this paper, we describe a system called, DeLa, which reconstructs (part of) a "hidden" back-end web database. It does this by sending queries through HTML forms, automatically generating regular expression wrappers to extract data objects from the result pages and restoring the retrieved data into an annotated (labelled) table. The whole process needs no human involvement and proves to be fast (less than one minute for wrapper induction for each site) and accurate (over 90% correctness for data extraction and around 80% correctness for label assignment).
