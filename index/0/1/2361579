This paper describes our experiences with the Webware, Interfaces and Networking Experimental (WINE) Laboratory. The WINE Lab was created to assist in teaching the topics of computer networks, user interfaces and webware. The goal of the lab is to provide students the opportunity to complete projects, experiment with relevant techniques and make connections between topics with resources not available in a general purpose Unix-based computing environment. The results from offering courses with the lab show success in meeting these goals.
