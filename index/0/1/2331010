A set G of points on a 1.5-dimensional terrain, also known as an x-monotone polygonal chain, is said to guard the terrain if every point on the terrain is seen by a point in G. Two points on the terrain see each other if and only if the line segment between them is never strictly below the terrain. The minimum terrain guarding problem asks for a minimum guarding set for the given input terrain. Using a reduction from PLANAR 3-SAT we prove that the decision version of this problem is NP-hard. This solves a significant open problem and complements recent positive approximability results for the optimization problem.
