An orphan DNS server is a DNS server which has an address record in the DNS, even though the domain in which it resides has no DNS records itself and hence does not exist. For example, the DNS server ns.foo.com would be an orphan DNS server if it had an address record, but the domain foo.com did not exist. In this paper, we undertake the first systematic study of the prevalence of orphan DNS servers in the Internet. We also examine who is using them and what they are used for. We find that certain top-level domains (TLDs) account for a disproportionate number of orphans. We also find that some orphans are used for malicious activities and as placeholders for records from deleted domains, while others likely only exist due to simple configuration errors. Our study points to the need for better scrutiny of orphan DNS servers so they cannot be misused.
