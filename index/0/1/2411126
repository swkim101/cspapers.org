Mobile applications frequently access sensitive personal informa- tion to meet user or business requirements. Because such informa- tion is sensitive in general, regulators increasingly require mobile- app developers to publish privacy policies that describe what infor- mation is collected. Furthermore, regulators have fined companies when these policies are inconsistent with the actual data practices of mobile apps. To help mobile-app developers check their pri- vacy policies against their appsâ€™ code for consistency, we propose a semi-automated framework that consists of a policy terminology- API method map that links policy phrases to API methods that pro- duce sensitive information, and information flow analysis to detect misalignments. We present an implementation of our framework based on a privacy-policy-phrase ontology and a collection of map- pings from API methods to policy phrases. Our empirical eval- uation on 477 top Android apps discovered 341 potential privacy policy violations.
