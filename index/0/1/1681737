The ability to achieve operational efficiency, product leadership, and customer intimacy still eludes many organizations due, in large part, to the chaos of business. Inconsistent prioritization and decision making; poor visibility between systems; processes that are not well controlled; and individual front-line decisions that seem small but, in totality, have a huge impact make it difficult for organizations to link strategy to execution and back. During this presentation, we will demonstrate how automating and optimizing decisions (operational efficiency) with business rules and predictive models enables better data driven results across the enterprise, and how this is implemented at the point of impact (customer intimacy) to transform an organization and support market leadership.
