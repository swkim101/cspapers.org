We develop and implement a methodology for automatic abstraction of systems defined as networks of timed components modeled by timed automata. The abstraction technique yields an abstract model with much less clocks and states which over-approximate the timed behavior of the concrete system. Using this technique we can analyze timed system of size beyond the capabilities of contemporary analysis tools for timed automata.
