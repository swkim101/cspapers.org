In this paper, we describe our experiences in extending a standard cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) approach which uses parallel aligned corpora and Latent Semantic Indexing. Most, if not all, previous work which follows this approach has focused on bilingual retrieval; two examples involve the use of French-English or English-Greek parallel corpora. Our extension to the approach is ‘massively parallel’ in two senses, one linguistic and the other computational. First, we make use of a parallel aligned corpus consisting of almost 50 parallel translations in over 30 distinct languages, each in over 30,000 documents. Given the size of this dataset, a ‘massively parallel’ approach was also necessitated in the more usual computational sense. Our re-sults indicate that, far from adding more noise, more linguistic parallelism is better when it comes to cross-language retrieval precision, in addition to the self-evident benefit that CLIR can be performed on more languages.
