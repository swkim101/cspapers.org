In this poster, we present the architecture, design, and the preliminary simulation results of a system for Metropolitan Heating, via intelligent temperature monitoring. The system consists of several Crossbow TelosB-compatible motes, a Nokia uSDCard, and a smart phone. The motes are used to collect indoor temperature data, which is further relayed to the smart phone's uSD interface. The uSDCard connects the phone with IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee compatible devices. We use the smart phone as the sink terminal because it has a rich set of user interfaces and can access to different kinds of networks, such as GPRS and 3G. In real scenes, our system can reduce the reading fluctuation, and ultimately save the energy consumed for heating company, achieving a better living condition in the houses.
