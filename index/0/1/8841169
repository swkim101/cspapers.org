The proliferation of spatial data on the Internet is beginning to allow a much wider access to data currently available in various Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In order to provide effective spatial database integration, we need to provide flexible and powerful GIS data integration solutions. Indeed, GIS are highly heterogeneous: not only they differ by their data representations, but they also offer radically different query languages. A GIS mediation approach should provide an integrated view of the data supplied by all sources, and a geographical query language to access and manipulate integrated data.
