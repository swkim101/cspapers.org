Recent studies focussed on the question whether less-conguration al languages like German are harder to parse than English, or whether the lower parsing scores are an artefact of treebank encoding schemes and data structures, as claimed by K¤ ubler et al. (2006). This claim is based on the assumption that PARSEVAL metrics fully reect parse quality across treebank encoding schemes. In this paper we present new experiments to test this claim. We use the PARSEVAL metric, the Leaf-Ancestor metric as well as a dependency-based evaluation, and present novel approaches measuring the effect of controlled error insertion on treebank trees and parser output. We also provide extensive past-parsing crosstreebank conversion. The results of the experiments show that, contrary to K¤ ubler et al. (2006), the question whether or not German is harder to parse than English remains undecided.
