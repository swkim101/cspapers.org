A mechanism is said to be strategy-proof if no agent has an incentive to misrepresent her true preferences. This property is considered highly desirable for mechanisms that are used in real-life markets. And indeed, many of the great success stories of market design employ strategy-proof mechanisms, such as the second-price sealed-bid auction (Vickrey 1961), or Deferred Acceptance (DA, Gale and Shapley 1962; Dubins and Freedman 1981; Roth 1982). Specifically, in school-choice settings, the appeal of strategy-proof mechanisms is one of the main reasons many school districts choose the applicant-proposing version of DA over pre-existing mechanisms. At the core of the attractiveness of these mechanisms is the assumption that agents report their preferences truthfully in strategy-proof environments. We present direct field evidence of preference misrepresentation by applicant's under the applicant-proposing DA. Our study is based on the recently redesigned admission process in Israel for graduate studies in psychology (MA or direct PhD track), where several participating institutions offer positions in the same study track, but under different terms. In particular, in some cases only some of the positions are funded.
