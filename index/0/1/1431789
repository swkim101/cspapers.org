The knowledge engineer practices the art of bringing the principles and tools of AI research to bear on difficult applications problems requiring experts' knowledge for their solution. The technical issues of acquiring this knowledge, representing it, and using it appropriately to construct and explain lines-of-reasoning, are important problems in the design of knowledge-based systems. Various systems that have achieved expert level performance in scientific and medical inference illuminate the art of knowledge engineering and its parent science, Artificial Intelligence.
