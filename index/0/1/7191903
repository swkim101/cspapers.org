We present a parallel finite element solver for mesh-connected multicomputers (ie., message-passing, distributed-memory multiprocessors) and provide a theoretical proof tht the algorithms used are highly scalable and close to optimal. Further, the algorithms are written in an object-oriented language (ESP C++) to enhance reusability of code. Performance results are presented for a Motorola multicomputer and a network of Sun workstations.
