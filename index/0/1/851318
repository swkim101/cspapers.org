This paper presents a method for automatic topic identification using a graph-centrality algorithm applied to an encyclopedic graph derived from Wikipedia. When tested on a data set with manually assigned topics, the system is found to significantly improve over a simpler baseline that does not make use of the external encyclopedic knowledge.
