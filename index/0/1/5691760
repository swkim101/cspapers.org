As online Collaborative Question Answering (CQA) servicessuch as Yahoo! Answers and Baidu Knows are attracting users, questions, and answers at an explosive rate, the truly urgent and important questions are increasingly getting lost in the crowd. That is, questions that require immediate responses are pushed out of the way by the trivial but more recently arriving questions. Unlike other questions in collaborative question answering (CQA) for which users might be willing to wait until good answers appear, urgent questions are likely to be of interest to the asker only if answered in the next few minutes or hours. For such questions, late responses are either not useful or are simply not applicable. Unfortunately, current collaborative question-answering systems do not distinguish urgent questions from the rest, and could thus be ineffective for urgent information needs. We explore text- and data- mining methods for automatically identifying urgent questions in the CQA setting. Our results indicate that modeling the question context (i.e., the particular forum/category where the question was posted) can increase classification accuracy compared to the text of the question alone.
