Abstract Annotea is a Web-based shared annotation system based on a general-purpose open resource description framework (RDF) infrastructure, where annotations are modeled as a class of metadata . Annotations are viewed as statements made by an author about a Web document. Annotations are external to the documents and can be stored in one or more annotation servers . One of the goals of this project has been to re-use as much existing W3C technology as possible. We have reached it mostly by combining RDF with XPointer, XLink, and HTTP. We have also implemented an instance of our system using the Amaya editor/browser and a generic RDF database, accessible through an Apache HTTP server. In this implementation, the merging of annotations with documents takes place within the client. The paper presents the overall design of Annotea and describes some of the issues we have faced and how we have solved them.
