Automatic key phrase extraction is fundamental to the success of many recent digital library applications and semantic information retrieval techniques and a difficult and essential problem in Vietnamese natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we propose a novel method for key phrase extracting of Vietnamese text that exploits the Vietnamese Wikipedia as an ontology and exploits specific characteristics of the Vietnamese language for the key phrase selection stage. We also explore NLP techniques that we propose for the analysis of Vietnamese texts, focusing on the advanced candidate phrases recognition phase as well as part-of-speech (POS) tagging. Finally, we review the results of several experiments that have examined the impacts of strategies chosen for Vietnamese key phrase extracting.
