Reflections in image sequences consist of several layers superimposed over each other. This phenomenon causes many image processing techniques to fail as they assume the presence of only one layer at each examined site e.g. motion estimation and object recognition. This work presents an automated technique for detecting reflections in image sequences by analyzing motion trajectories of feature points. It models reflection as regions containing two different layers moving over each other. We present a strong detector based on combining a set of weak detectors. We use novel priors, generate sparse and dense detection maps and our results show high detection rate with rejection to pathological motion and occlusion.
