Web access prediction is an active research topic with many applications. Various approaches have been proposed for Web access prediction in the domain of individual Web servers but they have to be tailored to the domain of proxy servers to satisfy its special requirements in prediction efficiency and scalability. In this paper, the design and implementation of proxy-based prediction service (PPS) is presented. For prediction efficiency, PPS applies a new prediction scheme which employs a two-layer navigation model to capture both inter-site and intra-site access patterns, incorporated with a bottom-up prediction mechanism that exploits reference locality in proxy logs. For system scalability, PPS manages the navigation model in disk database and adopts a predictive cache replacement strategy for data shipping between the model database and cache. We show the superiority of our prediction scheme over existing approaches and validate our model management and caching strategies, with a detailed performance study using real-world data.
