Rotating workforce scheduling is a typical constraint satisfaction problem which appears in a broad range of work places (e.g. industrial plants). Solving this problem is of a high practical relevance. In this paper we propose the combination of tabu search with random walk and min conflicts strategy to solve this problem. Computational results for benchmark examples in literature and other real life examples show that combination of tabu search with random walk and min conflicts strategy improves the performance of tabu search for this problem. The methods proposed in this paper improve performance of the state of art commercial system for generation of rotating workforce schedules.
