Experience in the development and maintenance of software leads to the design of methodologies for different phases of the software engineering process. Such methodologies attempt to usefully support the programmer's thought process for re-creating only good, standard patterns of programming without limiting creativity. However methodologies, as they are generally used, are limited in their impact on software quality. In this paper we present an approach for human engineering methodologies based on forms. The advantages of using a form-based interface for a software engineering environment are discussed by focusing on the design of forms, on the impact of forms on the software engineering process, and on the improved tool support facilitated by the standardization achieved by forms.
