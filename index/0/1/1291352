We present a program for segmenting texts according to the separate events they describe. A modular architecture is described that allows us to examine the contributions made by particular aspects of natural language to event structuring. This is applied in the context of terrorist news articles, and a technique is suggested for evaluating the resulting segmentations. We also examine the usefulness of various heuristics in forming these segmentations.
