We present an account of act ion whose ma in features are that actions are content, properties tha t agents have in v i r tue of (i) the bodi ly movements they effect and (ii) the wider circumstances in which those movements are effected. 'The account includes def ini t ions of one act ion being a way oj do ing another, and of pe r fo rm ing one act ion by per forming another. A l t h o u g h this account is intended to f o rm par t of a theory of intel l igent act ion, inc lud ing the del iberate and in tent ional actions of human agents or of autonomous robots, in this paper we abstract f rom the in fo rmat ion processing and cogni t ive factors involved in such act ions. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n A c t i o n is the goal of p lann ing , for p lanning is reasoning abou t what actions to per fo rm, given certain c i rcumstances, in order to achieve a goal . Most actions, perhaps a l l , involve movements of an agen ts body, or more gen era l ly of i ts movable parts. W h a t is the relat ionship between act ions and movements 7 Are actions movements t h a t are caused in a special way, for example by way of cer ta in aspects of the mental states of their agentsâ€” the i r beliefs, desires, and intent ions? Th is seems wrong , for our not ions of actions involve much more than mere bod i l y movements, however caused. Consider a s imple example : mov ing a block f rom one locat ion to another. First,, we must determine whether we are th ink ing of one nonrepeatable par t icu lar or of the repeatable k ind of act i o n : mov ing a block f rom one locat ion to another. I f the la t te r , i f is clear tha t different kinds of bodi ly movement m igh t be involved. Mov ing a block f rom one place to another may be a k ind of ac t ion, but it is not one k i n d of movement . Moreover, whether we have in m i n d a single nonrepeatable event or a repeatable k i nd , it is *The research reported in this paper has been made possible by a gift from the System Development Foundation and was conducted as part of a coordinated research effort wi th the Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University. also clear tha t mov ing a block requires more than a bodi ly movement , however caused. It also requires a block, and ( rough ly ) a pa th th rough which the block can be moved. The act ion of mov ing a block cannot be characterized solely in terms of the bodi ly movements of agents t ha t per fo rm the act ion; on the other hand , bod i l y movements can be characterized independent ly of the act ions those movements are associated w i t h when per formed in given circumstances. W h a t is the re lat ionship between act ions and movements 7 On our theory, act ions are not special k inds of movements, but content properties oj agents t h a t agents have in v i r tue of per fo rming those movements in certa in circumstances. We proceed to expla in th is idea and to show how a theory based on it can be used to develop accounts of re lat ionships between act ions tha t are central to a theory of inte l l igent act ion It w i l l be useful to begin by examin ing a repor t of an ac t ion . In the course of this br ief e x a m i n a t i o n , we shall in t roduce much of our theoret ical vocabulary , and some of our theory.
