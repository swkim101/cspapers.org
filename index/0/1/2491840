In this paper, service integration of voice, data and facsimile communications is studied from the viewpoint of developing the data switching networks to integrated services networks which could handle various types of information transmission.
 First, requirements from the user's and carrier's points of view are described. Integrated services networks must handle various calls with different traffic characteristics and meet different service grades in accordance with each type of calls. Considering such environments, many network morphological alternatives are listed as regards data switching network integration and data-telephone network integration, and network functions associated with service integration and developed within or around data switching networks are explained. Last, two experimental systems are described as some approaches to integrated services data networks.
