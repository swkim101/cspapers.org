Presynthesis optimizations transform a behavioral HDL description into an optimized HDL description that results in improved synthesis results. We introduce the decomposition of timed decision tables (TDT), a tabular model of system behavior. The TDT decomposition is based on the kernel extraction algorithm. By experimenting using named benchmarks, we demonstrate how TDT decomposition can be used in presynthesis optimizations.
