This paper presents a new multiprocessor architecture for the parallel execution of logic programs, developed as part of the Aquarius Project. This architecture is designed to support AND-parallelism, OR-parallelism, and intelligent backtracking. We present the most comprehensive experimental results available to date on combined AND-parallelism, OR-parallelism, and intelligent backtracking in Prolog programs. Simulation results indicate that most Prolog programs in use today cannot effectively make use of multiprocessing.
