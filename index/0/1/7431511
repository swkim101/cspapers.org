A method for defining the conceptual schema of databases is discussed within the framework of the ER(Entity-Relationship) model. Analyzing the semantic aspects of the ER schema based on the notions such the normalization, the gneralization, the instantiation, and the typification, the initial schema can be refined to have more natural and clearer meanings. We further analyze the processing requirements for the database and formalize them into the transaction descriptions which reflect the behavioral properties on the database. From the set of the transaction descriptions, the distribution of transaction workloads on the database is easily predicted.
