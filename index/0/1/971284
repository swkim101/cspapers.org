In this paper, we present the preliminary design and implementation of SDN-SAVI, an SDN application that enables SAVI functionalities in SDN networks. In this proposal, all the functionalities are implemented on the controller without modifying SDN switches. To enforce SAVI on packets in the data plane, the controller installs binding tables in switches using existing SDN techniques, such as OpenFlow. With SDN-SAVI, a network administrator can now enforce SAVI in her network by merely integrating a module on the controller, rather than purchasing SAVI-capable switches and replacing legacy ones.
