This paper discusses some methods for guiding the search of conventional chess programs to variable depth. The motivation for investigating such methods comes from the fact that searching to a fixed depth causes difficult problems (e.g. the horizon effect). The first section deals with certain improvements of the quiescence search and a demonstration of their beneficial effects. The method of not counting moves as a ply of depth is investigated then and the results of extending it somewhat are reported. As this method seems to be too simple nevertheless, a more general model tor extending the horizon of the full-width search to variable depth is proposed.
