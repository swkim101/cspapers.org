Large-scale parsing is still a complex and time-consuming process, often so much that it is infeasible in real-world applications. The parsing system described here addresses this problem by combining finite-state approaches, statistical parsing techniques and engineering knowledge, thus keeping parsing complexity as low as possible at the cost of a slight decrease in performance. The parser is robust and fast and at the same time based on strong linguistic foundations.
