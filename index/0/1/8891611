Integration of language constraints into a large vocabulary speech recognition system often leads to prohibitive complexity. We propose to factor the constraints into two components. The first is characterized by a covering grammar which is small and easily integrated into existing speech recognizers. The recognized string is then decoded by means of an efficient language post-processor in which the full set of constraints is imposed to correct possible errors introduced by the speech recognizer.
