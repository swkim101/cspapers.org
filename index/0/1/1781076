We consider the problem of matching a face in a low resolution query video sequence against a set of higher quality gallery sequences. This problem is of interest in many applications, such as law enforcement. Our main contribution is an extension of the recently proposed Generic Shape-Illumination Manifold (gSIM) framework. Specifically, (i) we show how super-resolution across pose and scale can be achieved implicitly, by off-line learning of subsampling artefacts; (ii) we use this result to propose an extension to the statistical model of the gSIM by compounding it with a hierarchy of subsampling models at multiple scales; and (iii) we describe an extensive empirical evaluation of the method on over 1300 video sequences â€“ we first measure the degradation in performance of the original gSIM algorithm as query sequence resolution is decreased and then show that the proposed extension produces an error reduction in the mean recognition rate of over 50%.
