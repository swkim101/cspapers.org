This paper presents a description and analysis of a task scheduling algorithm which is applicable to third generation computer systems. The analysis is carried out using a model of a computer system having several identical task processors and a fixed amount of memory. The algorithm schedules tasks having different processor-time and memory requirements. The goal of the algorithm is to produce a task schedule which is near optimal in terms of the time required to process all of the tasks. An upper bound on the length of this schedule is the result of deterministic analysis of the algorithm. Computer simulations demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm in actual systems, even when some of the basic assumptions are violated.
