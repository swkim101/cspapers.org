Many methods for generating and analyzing grasps have been developed in the recent years. They gave insight and comprehension of grasping with robot hands but many of them are rather complicated to implement and of high computational complexity. In this paper we study if the basic quality criterion for grasps, the force-closure property, is in principle easy or difficult to reach. We show that it is not necessary to generate optimal grasps, due to a certain quality measure, for real robot grasping tasks where an average quality grasp is acceptable. We present statistical data that confirm our opinion that a randomized grasp generation algorithm is fast and suitable for the planning of robot grasping tasks.
