This research work contributes to an active vision system for an gas pipe inspection robot moving inside of the pipe. The robot must be able to know what shape of the pipes where the robot is moving. The shapes of the pipe include straight, L or T. Also, when it is moving in the straight section, the robot must detect the relative angle with respect to its principal axis. The authors propose to use a laser spot array and TV camera for the vision sensor, which can find the three dimensional position of each spot on the surface of the pipe by means of triangulation. The shape of the pipe inside can be reconstructed by the information of the camera. A method is also presented to distinguish the shape whether it is straight or not.
