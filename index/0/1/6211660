We present several human-UAV interfaces that support real-time control of a small semi-autonomous UAV. These interfaces are designed for searching tasks and other missions that typically do not have a precise predetermined flight plan. We present a detailed analysis of a PDA-based interface and describe how our other interfaces relate to this analysis. We then offer quantative and qualitative performance comparisons of the interfaces, as well as an analysis of their possible real-world applications.
