Contextual bandit algorithms provide principled online learning solutions to find optimal trade-offs between exploration and exploitation with companion side-information. Most contextual bandit algorithms simply assume the learner would have access to the entire set of features, which govern the generation of payoffs from a user to an item. However, in practice it is challenging to exhaust all relevant features ahead of time, and oftentimes due to privacy or sampling constraints many factors are unobservable to the algorithm. Failing to model such hidden factors leads a system to make constantly suboptimal predictions. In this paper, we propose to learn the hidden features for contextual bandit algorithms. Hidden features are explicitly introduced in our reward generation assumption, in addition to the observable contextual features. A scalable bandit algorithm is achieved via coordinate descent, in which closed form solutions exist at each iteration for both hidden features and bandit parameters. Most importantly, we rigorously prove that the developed contextual bandit algorithm achieves a sublinear upper regret bound with high probability, and a linear regret is inevitable if one fails to model such hidden features. Extensive experimentation on both simulations and large-scale real-world datasets verified the advantages of the proposed algorithm compared with several state-of-the-art contextual bandit algorithms and existing ad-hoc combinations between bandit algorithms and matrix factorization methods.
