A multidimensional database is a data repository that supports the efficient execution of complex business decision queries. Query response can be significantly improved by storing an appropriate set of materialized views. These views are selected from the multidimensional lattice whose elements represent the solution space of the problem. Several techniques have been proposed in the past to perform the selection of materialized views for databases with a reduced number of dimensions. When the number and complexity of dimensions increase, the proposed techniques do not scale well. The technique we are proposing reduces the soluticn space by considering only the relevant elements of the multidimensional lattice. An additional statistical analysis allows a further reduction of the solution space.
