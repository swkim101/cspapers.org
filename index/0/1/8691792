Language Integrated Query (LINQ) is a framework that is rooted in the theoretical ideas of monads and monad comprehensions to allow seamless querying over objects, XML, and relational data. Instead of blindly gazing at the perceived impedance mismatch between the structure of these various data models, LINQ leverages the commonalities between the operations on these data models to achieve deep semantic integration.
