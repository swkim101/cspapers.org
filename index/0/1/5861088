We present pigeo, a Python geolocation prediction tool that predicts a location for a given text input or Twitter user. We discuss the design, implementation and application of pigeo, and empirically evaluate it. pigeo is able to geolocate informal text and is a very useful tool for users who require a free and easy-to-use, yet accurate geolocation service based on pre-trained models. Additionally, users can train their own models easily using pigeo's API.
