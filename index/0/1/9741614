I review a number of grammar induction algorithms (ABL, Emile, Adios), and test them on the Eindhoven corpus, resulting in disappointing results, compared to the usually tested corpora (ATIS, OVIS). Also, I show that using neither POS-tags induced from Biemann's unsupervised POS-tagging algorithm nor hand-corrected POS-tags as input improves this situation. Last, I argue for the development of entirely incremental grammar induction algorithms instead of the approaches of the systems discussed before.
