In this paper, we propose an in-hand motion planning algorithm for 3D objects under rolling contacts. By assuming the in-hand motion is quasi-static, we apply the concept of independent contact region (ICR) to determine stable boundaries of finger contact points during the in-hand motion. A specified level of grasp quality margin representing the ability to bear external load is guaranteed. The overall scheme contains two motion planning phases: one is the motion planning with fingers simultaneously rolling over the object surface, and the other is the planning associated with switching fingers of contact and non-contact. Simulation/experimental results are provided to show the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.
