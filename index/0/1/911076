This paper presents an optimal planning problem for workpiece measurement. Two sequential optimization algorithms are introduced to find maximum determinant solutions. Then, based on a reliability analysis of workpiece localization and the sequential optimization algorithms, a computer-aided probing strategy is proposed. With this strategy, given the desired translation and orientation error bounds and desired confidence limit, we can experimentally find the least number of points needed to measure. Simulation results show the efficiency of the computer-aided probing strategy.
