This paper proposes a single-image blur kernel estimation algorithm that utilizes the normalized color-line prior to restore sharp edges without altering edge structures or enhancing noise. The proposed prior is derived from the color-line model, which has been successfully applied to non-blind deconvolution and many computer vision problems. In this paper, we show that the original color-line prior is not effective for blur kernel estimation and propose a normalized color-line prior which can better enhance edge contrasts. By optimizing the proposed prior, our method gradually enhances the sharpness of the intermediate patches without using heuristic filters or external patch priors. The intermediate patches can then guide the estimation of the blur kernel. A comprehensive evaluation on a large image deblurring dataset shows that our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art results.
