The rationale for a software system captures the designers' and developers' intent behind the decisions made during its development. This information has many potential uses but is typically not captured explicitly. This paper describes an initial investigation into the use of text mining and parsing techniques for identifying rationale from existing documents. Initial results indicate that the use of linguistic features results in better precision but significantly lower recall than using text mining.
