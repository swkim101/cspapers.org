There is currently a dire need to improve efforts to integrate a better understanding of career and college pathways in all computing fields into our Computer Science (CS) curricula; versus continuing to label and advertise everything we do as "computer science". This effort is essential to improving post-secondary opportunities for students being introduced to computing through the nationwide CS for All commitment. For high school students in Chicago, this effort starts with Exploring Computer Science (ECS), which serves as our foundational CS course at CS4All@CPS, now that CS is a graduation requirement. I am examining the potential long term outcomes and benefits of segmenting each unit of ECS -- Human Computer Interaction, Problem Solving, Web Design, Programming, Big Data, and Robotics -- into different fields of computing and identifying the skillsets gained in these computing fields in order to articulate this to students with these interests. This effort is just underway and those interested in providing students with post graduation opportunities, as well as those personally interested in exploring career and college opportunities in computing fields, are invited to attend this talk, share feedback, and consider collaborating with CS4All.
