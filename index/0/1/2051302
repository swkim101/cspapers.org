The AI literature contains many definitions of diagnostic reasoning most of which are defined in terms of the logical entailment relation. We use existing work on approximate entailment to define notions of approximation in diagnosis. We show how such a notion of approximate diagnosis can be exploited in various diagnostic strategies. We illustrate these strategies by performing diagnosis in a small car domain example.
