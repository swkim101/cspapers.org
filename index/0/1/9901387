We consider the problem of image representation for visual analysis. When representing images as vectors, the feature space is of very high dimensionality, which makes it difficult for applying statistical techniques for visual analysis. To tackle this problem, matrix factorization techniques, such as Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), received an increasing amount of interest in recent years. Matrix factorization is an unsupervised learning technique, which finds a basis set capturing high-level semantics in the data and learns coordinates in terms of the basis set. However, the representations obtained by them are highly dense and can not capture the intrinsic geometric structure in the data. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Sparse Concept Coding (SCC), for image representation and analysis. Inspired from the recent developments on manifold learning and sparse coding, SCC provides a sparse representation which can capture the intrinsic geometric structure of the image space. Extensive experimental results on image clustering have shown that the proposed approach provides a better representation with respect to the semantic structure.
