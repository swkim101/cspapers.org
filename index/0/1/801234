Many practitioners of reinforcement learning problems have observed that oftentimes the performance of the agent reaches very close to the optimal performance even though the estimated (action-)value function is still far from the optimal one. The goal of this paper is to explain and formalize this phenomenon by introducing the concept of the action-gap regularity. As a typical result, we prove that for an agent following the greedy policy \(\hat{\pi}\) with respect to an action-value function $\(\hat{Q}\)$, the performance loss $\(E[V^*(X) - V^{\hat{X}} (X)]\)$ is upper bounded by $\(O(|| \hat{Q} - Q^*||_\infty^{1+\zeta}\))$, in which ζ ≥ = 0) is the parameter quantifying the action-gap regularity. For ζ > 0, our results indicate smaller performance loss compared to what previous analyses had suggested. Finally, we show how this regularity affects the performance of the family of approximate value iteration algorithms.
