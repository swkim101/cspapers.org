This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm for searching for the optimal implementations of signal transforms and compares this approach against other search techniques. A single signal processing algorithm can be represented by a very large number of different but mathematically equivalent formulas. When these formulas are implemented in actual code, unfortunately their running times differ signi.cantly. Signal processing algorithm optimization aims at finding the fastest formula. We present a new approach that successfully solves this problem, using an evolutionary stochastic search algorithm, STEER, to search through the very large space of formulas. We empirically compare STEER against other search methods, showing that it notably can find faster formulas while still only timing a very small portion of the search space.
