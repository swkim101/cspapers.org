The demo we propose represents a first step toward RF Sounding [1]. Such a project is an open space installation which comprises both artistic and technological innovations; its aim is to provide the user, while entering a specifically defined area, with awareness of radio frequency signals characterizing the cellular networks band. Indeed, radio signals are shifted, with proper elaboration, to the audible band and the result is spread all over the specific area through a certain number of loudspeakers. For this procedure we have been inspired by the eternal metaphor of the impossible human dream to fly, thus the limitations of our senses which are capable of feeling audio waves (sounds) but (maybe luckily) are not capable of directly feeling radio frequency (RF) waves are highlighted. The translation is the starting point for a more complex and exciting musical composition. It has to be underlined that some features of RF sensed signals are kept unchanged in order to give to the listener the clear feeling of the amount (power) of RF signals present in the monitored area. The aim of this project is twofold. Indeed, from one side we want to increase end users knowledge of the strength of the power emitted by their cellular phones with respect to the electromagnetic fields produced in the environment, on the other hand we want to provide for an artistic and interactive installation that can also be remotely joined through a web interface.
