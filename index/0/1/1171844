In this paper we introduce and analyze frame-based fair queueing, a novel traffic scheduling algorithm for packet-switched networks. The algorithm provides end-to-end delay bounds identical to those of PGPS (packet-level generalized processor sharing), without the complexity of simulating the fluid-model system in the background as required in PGPS. The algorithm is therefore ideally suited for implementation in packet switches supporting a large number of sessions. We present a simple implementation of the algorithm for a general packet switch. In addition, we prove that the algorithm is fair in the sense that sessions are not penalized for excess bandwidth they received while other sessions were idle. Frame-based fair queueing belongs to a general class of scheduling algorithms, which we call Rate-Proportional Servers. This class of algorithms provides the same end-to-end delay and burstiness bounds as PGPS, but allows more flexibility in the design and implementation of the algorithm. We provide a systematic analysis of this class of schedulers and obtain bounds on their fairness.
