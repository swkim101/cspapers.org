In the last five years we have witnessed a mushrooming of interest in computer education at the secondary level, the primary focus of which has been on computer literacy. Few guidelines exist for designing a course at this level which emphasizes programming. In this paper, we describe a computer programming course for high school students who are considering entering data processing or computer science degree programs. The course was developed jointly by members of the Computer Technology Department of Purdue University at Fort Wayne and the Mathematics Department at New Haven High School.
