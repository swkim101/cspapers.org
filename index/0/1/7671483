In traditional natural language systems, the channel of communication between the user and the system was a narrow and constraining device. In many areas natural Ian guage-based information access requires the possibility for the user of exploring the domain and a system's comfortable habitability. The present work presents a rationale for building intelligent interfaces that combine natural language and hypermedia as new means for human-computer interaction and in particular gives an outline of a prototype of this kind, built for the exploration of Italian frescoes: the ALFresco interactive system.
