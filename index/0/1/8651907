Featured articles in Wikipedia stand for high information quality, and it has been found interesting to researchers to analyze whether and how they can be distinguished from "ordinary" articles. Here we point out that article discrimination falls far short of writer support or automatic quality assurance: Featured articles are not identified, but are made. Following this motto we compile a comprehensive list of information quality flaws in Wikipedia, model them according to the latest state of the art, and devise one-class classification technology for their identification.
