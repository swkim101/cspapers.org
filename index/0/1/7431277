Network traffic classification is of great importance for fine-grained network management and network security. However, with the rapid development of new network applications in recent years, traffic that cannot be identified by classifiers accounts for an increasing ratio, which brings a great challenge for network operators. Most of the unknown traffic is usually generated by only a few or some certain kinds of applications. We call this kind of traffic as the elephant traffic. It is generally recognized that traffic sharing the same server IP and server port is generated by the same application. In this paper, we say that they are belonging to the same service. Therefore, we propose a novel method, in which service-based statistical features are used for cluster analysis, to classify these elephant traffic. Preliminary results on a real network traffic dataset show that our method is able to automatically identify similar unknown applications. We believe that classifying unknown traffic in service perspective is a promising direction.
