This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of an application following the deductive approach. The application concerns a safety critical system and for modelliig the application domain two conceptual models were used the Entity Relationship Time (ERT) for the structural part and the Conceptual Rule Language (CRL) for constraints, derivation and event-action rules. The mapping from the conceptual level to the deductive DBMS platform, namely MegaLog, is described with some sample results. An overview of the system, along with a simple user interface for creating different application scenarios are presented and are followed by some statistic results of a real life case study and an evaluation of the proposed approach.
