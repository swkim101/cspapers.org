The world population is growing older. Global aging is occurring at a rate never seen before, it is expected that in 2040 there will be three times more people over the age 85 than there are today. Population aging is a fundamental transformation of human society and many implications for health and long-term care policy are occuring. Even if nursing homes and other care facilities can provide assistance, space and staff shortages are already becoming an issue. In this paper, a new research work that depicts a music therapist robot that helps people suffering from cognitive changes related to aging and/or Alzheimerâ€™s disease, is presented. The social therapist robot tries to provide customized cognitive stimulation by playing a music game with the participants. This research work presents a 12 months longitudinal study.
