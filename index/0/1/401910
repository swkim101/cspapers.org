Most real world domains differ-from the micro-worlds traditionally used in A.I. in that they have an incomplete factual database which changes over time. A traditional rule interpreter such as Planner can be extended to construct plausible inferences in these domains by (A) allowing assumptions to be made in applying rules, resulting in simplifications of rules which can be used in an incomplete database; (B) monitoring the antecedents and consequents of a rule so that inferences can be maintained over a changing database.
