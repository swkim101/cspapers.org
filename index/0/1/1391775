Navigating information spaces is an essential part of our everyday lives, and in order to design efficient and user-friendly information systems, it is important to understand how humans navigate and find the information they are looking for. We perform a large-scale study of human wayfinding, in which, given a network of links between the concepts of Wikipedia, people play a game of finding a short path from a given start to a given target concept by following hyperlinks. What distinguishes our setup from other studies of human Web-browsing behavior is that in our case people navigate a graph of connections between concepts, and that the exact goal of the navigation is known ahead of time. We study more than 30,000 goal-directed human search paths and identify strategies people use when navigating information spaces. We find that human wayfinding, while mostly very efficient, differs from shortest paths in characteristic ways. Most subjects navigate through high-degree hubs in the early phase, while their search is guided by content features thereafter. We also observe a trade-off between simplicity and efficiency: conceptually simple solutions are more common but tend to be less efficient than more complex ones. Finally, we consider the task of predicting the target a user is trying to reach. We design a model and an efficient learning algorithm. Such predictive models of human wayfinding can be applied in intelligent browsing interfaces.
