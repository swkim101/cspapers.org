Expert finding on social media benefits both individuals and commercial services. In this paper, we exploit a 5-level tree representation to model the posts on social media and cast the expert finding problem to the matching problem between the learned user tree and domain tree. We enhance the traditional approximate tree matching algorithm and incorporate word embeddings to improve the matching result. The experiments conducted on Sina Microblog demonstrate the effectiveness of our work.
