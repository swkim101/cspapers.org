In this paper, the present status of DA system, which is used in designing computers in NEC is introduced, and the development procedure and use of this system are described. Then, on the basis of the actual results of this system, the future problems of DA systems to be solved are also described.
 In designing the present high speed and large scale-computer, the role of DA systems becomes more and more important because the processing of complex and a great deal of data is requested, and still more accurate, reliable and rapid processing capability is required.
