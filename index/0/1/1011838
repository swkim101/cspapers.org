We train the dog on several diverse terrains, progressively building up a database of good and bad points, along with their three characteristic parameters. The quality of a terrain point is determined by measuring the distance that the foot slips. We start by walking the LilttleDog on flat ground. The lower left visual shows the raw data being collected. In the lower right, we demonstrate how, as more data is collected, we are able to progressively generalize to an uncharted terrain.
