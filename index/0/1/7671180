Common algorithms for sentence and word-alignment allow the automatic identification of word translations from parallel texts. This study suggests that the identification of word translations should also be possible with non-parallel and even unrelated texts. The method proposed is based on the assumption that there is a correlation between the patterns of word co-occurrences in texts of different languages.
