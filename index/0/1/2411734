The IBM System/38 machine architecture provides data security through addressability control and protection domains while minimizing overhead for this service. This paper describes the addressing mechanism, basic data organization and process structure of the System/38. These constructs are fundamental to the operation of the security mechanism. A description is given of security in the architecture and how it can be extended.
