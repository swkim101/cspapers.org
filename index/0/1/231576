Some recent initiatives try to take profit from RDF to make XML documents interoperate at the semantic level. Ontologies are used to establish semantic connections among XML languages, and some mechanisms have been defined to query them with natural XML query languages like XPath and XML Query. Generally structure-mapping approaches define a simple translation between trivial XPath expressions and some RDF query language like RDQL; however some XPath constructs cannot be covered in a structure-mapping strategy. In contrast, our work takes the model-mapping approach, respectful with node order, that allows mapping all XPath axis. The obtained XPath implementation has the properties of schema-awareness and IDREF-awareness, so it can be used to exploit inheritance hierarchies defined in one or more XML schemas.
