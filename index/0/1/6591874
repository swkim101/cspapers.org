This paper discusses the kind of information that must be present in a computer program that models the linguistic development of a child. A three stage model is presented that characterizes the development of a natural language parser in a child of ages one, one and a half, and two. Some data from children of these ages is presented. General problems with respect to computer learning are also discussed.
