Numerous papers and conference talks have recently been devoted to the affirmation or reaffirmation of various common-sense principles of computer program design and implementation, particularly with respect to operating systems and to large subsystems such as language translators. These principles are nevertheless little observed in practice, often to the detriment of the resulting systems. This paper attempts to summarize the most significant principles, to evaluate their applicability in the real world of large multi-access systems, and to assess how they can be used more effectively.
