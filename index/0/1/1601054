The lnscape Environment is an integrated software development enviroment for building large software systems by large groups of developers. It provides tools that are knowledgeable about the process of system construction and evolution and that work in symbiosis with the system builders and evolvers. These tools are integrated around the constructive use of formal module interface specifications. We first discuss the problems that Inscapo addresses, outline our research strategies and approaches to solving these problems, and summarize the contributions of the Inscape Environment. We then discuss the major aspects of the Inscape Environment: the specification language, system construction, system evolution, use and reuse, and validation, We illustrate these various components with examples and discussions.
