We study self-training with products of latent variable grammars in this paper. We show that increasing the quality of the automatically parsed data used for self-training gives higher accuracy self-trained grammars. Our generative self-trained grammars reach F scores of 91.6 on the WSJ test set and surpass even discriminative reranking systems without self-training. Additionally, we show that multiple self-trained grammars can be combined in a product model to achieve even higher accuracy. The product model is most effective when the individual underlying grammars are most diverse. Combining multiple grammars that were self-trained on disjoint sets of unlabeled data results in a final test accuracy of 92.5% on the WSJ test set and 89.6% on our Broadcast News test set.
