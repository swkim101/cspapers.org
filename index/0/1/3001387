This paper describes a practical method of automatic simultaneous interpretation utilizing an example-based incremental transfer mechanism. We primarily show how incremental translation is achieved in the context of an example-based framework. We then examine the type of translation examples required for a simultaneous interpretation to create naturally communicative dialogs. Finally, we propose a scheme for automatic simultaneous interpretation exploiting this example-based incremental translation mechanism. Preliminary experimentation analyzing the performance of our example-based incremental translation mechanism leads us to believe that the proposed scheme can be utilized to achieve a practical simultaneous interpretation system.
