A flat reflector having retroreflection characteristics is presented based on transformation electromagnetics. The retroreflector is designed with a distributed full-tensor anisotropic metamaterial. Its retroreflection operations are confirmed by circuit simulations based on the equivalent circuit model of the distributed anisotropic metamaterial.
