Although reliefs are frequently used to add patterns to product surfaces, there is a lack of interaction techniques to model reliefs on the surface of virtual objects. We adopted the repouss√© and chasing artwork techniques in an alternative interaction technique to model relief on virtual surfaces. To support this interaction technique, we developed the double-sided touchpad Trampoline that can detect the position and force of a finger touch on both sides. Additionally, Trampoline provides users with elastic feedback, as its surface consists of a stretchable fabric. We implemented a relief application with this device and the developed interaction technique. An informal user study showed that the proposed system can be a promising solution to create reliefs.
