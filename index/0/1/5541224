By Robertson and Seymour's graph minor theorem, every minor ideal can be characterised by a finite family of excluded minors. (A <i>minor ideal</i> is a class of graphs closed under taking minors.) We study algorithms for computing excluded minor characterisations of minor ideals. We propose a general method for obtaining such algorithms, which is based on definability in monadic second-order logic and the decidability of the monadic second-order theory of trees. A straightforward application of our method yields algorithms that, for a given <i>k</i>, compute excluded minor characterisations for the minor ideal <i>T</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> of all graphs of tree width at most <i>k</i>, the minor ideal <i>B</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> of all graphs of branch width at most <i>k</i>, and the minor ideal <i>G</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> of all graphs of genus at most <i>k.</i>
 Our main results are concerned with constructions of new minor ideals from given ones. Answering a question that goes back to Fellows and Langston [11], we prove that there is an algorithm that, given excluded minor characterisations of two minor ideals <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, computes such a characterisation for the ideal <i>C</i> âˆª <i>D.</i> Furthermore, we obtain an algorithm for computing an excluded minor characterisation for the class of all apex graphs over a minor ideal <i>C</i>, given an excluded minor characterisation for <i>C.</i> (An apex graph over <i>C</i> is a graph <i>G</i> from which one vertex can be removed to obtain a graph in <i>C.</i>) A corollary of this result is a uniform ftpalgorithm for the "distance <i>k</i> from planarity" problem.
