The widespread use of Internet-based services is increasing the amount of information (such as user pro les) that clients are required to disclose. This information demand is necessary for regulating access to services, and functionally convenient (e.g., to support service customization), but it has raised privacy-related concerns which, if not addressed, may a ect the users disposition to use network services. At the same time, servers need to regulate service access without disclosing entirely the details of their access control policy. There is therefore a pressing need for privacy-aware techniques to regulate access to services open to the network. We propose an approach for regulating service access and information disclosure on the Web. The approach consists of a uniform formal framework to formulate|and reason about|both service access and information disclosure constraints. It also provides a means for parties to communicate their requirements while ensuring that no private information be disclosed and that the communicated requirements are correct w.r.t. the constraints.
