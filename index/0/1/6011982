The VideoMouse is a mouse that uses a camera as its input sensor. A real-time vision algorithm determines the six degree-of-freedom mouse posture, consisting of 2D motion, tilt in the forward/back and left/right axes, rotation of the mouse about its vertical axis, and some limited height sensing. Thus, a familiar 2D device can be extended for three-dimensional manipulation, while remaining suitable for standard 2D GUI tasks. We describe techniques for mouse functionality, 3D manipulation, navigating large 2D spaces, and using the camera for lightweight scanning tasks.
