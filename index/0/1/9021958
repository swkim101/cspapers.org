Information access is becoming increasingly heterogeneous. Especially when the user's information need is for exploratory purpose, returning a set of diverse results from different resources could benefit the user. For example, when a user is planning a trip to China, retrieving and showing results from vertical search engines like travel, flight information, map and Q2A sites can satisfy the user's rich and diverse information need. This heterogeneous search paradigm is useful in many contexts and brings many new challenges.
