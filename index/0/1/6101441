Typical volume meshes in three dimensions are designed to conform to an underlying two-dimensional surface mesh, with volume mesh element size growing larger away from the surface. The surface mesh may be uniformly spaced or highly graded, and may have fine resolution due to extrinsic mesh size concerns. When we desire that such a volume mesh have good aspect ratio, we require that some space-filling scaffold vertices be inserted off the surface. We analyze the number of scaffold vertices in a setting that encompasses many existing volume meshing algorithms. We show that under simple preconditions, the number of scaffold vertices will be linear in the number of surface vertices.
