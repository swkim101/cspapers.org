1 In t roduc t ion The edit distance (also called Levenshtein metric) between two strings is the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions and character substitutions) needed to transform one string into another. This distance is of key importance in computational biology, as well as text processing and other areas. Algorithms for problems involving this metric have been extensively investigated. In particular, the quadratic-time dynamic programming algorithm for computing the edit distance between two strings is one of the most investigated and used algorithms in computational biology. Recently, a new approach to problems involving edit distance has been proposed. Its basic component is construction of a mapping ff (called an embedding), which maps any string s into a vector ff(s) E ~d, so that for any pair of strings s, s', the Ip distance IIf(s)-f(s')lip is approximately equal to the edit distance between s and s ~. The approximation factor is called distortion of the embedding f. A low-distortion embedding of edit distance into lp norm would be very useful, for the following reasons:
