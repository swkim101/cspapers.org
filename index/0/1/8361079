We use the measured round trip delays of small UDP probe packets sent at regular time intervals to analyze the end-to-end packet delay and loss behavior in the Internet. By varying the interval between probe packets, it is possible to study the structure of the Internet load over different time scales. In this paper, the time scales of interest range from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Our observations agree with results obtained by others using simulation and experimental approaches. For example, our estimates of Internet workload are consistent with the hypothesis of a mix of bulk traffic with larger packet size, and interactive traffic with smaller packet size. We observe compression (or clustering) of the probe packets, rapid fluctuations of queueing delays over small intervals, etc. Our results also show interesting and less expected behavior. For example, we find that the losses of probe packets are essentially random unless the probe traffic uses a large fraction of the available bandwidth. We discuss the implications of these results on the design of control mechanisms for the Internet.
