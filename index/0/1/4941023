In a robot mounted camera arrangement, hand-eye calibration estimates the rigid relationship between the robot and camera coordinate frames. Most hand-eye calibration techniques use a calibration object to estimate the relative transformation of the camera in several views of the calibration object and link these to the forward kinematics of the robot to compute the hand-eye transformation. Such approaches achieve good accuracy for general use but for applications such as robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery, acquiring a calibration sequence multiple times during a procedure is not practical. In this paper, we present a new approach to tackle the problem by using the robotic surgical instruments as the calibration object with well known geometry from CAD models used for manufacturing. Our approach removes the requirement of a custom sterile calibration object to be used in the operating room and it simplifies the process of acquiring calibration data when the laparoscope is constrained to move around a remote centre of motion. This is the first demonstration of the feasibility to perform hand-eye calibration using components of the robotic system itself and we show promising validation results on synthetic data as well as data acquired with the da Vinci Research Kit.
