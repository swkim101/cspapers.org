This panel focuses on the industrial vision for the future of computer architecture research. The field of computer architecture is in critical need for focus, perhaps now more than ever. The underlying technology is presenting significant roadblocks for next generation designs. The applications that the world wants seem to be out of synch with mainstream research. The potential impact of our work seems to be uncertain. Despite this, there are some excellent opportunities out there. We have invited several distinguished technical leaders from key hardware and software companies in the computing industry to articulate their vision for the future of computer architecture research.
