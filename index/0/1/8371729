A five-year old program of a two-semester course sequence in software engineering is described. Strategies for handling four common faculty administrative concerns of teaching a project centered software engineering course are presented. The methods and experiences described are the results of a program now in its fifth year. The program is centered around industry sponsored projects which computer science seniors take from design to implementation during the school year.
