The quantified boolean formula (QBF) problem is a powerful generalization of the boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem where variables can be both universally and existentially quantified. Inspired by the fruitfulness of the established model for generating random SAT instances, we define and study a general model for generating random QBF instances. We exhibit experimental results showing that our model bears certain desirable similarities to the random SAT model, as well as a number of theoretical results concerning our model.
