Formations that contain a small number of robots are modeled as controlled Lagrangian systems on Jacobi shape space. This allows a blocked decoupled control for position, orientation and shape of the formation. Feedback control laws are derived using control Lyapunov functions. The controlled dynamics converges to the invariant set where desired shape is achieved. Controllers are implemented in a layered fashion via the extended motion description language (MDLe) system. Group MDLe plans are constructed to allow structured controller design for formations.
