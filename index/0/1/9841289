In this paper we present motion optimization algorithms for computing manipulation motions in presence of obstacles. Our approach builds a geometric representation of the workspace by constructing Riemannian metrics using electric potentials emanating from the workspace obstacles. Velocity of the robot's body is measured with respect to this metric instead of traditional Cartesian velocity. Empirical results demonstrate that Riemannian metrics are better handled by optimizers that leverage objective and constraint functions' second order information. This information encodes how the Riemannian geometry of the modeled workspace pulls back into the configuration space. We also show that despite the additional computational burden of computing the electric-potential based metric, it results in faster overall convergence than reasoning on Euclidean geometry alone. Evaluation is made efficient by cashing the electric potential in voxel grids and using Tri-cubic spline interpolation to assess the potentials gradient.
