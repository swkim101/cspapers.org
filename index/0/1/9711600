System combination is an effective strategy to boost retrieval performance, especially in complex applications such as cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) where the aspects of translation and retrieval have to be optimized jointly. We focus on machine learning-based approaches to CLIR that need large sets of relevance-ranked data to train high-dimensional models. We compare these models under various measures of orthogonality, and present an experimental evaluation on two different domains (patents, Wikipedia) and two different language pairs (Japanese-English, German-English). We show that gains of over 10 points in MAP/NDCG can be achieved over the best single model by a linear combination of the models that contribute the most orthogonal information, rather than by combining the models with the best standalone retrieval performance.
