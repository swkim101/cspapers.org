This paper explores different techniques for explanation within the framework of the situation calculus, using the so-called stolen car problem as its main example. Two approaches to explanation are compared: the deductive approach usually found in the literature, and a less common abductive approach. Both approaches are studied in the context of two different styles of representation.
