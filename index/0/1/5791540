Crowdsourcing serves different needs of different sets of users. Most existing definitions and taxonomies of crowdsourcing address platform purpose while paying little attention to other parameters of this novel social phenomenon. In this paper, we analyze 41 crowdsourcing campaigns on 21 crowdsourcing platforms to derive 9 key parameters of successful crowdsourcing campaigns and introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of crowdsourcing. Using this taxonomy, we identify crowdsourcing trends in two parameters, platform purpose and contributor motivation. The paper highlights important advantages of using this conceptual model in planning crowdsourcing campaigns and concludes with a discussion of emerging challenges to such campaigns.
