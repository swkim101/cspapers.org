A stochastic model is developed for estimating wiring space requirements for one-dimensional layouts. This model uses as input the number of devices in the complex to be wired, the average length of a connection, and the average number of connections per device, to compute the probability of successfully wiring the devices as a function of the number of tracks provided.
 A heuristic approach is used to extend this model to the two-dimensional case, and tested against experimen-tal studies. Satisfactory agreement is found between a priori calculations of track requirements for the two-dimensional case against global wiring solutions for artificially generated problems, and for some layouts of actual logic complexes.
