We present a new method for estimating the number of tuples satisfying a condition of the type attribute rel constant, where rel is one of "=", ">", "<", "≥", "≤". Our method gives highly accurate, yet easy to compute, estimates. We store information about attribute values as a list of distribution steps (histograms where buckets, instead of having equal width, have equal height). These distribution steps provide an upper bound on the error when estimating the number of tuples satisfying a condition. The estimation error can be arbitrarily reduced by increasing the number of steps. We analyze desirable conditions that such estimates should satisfy. Based on the distribution steps, we derive a set of estimation formulas which minimize the worst-case error. We also present another set of formulas which reduce the average-case error. Finally, we show how to use sampling to compute a close approximation of the distribution steps very quickly. The major applications of our method are in query optimization and in answering statistical queries.
