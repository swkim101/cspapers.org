Viewing knowledge discovery as a user-centered process that requires an effective collaboration between the user and the discovery system, our work aims to support an active role of the user in that process by developing synergistic visualization tools integrated in our discovery system D2MS. These tools provide an ability of visualizing the entire process of knowledge discovery in order to help the user with data preprocessing, selecting mining algorithms and parameters, evaluating and comparing discovered models, and taking control of the whole discover process. Our case-studies with two medical datasets on meningitis and stomach cancer show that, with visualization tools in D2MS, the user gains better insight in each step of the knowledge discovery process as well the relationship between data and discovered knowledge.
