Two parallel rows of support elements are provided in a roll assembly for a controlled deflection roll comprising a stationary roll support and a rotatable roll shell supported by the support elements at the rotatable roll support. The support elements of one row are axially displaced or offset with respect to the support elements of the other row. The support elements of one row are circumferentially aligned with the spaces in the other row and partially overlap or overlie the support elements thereof. As a further modification the support elements of the two rows may also interleave in the circumferential direction. The roll pressure can be varied or adjusted by the individual supply of pressure fluid to individual support elements permitting finer and more accurate adjustment and regulation of the contact pressure at a greater number of regulation points in a roll device.
