It is becoming the norm for small mobile devices to have access to multiple technologies for connecting to the Internet. This gives researchers an increasing interest for solutions allowing to use efficiently several communication mediums. We propose a demonstration of our Multipath TCP implementation for Linux, that allows spreading a single TCP flow across multiple Internet paths, without requiring any change to applications. The demonstration will involve a real Internet communication with MPTCP, with simultaneous use of several paths, as well as a demonstration of MPTCP failover capability.
