The main objective of this paper is to study the control problems for a multi-robot team moving in hierarchical formation. We formulate the problem as a chart by the four-tier hybrid architecture. We devise rules to form a realizable hierarchical formation. Four control laws are derived to achieve the formation patterns. The proposed control laws are suitable for the on-line, real-time formation tasks. Simulation result shows the efficacy of the approaches.
