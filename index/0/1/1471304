The purpose of this paper is to introduce a replicable WWW protocol analysis methodology illustrated by application to data collected in the laboratory. The methodology uses instrumentation to obtain detailed recordings of user actions with a browser, caches Web pages encoutered, and videotapes talk-aloud protocols. We apply the current form of the method to the analysis of eight Web protocols, visualizing the structure of the interaction and showing the strong effect of information scent in determining the path followed.
