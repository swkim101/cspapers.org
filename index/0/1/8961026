This paper presents a detailed comparative framework for assessing the usefulness of unsupervised word representations for identifying so-called implicit discourse relations. Specifically, we compare standard one-hot word pair representations against low-dimensional ones based on Brown clusters and word embeddings. We also consider various word vector combination schemes for deriving discourse segment representations from word vectors, and compare representations based either on all words or limited to head words. Our main finding is that denser representations systematically outperform sparser ones and give state-of-the-art performance or above without the need for additional hand-crafted features.
