We consider the problem of partitioning <italic>n</italic> integers chosen randomly between <italic>1</italic> and <italic>2^m</italic> into two subsets such that the discrepancy, the absolute value of the difference of their sums, is minimized. A partition is called <italic>perfect</italic> if the optimum discrepancy is <italic>0</italic> when the sum of all <italic>n</italic> integers in the original set is even, or <italic>1</italic> when the sum is odd. Parameterizing the random problem in terms of <italic>&kgr; = m/n</italic>, we prove that the problem has a sharp threshold at <italic>&kgr; = 1</italic>, in the sense that for <italic>&kgr; < 1</italic>, there are many perfect partitions with probability tending to <italic>1</italic> as <italic>n \to \infty</italic>, while for  <italic &kgr;> 1</italic>, there are no perfect partitions with probability tending to <italic>1</italic>. Moreover, we show that the derivative of the so-called entropy is discontinuous at <italic>&kgr;=1</italic>.
We also determine the scaling window about the transition point: <italic>&kgr;_n = 1 - (2n)^{-1}\log_2 n + λ_n / n</italic>, by showing that the probability of a perfect partition tends to <italic>0</italic>, <italic>1</italic>, or some explicitly computable <italic>p(λ) \in (0,1)</italic>, depending on whether <italic>λ_n</italic> tends to <italic>-\infty$, $\infty$, or $λ \in (-\infty, \infty)</italic>, respectively. For <italic>λ_n \to -\infty</italic> fast enough, we show that the number of perfect partitions is Gaussian in the limit. For  <italic>λ_n \to \infty</italic>, we prove that with high probability the optimum partition is unique, and that the optimum discrepancy is <italic>&thgr;(λ_n)</italic>.  Within the window, i.e., if <italic>|λ_n|</italic> is bounded, we prove that the optimum discrepancy is bounded. Both for <italic>λ_n \to \infty</italic> and within the window, the limiting distribution of the (scaled) discrepancy
