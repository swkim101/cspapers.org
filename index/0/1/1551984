We introduce a new method of constructing approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems using semidefinite programming. It consists of expressing each combinatorial object in the original problem as a constellation of vectors in the semidefinite program. When we apply this technique to systems of linear equations mod p with at most two variables in each equation, we can show that the problem is approximable within (1??(p))p, where ?(p)0 for all p. Using standard techniques, we also show that it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within a constant ratio, independent of p.
