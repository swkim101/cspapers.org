We analyze a lattice rounding technique using a natural matrix norm. We present its application to proving in a non-uniform model the hardness of computing 2 log log p bits of the secret keys of Diffie-Hellman and related protocols from the public keys. Earlier in it was shown that {radical}log p bits are hard to compute. Efforts to extend our results to the uniform model raise a natural approximation problem for a form of weighted bin packing. If this approximation problem is easy on random inputs, then MSB`s of Diffie-Hellman secrets are as hard to compute as the whole in the uniform model.
