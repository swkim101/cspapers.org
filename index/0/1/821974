Computers running database management applications often manage large amounts of data. Typically, the price of the I/O subsystem is a considerable portion of the computing hardware. Fierce price competition demands every possible savings. Lossless data compression methods, when appropriately integrated with the dbms, yield signiflcant savings. Roughly speaking, a slight increase in cpu cycles is more than offset by savings in I/O subsystem. Various design issues arise in the use of data compression in the dbms from the choice of algorithm, statistics collection, hardware versus software based compression, location of the compression function in the overall computer system architecture, unit of compression, update in place, and the application of log’ to compressed data. These are methodic & y examined and trade-offs discussed in the context of choices made for IBM’s DB2 dbms product.
