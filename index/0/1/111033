Haptic systems usually stimulate the kinesthetic aspects of the sense of touch, i.e. force feedback systems. But more and more devices aim to stimulate the cutaneous part of the sense of touch to reproduce more complex tactile sensations. To do so, they stimulate one's fingertip in different locations, usually in the fashion of a matrix pattern. In this paper we investigate the new possibilities that are offered by such a framework and present an ongoing project that investigates the benefits of Hilbert curves to display resolution independent mid-air haptic textures in comparison with other implementation approaches.
