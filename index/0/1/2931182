In contrast with traditional relation extraction, which only considers a fixed set of relations, Open Information Extraction (Open IE) aims at extracting all types of relations from text. Because of data sparseness, Open IE systems typically ignore lexical information, and instead employ parse trees and Part-of-Speech (POS) tags. However, the same syntactic structure may correspond to different relations. In this paper, we propose to use a lexicalized tree kernel based on the word embeddings created by a neural network model. We show that the lexicalized tree kernel model surpasses the unlexicalized model. Experiments on three datasets indicate that our Open IE system performs better on the task of relation extraction than the stateof-the-art Open IE systems of Xu et al. (2013) and Mesquita et al. (2013).
