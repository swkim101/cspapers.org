Time sequences appear in various application domains. Many applications require time sequences to be seen as continuous where implicit values can be derived from explicit values by arbitrary user-defined interpolation functions. This paper describes the implementation of an extended SELECT operator, σ*, that retrieves implicit values from a discrete time sequence under various user-defined interpolation assumptions. The σ* operator is efficiently supported by an indexing technique termed the IP-index. Possible optimizations of the σ* operator are investigated and verified by experiments on SHORE. The σ* operator is applicable to any 1-D sequence data.
