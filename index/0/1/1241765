The Engineering Psychology program at the University of Illinois is interdisciplinary in nature and involves the participation of faculty members, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students from the Department of Psychology, Department of Industrial Engineering, the Institute of Aviation, and the Beckman Institute. While the interests of the faculty members and the students run the gamut from nuts and bolts ergonomics to the design of intelligent systems there are two topics, the design of displays and the acquisition of perceptual-motor and cognitive skills, which serve as a unifying focus of research in Human-Computer Interaction.
The examination of issues in display design and skill acquisition ranges from basic research on visual psychophysics and automatization to applied research and design projects on aviation displays and computer-based tutorials. Three laboratories within the Engineering Psychology program contribute to these research efforts: the Visual Information Processing laboratory, the Human-Computer Interaction laboratory, and the Aviation Research laboratory. In the description that follows we will indicate the mission of each of these laboratories and the manner in which they contribute to the interdisciplinary research programs on displays and skill acquisition.
