Multimedia data mining is the mining of high-level multimedia information and knowledge from large multimedia databases. A multimedia data mining system prototype, MultiMediaMiner, has been designed and developed. It includes the construction of a multimedia data cube which facilitates multiple dimensional analysis of multimedia data, primarily based on visual content, and the mining of multiple kinds of knowledge, including summarization, comparison, classification, association, and clustering.
