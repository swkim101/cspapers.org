This paper describes a design automation processor which was developed as a design, pedagogical, and research tool at Vanderbilt University. The processor was intended to provide a design aid for the development of small scale switching systems (e.g., controllers, interfaces, etc.). These designs were intended to be realized using TTL logic and TI #218763 wire-wrap boards. While the initial implementation was limited to this technology, flexibility for growth was included in the system design. In addition, although the system is primarily designed for wire-wrapped technology, a wire router is included to provide a printed circuit capability.
