We feel that for a long time introductory computer science courses have degenerated into courses more appropriately titled “Introduction to the Programming Language X” where X has historically been FORTRAN or BASIC and more recently PL/I or APL. In this paper we propose an introductory course which first, and foremost, teaches problem-solving methodology with the final stage of it being translation of an algorithm into a well-structured program. And, second, it achieves this in conjunction with an introduction to the major areas of computer science.
