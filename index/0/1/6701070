Because of polysemy, distant labeling for information extraction leads to noisy training data. We describe a procedure for reducing this noise by using label propagation on a graph in which the nodes are entity mentions, and mentions are coupled when they occur in coordinate list structures. We show that this labeling approach leads to good performance even when off-the-shelf classifiers are used on the distantly-labeled data.
