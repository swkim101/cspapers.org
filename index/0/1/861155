The fastest growing community of web users is that of mobile visitors who browse with wireless PDAs, cell phones, and pagers. Unfortunately, most web sites today are optimized exclusively for desktop, broadband clients, and deliver content poorly suited for mobile devices | devices that can display only a few lines of text, are on slow wireless network connections, and cannot run client-side programs or scripts. To best serve the needs of this growing community, we propose building web site personalizers that observe the behavior of web visitors and automatically customize and adapt web sites for each individual mobile visitor. In this paper, we lay the theoretical foundations for web site personalization, discuss our implementation of the web site personalizer Proteus, and present experiments evaluating its behavior on a number of academic and commercial web sites. Our initial results indicate that automatically adapting web content for mobile visitors saves a considerable amount of time and e ort when seeking information \on the go."
