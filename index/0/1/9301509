Computer-controlled hardware testing can be accomplished safely, dependably, and economically with the four-phase plan presented in this paper. The four phases are product design, product testers, tester programming, and data output. Usefulness of the plan increases if the designer, programmer, and management understand each others problems and do an adequate job of communicating.
