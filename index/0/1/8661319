Given an <italic>n</italic>-edge convex subdivision of the plane, is it possible to report its <italic>k</italic> intersections with a query line segment in <italic>O(k+$~polylog$(n))</italic> time, using subquadratic storage? If the query is a plane and the input is a polytope with <italic>n</italic> vertices, can one achieve <italic>O(k+$~polylog$(n))</italic> time with subcubic storage? Does any convex polytope have a boundary dominant Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchy? Can fractional cascading be generalized to planar maps instead of linear lists? We prove that the answer to all of these questions is no, and we derive near-optimal solutions to these classical problems.
