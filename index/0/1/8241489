This paper proposes a method for packing feature structures, which automatically collapses equivalent parts of lexical/phrasal feature structures of HPSG into a single packed feature structure. This method avoids redundant repetition of unification of those parts. Preliminary experiments show that this method can significantly improve a unification speed in parsing.
