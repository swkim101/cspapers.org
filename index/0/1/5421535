Abstract : The formation of data bases containing information on mechanical systems for trouble shooting purposes has become increasingly popular and important. Examination of these data bases by humans can be very costly. A system called BROWSER is currently under development to heuristically search a data base containing information on Navy aircraft with little or no human intervention. BROWSER searches the data base guided by models and heuristics looking for interesting patterns or configurations. The user is then notified of the existence of these patterns. (Author)
