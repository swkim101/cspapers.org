Compilability is a measure of how effectively compilation (or preprocessing) can be applied to knowledge bases specified in a particular knowledge representation formalism; the aim of compilation is to allow for efficient, on-line query processing. A theory of compilability has been established for organizing knowledge representation formalisms according to a scheme of "compilability classes", and bears strong analogies to the classical theory of complexity, which permits the organization of computational problems according to complexity classes. We develop a novel theory of compilability, called parameterized compilability, which incorporates the notion of parameterization as used in parameterized complexity and permits for refined analysis of compilability.
