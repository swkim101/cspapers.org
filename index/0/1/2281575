This paper presents the design, kinematics, fabrication, and magnetic manipulation of a milli-gripper for medical applications. The design employs a permanent magnet for two purposes. It actuates the compliant gripper and allows for maneuverability of the milli-gripper in an externally applied magnetic field generated by an electromagnetic manipulation system. The modular milli-gripper can be manipulated directly or attached to the distal tip of a magnetically steered catheter. Experiments show successful actuation of the gripper and guidance of the device with the integrated gripper in both the tethered and untethered configuration.
