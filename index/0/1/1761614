A route navigation method for a mobile robot with an omni-directional image sensor is described. The route is memorized from a series of consecutive omnidirectional images at the horizon when the robot moves to the goal. While the robot is navigating to the goal point, the input is matched against the memorized spatio-temporal route pattern by using dual active contour models and the exact robot position and orientation is estimated from the converged shape of active contour models.
