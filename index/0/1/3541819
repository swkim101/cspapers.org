The minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding objective improves BLEU scores for machine translation output relative to the standard Viterbi objective of maximizing model score. However, MBR targeting BLEU is prohibitively slow to optimize over k-best lists for large k. In this paper, we introduce and analyze an alternative to MBR that is equally effective at improving performance, yet is asymptotically faster --- running 80 times faster than MBR in experiments with 1000-best lists. Furthermore, our fast decoding procedure can select output sentences based on distributions over entire forests of translations, in addition to k-best lists. We evaluate our procedure on translation forests from two large-scale, state-of-the-art hierarchical machine translation systems. Our forest-based decoding objective consistently outperforms k-best list MBR, giving improvements of up to 1.0 BLEU.
