We suggest a new model for strategic voting based on local dominance, where voters consider a set of possible outcomes without assigning probabilities to them. We prove that voting equilibria under the Plurality rule exist for a broad class of local dominance relations. Furthermore, we show that local dominance-based dynamics quickly converge to an equilibrium if voters start from the truthful state, and we provide weaker convergence guarantees in more general settings. Using extensive simulations of strategic voting on generated and real profiles, we show that emerging equilibria replicate widely known patterns of human voting behavior such as Duverger's law, and that they generally improve the quality of the winner compared to non-strategic voting.
