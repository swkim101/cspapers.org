We investigate the problem of a robot searching for an object. This requires reasoning about both perception and manipulation: some objects are moved because the target may be hidden behind them, while others are moved because they block the manipulatorâ€™s access to other objects. We contribute a formulation of the object search by manipulation problem using visibility and accessibility relations between objects. We also propose a greedy algorithm and show that it is optimal under certain conditions. We propose a second algorithm which takes advantage of the structure of the visibility and accessibility relations between objects to quickly generate plans. Our empirical evaluation strongly suggests that our algorithm is optimal under all conditions. We support this claim with a partial proof. Finally, we demonstrate an implementation of both algorithms on a real robot using a real object detection system.
