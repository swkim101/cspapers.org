This paper presents results of studies conducted at Hughes Aircraft Company into automated aids for designing large software systems. In particular, we describe two automated tools that have been developed to establish the feasibility of aiding the construction, modification, and goodness testing of large structure charts of software modules. Further, we present conclusions of studies which establish software system design engineering principles that are necessary for disciplined software development. We conclude by proposing a system which incorporates these engineering principles and the experience gained from using current automated tools into a forward thinking computer aided software design system.
