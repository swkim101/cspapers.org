This paper describes the main design principles of the multiaccess system ESOPE. Emphasis is placed on basic ideas underlying the design rather than on implementation details. The main features of the system include the ability given to any user to schedule his own parallel processes, using system primitive operations, and the allocation/scheduling policy, which dynamically takes into account recent information about user behaviour.
