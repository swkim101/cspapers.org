We study efficient, deterministic interactive coding schemes that simulate any interactive protocol both under random and adversarial errors, and can achieve a constant communication rate independent of the protocol length. For channels that flip bits independently with probability e For channels in which an adversary controls the noise pattern our coding scheme can tolerate Ω(1/log n) fraction of errors with rate approaching 1. Once more, all previously known nontrivial deterministic schemes (either efficient or not) in the adversarial setting had a rate bounded away from 1, and no nontrivial efficient deterministic coding schemes were known with any constant rate. Essential to both results is an explicit, efficiently encodable and decodable systematic tree code of length n that has relative distance Ω(1/log n) and rate approaching 1, defined over an O(log n)-bit alphabet. No nontrivial tree code (either efficient or not) was known to approach rate 1, and no nontrivial distance bound was known for any efficient constant rate tree code. The fact that our tree code is systematic, turns out to play an important role in obtaining rate 1 - O([EQUATION]) in the random error model, and approaching rate 1 in the adversarial error model.
