Phase-Change Memory (PCM) technology has received substantial attention recently. Because PCM is byte-addressable and exhibits access times in the nanosecond range, it can be used in main memory designs. In fact, PCM has higher density and lower idle power consumption than DRAM. Unfortunately, PCM is also slower than DRAM and has limited endurance. For these reasons, researchers have proposed memory systems that combine a small amount of DRAM and a large amount of PCM. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid design that features a hardware-driven page placement policy. The policy relies on the memory controller (MC) to monitor access patterns, migrate pages between DRAM and PCM, and translate the memory addresses coming from the cores. Periodically, the operating system updates its page mappings based on the translation information used by the MC. Detailed simulations of 27 workloads show that our system is more robust and exhibits lower energy-delay2 than state-of-the-art hybrid systems.
