Experts in advanced system technologies will predict the design of the best HPC architectures in 2020. They will defend why they think the technology they select will be the winning technology 15 years from now. The panelists will pick one set of technology - not a list of possibilities - to define the system. They will define the performance and aspects of the technologies and explain why their system is the most likely to succeed.Besides questions and comments at the sessions, attendees will vote for the proposed systems of 2020 they think are most likely to succeed. The presentations, votes and attendee comments will all be sealed in a time capsule that will be opened in 2020, which will be used in 2020 to compare the predications to reality. The time capsule will also include an appropriate prize for the presenter who made the best prediction. The winner needs to be present to collect their prize.
