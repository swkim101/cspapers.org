Anyone who teaches a course in Computer Organization is faced with the problem of supplementing lectures and readings with hands-on experience for the students in microprogramming, both as laboratory exercises and homework. Many are using simulators to fill this role, as witnessed by frequent papers in this and other forums. (The “no fewer than three... since 1987,” in [Fu] is a considerable underestimate.) Rarely in these papers is discussed the educational goals behind the design and application of these simulators; instead, the specific capabilities and architectures are generally described, frequently accompanied by sample output and screen dumps. Related papers discuss actual microprogrammable hardware, generally interfaced with a microcomputer monitor. A selection of these papers appears in the bibliography; space precludes a complete list. The present paper describes the goals upon which one such simulator was based. This program, Micro, was originally written by the author in the Summer of 1989 and has been enhanced considerably during the following years. It is based on the data path used as the primary example in the Computer Organization book by Hamacher, et. al. [HVZ], particukwly in Chapter 5. It has been used for over four years in an undergraduate hardware-oriented Computer Organization course, and once in a Master’s level graduate Organization course.
