AGVCR, the AccessGrid Video "Cassette" Recorder, allows easy recording, editing and playback of an AccessGrid conference. Replayed conferences can be played back locally or via an AccessGrid venue to share again with others. AGVCR operates on all platforms that AccessGrid supports (Linux, Windows and Mac OS X) and does not necessarily even require host machine installation when run directly from CD/DVD. Optionally, AGVCR can integrate with the AccessGrid Venue Client to make recording those events possible with just a couple of clicks.
