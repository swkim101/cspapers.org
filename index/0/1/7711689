We address the query-performance-prediction task for entity retrieval; that is, retrieval effectiveness is estimated with no relevance judgements. First we show how to adapt state-of-the-art query-performance predictors proposed for document retrieval to the entity retrieval domain. We then present a novel predictor that is based on the cluster hypothesis. Evaluation performed with the INEX entity ranking track collections shows that our predictor can often outperform the most effective predictors we experimented with.
