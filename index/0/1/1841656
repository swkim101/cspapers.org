The demo, BeepBeep, shows a high-accuracy acoustic-based ranging system without relaying on any pre-planned infrastructure or inter-device time synchronization. Moreover, the BeepBeep is a pure software-based solution and readily applicable to many low-cost sensor platforms and to most commercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices. Our demo using two common cell phones shows that BeepBeep can achieve average two centimeters accuracy within a range of more than ten meters.
