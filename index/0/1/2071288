Computational web portals are designed to simplify access to diverse sets of high performance computing resources, typically through an interface to computational Grid tools. An important shortcoming of these portals is their lack of interoperable and reusable services. This paper presents an overview of research efforts undertaken by our group to build interoperating portal services around a Web Services model. We present a comprehensive view of an interoperable portal architecture, beginning with core portal services that can be used to build Application Web Services, which in turn may be aggregated and managed through portlet containers.
