For the design and verification of a heterogeneous system architecture containing analog, digital, and software functionality, the use of modern languages and advanced Electronic System-Level (ESL) top-down design methodologies becomes fundamental. This paper will present the industrial application of the SystemC analog/mixed-signal (AMS) extensions in combination with SystemC and other C++ libraries, to enable mixed-signal system-level design of a Magneto Resistive Sensor product. It will demonstrate an efficient top-down design and early verification approach by creating an accurate mixed-signal virtual prototype for concept development and architecture exploration, bringing high modelling fidelity and high simulation speed.
