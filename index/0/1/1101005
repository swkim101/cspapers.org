A linear-time approximation algorithm for routing multipoint net channels is presented. The algorithm uses at most a constant factor times the optimal number of tracks required. The notion of channel fluxis introduced and shown, like channel density, to be a lower bound for channel width. Every multipoint net channel having density d and flux f is routed within 2d+O(f) tracks, and every two-point net channel within d+O(f) tracks. Since the flux never exceeds &thgr;(@@@@n), this proves a conjecture of Brown and Rivest [6] that every n-net channel can be routed in O(d+@@@@n) tracks. In practice, it appears that the flux never exceeds a small constant. In this case the algorithm performs asymptotically better than the best-known knock-knee algorithm [21], and almost as well as the best-known three-layer algorithm [19], without requiring the use of either knock-knees or three layers of interconnect. In addition, the three-parameter model, which is closer to the design rules of current fabrication technologies, is presented. Under this model, it is shown that every channel can be routed using 2d+O(1) tracks.
