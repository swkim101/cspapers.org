Understanding crosscutting concerns is difficult because their underlying relations remain hidden in a class-based decomposition of a system. Based on an extensive investigation of crosscutting concerns in existing systems and literature, we identified a number of typical implementation idioms and relations that allow us to group such concerns around so- called "sorts". In this paper, we present SoQueT, a tool that uses sorts to support the consistent description and documentation of crosscutting relations using pre-defined, sort- specific query templates.
