This paper focuses on the design of communication strategies between vehicle to roadside unit (RSU). For reducing the contention probability and increasing the probability of uploading high-priority data to the RSU, the IEEE 802.11 PCF MAC protocol is used within the signal coverage rage of RSU. Based on the PCF MAC, a priority-based bandwidth request scheme is applied to increase the probability of the vehicle with high-priority data sends the bandwidth request packet to RSU. According to the bandwidth requesting, a scheduling algorithm with linear programming scheme is developed in RSU to maximize the bandwidth utilization and to maximize the success uploading ratio of high-priority data. The simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme has a good performance in term of bandwidth utilization and success data uploading ratio.
