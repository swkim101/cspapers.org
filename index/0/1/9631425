INTRODUCTION Apple’s Business Learning Research group is exploring the development of next generation simulation-based learning environmentsthat integrate artificial intelligence and multimedia technologies [1]. Sample applications include a role playing simulator designed to help engineers learn information gathering skills, and a device simulator designed to help mechanics learn troubleshooting skills. In addition to sample applications, authoring environments that can speed the development of these systems are also being prototype. The Business Learning Research (BLR) group is part of Apple’s Advanced Technology Group (ATG).
