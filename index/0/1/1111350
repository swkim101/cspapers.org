The ability to perceive possible interactions with the environment is a key capability of task-guided robotic agents. An important subset of possible interactions depends solely on the objects of interest and their position and orientation in the scene. We call these object-based interactions 0-order affordances and divide them among non-hidden and hidden whether the current configuration of an object in the scene renders its affordance directly usable or not. Conversely to other works, we propose that detecting affordances that are not directly perceivable increase the usefulness of robotic agents with manipulation capabilities, so that by appropriate manipulation they can modify the object configuration until the seeked affordance becomes available. In this paper we show how 0-order affordances depending on the geometry of the objects and their pose can be learned using a supervised learning strategy on 3D mesh representations of the objects allowing the use of the whole object geometry. Moreover, we show how the learned affordances can be detected in real scenes obtained with a low-cost depth sensor like the Microsoft Kinect through object recognition and 6D0F pose estimation and present results for both learning on meshes and detection on real scenes to demonstrate the practical application of the presented approach.
