This paper reports upon an engagement-based study that was carried out on the Isle of Tiree (the Inner Hebrides, Scotland). The purpose of the study was to examine the use of a tabletop projection system as a mechanism to allow some of the islands inhabitants to initially discuss their understanding of data, data needs and to further explicate the ways in which communities or researchers might use such systems to engage with communities in a participatory-civic manner.
