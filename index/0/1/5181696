ABSTRACT Understanding the nature and hara teristi s of e-business workloads is a ru ial step to improve the quality of servi e o ered to ustomers in ele troni business environments. However, the variety and omplexity of the intera tions between ustomers and sites make the hara terization of ebusiness workloads a hallenging problem. Using a multilayer hierar hi al model, this paper presents a detailed hara terization of the workload of two a tual e-business sites: an online bookstore and an ele troni au tion site. Through the hara terization pro ess, we found the presen e of autonomous agents, or robots, in the workload and used the hierar hi al stru ture to determine their hara teristi s. We also found that sear h terms follow a Zipf distribution.
