The robustnessfunctionof a matroid measures the maximum increase in the weight of its minimum weight bases that can be obtained by increases of a given total c&t on the weights of its elements. We present an algorithm for computing this function, that runs in strongly polynomial time for matroids in which independence can be tested in strongly polynomial time. We identify key properties of transversal, scheduling, and partition matroids, and exploit them to design robustness algorithms that are more efficient than our general algorithm.
