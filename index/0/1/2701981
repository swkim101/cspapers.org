This paper presents a novel trip route construction using location check-in data. Given a set of preference lists of locations from users, we aim to coordinate their preferred locations to visit and construct a route which not only satisfying user preferences as many as possible, but also being popular and reasonable. We formulate such preferred route construction as an optimization problem. We solve it efficiently and effectively by devising some greedy methods. Experiments on Gowalla large-scale check-in data show the promising effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.
