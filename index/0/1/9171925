In this paper we investigate new mechanisms for achieving forward secure encryption in store and forward messaging systems such as email and SMS. In a forward secure encryption scheme, a user periodically updates her secret key so that past messages remain confidential in the event that her key is compromised. A primary contribution of our work is to introduce a new form of encryption that we name puncturable encryption. Using a puncturable encryption scheme, recipients may repeatedly update their decryption keys to revoke decryption capability for selected messages, recipients or time periods. Most importantly, this update process does not require the recipients to communicate with or distribute new key material to senders. We show how to combine puncturable encryption with the forward-secure public key encryption proposal of Canetti et al. To achieve practical forward-secure messaging with low overhead. We implement our schemes and provide experimental evidence that the new constructions are practical.
