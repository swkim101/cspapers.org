Recently, neural network models have achieved consistent improvements in statistical machine translation. However, most networks only use one-hot encoded input vectors of words as their input. In this work, we investigated the exponentially decaying bag-of-words input features for feed-forward neural network translation models and proposed to train the decay rates along with other weight parameters. This novel bag-of-words model improved our phrase-based state-of-the-art system, which already includes a neural network translation model, by up to 0.5% B LEU and 0.6% T ER on three different translation tasks and even achieved a similar performance to the bidirectional LSTM translation model.
