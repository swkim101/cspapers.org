As system designers make increasing use of complex standard components (such as microcomputers, RAM, standard DSP's) and ASIC's in the same design, or even on the same semi-custom integrated circuit, the problem of modeling the behavior of the system for verification using simulation is becoming increasingly acute. While chip designers have made extensive use of simulation for design verification, system designers have been slow to follow their lead.
Will vendors provide detailed simulation models of their complex standard components and, if so, in what format? Can VHDL be used effectively in this role or is it too complex to use? How can the IC vendor provide a model without giving away its design to competitors? Can an accurate model be created by a third party, from the part and its specification sheets, in all cases? Will IC vendors qualify such a model? What is the role of hardware modeling; are hardware modelers and behavioral models complements or competitors? Can software simulators meet the challenge of design size and design complexity? How important is mixed analog-digital simulation in this process?
