Abstract : Performance analysis of an interactive visualization system generally requires an extensive user study, a method that is very expensive and that often yields inconclusive results. To do a successful user study, the researcher has to be well aware of the system's possibilities. In this paper we present a different kind of analysis. We show how the system behavior and performance could be investigated off line, without direct user intervention. We introduce an evaluation measure to assess the quality of a multidimensional visualization. Next, we suggest two methods for dealing with user's feedback. We also discuss the effect the dimensionality of the visualization has on the actual performance.
