We examined background characteristics of virtual reality participants in order to determine correlations to cybersickness. As 3D media and new VR display technologies from companies such as Occulus and Sony become more popular, the incidence of cybersickness is likely to increase. Understanding the impact of individual backgrounds on susceptibility can help shed light on which individuals are more likely to be impacted. Past history of motion sickness and video game play have the best predictive power of cybersickness of the factors studied. A model to estimate the likelihood of cybersickness using background characteristics is posed.
