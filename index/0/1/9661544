In this paper we classify and analyze approximately twenty database machines (DBMs). We show that (i) research has generally been focused on brute force parallel search methods, (ii) little original work has been done on storage structures, (iii) almost no work has been done on database operating systems, and (iv) most designs are geared towards minimizing the response time of an individual operation, few designs attempt to minimize the response time of an individual query, and almost none are throughput oriented. We also show that the machine architecture of most DBMs can be described using a small number of building blocks.
