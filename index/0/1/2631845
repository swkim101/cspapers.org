Energy efficiency is one of important issues in the resource constrained wireless sensor network. In this paper, we propose the authentication and key agreement protocol that efficiently reduces the overall computational and communication costs in the next generation converged network. The enhanced security procedures are operated through the mobile network in order to maximize the lifetime of the sensor networks and to apply the combined capabilities of both networks.
