Packet sampling techniques introduce measurement errors that should be carefully handled in order to correctly characterize the network behavior. In the literature several works have studied the statistical properties of packet sampling and the way it should be inverted to recover the original network measurements. Here we take the new direction of studying the spectral properties of packet sampled traffic. A novel technique to model the impact of packet sampling is proposed based on a theoretical analysis of network traffic in the frequency domain. Moreover, a real-time algorithm is also presented to detect the spectrum portion of the network traffic that can be restored once packet sampling has been applied. Preliminary experimental results are reported to validate the proposed approach.
