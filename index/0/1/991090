We present an algorithm for automatically generating a nested, fork-join parallel program from a sequential program represented in terms of control and data dependences. This algorithm embodies two techniques for dealing with data dependences: the rst implicitly satis es such dependences by reducing parallelism, and the second eliminates some dependences by introducing private variables. This algorithm has been implemented in the PTRAN system [ABC*87]. Previous work on automatic generation of parallelism focused on vectorization, relying on a datadependence-based and loop-based representation as input [Kuc78] [Wol82] [AK87]. This work is welldeveloped and includes automatic generation of synchronization for loop iterations [Mid86]. Previous work has applied privatization in the form of scalar expansion for vectorization [Wol78]. Other work has fully renamed a program so as to obviate privatization [CF87b]. Our work extends automatic parallelization in the following ways:
