We address this problem using a local search technique, based on Adaptive Search and present experimental evidence that this approach is much more efficient than state-of-the-art exact and approximate methods. Moreover, parallel versions (particularly versions with communication) improve performance so much that very large and hard instances can be solved quickly.
