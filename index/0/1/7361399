Free-word order languages have long posed significant problems for standard parsing algorithms. This paper reports on an implemented parser, based on Government-Binding theory (GB) (Chomsky, 1981, 1982), for a particular free-word order language, Warlpiri, an aboriginal language of central Australia. The parser is explicitly designed to transparently mirror the principles of GB.The operation of this parsing system is quite different in character from that of a rule-based parsing system, e.g., a context-free parsing method. In this system, phrases are constructed via principles of selection, case-marking, case-assignment, and argument-linking, rather than by phrasal rules.The output of the parser for a sample Warlpiri sentence of four words in length is given. The parser was executed on each of the 23 other permutations of the sentence, and it output equivalent parses, thereby demonstrating its ability to correctly handle the highly scrambled sentences found in Warlpiri.
