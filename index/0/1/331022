We develop a sequential adaptation algorithm for radial basis function (RBF) neural networks of Gaussian nodes, based on the method of successive F-Projections. This method makes use of each observation efficiently in that the network mapping function so obtained is consistent with that information and is also optimal in the least L2-norm sense. The RBF network with the F-Projections adaptation algorithm was used for predicting a chaotic time-series. We compare its performance to an adaptation scheme based on the method of stochastic approximation, and show that the F-Projections algorithm converges to the underlying model much faster.
