We introduce an approach to recommending short-lived dynamic packages for golf booking services. Two challenges are addressed in this work. The first is the short life of the items, which puts the system in a state of a permanent cold start. The second is the uninformative nature of the package attributes, which makes clustering or figuring latent packages challenging. Although such settings are fairly pervasive, they have not been studied in traditional recommendation research, and there is thus a call for original approaches for recommender systems. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid method that leverages user analysis and its relation to the packages, as well as package pricing and environmental analysis, and traditional collaborative filtering. The proposed approach achieved appreciable improvement in precision compared with baselines
