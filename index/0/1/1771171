In this paper, we present, discuss and summarize different research works we carried out toward the exploitation of the Web of data for learning and training purpose (Web of learning data). For several years now, we have conducted efforts to explore this main objective through two complementary directions. The first direction is the scalability and particularly the need to develop methods able to provide learners with adequate learning path in the world of big data. The second direction is related to the transition from Web data to Web of learning data and particularly the extraction of cognitive attributes from Web content. For this purpose, we proposed different text mining techniques as well as the development of competency framework engineering tools. Resulting evidence-based techniques allow us to properly evaluate and improve the relationships between learning materials, performance records and student competencies. Although some questions remain unanswered and challenging technology improvements are still required, promising results and developments are arising.
