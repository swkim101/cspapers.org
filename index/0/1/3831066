It has been shown that for a general-valued constraint language Γ the following statements are equivalent: (1) any instance of VCSP(Γ) can be solved to optimality using a constant level of the Sherali-Adams LP hierarchy; (2) any instance of VCSP(Γ) can be solved to optimality using the third level of the Sherali-Adams LP hierarchy; (3) the support of Γ satisfies the “bounded width condition”, i.e., it contains weak near-unanimity operations of all arities.
