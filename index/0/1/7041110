High-generation FPD (Flat Panel Display) glass substrates need to be carried by large clean transfer robot. Due to the space of the deposited glass box is limited, the distance between the two substrates is very small, this requires the sag amount of the robot fork must be controlled within a certain range. The traditional design is completed only in robot manufacturing stage by adding a shim to compensate for this distortion, but this method can only make the fork be compensated at a determined location, deformation at other locations may not be considered. A new solution to the dynamic compensation for the robot fork is proposed. By establishing the robot FEA model and mechanism accuracy model respectively, the synthetic dynamic error is then obtained. One can just change the mechanism accuracy through rational allocation of design tolerances of the robot links to minimize the dynamic error.
