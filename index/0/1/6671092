This paper presents a compliant locomotion framework for torque-controlled humanoids using model-based whole-body control. In order to stabilize the centroidal dynamics during locomotion, we compute linear momentum rate of change objectives using a novel time-varying controller for the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM). Task-space objectives, including the desired momentum rate of change, are tracked using an efficient quadratic program formulation that computes optimal joint torque setpoints given frictional contact constraints and joint position / torque limits. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we demonstrate push recovery and compliant walking using THOR, a 34 DOF humanoid with series elastic actuation. We discuss details leading to the successful implementation of optimization-based whole-body control on our hardware platform, including the design of a “simple” joint impedance controller that introduces inner-loop velocity feedback into the actuator force controller.
