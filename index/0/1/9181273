We deal with the practical solution of the problem of Sorting a permutation By Reversals (SBR), which has relevant applications in computational biology. We present a successful approach based on the use of Linear Programming (LP). In particular, we deal with an LP relaxation with exponentially many variables, that can be handled by generating variables "on the fly", according to a so-called column generation scheme. A major advantage with respect to previous analogous approaches is that the subproblem to face in the column generation phase requires no longer the solution of min-cost general matching problems, but the solution of raincost bipartite matching problems. Experiments show that, at least for our purposes, there is a speed-up of one order of magnitude in going from general matching to bipartite matching, although the best-known algorithms for. the two problems have the same theoretical worst-case complexity. We also prove the worst-case ratio between the lower bound value obtained by our new method and previous ones. The LP relaxation is used within a polynomial-time heuristic and an enumerative exact algorithm for SBR. We show the effectiveness of our approach through extensive computational experiments. In particular, we can solve to proven optimality the largest real-world instances from the literature in few seconds, and the other (smaller) realworld instances within few milliseconds on a workstation. Moreover, we can solve to optimality random instances with n = 100 within 2-3 seconds, as well as provide a solution within 2% of the optimum for ranxtom instances with n = 500 within 10 minutes. These results show that, although the problem is hard and the exact algorithm we propose has apparently exponential running time even on average (in particular, random instances with n = 400 seem to take months, if not much longer), the instances of practical interest can be solved to proven optimality very fast.
