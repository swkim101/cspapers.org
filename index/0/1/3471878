Pair programming is a successful approach for improving student performance, retention, and motivation toward computer science. However, not all students benefit equally from this approach. An open challenge for researchers is to develop a deep understanding of the student experience in pair programming, particularly for novices. This paper reports on a study of the cognitive, affective, and social experiences of students in an introductory programming course in which pair programming was utilized throughout the term. Students reported their experience through reflection essays written at the end of the semester. We analyzed 137 student reflection papers in a mixed-methods study. The quantitative results show that overall, students have a positive attitude toward pair programming. Looking more deeply at the reflection essays, thematic analysis revealed themes centered around cognitive, affective, and social dimensions. In the cognitive dimension, students expressed the importance of exposure to different ideas and developing deeper understanding. Affectively, students reported that working with a partner reduced their frustration and increased their confidence. Students also pointed out the social benefits of forming friendships and helpful connections. These results highlight the powerful benefits of pair programming and point to ways in which this collaborative approach could be adapted to better meet student needs.
