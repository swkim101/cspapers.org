This paper introduces an approach to sentiment analysis which uses support vector machines (SVMs) to bring together diverse sources of potentially pertinent information, including several fa-vorability measures for phrases and adjectives and, where available, knowledge of the topic of the text. Models using the features introduced are further combined with unigram models which have been shown to be effective in the past (Pang et al., 2002) and lemmatized versions of the unigram models. Experiments on movie review data from the Internet Movie Database demonstrate that hybrid SVMs which combine unigram-style feature-based SVMs with those based on real-valued favorability measures obtain superior performance, producing the best results yet published using this data. Further experiments using a feature set enriched with topic information on a smaller dataset of music reviews hand-annotated for topic are also reported, the re-sults of which suggest that incorporating topic information into such models may also yield improvement.
