We propose five heuristic rules for improving the quality of the final results from fully automated sequential procedures in steady-state simulation of communication networks. The goal is to reduce the probability of finishing too early. The effectiveness of these rules of thumb is quantitatively assessed on the basis of the results of coverage analysis of a method of sequential output data analysis in steady-state simulation: spectral analysis. Our results show that rule I which takes the longest run of R replications is the best of five rules.
