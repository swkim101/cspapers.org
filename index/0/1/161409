This paper proposes an adaptation of classical image-based visual servoing to a generalised imaging model where cameras are modelled as sets of 3D viewing rays. This new model leads to a generalised visual servoing control formalism that can be applied to any type of imaging system whether it be multi-camera, catadioptric, non-central, etc. In this paper the generalised 3D viewing cones are parameterised geometrically via Pl√ºcker line coordinates. The new visual servoing model is tested on an a-typical stereo-camera system with non-overlapping cameras. In this case no 3D information is available from triangulation and the system is comparable to a 2D visual servoing system with non-central ray-based control law.
