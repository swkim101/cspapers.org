A range of pneumatically-driven devices have been developed. However, these require a large air compressor, making them heavy, bulky, and therefore inappropriate for use in portable devices. In this study, we proposed and tested a portable pneumatic power source using the chemical reaction between sodium bicarbonate and citric acid. The carbon dioxide generated in the reaction was used as a pneumatic power source. The chemicals used are inexpensive, nontoxic, and readily available. From the result of basic experiment demonstrated in this paper, we conclude that the method can provide enough high pressure (more than 1 MPa) for activating pneumatic actuators and the chemical reaction is safe since it is endothermic reaction. We also demonstrated a novel system that provides continuous mixing of the reagents, using a pressure booster. The system keeps a pressure inside of a tank moderate, and tank can become light weight because it doesn't need to endure high pressure.
