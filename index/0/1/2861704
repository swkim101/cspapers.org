In this paper, a Bayesian inference network model for automatic indexing with index terms (descriptors) from a prescribed vocabulary is presented. It requires an indexing dictionary with rules mapping terms of the respective subject field onto descriptors and inverted lists for terms occuring in a set of documents of the subject field and descriptors manually assigned to these documents. The indexing dictionary can be derived automatically from a set of manually indexed documents. An application of the network model is described, followed by an indexing example and some experimental results about the indexing performance of the network model.
