The kite mechanics including some basic aerodynamics is reviewed in order to set up a framework for the development of robotic kite systems. Some historical background is provided together with a brief review of kite applications, which have been numerous and diverse. Robotizing the kite is expected to enhance its capabilities and revive scientific kiting. Towards that direction a methodology for controlling the angular elevation (and the altitude) of a single-line kite by actively adjusting the length of its bridle strings is proposed together with the required implementation hardware. Preliminary simulations and proof-of-concept field testing using a box kite were carried out.
