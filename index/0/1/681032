This paper analyzes the impact that a high-level design methodology can have in the total design cycle. The main question being raised here is how much high-level design tools really help. For example, one can use a high-level tool to perform scheduling or generate a pipelined implementation of a for loop; and that may save a week in design time. But that alone does not decrease the months of simulation time that still must be performed in large designs. This paper discusses these issues and presents possible approaches for making high-level design tools more effective in the total design cycle.
