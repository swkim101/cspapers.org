In this paper, an efficient computation scheme to control the actuation redundancy in a closed-chain robot manipulator is experimented. A closed-chain direct-drive robot with actuation redundancy is designed and constructed. The redundancy control is implemented on a 2 DOF direct-drive robot with one additional actuator. The robot structure is a five-bar mechanism designed so that in the inertia matrix the velocity dependent terms will disappear. A dynamic performance criteria is used to minimize the joint torques of the robot. A model-based control method is implemented for the direct-drive robot. The joints torques for the same motion in both redundant and nonredundant cases are compared. The experiments verify that the proposed control scheme performs in real-time, and without algorithmic deficiency.<<ETX>>
