The Natural Language Understanding Engine Test Environment (ETE) is a GUI software tool that aids in the development and maintenance of large, modular, natural language understanding (NLU) systems. Natural language understanding systems are composed of modules (such as part-of-speech taggers, parsers and semantic analyzers) which are difficult to test individually because of the complexity of their output data structures. Not only are the output data structures of the internal modules complex, but also many thousands of test items (messages or sentences) are required to provide a reasonable sample of the linguistic structures of a single human language, even if the language is restricted to a particular domain. The ETE assists in the management and analysis of the thousands of complex data structures created during natural language processing of a large corpus using relational database technology in a network environment.
