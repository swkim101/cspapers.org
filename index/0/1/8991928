CC2001 and CC2008 recommend that an undergraduate computing curriculum include 16 hours related to social and professional issues. An ITiCSE 2010 Working Group discussed approaches for incorporating this material in the curriculum and outlined seven contrasting implementation cases. Also, Baldwin et al discuss the implementation of computing curricula at five different liberal arts colleges [TOCE, March 2010]. However, none of these provides specific implementation details for addressing social issues in a liberal arts computing curriculum. This paper identifies successful strategies from one college and begins a general discussion of teaching social issues of computing in a liberal arts setting.
