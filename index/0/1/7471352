In the field of saliency detection, many graph-based algorithms heavily depend on the accuracy of the pre-processed superpixel segmentation, which leads to significant sacrifice of detail information from the input image. In this paper, we propose a novel bottom-up saliency detection approach that takes advantage of both region-based features and image details. To provide more accurate saliency estimations, we first optimize the image boundary selection by the proposed erroneous boundary removal. By taking the image details and region-based estimations into account, we then propose the regularized random walks ranking to formulate pixel-wised saliency maps from the superpixel-based background and foreground saliency estimations. Experiment results on two public datasets indicate the significantly improved accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm in comparison with 12 state-of-the-art saliency detection approaches.
