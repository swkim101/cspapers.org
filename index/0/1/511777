Switching activity is the primary cause of power dissipation in CMOS combinational and sequential circuits. We give a method of estimating power in pipelined sequential CMOS circuits that accurately models the correlation between the vectors applied to the combinational logic of the circuit. We explore the implications of the observation that the switching activity at flip-flop outputs in a synchronous sequential circuit can be significantly less than the activity at the flip-flop inputs. We present a retiming method that targets the power dissipation of a sequential circuit.
