While there is an enormous amount of music 
data available, the eld of music analysis 
almost exclusively uses manually designed 
features. In this work we learn features from 
music data in a completely unsupervised way 
and evaluate them on a musical genre classi - 
cation task. We achieve results very close to 
state-of-the-art performance which relies on 
highly hand-tuned feature extractors.
