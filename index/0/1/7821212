Computer Science educators are constantly reinventing introductory CS0, CS1 and CS2 courses to retain students and increase their learning and motivation. While the focus on drawing students into Computer Science is vital to maintain enrollment, it is also paramount to sustain student motivation by using new pedagogical approaches, contextualized to how students learn, throughout the curriculum to develop technical and interpersonal skills. Many educators have developed one-off courses employing new technology or a project-driven approach to engage students and transfer ready industry skills. Yet, too few have woven a combination of pedagogical approaches sensitive to how students learn with in-demand technology and skills contiguously throughout the upper-level curriculum and tied it to opportunities outside of the classroom. In this poster, we present the initial results of a project with two aims to: (1) design, pilot, and offer new curriculum materials for three upper-level Computer Science courses using a mobile computing platform paired with pedagogical approaches sensitive to the learning styles of today's student; and, (2) develop out-of-classroom learning opportunities including mobile computing student seminars, externship opportunities and service-learning projects reinforcing in-classroom technical skills. We believe that these two components synergistically, can be leveraged to revitalize the undergraduate Computer Science curriculum, better motivate student learning and provide in-demand technical skills to students without losing the fundamental Computer Science concepts.
