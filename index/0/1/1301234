In this paper a sequence of software engineering courses based upon the software life cycle and integrated by a single, medium-size project will be described in detail. The courses will be presented from an educational point of view, emphasizing the topics covered as well as the logistics of teaching the courses. A comparison of these courses to other software engineering courses existing in university curricula will also be presented. The potential advantages for faculty, students, and the research community of this type of course sequence will also be enumerated.
