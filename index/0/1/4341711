A low cost system for mobile robots indoor localization is presented. The system is composed of an emitter located on a wall and a receptor at the top of the robot. The emitter is a laser pointer acting like a beacon, and the receptor is a cylinder made by 32 independent photovoltaic cells. The robot's position and orientation are obtained from the times of impact of the laser on each cell.
