SCORE 2011 is the second iteration of a team-oriented software engineering contest that attracts student teams from around the world, culminating in a final round of competition and awards at ICSE. Each team has responded to one of the project proposals provided by the SCORE program committee, usually in the context of a software engineering project course. In this second iteration we have built on the success of SCORE 2009, greatly expanding the number and geographical distribution of student teams, including many of very high quality.
