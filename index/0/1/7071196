A high speed image based visual servoing (VS) technique is developed in this study for a Selective Compliant Assembly Robotic Arm (SCARA) manipulator with rotary hydraulic actuators. This study has developed a 2D position measuring system which comprise a high speed camera with a position sensitive detector as the image sensor. The input output interface and the controller for the VS system was implemented using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) providing a single chip solution for the embedded system. This camera was capable of providing position measurements of the end effector (EE) with an accuracy of up to 0.95 mm at a frequency of 1340 Hz. The proposed control strategy produced a better tracking performance with an EE payload of 12 kg with speeds of up to 1.3 m/s.
