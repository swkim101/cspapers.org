We describe the design and implementation of a system for logic-based multimedia retrieval. As high-level logic for retrieval of hypermedia documents, we have developed a probabilistic object-oriented logic (POOL) which supports aggregated objects, different kinds of propositions (terms, classifications and attributes) and even rules as being contained in objects. Based on a probabilistic four-valued logic, POOL uses an implicit open world assumption, allows for closed world assumptions and is able to deal with inconsistent knowledge. POOL programs and queries are translated into probabilistic Datalog programs which can be interpreted by the HySpirit inference engine. For storing the multimedia data, we have developed a new basic IR engine which yields physical data abstraction. The overall architecture and the flexibility of each layer supports logic-based methods for multimedia information retrieval.
