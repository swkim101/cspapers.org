This abstract describes a natural language system which deals usefully with ungrammatical input and describes some actual and potential applications of it in computer aided second language learning. However, this is not the only area in which the principles of the system might be used, and the aim in building it was simply to demonstrate the workability of the general mechanism, and provide a framework for assessing developments of it.
