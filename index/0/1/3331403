ABSTRACT This paper proposes an alternative to ROC representation, in which the expected cost of a classi er is represented explicitly. This expected cost representation maintains many of the advantages of ROC representation, but is easier to understand. It allows the experimenter to immediately see the range of costs and class frequencies where a particular classi er is the best and quantitatively how much better it is than other classi ers. This paper demonstrates there is a point/line duality between the two representations. A point in ROC space representing a classi er becomes a line segment spanning the full range of costs and class frequencies. This duality produces equivalent operations in the two spaces, allowing most techniques used in ROC analysis to be readily reproduced in the cost space.
