In this paper we compare accelerated waveform relaxation algorithms to pointwise methods for the transient simulation of semiconductor devices on parallel machines. Experimental results are presented for simulations on small clusters of workstations and on an Intel iPSC/860. The results show that accelerated waveform methods are competitive with standard pointwise methods on serial machines, but are significantly faster on loosely-coupled MIMD machines.
