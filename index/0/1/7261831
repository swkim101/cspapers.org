Robot hybrid control has been noted for its difficulty due to so called dynamic stability problem, and consequently demands robust control algorithms that can overcome this difficulty, yet with accuracy. In this paper, a control law based on time delay control has been derived for hybrid control, with a condition for closed-loop stability. Throughout simulations and experiments, this control law was observed to outperform PD or PID control, thereby proposing itself as a promising one for the hybrid control purpose.<<ETX>>
