Let S be a set S of n points on a polyhedral terrain T in ℝ3, and let e > 0 be a fixed constant. We prove that S admits a (2 + e)-spanner with O(n log n) edges with respect to the geodesic distance. This is the first spanner with constant spanning ratio and a near-linear number of edges for points on a terrain. On our way to this result, we prove that any set of n weighted points in ℝd admits an additively weighted (2 + e)-spanner with O(n) edges; this improves the previously best known bound on the spanning ratio (which was 5 + e), and almost matches the lower bound.
