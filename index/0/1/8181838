A successful approach in the recovery of video-rate structure from motion is to allow the camera to keep track of its position in every frame assuming the recovered set of scene landmarks is fixed in 3D, and then to use the poses in a subset of separated frames, or keyframes, to initialise further landmark structure. The landmark structure and keyframe poses are optimised in a bundle adjustment. Unfortunately this monolithic bundle adjustment has cubic complexity.
