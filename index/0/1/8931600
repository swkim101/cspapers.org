With the constantly increasing Internet traffic and fast changing network protocols, future routers have to simultaneously satisfy the requirements for throughput, QoS, flexibility, and scalability. In this work, we propose a novel integrated CPU/GPU microarchitecture, Hermes, for QoS-aware high speed routing. We also develop a new thread scheduling mechanism, which significantly improves all QoS metrics.
