The semantics of memory-a large state which 
can only be read or changed a small piece at a 
time-has remained virtually untouched since 
von Neumann, and its effects-latency and 
bandwidth-have proved to be the major stumbling 
block for high performance computing. 
This paper suggests a new model, termed 
“microservers,” that exploits “Processing-In- 
Memory” VLSI technology, and that can 
reduce latency and memory traffic, increase 
inherent opportunities for concurrency, and 
support a variety of highly concurrent programming 
paradigms. Application of this 
model is then discussed in the framework of 
several on-going supercomputing programs, 
particularly the HTMT petaflops project.
