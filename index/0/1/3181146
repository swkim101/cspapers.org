Let A be an n times n matrix, whose entries are independent copies of a centered random variable satisfying the subGaussian tail estimate. We prove that the operator norm of' A-1 does not exceed Cn3/2 with probability close to 1. In a geometric language, this bounds the probability that the affine span of n random vectors in Ropfn with i.i.d. subGaussian coordinates comes close to the origin
