Peer tutoring has been used in a variety of contexts and a variety of institutions to both improve learning and retention for the classroom students and to improve the confidence and knowledge base of the peer tutor. Much of the current literature focusses on how to implement peer tutoring with a fairly large program, including at least one graduate TA and multiple undergraduates who have recently taken the course. In addition, these peers were trained outside of the normal classroom hours and/or paid to participate. While useful at larger institutions, or at least those with substantial resources, this model is generally unworkable at a smaller institution without funding to pay students, or a sufficient critical mass of students to enable formal training outside of the classroom. This lightning talk describes a slightly different model that involves the university's academic support center staff for tutoring training, class attendance for technical training, and the giving of credit as opposed to payment for the student. To receive more than one hour of credit the student also works closely with the professor to complete one or more "learning modules" that later become resources for the class and provide an additional learning opportunity for the tutor. This method has been used by the author with over 9 peer tutors across a range of 7 classes, with generally good success.
