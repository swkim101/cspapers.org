It is accepted wisdom that the current Internet architecture conflates network locations and host identities, but there is no agreement on how a future architecture should distinguish the two. One could sidestep this quandary by routing directly on host identities themselves, and eliminating the need for network-layer protocols to include any mention of network location. The key to achieving this is the ability to route on flat labels. In this paper we take an initial stab at this challenge, proposing and analyzing our ROFL routing algorithm. While its scaling and efficiency properties are far from ideal, our results suggest that the idea of routing on flat labels cannot be immediately dismissed.
