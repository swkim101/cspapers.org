This paper studies TSV-to-TSV coupling in 3D ICs. A full-chip SI analysis flow is proposed based on the proposed coupling model. Analysis results show that TSVs cause significant coupling noise and timing problems despite that TSV count is much smaller com- pared with the gate count. Two approaches are proposed to alleviate TSV-to-TSV coupling, namely TSV shielding and buffer insertion. Analysis results show that both approaches are effective in reducing the TSV-caused-coupling and improving timing.
