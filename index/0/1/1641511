Classifying pictures into one of several semantic categories is a classical image understanding problem. In this paper, we present a stratified approach to both binary (outdoor-indoor) and multiple category of scene classification. We first learn mixture models for 20 basic classes of local image content based on color and texture information. Once trained, these models are applied to a test image, and produce 20 probability density response maps (PDRM) indicating the likelihood that each image region was produced by each class. We then extract some very simple features from those PDRMs, and use them to train a bagged LDA classifier for 10 scene categories. For this process, no explicit region segmentation or spatial context model are computed. To test this classification system, we created a labeled database of 1500 photos taken under very different environment and lighting conditions, using different cameras, and from 43 persons over 5 years. The classification rate of outdoor-indoor classification is 93.8%, and the classification rate for 10 scene categories is 90.1%. As a byproduct, local image patches can be contextually labeled into the 20 basic material classes by using loopy belief propagation (Yedidia et al., 2001) as an anisotropic filter on PDRMs, producing an image-level segmentation if desired.
