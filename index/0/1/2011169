Graph-based dependency parsers suffer from the sheer number of higher order edges they need to (a) score and (b) consider during optimization. Here we show that when working with LP relaxations, large fractions of these edges can be pruned before they are fully scored---without any loss of optimality guarantees and, hence, accuracy. This is achieved by iteratively parsing with a subset of higherorder edges, adding higher-order edges that may improve the score of the current solution, and adding higher-order edges that are implied by the current best first order edges. This amounts to delayed column and row generation in the LP relaxation and is guaranteed to provide the optimal LP solution. For second order grandparent models, our method considers, or scores, no more than 6--13% of the second order edges of the full model. This yields up to an eightfold parsing speedup, while providing the same empirical accuracy and certificates of optimality as working with the full LP relaxation. We also provide a tighter LP formulation for grandparent models that leads to a smaller integrality gap and higher speed.
