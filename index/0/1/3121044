Laundering email spam through open-proxies or compromised PCs is a widely-used trick to conceal real spam sources and reduce spamming cost in underground email spam industry. Spammers have been plaguing the Internet by exploiting a large number of spam proxies. The facility of breaking spam laundering and deterring spamming activities close to their sources, which would greatly benefit not only email users but also victim ISPs, is in great demand but still missing. In this paper, we reveal one salient characteristic of proxy-based spamming activities, namely packet symmetry, by analyzing protocol semantics and timing causality. Based on the packet symmetry exhibited in spam laundering, we propose a simple and effective technique, DBSpam, to on-line detect and break spam laundering activities inside a customer network. Monitoring the bi-directional traffic passing through a network gateway, DBSpam utilizes a simple statistical method, Sequential Probability Ratio Test, to detect the occurrence of spam laundering in a timely manner. To balance the goals of promptness and accuracy, we introduce a noise-reduction technique in DBSpam, after which the laundering path can be identified more accurately. Then, DBSpam activates its spam suppressing mechanism to break the spam laundering. We implement a prototype of DBSpam based on libpcap, and validate its efficacy through both theoretical analyses and trace-based experiments.
