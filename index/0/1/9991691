This paper presents our new progress on research of electromyography (EMG) controlled prosthetic hand. Preliminary clinical study is conducted on amputees. EMG data from the residual muscles of three amputees are used to evaluate the new features, discriminant bispectra (DBS) and discriminant Fourier cepstrum (DFC). The performance is also compared with other traditional features, autoregressive (AR) coefficient, time domain statics (TDS), and power spectral distribution (PSD). Some promising results are presented. It shows that DFC and DBS outperforms the other features. The implementation of EMG algorithm is accomplished. Based on the prosthetic hand (SJT-2 hand), experimental demonstration is conducted by both healthy and amputated subjects.
