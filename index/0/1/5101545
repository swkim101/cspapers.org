We describe the i-LAND environment which constitutes an exampleof our vision of the workspaces of the future, in this casesupporting cooperative work of dynamic teams with changing needs.i-LAND requires and provides new forms of human-computerinteraction and new forms of computer-supported cooperative work.Its design is based on an integration of information andarchitectural spaces, implications of new work practices and anempirical requirements study informing our design. i-LAND consistsof several roomware components, i.e. computer-aug- mented objectsintegrating room elements with information technology. We presentthe current realization of i-LAND in terms of an interactiveelectronic wall, an interactive table, two computer-enhancedchairs, and two bridges for the Passage-mechanism. This iscomplemented by the description of the creativity supportapplication and the technological infrastructure. The paper isaccompanied by a video figure in the CHI99 video program.
