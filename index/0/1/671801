Manipulating multiple movable obstacles is a hard problem that involves searching high-dimensional C-spaces. A milestone method for this problem was able to compute solutions for monotone instances. These are problems where every object needs to be transferred at most once to achieve a desired arrangement. The method uses backtracking search to find the order with which objects should be moved. This paper first proposes an approximate but significantly faster alternative for monotone rearrangement instances. The method defines a dependency graph between objects given minimum constraint removal paths (MCR) to transfer each object to its target. From this graph, the approach discovers the order of moving objects by performing topological sorting without backtracking search. The approximation arises from the limitation to consider only MCR paths, which minimize, however, the number of conflicts between objects. To solve non-monotone instances, this primitive is incorporated in a higher-level incremental search algorithm for general rearrangement planning, which operates similar to Bi-RRT. Given a start and a goal object arrangement, tree structures of reachable new arrangements are generated by using the primitive as an expansion procedure. The integrated solution achieves probabilistic completeness for the general non-monotone case and based on simulated experiments it achieves very good success ratios, solution times and path quality relative to alternatives.
