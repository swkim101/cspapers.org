We have previously introduced a method of word sense disambiguation that computes the intended sense of a target word, using WordNet-based measures of semantic relatedness (Patwardhan et al., 2003). SenseRelate::TargetWord is a Perl package that implements this algorithm. The disambiguation process is carried out by selecting that sense of the target word which is most related to the context words. Relatedness between word senses is measured using the WordNet::Similarity Perl modules.
