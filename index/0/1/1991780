We present TapSense, an enhancement to touch interaction that allows conventional surfaces to identify the type of object being used for input. This is achieved by segmenting and classifying sounds resulting from an object's impact. For example, the diverse anatomy of a human finger allows different parts to be recognized including the tip, pad, nail and knuckle - without having to instrument the user. This opens several new and powerful interaction opportunities for touch input, especially in mobile devices, where input is extremely constrained. Our system can also identify different sets of passive tools. We conclude with a comprehensive investigation of classification accuracy and training implications. Results show our proof-of-concept system can support sets with four input types at around 95% accuracy. Small, but useful input sets of two (e.g., pen and finger discrimination) can operate in excess of 99% accuracy.
