In this work, we designed and field-tested a system called Home Trivia to explore how we can use activity traces captured in the home to allow household members to reflect on how they use technology, which has become an issue of increasing concern among families that have seen their home lives intertwined with Internet-enabled devices. Home Trivia captures traces of using technology at home and then shows those traces to family members as content of a puzzle game they can play together. The results of testing Home Trivia in the field show that the design of the game allows engagement and reflection to reinforce each other. Moreover, our work enriches and further develops the idea of using ambiguity as a resource for design with the insight that allowing users to reduce ambiguity through recollecting past events and communicating with others can help trigger reflection.
