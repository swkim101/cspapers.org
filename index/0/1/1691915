Regular monitoring of certain vital parameters like heart-rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), Electrocardiogram (ECG) are the basic needs for elderly people and patients with chronic diseases residing at home. In this demo, authors would like to demonstrate the possibility of estimating BP levels and certain ECG parameters using the PPG signals captured from smart phones. The work includes mainly three components -- (i) robust PPG signal acquisition, (ii) estimation of BP levels (low, medium, high) from PPG signals and (iii) estimation of PR, RR, QRS and QT intervals of ECG parameters from PPG signals. Initially certain time domain features are extracted from PPG, which are used to create training models for various BP levels and ECG parameters. The approach is tested on two benchmark hospital datasets from (i) University of Queensland and (ii) Capnobase TBME RR dataset and one dataset captured from smart phones. Results indicate that the estimation accuracy is above 75% and sometimes above 95% if the height, weight and age information are considered.
