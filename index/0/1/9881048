Today's inter-domain routing protocol, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), is increasingly complicated and fragile due to policy misconfiguration by individual autonomous systems (ASes). Existing configuration analysis techniques are either manual and tedious, or do not scale beyond a small number of nodes due to the state explosion problem. To aid the diagnosis of misconfigurations in real-world large BGP systems, this paper presents BGPVerif , a reduction based analysis toolkit. The key idea is to reduce BGP system size prior to analysis while preserving crucial correctness properties. BGPVerif consists of two components, NetReducer that simplifies BGP configurations, and NetAnalyzer that automatically detects routing oscillation. BGPVerif accepts a wide range of BGP configuration inputs ranging from real-world traces (Rocketfuel network topologies), randomly generated BGP networks (GT-ITM), Cisco configuration guidelines, as well as arbitrary user-defined networks. BGPVerif illustrates the applicability, efficiency, and benefits of the reduction technique, it also introduces an infrastructure that enables networking researchers to interact with advanced formal method tool.
