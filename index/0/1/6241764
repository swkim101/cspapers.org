In this work, the problem of extracting phrase translation is formulated as an information retrieval process implemented with a log-linear model aiming for a balanced precision and recall. We present a generic phrase training algorithm which is parameterized with feature functions and can be optimized jointly with the translation engine to directly maximize the end-to-end system performance. Multiple data-driven feature functions are proposed to capture the quality and confidence of phrases and phrase pairs. Experimental results demonstrate consistent and significant improvement over the widely used method that is based on word alignment matrix only.
