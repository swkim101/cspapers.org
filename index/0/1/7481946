Parallel programming has been taught for many years but has recently taken on greater significance with introduction of multicore and many-core processors. Still, most teaching has followed a traditional path of focusing on learning low-level tools such as MPI. This workshop introduces a new educational approach based upon first selecting a computational pattern and then using higher-level tools to create parallel executable code. A pattern programming framework has been developed to create a distributed application that avoids the need to use low-level routines. The framework self-deploys on distributed computers, clusters, and individual multicore computers. Several patterns have been implemented including workpool, pipeline, synchronous and iterative all-to-all, and stencil. The first pattern covered is the widely applicable workpool pattern and other patterns will be introduced. The workshop will describe how the approach can be used in the undergraduate curriculum and will provide hands-on experiences to participants. In our approach, students focus upon computational strategies. Programming is much easier and less likely to be flawed. Each workshop participant will receive a flash drive with all software and documentation pre-loaded for use in the workshop and afterwards in their classes. Laptop required.
