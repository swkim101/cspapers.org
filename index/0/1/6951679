In a dynamic service oriented environment it is desirable for service consumers and providers to offer and obtain guarantees regarding their capabilities and requirements. WS-Agreement defines a language and protocol for establishing agreements between two parties. The agreements are complex and expressive to the extent that the manual matching of these agreements would be expensive both in time and resources. It is essential to develop a method for matching agreements automatically. This work presents the framework and implementation of an innovative tool for the matching providers and consumers based on WS-Agreements. The approach utilizes Semantic Web technologies to achieve rich and accurate matches. A key feature is the novel and flexible approach for achieving user personalized matches.
