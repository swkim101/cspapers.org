Motivated by applications in combinatorial optimization, we initiate a study of the extent to which the global properties of a metric space (especially, embeddability in l1 with low distortion) are determined by the properties of small subspaces. We note connections to similar issues studied already in Ramsey theory, complexity theory (especially PCPs), and property testing. We prove both upper bounds and lower bounds on the distortion of embedding locally constrained metrics into various target spaces.
