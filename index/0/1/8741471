In this paper we outline a sensor network for landslide detection. Network sensors deployed on the surface and underground the hill under observation, use distributed signal processing techniques to self-localize and detect any changes in their relative locations. When such movements occur, changes in location as well as soil parameters are passed to a central location and used as input to a Finite Element Model that predicts whether and when a landslide will occur.
