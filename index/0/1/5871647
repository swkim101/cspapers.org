Video games, virtual reality, augmented reality, and smart appliances all call for a new way for users to interact and control them. This paper develops high-preCision Acoustic Tracker (CAT), which aims to replace a traditional mouse and let a user control various devices by moving a smartphone in the air. At its heart lies a distributed Frequency Modulated Continuous Waveform (FMCW) that can accurately estimate the distance between a transmitter and a receiver that are separate and unsynchronized. We further develop an optimization framework to combine FMCW estimation with Doppler shifts to enhance the accuracy. We implement CAT on a mobile phone. The performance evaluation and user study show that our system achieves high tracking accuracy and ease of use using existing hardware.
