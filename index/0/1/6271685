Currently, there is an increasing effort to provide various personalized services on museum web sites. This paper presents an approach for determining user interests in a museum collection with the help of an interactive dialog. It uses a semantically annotated collection of the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam to elicit specific user's interests in artists, periods, genres and themes and uses these values to recommend relevant artefacts and related concepts from the museum collection. In the presented prototype, we show how constructing a user profile and applying recommender strategies in this way enable dynamical generation personalized museum tours for different users.
