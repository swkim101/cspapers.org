A broad class of algorithms for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) relies heavily on similarity queries, i.e. range queries or nearest neighbor queries, in multidimensional feature spaces. Many KDD algorithms perform a similarity query for each point stored in the database. This approach causes serious performance degenerations if the considered data set does not fit into main memory. Usual cache strategies such as LRU fail because the locality of KDD algorithms is typically not high enough. In this paper, we propose to replace repeated similarity queries by the similarity join, a database primitive prevalent in multimedia database systems. We present a schema to transform query intensive KDD algorithms into a representation using the similarity join as a basic operation without affecting the correctness of the result of the considered algorithm. In order to perform a comprehensive experimental evaluation of our approach, we apply the proposed transformation to the clustering algorithm DBSCAN and to the hierarchical cluster structure analysis method OPTICS. Our technique allows the application of any similarity join algorithm, which may be based on index structures or not. In our experiments, we use a similarity join algorithm based on a variant of the X-tree. The experiments yield substantial performance improvements of our technique over the original algorithms. The traditional techniques are outperformed by factors of up to 33 for the X-tree and 54 for the R*-tree.
