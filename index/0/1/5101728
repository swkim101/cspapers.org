We compare performance of a multimedia storage server based on a random data allocation layout and block replication with traditional data striping techniques. Data striping techniques in multimedia servers are often designed for restricted workloads, e.g. sequential access patterns with CBR (constant bit rate) requirements. On the other hand, a system based on random data allocation can support virtually any type of multimedia application, including VBR (variable bit rate) video or audio, and interactive applications with unpredictable access patterns, such as 3D interactive virtual worlds, interactive scientific visualizations, etc. Surprisingly, our results show that system performance with random data allocation is competitive and sometimes even outperforms traditional data striping techniques, for the workloads for which data striping is designed to work best; i.e. streams with sequential access patterns and CBR requirements. Due to its superiority in supporting general workloads and competitive system performance, we believe that random data allocation will be the scheme of choice for next generation multimedia servers.
