Adaptive Mixed Criticality (AMC) scheduling has previously been shown to be the most effective fixed priority approach for scheduling mixed criticality systems, while the idea of final non-preemptive regions has been shown to improve the schedulability of systems with a single criticality level. In this paper, we combine AMC with the concept of non-preemptive regions by making the final part of each task's execution at each criticality level non-preemptive. We derive schedulability analysis for this approach, and provide an effective algorithm for choosing each task's priority and the durations of its non-preemptive regions. Evaluations illustrate the benefits of this approach in terms of increased schedulability.
