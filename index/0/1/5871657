Interaction between heterogeneous agents can raise some problems since agents may not use the same models and concepts. Therefore, the use of some mechanisms to achieve interoperability between models allows agents to interact. In this paper we consider the case of reputation models by describing an experience of using several existing technologies to allow agents to interoperate when they use reputation notions/values during interactions. For this purpose, we have implemented agents on the ART testbed and we make them use a functional ontology of reputation which was developed to allow the interoperability among reputation models.
