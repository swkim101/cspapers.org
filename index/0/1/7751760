Google Summer of Code is the outreach program aimed at getting university students involved in a 3-month online internship working in open source software development. Google Code-in is the contest aimed at involving 13-18 year olds in open source software development, documentation translation, outreach, research, and more. I will be discussing both programs at this BoF and encouraging students and teachers to get involved. We'll open the forum for discussion amongst the attendees about how to participate, how to get the word out, and answer any questions they may have.
