A central issue in the design of multiprocessor systems is the interconnection network which provides communications paths between the processors. For large systems, high bandwidth interconnection networks will require numerous 'network chips' with each chip implementing some subnetwork of the original larger network. Modularity and growth are important properties for such networks since multiprocessor systems may vary in size. This paper is concerned with the question of timing control of such networks. Two approaches, asynchronous and clocked, are used in the design of a basic network switching module. The modules and the approaches are then modelled and equations for network time delay are developed. These equations form the basis for a comparison between the two approaches. The importance of clock distribution strategies and clock skew is quantified, and a network clock distribution scheme which guarantees equal length clock paths is presented.
