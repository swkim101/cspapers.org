The concept of prime program is applied as a decomposition technique to the global data flow analysis problem. This is done both in the abstract and through the use of the live variables problem as an example. It is also shown how the prime program decomposition is equivalent to the arrangement of a certain matrix (associated with the global data flow analysis problem) into block triangular form.
