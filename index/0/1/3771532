Wordspotting Wordspotting is the ability to locate a keyword or phrase in the context of fluent speech.The location of the keyword or phrase is identified, without the need to recognize the non-keyword speech.Thus wordspotting differs from isolated word recognition [2], in which words to be recognized must be spoken in isolation, and continuous speechrecognition [1], in which eachword in the continuous streammust berecognized. Wordspotting is useful in tasks such as editing of voice audio and indexing into stored audio files.
