We describe a framework for run-time adaptive dynamic voltage-frequency scaling in Linux systems. Our underlying methodology is based on a simple first-order processor performance model in which frequency scaling is expressed as a change (in cycles) of the main memory latency. Utilizing available performance monitoring hardware, we show that our model is powerful enough to i) predict with reasonable accuracy the effect of frequency scaling, and ii) predict the energy consumed by the core under different V/f combinations. To validate our approach we perform highly accurate, fine grained power measurements directly on the processor off-chip voltage regulator.
