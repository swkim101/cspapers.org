The objective of this workshop is to consolidate the interest in the software engineering community on autonomic, self-managing, self-healing, self-optimizing, self-configuring, and self-adaptive systems. The workshop will provide a forum for researchers to share new results, raise awareness of new adaptive concerns, and promote collaboration among the community. This workshop will be the first of several to assess progress and identify challenges in this important area.
