INTRODUCTION Command histories are an important component of good user interfaces [3]. They allow users to review sequences of previously executed commands, and can provide an interface to an undo facility. Furthermore, they can support either a simple redo mechanism, or a more sophisticated macro-by-demonstration capability. Providing a visual representation of command histories in a graphical user interface presents a number of difficulties. Editable graphical histories [1, 2], a history representation that we have developed based on a comic-strip metaphor, overcomes many of these. Here we describe editable graphical histories, and in the accompanying videotape we demonstrate our test-bed implementation in the graphical editing mode of Chimera, a multi-modal editor.
