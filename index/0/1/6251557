Concurrency has been a perpetual problem in Android apps, mainly due to event-based races. Several event-based race detectors have been proposed, but they produce false positives, cannot reproduce races, and cannot distinguish be- tween benign and harmful races. To address these issues, we introduce a race verification and reproduction approach named ERVA. Given a race report produced by a race detector, ERVA uses event dependency graphs, event flipping, and replay to verify the race and determine whether it is a false positive, or a true positive; for true positives, ERVA uses state comparison to distinguish benign races from harmful races. ERVA automatically produces an event schedule that can be used to deterministically reproduce the race, so developers can fix it. Experiments on 16 apps indicate that only 3% of the races reported by race detectors are harmful, and that ERVA can verify an app in 20 minutes on average.
