This paper describes a computational model of concept acquisition for natural language. We develop a theory of lexical semantics, the Extended Aspect Calculus, which together with a "markedness theory" for thematic relations, constrains what a possible word meaning can be. This is based on the supposition that predicates from the perceptual domain are the primitives for more abstract relations. We then describe an implementation of this model, TULLY, which mirrors the stages of lexical acquisition for children.
