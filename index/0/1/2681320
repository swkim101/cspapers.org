In the field of medicine and biology, many studies to be related to regenerative medicine are accomplished. In particular, the purpose of helping the operation of the cells under a microscope, many research related to micro manipulation techniques with robotic technology has been proposed. In such background, we studied two finger micro hand that realized control of the sub-micro order size object. The accurate operation of the end effector against the object by the micro hand is demanded to users. To reduce the burden, we focus on making the manipulation easy. User can perform micro manipulation with rough operation by using the actuator that varies in size. Since the actuator fills space between the end effectors and the object. Then we focus on the gel that varies in size. In this paper, we evaluate the gel that varies in size. Then we propose the manipulation that take advantage of the gel.
