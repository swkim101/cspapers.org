Software product lines are hard to configure. Techniques that work for medium sized product lines fail for much larger product lines such as the Linux kernel with 6000+ features. This paper presents simple heuristics that help the Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA) in finding sound and optimum configurations of very large variability models in the presence of competing objectives. We employ a combination of static and evolutionary learning of model structure, in addition to utilizing a pre-computed solution used as a “seed” in the midst of a randomly-generated initial population. The seed solution works like a single straw that is enough to break the camel's back -given that it is a feature-rich seed. We show promising results where we can find 30 sound solutions for configuring upward of 6000 features within 30 minutes.
