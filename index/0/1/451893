We discuss current trends in the development and use of high-confidence medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS). These trends, including increased reliance on software to deliver new functionality, wider use of network connectivity in MCPS, and demand for continuous patient monitoring, bring new challenges into the process of MCPS development and at the same time create new opportunities for research and development.
