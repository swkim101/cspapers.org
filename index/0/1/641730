The forms of communication available now are categorized into the one or three dimensional. One dimensional communication includes metal wires and optical fibers in which the electro-magnetic field is confined in one dimensional medium. Wireless communication based on RF or optical connection emits electro-magnetic field in 3-D space. Now what if we have "two-dimensional communication" in which signals travels from one point to another point freely in elastic two-dimensional space using electromagnetic field confined in 2-D space? In this paper, we describe such a new technology of 2-D communication brings new paradigm to robotics. The methodologies of machine-design, system-integration, sensing, and computing will be drastically changed. We show architecture of the 2-D signal transmission based on relaying packets between communication chips on a thin sheet, the physical structure of the 2-D signal transmission, the protocols of the signal relay, and the results of the basic experiments.
