This paper presents a social component framework for the SatinII App Development Environment. The environment provides a systematic way of designing, developing and deploying personalized apps and enables end-users to develop their own apps without requiring prior knowledge of programming. A wide range of social components based on the framework have been deployed in the SatinII Editor, including components that utilize aggregated social graphs to automatically create groups or recommending/filtering information. The resulting social apps are web-based and target primarily mobile clients such as smartphones. The paper also presents a classification of social components and provides an initial user-evaluation with a small group of users. Initial results indicate that social apps can be built and deployed by end-users within 17 minutes on average after 20 to 30 minutes of being introduced to the SatinII Editor.
