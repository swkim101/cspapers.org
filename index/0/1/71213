Desikanz Abstract An important problem in layered manufacturing is the choice of a good build direction, which in uences the quality and the cost of manufacturing the object. We present e cient algorithms for computing a build direction that optimizes the total area of faces that are in contact with supports. For a given convex polytope with n faces and for a parameter " > 0, we present an O((n="3) polylogn) algorithm that computes a build direction so that the total area of faces in contact with supports is at most (1+")A , where A is the minimum area of contact with supports for all build directions. For non-convex polyhedra, we provide evidence that the lower bound for any algorithm computing the optimal direction might be (n4). We also present a faster algorithm for some special cases. Our technique for convex polyhedra involves computing approximate levels in arrangement of lines with weights. For given parameters !; " > 0, we present an algorithm that computes a (1 + ")-approximate weighted !-level in an arrangement of n weighted lines in time O((n="3) polylogn).
