This paper introduces a high performance communication middle layer, called PM2, for hetero-geneous network environments. PM2 currently supports Myrinet, Ethernet, and SMP. Binary code written in PM2 or written in a communication library, such as MPICH-SCore on top of PM2, may run on any combination of those networks without re-compilation. According to a set of NAS parallel benchmark results, MPICH-SCore performance is better than dedicated communication libraries such as MPICH-BIP/SMP and MPICH-GM when running some benchmark programs.
