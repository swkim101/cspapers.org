As mobile video traffic is becoming dominant, balancing the mobile video quality and bandwidth usage is a relevant but hard problem. Particularly, in this project, we attempt to reduce the bandwidth usage of video chats through frame rate adaption. The key idea of this project is to save bandwidth through reducing frame rate at the sender and interpolate the `missing' frames at the receiver for a video chat. Additionally, the sender dynamically adapts the frame rate with respect to inertial sensor readings in order to keep the scene change between consecutive frames small and prevent strong artifacts from the frame interpolation.
