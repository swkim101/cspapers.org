We present a comprehensive overview of the stereoscopic Intel RealSense RGBD imaging systems. We discuss these systems' mode-of-operation, functional behavior and include models of their expected performance, shortcomings, and limitations. We provide information about the systems' optical characteristics, their correlation algorithms, and how these properties can affect different applications, including 3D reconstruction and gesture recognition. Our discussion covers the Intel RealSense R200 and the Intel RealSense D400 (formally RS400).
