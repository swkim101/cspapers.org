This paper presents an annotation scheme for events that negatively or positively affect entities (benefactive/malefactive events) and for the attitude of the writer toward their agents and objects. Work on opinion and sentiment tends to focus on explicit expressions of opinions. However, many attitudes are conveyed implicitly, and benefactive/malefactive events are important for inferring implicit attitudes. We describe an annotation scheme and give the results of an inter-annotator agreement study. The annotated corpus is available online.
