In this paper, we propose a new type of market model called the social domination game model. Given a set C of customers and a set P of products, this model simulates market competition among P and estimates market shares, considering both the dominance relation between C and P and the influence relation among the members of C. With this model, we propose a greedy product positioning algorithm for designing a new product that approximately maximizes market share. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm creates a new product gaining up to 97.5% market share of the best product's market share obtained by the exact method, while significantly outperforming the exact method in terms of running time, i.e., by up to two orders of magnitude.
