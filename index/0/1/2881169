In the recent successful effort to achieve the spatial two-juggle - batting two freely falling balls into independent stable periodic vertical orbits by repeated impacts with a three degree of freedom robot arm, the authors have found it necessary to introduce a dynamical window manager into their real-time stereo vision. This paper describes these necessary enhancements to the original vision system and then proposes a more formal account of how such a feedback based sensor might be understood to work. Further experimentation will be required to determine the extent to which the analytical model explains (and might thus be used as a tool to improve) the performance of the system presently working in the laboratory.
