This demonstration presents a mobile surveillance system that is developed at the University of Science and Technology of China and undergoing a technology transition. The goal of this project is to develop a low-cost, promptly-deployable, mobility manageable, location traceable, self-organizing wireless communication and mobile surveillance system, for real-time video surveillance and on-site guard for public security purposes, e.g., public security against terrorism in large-scale gatherings and events.
