Pseudo-relevance feedback has proven to be an effective strategy for improving retrieval accuracy in all retrieval models. However the performance of existing pseudo feedback methods is often affected significantly by some parameters, such as the number of feedback documents to use and the relative weight of original query terms; these parameters generally have to be set by trial-and-error without any guidance. In this paper, we present a more robust method for pseudo feedback based on statistical language models. Our main idea is to integrate the original query with feedback documents in a single probabilistic mixture model and regularize the estimation of the language model parameters in the model so that the information in the feedback documents can be gradually added to the original query. Unlike most existing feedback methods, our new method has no parameter to tune. Experiment results on two representative data sets show that the new method is significantly more robust than a state-of-the-art baseline language modeling approach for feedback with comparable or better retrieval accuracy.
