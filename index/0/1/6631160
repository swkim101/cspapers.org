The continuous growth of media databases necessitates development of novel visualization and interaction techniques to support management of these collections. We present Videotater, an experimental tool for a Tablet PC that supports the efficient and intuitive navigation, selection, segmentation, and tagging of video. Our veridical representation immediately signals to the user where appropriate segment boundaries should be placed and allows for rapid review and refinement of manually or automatically generated segments. Finally, we explore a distribution of modalities in the interface by using multiple timeline representations, pressure sensing, and a tag painting/erasing metaphor with the pen.
