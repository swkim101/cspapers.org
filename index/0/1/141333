This paper presents a trajectory-tracking control strategy for a class of mechanical systems in Hamiltonian form. The class is characterised by a simplectic interconnection arising from the use of generalised coordinates and full actuation. The tracking error dynamic is modelled as a port-Hamiltonian Systems (PHS). The control action is designed to take the error dynamics into a desired closed-loop PHS characterised by a constant mass matrix and a potential energy with a minimum at the origin. A transformation of the momentum and a feedback control is exploited to obtain a constant generalised mass matrix in closed loop. The stability of the close-loop system is shown using the close-loop Hamiltonian as a Lyapunov function. The paper also considers the addition of integral action to design a robust controller that ensures tracking in spite of disturbances. As a case study, the proposed control design methodology is applied to a fully actuated robotic manipulator.
