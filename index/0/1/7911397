The problem of Adaptation from Participation (AfP) aims to improve the efficiency of a human-robot team by adapting a robot's autonomous systems and behaviors based on command-level input from a human supervisor. As a solution to AfP, the Adaptive Parameter EXploration (APEX) algorithm continuously explores the space of all possible parameter configurations for the robot's autonomous system in an online and anytime manner. Guided by information deduced from the human's latest intervening commands, APEX is capable of adapting an arbitrary robot system to dynamic changes in task objectives and conditions during a session. We explore this framework within visual navigation contexts where the humanrobot team is tasked with covering or patrolling over multiple terrain boundaries such as coastlines and roads. We present empirical evaluations of two separate APEX-enabled systems: the first, deployed on an aerial robot within a controlled environment, and the second, on a wheeled robot operating within a challenging university campus setting.
