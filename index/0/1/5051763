Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a common chronic condition that requires management of one's lifestyle, including nutrition. Critically, patients often lack a clear understanding of how everyday meals impact their blood glucose. New predictive analytics approaches can provide personalized mealtime blood glucose forecasts. While communicating forecasts can be challenging, effective strategies for doing so remain little explored. In this study, we conducted focus groups with 13 participants to identify approaches to visualizing personalized blood glucose forecasts that can promote diabetes self-management and understand key styles and visual features that resonate with individuals with diabetes. Focus groups demonstrated that individuals rely on simple heuristics and tend to take a reactive approach to their health and nutrition management. Further, the study highlighted the need for simple and explicit, yet information-rich design. Effective visualizations were found to utilize common metaphors alongside words, numbers, and colors to convey a sense of authority and encourage action and learning.
