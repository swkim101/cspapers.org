In this paper, we established the transport systems for micro object by using surface swarming of Vibrio alginolyticus. First, we confirmed that V. alginolyticus were able to transport the micro beads. In this experiment, we used YM19 and YM19Î”cheY that were a kind of the variant strain of V. alginolyticus appropriate for surface swarming. Next, we examined relationship between the transport speed and the diameter of the micro bead. The micro channel was applied to control the cell movement. And then we succeeded in causing the rotational transport of object through this method.
