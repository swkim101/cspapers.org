A variety of query systems have been developed for interrogating parsed corpora, or treebanks. With the arrival of efficient, wide-coverage parsers, it is feasible to create very large databases of trees. However, existing approaches that use in-memory search, or relational or XML database technologies, do not scale up. We describe a method for storage, indexing, and query of treebanks that uses an information retrieval engine. Several experiments with a large treebank demonstrate excellent scaling characteristics for a wide range of query types. This work facilitates the curation of much larger treebanks, and enables them to be used effectively in a variety of scientific and engineering tasks.
