This paper proposes a modeling and simulation of three level piezoelectric transformer converters. The increasing utilization of piezoelectric transformers (PT) in power electronics requires fundamental analysis and design of PT power converters. In addition, the possibility of overcoming the essential limitations of PT power ability by a combined operation of PTs needs to be examined. These studies could provide wide opportunities for PT exploitation in power electronic circuits. The electrical circuit and model of piezoelectric transformers (PTs) ELS-60 is developed. Rosen-type PT and many other non-isolated conversion circuits have the inherit problem of the common neutral between the input and output that make it difficult to connect the output in series like the magnetic transformer. A new method based on the bootstrap method is proposed to solve the aforementioned problem. A new circuit for output summation of voltage level in the output side of each PT is developed. The impact of load and output filter capacitor on the conversion ratio and resonant frequency is discussed. The paper finally proposes a multilevel concept for many PT connected together for voltage summation. The method proposed can be applied to other multiple conversion circuits, which are based on common neutral between the input and output. The MATLAB/SIMULINK software used to design the required circuit diagram.
