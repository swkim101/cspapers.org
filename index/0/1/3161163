Undergraduate students often lack the skills necessary to conduct independent research. In order to improve students' skills in research, the Computer Science department at the University of Mary Washington has designed and offered a course in research methods. The course teaches students about learning strategies that they can apply across the computing discipline and beyond. This paper describes the process that was used to create a new research methods course, the details related to the first offering of the course, and findings on how the course changed students' perception of research.
