The design of a two-semester course sequence in software engineering is described. These courses, offered at the undergraduate level, are centered around student projects developed in conjunction with local industry; the projects are used as a focal point to motivate and teach software engineering concepts and tools. The goal of the courses is to provide the student with an overview of the entire software development process, experience as a member of a project team, and exposure to a real-world software environment. This paper describes the course organization and topics, and techniques for project selection and monitoring. Results and experience gained to date with this approach are also discussed.
