Having seen a news title "Alba denies wedding reports", how do we infer that it is primarily about Jessica Alba, rather than about weddings or reports? We probably realize that, in a randomly driven sentence, the word "Alba" is less anticipated than "wedding" or "reports", which adds value to the word "Alba" if used. Such anticipation can be modeled as a ratio between an empirical probability of the word (in a given corpus) and its estimated probability in general English. Aggregated over all words in a document, this ratio may be used as a measure of the document's topicality. Assuming that the corpus consists of on-topic and off-topic documents (we call them the core and the noise), our goal is to determine which documents belong to the core. We propose two unsupervised methods for doing this. First, we assume that words are sampled i.i.d., and propose an information-theoretic framework for determining the core. Second, we relax the independence assumption and use a simple graphical model to rank documents according to their likelihood of belonging to the core. We discuss theoretical guarantees of the proposed methods and show their usefulness for Web Mining and Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT).
