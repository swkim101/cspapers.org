As the availability and importance of relational data—such as the friendships summarized on a social networking website—increases, it becomes increasingly important to have good models for such data. The kinds of latent structure that have been considered for use in predicting links in such networks have been relatively limited. In particular, the machine learning community has focused on latent class models, adapting Bayesian nonparametric methods to jointly infer how many latent classes there are while learning which entities belong to each class. We pursue a similar approach with a richer kind of latent variable—latent features—using a Bayesian nonparametric approach to simultaneously infer the number of features at the same time we learn which entities have each feature. Our model combines these inferred features with known covariates in order to perform link prediction. We demonstrate that the greater expressiveness of this approach allows us to improve performance on three datasets.
