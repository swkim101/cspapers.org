Temporal taggers are usually developed for a certain language. Besides English, only few languages have been addressed, and only the temporal tagger HeidelTime covers several languages. While this tool was manually extended to these languages, there have been earlier approaches for automatic extensions to a single target language. In this paper, we present an approach to extend HeidelTime to all languages in the world. Our evaluation shows promising results, in particular considering that our approach neither requires language skills nor training data, but results in a baseline tagger for 200+ languages.
