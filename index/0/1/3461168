1. SUMMARY A working group proposed a curriculum in 2010 for computer science and engineering undergraduates on parallel and distributed computing (PDC), with the goal that every undergraduate in computing and engineering related fields should be exposed to courses and experiences in PDC-related topics. This group produced an edited book of contributed chapters on teaching PDC topics in the undergraduate curriculum in computing and engineering [1], and also provided updates to the SIGCSE community in 2011 [2] and again in 2014 [3]. In 2017, an expanded working group, including some early adopters, has undertaken a revision of this curriculum, especially considering the emerging aspects of Big Data, power, and distributed computing and identifying a set of cross-cutting topics, as well as formulating concrete exemplars for various PDC topics, modules, and courses.
