This paper presents a method of design for projects in computer courses that tends to enable all students in the class to achieve their maximum potential. Each project is structured at three progressive levels of difficulty corresponding to three prospective grades A, B, and C. The B-level is an extension of the C-level and the A-level is an extension of the B-level. Each student starts at the C-level and progresses as far as possible and is scored accordingly.
