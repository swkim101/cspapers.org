An analogue VLSI neural network has been designed and tested to perform cardiac morphology classification tasks. Analogue techniques were chosen to meet the strict power and area requirements of an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) system. The robustness of the neural network architecture reduces the impact of noise, drift and offsets inherent in analogue approaches. The network is a 10:6:3 multi-layer perceptron with on chip digital weight storage, a bucket brigade input to feed the Intracardiac Electrogram (ICEG) to the network and has a winner take all circuit at the output. The network was trained in loop and included a commercial ICD in the signal processing path. The system has successfully distinguished arrhythmia for different patients with better than 90% true positive and true negative detections for dangerous rhythms which cannot be detected by present ICDs. The chip was implemented in 1.2µm CMOS and consumes less than 200nW maximum average power in an area of 2.2 × 2.2mm2.
