We revisit the problem of computing the path with the minimum cost in terms of the expected number of link layer retransmissions in wireless mesh networks. Unlike previous efforts (such as the popular ETX) we account for the fact that link layer protocols (such as the IEEE 802.11 MAC) incorporate a non-zero but finite number of retransmission attempts per packet. A key observation that motivates this work is that the performance of a path depends not only on the number of links on the path and their qualities, but also on the relative positions of the links on the path. In particular, the closer a lossy link to the destination, the higher is its impact on the performance of that path. We design a new path metricthat captures all of the above factors and we call this metric ETOP. In this paper, we provide a synopsis of the analytical computation of ETOP. We also implement a routing strategy based on ETOP on a 25-node experimental testbed and provide sample results to showcase the performance with ETOP.
