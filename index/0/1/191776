At present, the distinction between interpretive and observational assertions is not made strongly in biomedical informatics knowledge representation (KR) research. In this position paper, we draw from examples in a small number of biomedical domains to advocate the importance of developing systems based primarily on scientific evidence rather than interpretations. As an explanatory methodology, we base this argument primarily on a worked example from a cancer biology study and previous work in knowledge engineering. We emphasize how interpretative models that form the basis of scientific theories are themselves created to fit, explain and predict experimental data. Within an empiricallydriven field such as biomedicine, scientists typically use a rich, intuitive understanding of experimental methodology directly in their work and developing methods to incorporate that expertise into informatics systems remains a challenging but important goal.
