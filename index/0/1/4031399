We present PlayGo, a comprehensive tool for scenario-based programming, built around the language of live sequence charts and the play-in/play-out approach [7], which includes a compiler into AspectJ code and means for debugging the execution. PlayGo is intended to be a full IDE that addresses major parts of the vision of Liberating Programming [3]. This paper presents the first version of PlayGo, which already includes several of the intended capabilities.
