Long interconnects are becoming an increasingly important problem from both power and performance perspectives. This motivates designers to adopt on-chip network-based communication infrastructures and three-dimensional (3D) designs where multiple device layers are stacked together. Considering the trends towards increasing use of chip multiprocessing, it is timely to consider 3D chip multiprocessor design and memory networking issues, especially in the context of data management in large L2 caches. The overall goal of this paper is to study the challenges for L2 design and management in 3D chip multiprocessors. Our first contribution is to propose a router architecture and a topology design that makes use of a network architecture embedded into the L2 cache memory. Our second contribution is to demonstrate, through extensive experiments, that a 3D L2 memory architecture generates much better results than the conventional two-dimensional (2D) designs under different number of layers and vertical (inter-wafer) connections. In particular, our experiments show that a 3D architecture with no dynamic data migration generates better performance than a 2D architecture that employs data migration. This also helps reduce power consumption in L2 due to a reduced number of data movements
