It is challenging to analyze the aerial locomotion of bats because of the complicated and intricate relationship between their morphology and flight capabilities. Developing a biologically inspired bat robot would yield insight into how bats control their body attitude and position through the complex interaction of nonlinear forces (e.g., aerodynamic) and their intricate musculoskeletal mechanism. The current work introduces a biologically inspired soft robot called Bat Bot (B2). The overall system is a flapping machine with 5 Degrees of Actuation (DoA). This work reports on some of the preliminary untethered flights of B2. B2 has a nontrivial morphology and it has been designed after examining several biological bats. Key DoAs, which contribute significantly to bat flight, are picked and incorporated in B2's flight mechanism design. These DoAs are: 1) forelimb flapping motion, 2) forelimb mediolateral motion (folding and unfolding) and 3) hindlimb dorsoventral motion (upward and downward movement).
