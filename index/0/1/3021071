Unlike the classical deterministic digital circuit analysis, we consider the analysis of uncertain digital circuits defined as follows. Given a binary function of n uncertain input binary variables, we express the probability of this binary function in terms of the probabilities of the corresponding input binary variables. This in turn, allows us to estimate appropriate probabilistic measure of the output of a digital circuit with uncertain input parameters and answer typical questions that arise in stochastic optimization.
