Within many organizations the number of databases containing classified or otherwise sensitive data is increasing rapidly. Access to these databases must be restricted and controlled to limit the unauthorized disclosure, or malicious modification of data contained in them. However, the conventional models of authorization that have been designed for database systems supporting the hierarchical, network and relational models of data do not provide adequate mechanisms to support controlled access of temporal objects and context based temporal information. In this paper we extend the multilevel secure relational model to capture the functionality required of a temporal database, i.e. a database that supports some aspect of time, not counting user-defined time. In particular we assign class access to bitemporal timestamped attributes, and give explicit security classifications to temporal elements.
