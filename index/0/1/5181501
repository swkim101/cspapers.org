We consider the problem of privacy in a 3D multi-user collaborative environment. We assume that information objects are represented by visual icons, and can either be public or private, and that users need effective methods for viewing and manipulating that state. We suggest two methods, which we call vampire mirrorsand privacy lamps, that are unobtrusive, simple, and natural.
