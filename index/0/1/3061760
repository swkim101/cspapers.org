We present our vision of a wearable light display integrated into a piece of jewellery -- an aesthetic bracelet. As a piece of jewellery, the display is discreetly integrated into some accessoire that is worn anyway and therefore integrates excellently into everyday life. The bracelet can be used for various daily reminder tasks like intake of medication. It can also be used to present feedback on a person's health behaviour, e.g. their daily physical activity. We briefly describe our concept and present a number of research questions that need to be investigated.
