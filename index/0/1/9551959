We present new applications for cryptographic secret handshakes between mobile devices on top of Bluetooth Low-Energy (LE). Secret handshakes enable mutual authentication, with the property that the parties learn nothing about each other unless they have been both issued credentials by a group administrator. This property provides strong privacy guarantees that enable interesting applications. One of them is proximity-based discovery for private communities. We introduce MASHaBLE, a mobile application that enables participants to discover and interact with nearby users if and only if they belong to the same secret community. We use direct peer-to-peer communication over Bluetooth LE, rather than relying on a central server. We discuss the specifics of implementing secret handshakes over Bluetooth LE and present our prototype implementation.
