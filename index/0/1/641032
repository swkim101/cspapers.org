The running time or computational complexity of a sequential process is usually determined by summing weights attached to the basic operations from which the process is derived. In practice, however, the complexity is often limited by how efficiently it can access its data structures and how efficiently it can control program flow. Furthermore, it has been extensively argued [4] that certain limitations on the process sequencing mechanisms available to the programmer result in more “efficient” representations for the underlying processes. In this paper we will examine these issues in an attempt to assess the “power” of various data and control structures.
