Tech Camps are popular outreach tools to interest teens in computing programs and technology careers. One of the biggest obstacles is how to make Tech Camp "cool" and inviting for teenagers. How do we grab the attention of students to enroll? Once at camp, how do we engage teens with computing as a creative tool with relevancy to their lives? It is summer; subject areas must be entertaining and relevant. Can we stay ahead of the tech-savvy teens with our budget constraints? Robots and storytelling have long been used; how do we innovate and spark interest, throughout the year? The purpose of this BOF is to share ideas, such as App Inventor for Android to create apps, including text messaging, encouraging students to incorporate their own creative graphics, and using tablet devices.
