We propose several context-based methods for text categorization. One method, a small modification to the PPM compression-based model which is known to significantly degrade compression performance, counter-intuitively has the opposite effect on categorization performance. Another method, called C-measure, simply counts the presence of higher order character contexts, and outperforms all other approaches investigated.
