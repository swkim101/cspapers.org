Exact structure from motion is an ill-posed computation and therefore very sensitive to noise. In this work I describe how a qualitative shape representation, based on the sign of the Gaussian curvature, can be computed directly from motion disparities, without the computation of an exact depth map or the directions of surface normals. I show that humans can judge the curvature sense of three points undergoing 3D motion from two, three and four views with success rate significantly above chance. A simple RBF net has been trained to perform the same task.
