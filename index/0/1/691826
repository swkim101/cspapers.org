This paper studies a falling motion control of a human-size humanoid robot when it falls forward. Safe knee landing of the robot is realized as a first step to minimize the damage of the falling over. The landing follows the detection of the falling, the decrease of the knee height after the detection, and the brake of landing speed. It is confirmed that the proposed method can soften the landing impact significantly by the proposed method.
