In this paper, we propose an original design for a manipulation system of rigid micro-objects by adhesion (50 /spl mu/m/spl sim/200 /spl mu/m) in open air. The design is based on a precise analysis of the mechanical conditions for manipulation by adhesion. Simulations using a dynamic model of a canonical manipulation (capture and release of micro-objects) have shown that it exists an "end-effector initial acceleration" windows for which manipulations are possible. The end-effector we have developed integrates a highly sensitive contact sensor and two piezo-accelerators (/spl sim/10/sup 6/ m.s/sup -2/). Successful manipulations by adhesion of silicon chips with a gold coated piezoresistive silicon cantilever have been carried out and are presented as conclusion of this paper.
