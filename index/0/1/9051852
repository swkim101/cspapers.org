Reliability concerns due to technology scaling have been a major focus of researchers and designers for several technology nodes. Therefore, many new techniques for enhancing and optimizing reliability have emerged particularly within the last five to ten years. This perspective paper introduces the most prominent reliability concerns from today's points of view and roughly recapitulates the progress in the community so far. The focus of this paper is on perspective trends from the industrial as well as academic points of view that suggest a way for coping with reliability challenges in upcoming technology nodes.
