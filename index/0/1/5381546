Best-first chart parsing utilises a figure of merit (FOM) to efficiently guide a parse by first attending to those edges judged better. In the past it has usually been static; this paper will show that with some extra information, a parser can compensate for FOM flaws which otherwise slow it down. Our results are faster than the prior best by a factor of 2.5; and the speedup is won with no significant decrease in parser accuracy.
