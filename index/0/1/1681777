However, most existing approaches do not distinguish social roles that nodes may play in the diffusion process. In this paper, we study the interplay between users' social roles and their influence on information diffusion. We propose a Role-Aware INformation diffusion model (RAIN) that integrates social role recognition and diffusion modeling into a unified framework. We develop a Gibbs-sampling based algorithm to learn the proposed model using historical diffusion data. The proposed model can be applied to different scenarios. For instance, at the micro-level, the proposed model can be used to predict whether an individual user will repost a specific message; while at the macro-level, we can use the model to predict the scale and the duration of a diffusion process. We evaluate the proposed model on a real social media data set. Our model performs much better in both micro- and macro-level prediction than several alternative methods.
