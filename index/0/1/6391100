Studies of interactive systems in museums have raised important design considerations, but so far have failed to address sufficiently the particularities of family interaction and co-operation. This paper introduces qualitative video-based observations of Japanese families using an interactive portable guide system in a museum. Results show how unexpected usage can occur through particularities of interaction between family members. The paper highlights the necessity to more fully consider familial relationships in HCI.
