This paper presents a detailed evaluation of parallel mesaagedriven pmgmms on both message-passing and shared memory pamllel architectures. Four large pomllel appiications from the domain of VLSI computer aided design are evaluated, namely: parallel test pattern genemtion, pamllel cell placement, logic qnthesis, and event dnâ€™ven VHDL kmulalion. The parallelism structure, the communication characterktics, locality chamcterirrtics, gmin sizes of wmputationa, and detailed measurement8 of system time, idle time, and uaer time are meaaunzd for theae applicationa. Resulta are presented for an Intel Pamgon distributed-memory measagepassing multicomputer and compared to a Sun SPARCcenter 1 OOOE symmetric multiprocessor.
