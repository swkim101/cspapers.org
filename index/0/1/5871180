This paper describes a comprehensive method for presenting mathematical equations and expressions using only pure HTML and CSS. This method renders the equations portable and editable and contrasts with previous procedures that represent equations as whole graphic objects. Methods for generating and documenting the equations using HTML and JavaScript are also described such that the equations can be interpreted and converted to or from other formats such as LaTex, MATHML, or linear representation.
