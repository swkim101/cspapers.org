This paper is concerned with the introduction of model checking – in particular the SMV model checking tools – into an industrial process for the design of interactive systems. Using the example of an avionics design environment, differences between actual design practice and the productive application of model-checking are explored. The paper presents a design framework which aims to bridge the gap between company practice and tool requirements. The results of a co-operative evaluation of a tool prototype that supports this framework are presented.
