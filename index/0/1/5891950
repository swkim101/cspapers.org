Collaborative Web search uses the past search behaviour (queries and selections) of a community of users to promote search results that are relevant to the community. The extent to which these promotions are likely to be relevant depends on how reliably past search behaviour can be captured. We consider this issue by analysing the results of collaborative Web search in circumstances where the behaviour of searchers is unreliable.
