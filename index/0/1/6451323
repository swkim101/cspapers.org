Engaging and maintaining student engagement with the content of a course in formal language theory and the theory of computation is notoriously difficult. A major factor is student's perception of the relevance of the required mathematical material to computer science as they have studied the discipline. Usually, the mathematical material discourages students and for many it forms an insurmountable barrier. This paper describes the construction of a course using the discovery learning technique known as the Moore Method that directly addresses student engagement with this material. The results of the delivery of this course were that students remained engaged with the course throughout the semester and enthusiastically received the pedagogical approach employed. While the course described was delivered to a small class in a liberal arts college, it may be adapted to larger class sizes and taught in any computer science program.
