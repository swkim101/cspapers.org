NotePals is a lightweight note sharing system that gives groupmembers easy access to each others experiences through theirpersonal notes. The system allows notes taken by group members inany context to be uploaded to a shared repository. Group membersview these notes with browsers that allow them to retrieve allnotes taken in a given context or to access notes from otherrelated notes or documents. This is possible because NotePalsrecords the context in which each note is created (e.g., itsauthor, subject, and creation time). The system is lightweightbecause it fits easily into group members regular note- takingpractices, and uses informal, ink-based user interfaces that run onportable, inexpensive hardware. In this paper we describe NotePals,show how we have used it to share our notes, and present ourevaluations of the system.
