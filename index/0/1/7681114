Smartphones now are equipped with a variety of sensors including inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) and multiple position sensors (GPS, WiFi, and cellular radios). These powerful capabilities have made smartphones an attractive platform for tasking applications. Tasking applications are rapid developing mobile applications which process data from multiple sensors continuously to determine user's context (such as location or activity) and take certain actions based on pre-defined conditions. Examples of such applications include location-based reminders, notifying when friends are nearby, changing the ring-mode of a phone automatically depending on the location, automatically tracking and storing movement tracks when driving, and inferring the number of steps walked each day. However, today, developing tasking applications is non-trivial for two reasons: poor abstractions and poor programming support [1].
 We address these shortcomings through Code In The Air (CITA), a system that simplifies the development of tasking applications. CITA achieves this by providing an activity composition framework and a tasking execution framework that allows developers and end-users to easily write and compose tasks.
