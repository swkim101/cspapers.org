This paper focuses on documentation and evaluation techniques for monitoring and assessing team oriented database projects in a senior level database course in computer science. Instead of effecting documentation as the last phase in traditional software development, the documentation procedures are implemented as nine separate staggered deliverables during the project development. These deliverables are revised and organized into a final documentation binder. Evaluation techniques are monitored through four distinct phases: Project Plan, Ongoing Documentation, Progress Report, and Project Presentation (Demonstration).
