This paper describes a PCB artwork verification program which imposes virtually no restrictions on the layout designer. The program is capable of making fast and reliable verifications of layouts of any type and style. The concepts and techniques used to achieve the "non-restrictive" feature of the program are discussed. A unique characteristic of the program is the special treatment of non-electrical elements. The program has been proven by continuous practical use in a dynamic production environment.
