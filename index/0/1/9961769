Software simulation has often been used to evaluate proposed protocols for wireless devices. Simulation allows for rapid development and testing, but does not provide a realistic RF environment. To compensate for this, field experiments are performed. However, problems encountered during field experiments can be difficult to locate and correcting problems on-site can be time-consuming. Emulations attempt to provide the advantages of simulation and field experiments without the suffering the disadvantages of both. This demo provides an overview of the hardware, software, and emulation capabilities of ASSERT, an emulation testbed.
