Our goal is to recover a complete 3D model from a depth image of an object. Existing approaches rely on user interaction or apply to a limited class of objects, such as chairs. We aim to fully automatically reconstruct a 3D model from any category. We take an exemplar-based approach: retrieve similar objects in a database of 3D models using view-based matching and transfer the symmetries and surfaces from retrieved models. We investigate completion of 3D models in three cases: novel view (model in database); novel model (models for other objects of the same category in database); and novel category (no models from the category in database).
