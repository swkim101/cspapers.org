The presence of Type 2 singularities in parallel robots severely affects their performances, mainly because the platform motion control is partially lost. It also leads to a size reduction of the operational workspace. Moreover, the dynamic model of the parallel mechanism degenerates and locally, the robot becomes underactuated in the singularity. It has been proven that it is possible to cross Type 2 singularities by respecting a dynamic criterion. Nevertheless, the controllers designed up to now require a pre-planned optimized trajectory including this criterion, and as a result, this strategy can only be used by qualified users. In order to avoid this drawback and to cross these types of singularities even if the trajectory is not pre-planned, this paper proposes a controller based on virtual constraints. Furthermore, the controller is integrated in a multi-control architecture in order to switch between a classical computed torque control far from the singularity and the virtual-constraint-based control law near to the singularity locus. Experimental results on a five-bar mechanism validated the automatic Type 2 singularity crossing.
