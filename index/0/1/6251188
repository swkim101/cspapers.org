Plagiarism on programming assignments, particularly in lower-level computer classes, has been a problem of considerable concern. We suspect that the strongest contributing factor to the increase in this kind of cheating is the computing profession's reputation for being able to offer such a high-salaried positions. Students are literally clamoring to get into computer classes, partly with the hopes of securing high-paying jobs after graduation. The competition is keen in these computer classes, the computer departments frequently having to apply increasingly tough standards in order to thin out the ranks. Therefore, the strong desire to get an attractive job, coupled with the fear of failing computer courses seems to bring out the worst in many students, and they resort to cheating. The teaching staff naturally reacts to this problem by devising all sorts of methods for detecting and preventing instances of cheating.
