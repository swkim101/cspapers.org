The directed Steiner tree problem is the following: given a directed graph <i>G</i> = (<i>V, E</i>) with weights on the edges, a set of terminals <i>S</i> ⊆ <i>V</i>, and a root vertex <i>r,</i> find a minimum weight out-branching <i>T</i> rooted at <i>r,</i> such that all vertices in <i>S</i> are included in <i>T</i>. This problem is known to be NP-hard. Recently, non-trivial polynomial time approximation algorithms have been developed for this problem with worst case approximation guarantees of <i>O</i>(<i>k<sup>ε</sup></i>) for any fixed ε > 0. We consider a natural LP relaxation of this problem. Using a dual formulation we construct a simple deterministic (<i>D</i> + 1)-approximation algorithm for a special case when the subgraph induced by <i>V</i> \ <i>S</i> is a tree with depth <i>D</i> (for example, this can be shown to include the group Steiner tree problem as a special case, by the loss of poly-log factors in the approximation guarantee). We also show that this LP has an integrality gap of Θ(√<i>k</i>) for the general problem.
