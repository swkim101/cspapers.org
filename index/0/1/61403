SYMPOSIa33 Knowledge-guided learning o r structural descriptions A. Fox, M.S. B, Reddy, D. R. We demonstrate how the use of do.~in dependent knowledge can reduce the combinatorios of learning structural descriptions, usimg as an example the creation of alternative pronunciations from examples of spoken words. Briefly, certain learning problems (Winston9 1970; Fox & Hayes-Roth~ 1976) can be solved by presenting to a learning program exemplars (tralni~ data) representative of a classÂ° The program constructs a characteristic representation (CR) of the class that best fits the training data. Learning can be viewed as search in the space of representations. Applied complex domalns the search is highly combinatorial due to the: i) Number of alternative CRSo 2) Size of training set. 3) Size of the exemplars. help hack next mark return top display comment goto find
