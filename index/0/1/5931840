DIARC, a distributed integrated affect, reflection, cognition architecture for robots, provides many features that are critical to successful natural human-robot interaction. As such, DIARC is an ideal platform for experimentation in HRI. In this paper we describe the architecture and and its implementation in ADE, paying particular attention to its interaction capabilities and features that allow robust operation. These features are evaluated in the context of the 2006 AAAI Robot Competition.
