The paper proposes a scheme for direct torque control(DTC) which is propitious to axially laminated anisotropic (ALA) and PMSM combined rotor synchronous motor., the conventional speed error PI adjustor is substituted for sliding mode controller(SMC). The principle of speed error sliding mode controller is presented, the system is simulated with MATLAB/SIMULINK, results show current and flux linkage and torque pulsation are reduced by making use of sliding mode direct torque control ,the torque has fast response ,robustness and robust low-speed performance.
