Linguistic communication relies on non-linguistic context to convey meaning. That context might include, for instance, recent or long-term experience, semantic knowledge of the world, or objects and events in the immediate environment. In this paper, we describe embodied agents instantiated in Soar cognitive architecture that use context derived from their linguistic, perceptual, procedural and semantic knowledge for comprehending imperative sentences.
