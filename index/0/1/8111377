Remarkable performance in multi-domain sentiment analysis datasets has been reported, making deep learning a promising approach to domain adaptation problems. SDAs are distinguished by learning robust data representations for recovering the original features that have been artificially corrupted with noise. The idea has been further exploited to marginalize out the random corruptions by a state-of-the-art method called mSDA. In this paper, a deep learning method for domain adaptation called l2,1-norm stacked robust autoencoders (l2,1-SRA) is proposed to learn useful representations for domain adaptation tasks. Each layer of l2,1-SRA contains two steps: a robust linear reconstruction step which is based on l2,1 robust regression and a non-linear squashing transformation step. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is very effective in multiple cross domain classification datasets which include Amazon review dataset, spam dataset from ECML/PKDD discovery challenge 2006 and 20 newsgroups dataset.
