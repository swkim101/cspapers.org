1 I n t r o d u c t i o n The probabilistic method is used to prove the existence of objects with desirable properties by showing that a randomly chosen object from an appropriate probability distribution has the desired properties with positive probability. In most applications this probability is not only positive, but is actually high and frequently tends to 1 as the parameters of the problem tend to infinity. In such cases, the proof usually supplies an efficient randomized algorithm for producing a structure of the desired type. There are, however, certain examples, where one can prove the existence of the required combinatorial structure by probabilistic arguments that deal with rare events; events that hold with positive probability which is exponentially small in the size of the input. This happens often when using the Lov£sz Local Lemma (LLL). We state it in its general form. ~ a r c h partially supported by DFGSonderforschungsbereich 376 "Massive Parallelit~.t: Algorithmen, Entwurfsmethoden, Anwendungen." ?Department of Mathematics & Computer Science and Heinz Nixdorf Institute.
