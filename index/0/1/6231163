A new method of implementing branch instructions is presented. This technique has been implemented in the CRISP Microprocessor. With a combination of hardware and software techniques the execution time cost for many branches can be effectively reduced to zero. Branches are folded into other instructions, making their execution as separate instructions unnecessary. Branch Folding can reduce the apparent number of instructions needed to execute a program by the number of branches in that program, as well as reducing or eliminating pipeline breakage. Statistics are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of Branch Folding and associated techniques used in the CRISP Microprocessor.
