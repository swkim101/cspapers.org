A fundamental difficulty in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows what intelligence is, especially for systems with senses, environments, motivations and cognitive capacities which are very different to our own. If we look to definitions of human intelligence given by experts, we see that although there is no consensus, most views cluster around a few common perspectives and share many key features. In all cases, intelligence is a property of an entity, which we will call the agent, that interacts with an external problem or situation, which we will call the environment. An agentâ€™s intelligence is typically related to its ability to succeed in environments, which implies that there is some kind of objective, which we will call the goal. The emphasis on learning, adaptation and flexibility common to many definitions implies that the environment is not fully known to the agent.
