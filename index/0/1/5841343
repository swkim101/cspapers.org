This paper presents a version model which handles database schema changes and which takes evolution into account. Its originality is in allowing the development of partial schema versions, or views of a schema. These versions are created in the same database from a common schema. We define the set of authorised modifications on a schema and the rules which guarantee its coherence after transformation. Mechanisms allowing data to be associated with each version are also integrated in the model.
