Parallel robots admit generally several solutions to the direct kinematics problem. The aspects are associated with the maximal singularity free domains without any singular configurations. Inside these regions, some trajectories are possible between two solutions of the direct kinematic problem without meeting any type of singularity: non-singular assembly mode trajectories. An established condition for such trajectories is to have cusp points inside the joint space that must be encircled. This paper presents an approach based on the notion of uniqueness domains to explain this behaviour.
