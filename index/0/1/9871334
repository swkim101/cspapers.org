Development of smarthome home application depends on the ability to identify resident activity and track occupancy of rooms as people move within a residence. Existing solutions to home activity recognition are evaluated using controlled experiments and having participants maintain logs of daily activities as ground truth. In our study, we evaluate the effectiveness of using mid-range RFID as a research tool to perform in-situ evaluation of smarthome systems. We propose that using bracelets and anklets embedded with passive RFID tags can provide an accurate ground truth system, which can help evaluate the performance of research solutions for smarthomes with higher accuracy - in presence of natural variability of people in activities and movement in homes.
