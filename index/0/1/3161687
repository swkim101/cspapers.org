In this paper, we present a new variant of digital signature scheme, restricted message signing. This signature scheme restricts a signer such that he or she can sign any message except for ones in the specific message set. We expect it to be a useful primitive for various cryptographic applications. We propose the first construction of the restricted message signing and prove it secure in the random oracle model.
