For a density f on ℝd, a high-density cluster is any connected component of {x : f(x) ≥ λ}, for some λ < 0. The set of all high-density clusters form a hierarchy called the cluster tree of f. We present a procedure for estimating the cluster tree given samples from f. We give finite-sample convergence rates for our algorithm, as well as lower bounds on the sample complexity of this estimation problem.
