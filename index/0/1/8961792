We describe a robust working prototype of a system for accurate page-ID detection from bound paper books. Our method uses a new RFID technology to recognize book page location. A thin flexible transponder tag with a unique ID is embedded in the paper of each page, and a tag reader is affixed to the binding of the back of the book. As the pages turn, the tag reader notices which tags are within its read range and which have moved out of its range (which is about four inches). The human interacts with the book naturally, and is not required to perform any actions for page detection that are not usual in book interaction. The page-detection data can be used to enhance the experience of the book, or to enable the book as a controller for another system. One such system, an interactive museum exhibit, is briefly described.
