In this contribution, we propose a novel Network Coding based LTE Cooperative-communication (NCLC) system. More specifically, our novel NCLC system is devised by incorporating a beneficial network coding scheme into the TD-LTE system. The benefit obtained by employing the network coding scheme in our NCLC systems are highlighted and analysed by both insightful formulae and illustrative examples. Particularly, Monte Carlo simulation based results suggest that our NCLC system outperforms the conventional TD-LTE by at least 3dB at an FER of 10-5.
