We present an efficient deterministic hypothesis generation algorithm for robust fitting of multiple structures based on the maximum feasible subsystem (MaxFS) framework. Despite its advantage, a global optimization method such as MaxFS has two main limitations for geometric model fitting. First, its performance is much influenced by the user-specified inlier scale. Second, it is computationally inefficient for large data. The presented algorithm, called iterative MaxFS with inlier scale (IMaxFS-ISE), iteratively estimates model parameters and inlier scale and also overcomes the second limitation by reducing data for the MaxFS problem. The IMaxFS-ISE algorithm generates hypotheses only with top-n ranked subsets based on matching scores and data fitting residuals. This reduction of data for the MaxFS problem makes the algorithm computationally realistic. A sequential "fitting-and-removing" procedure is repeated until overall energy function does not decrease. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate more reliable and consistent hypotheses than random sampling-based methods for estimating multiple structures from data with many outliers.
