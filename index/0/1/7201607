With the explosion of the Internet, LDAP di-rectories and XML, there is an ever greater need to evaluate queries involving (sub)string matching. In many cases, matches need to be on multiple attributes/dimensions, with correlations between the dimensions. E(cid:11)ective query optimization in this context requires good selectivity estimates. In this paper, we use multi-dimensionalcount-su(cid:14)x trees as the basic framework for sub-string selectivity estimation. Given the enormous size of these trees for large databases, we develop a space and time e(cid:14)cient probabilistic algorithm to construct multi-dimensional pruned count-su(cid:14)x trees directly. We then present two techniques to obtain good estimates for a given multi-dimensional sub-string matching query, using a pruned count-su(cid:14)x tree. The (cid:12)rst one, called GNO (for Greedy Non-Overlap), generalizes the greedy parsing suggested by Krishnan et al. [9] for one-dimensional substring selectivity estimation. The second one, called MO (for Maximal Overlap), uses all maximal multi-dimensional substrings of the query for estimation; these multi-dimensional substrings help to capture the correlation that may exist between strings (cid:3)
