We demonstrate OPAL [2]- a system for opportunistically aligning advertisement delivery with basestation overload periods, which reduces the total number of times network service is unavailable to users. This system is motivated by two trends: Firstly, as networks get dominated by non-elastic traffic such as video, overload management using admission control will be imminent, thereby exposing network unavailability to users. Secondly, as mobile advertising is rapidly growing, mobile network operators are increasingly interested in leveraging its huge revenue potential, and are also better equipped than any other entity in reaching the users.
