Spatial information systems are large collections of spatial and non-spatial data on top of tailored database management systems with interactive analysis being the rule rather than an exception. Current database query languages, which are well-suited to treat alphanumeric data, do not reflect the properties of spatial data. In order to visualize the power needed for a spatial query language, a user interface is designed which gives specific considerations tc the coexistence of repiesent’ations as graphical renderings, such as maps, and lexical listings, such as tables. The different properties of spatial and non-spatial data give rise to lexical formulations of queries in combination with references to graphical ‘objects’ or areas on maps. In particular, immediate reference to objects on drawings with direct manipulation devices is a crucial technique to be embedded in the interaction. Variation of graphical presentations by colors, patterns, etc. requires appropriate tools in the interface to manipulate the presentation of spatial objects. These issues are visualized in a sample session by a sequence of interface snapshots.
