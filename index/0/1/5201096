(MATH) The collision problem is to decide whether a function X: { 1,&ldots;,n} → { 1, &ldots;,n} is one-to-one or two-to-one, given that one of these is the case. We show a lower bound of Ω(n1/5) on the number of queries needed by a quantum computer to solve this problem with bounded error probability. The best known upper bound is O(n1/3), but obtaining any lower bound better than Ω(1) was an open problem since 1997. Our proof uses the polynomial method augmented by some new ideas. We also give a lower bound of Ω(n1/7) for the problem of deciding whether two sets are equal or disjoint on a constant fraction of elements. Finally we give implications of these results for quantum complexity theory.
