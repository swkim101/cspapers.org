Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) raises the level of abstraction beyond programming by specifying the solution directly using domain concepts. In many cases, the final products can be generated from these high-level specifications. This automation is possible because both the language and generators need fit the requirements of only one company and domain.This demonstration illustrates DSM by showing real world cases from various fields of software development. These cases describe how DSM, giving first class support for modeling, can prevent incorrect or unwanted designs at the early stages of development, and how full code can be generated from the modeler's point of view. Second part of the demonstration will show in an interactive manner both the design side and the use side of DSM languages and generators. Using MetaEdit+ tool for metamodeling, we define a DSM for a given domain and apply it to generate full code from high-level models.
