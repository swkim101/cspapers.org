We describe a novel approach to the visualization of hierarchical clustering that superimposes the classical dendrogram over a fully synchronized low-dimensional embedding, thereby gaining the benefits of both approaches. In a single image one can view all the clusters, examine the relations between them and study many of their properties. The method is based on an algorithm for low-dimensional embedding of clustered data, with the property that separation between all clusters is guaranteed, regardless of their nature. In particular, the algorithm was designed to produce embeddings that strictly adhere to a given hierarchical clustering of the data, so that every two disjoint clusters in the hierarchy are drawn separately.
