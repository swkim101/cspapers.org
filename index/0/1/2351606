This paper discusses some useful insights for instructors who might want to consider using a web approach in courses involving language design and implementation. The basic idea is to have students build a language processor that actually runs on the web, instead of a processor that just runs on a command-line shell. The author documents the advantages and possible shortcomings of this approach, as well as his class experiences.
