Kabiria is a document classification and retrieval system that integrates classical information retrieval facilities with features of knowledge representation for document retrieval. In fact, Kabiria is based on a semantic model of documents where knowledge about the procedures and the rules of the office environment drives the filing and retrieval activities. The model includes knowledge regarding the document structure and text, and operational knowledge of the environment where documents are used. Details about the model can be found in [1]. The knowledge is organized in Kabiria as a semantic network representing both the document structures and roles, and as a set of rules representing the laws, regulations, and processing habits that influence the document life cycle. The implementation of Kabiria is based on a client-server architecture supporting three basic activities on documents: classification, according to the semantic types defined in the model; filing, both in a traditional document base and as classes of the knowledge net according to the document roles; retrieual, according both to the structure, contents, and role of documents and to the domain dependencies holding between the office environment and the domain context where the office is embedded.
