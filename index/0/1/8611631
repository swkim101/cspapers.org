It is well-known thatCTL andLTL have incomparable expressive power. In this paper, we give an inductive definition of thoseACTL formulas that can be expressed in LTL . In addition, we obtain a procedure to decide whether an ACTL formula lies inLTL , and show that this problem isPSPACEcomplete. By omitting path quantifiers, we get an inductive definition of the LTL formulas expressible in ACTL . We can show that the fragment defined by our logic represents exactly those LTL formulas the negation of which can be represented by a 1-weak B Ã¼chi automaton and that for this fragment, the representing automaton can be chosen to be of size linear in the size of the formula.
