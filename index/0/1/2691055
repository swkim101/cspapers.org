We present a systematic methodology for exploring application partitioning and assignment together with platform architecture instantiation. Streaming applications with multiple runtime modes are considered. The platform architecture is based on a domain specific MPSoC architecture template. We show results using complete inner modem physical layer processing of wireless applications, WLAN and LTE. We show that the proposed methodology obtains up to 30% energy improvement in energy with negligible area overheads as compared to straight-forward mapping to one processor, while meeting performance constraints, for a multi-mode WLAN 11n system and single-mode LTE system.
