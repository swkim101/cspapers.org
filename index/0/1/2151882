We present a novel approach to mining dependency rules that explain the scenes present during a video sequence. The approach first characterizes activities based on their most important events. Next, an HMM-based approach finds the mixture components that best describe the clustering dependencies between events and activities in video data. The dependencies among activities are taken as association patterns with temporal precedence and analyzed using their co-occurrence relationships in time windows. This technique is meant to understand the multiple actions taken in a video or to predict future occurrences of certain activities.
