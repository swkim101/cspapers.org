The successful construction of interactive systems requires the utilization of principles of user-centered design, combined with techniques for software engineering, in order to produce systems that are reliable, easy to use, and well adapted to user needs. This paper presents some of these principles and shows how they are achieved in the User Software Engineering (USE) project, which is intended to provide the applications developer with a development environment that supports the systematic specification and implementation of interactive systems.
