Microrobots show great potential to realize a wide range of medical applications especially in a hard-to-reach region within human body. Among a diversity of medical applications, the microrobots are expected to efficiently perform tasks within the human body, but the existing electromagnetic coil systems such as Helmholtz coil, Maxwell coil, etc. do not compromise on the insertion of such a large volume of human parts. We aim to magnetically manipulate diverse microrobots in medical applications with respect to surgical or biopsy tasks within insiders of the human head such as to perform brachytherapy with the helical microswimmer, etc. For this reason, we proposed a novel, a magnetically actuated system called the HyBrid system with the conceptual design in capability of generating both uniform and gradient magnetic fields. The system consists of three different coil setups orthogonally arranged over a large workspace which is available to let the human head inserted into. The simulation results of the magnetic field generation expressed that its performance is suitable and feasible towards magnetically manipulation within the human head, and more efficient than 3D-Helmholtz coil system under the same conditions.
