The speed of convergence of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian mixture model fitting is known to be dependent on the amount of overlap among the mixture components. In this paper, we study the impact of mixing coefficients on the convergence of EM. We show that when the mixture components exhibit some overlap, the convergence of EM becomes slower as the dynamic range among the mixing coefficients increases. We propose a deterministic anti-annealing algorithm, that significantly improves the speed of convergence of EM for such mixtures with unbalanced mixing coefficients. The proposed algorithm is compared against other standard optimization techniques like BFGS, Conjugate Gradient, and the traditional EM algorithm. Finally, we propose a similar deterministic antiannealing based algorithm for the Dirichlet process mixture model and demonstrate its advantages over the conventional variational Bayesian approach.
