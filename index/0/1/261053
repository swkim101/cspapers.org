Aspect-oriented programming is considered a promising new technology. As object-oriented programming did before, it is beginning to pervade all areas of software engineering. With its growing popularity, practitioners and academics alike are wondering whether they should start looking into it, or otherwise risk having missed an important development. The author of this essay finds that much of aspect-oriented programming's success seems to be based on the conception that it improves both modularity and the structure of code, while in fact, it works against the primary purposes of the two, namely independent development and understandability of programs. Not seeing any way of fixing this situation, he thinks the success of aspect-oriented programming to be paradoxical.
