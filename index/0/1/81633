Recent theoretical results have shown that improved bounds on generalization error of classifiers can be obtained by explicitly taking the observed margin distribution of the training data into account. Currently, algorithms used in practice do not make use of the margin distribution and are driven by optimization with respect to the points that are closest to the hyperplane. 
 
This paper enhances earlier theoretical results and derives a practical data-dependent complexity measure for learning. The new complexity measure is a function of the observed margin distribution of the data, and can be used, as we show, as a model selection criterion. We then present the Margin Distribution Optimization (MDO) learning algorithm, that directly optimizes this complexity measure. Empirical evaluation of MDO demonstrates that it consistently outperforms SVM.
