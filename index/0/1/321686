Machine translation of locative prepositions is not straightforward, even between closely related languages. This paper discusses a system of translation of locative prepositions between English and French. The system is based on the premises that English and French do not always conceptualize objects in the same way, and that this accounts for the major differences in the ways that locative prepositions are used in these languages. This paper introduces knowledge representations of conceptualizations of objects, and a method for translating prepositions based on these conceptual representations.
