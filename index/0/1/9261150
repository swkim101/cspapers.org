This research focuses on characterizing visually impairedcomputer users performance on graphical user interfaces by linkingclinical assessments of low vision with visual icon identification.This was accomplished by evaluating user performance on basicidentification and selection tasks within a graphical userinterface, comparing partially sighted user performance with fullysighted user performance, and linking task performance to specificprofiles of visual impairment. Results indicate that visual acuity,contrast sensitivity, visual field and color perception weresignificant predictors of task performance. In addition, icon sizeand background color significantly influenced performance.Suggestions for future research are provided. Keywords
