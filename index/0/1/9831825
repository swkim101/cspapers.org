We study two fundamental static data structure problems, membership and perfect hashing, in Yao's cell probe model. The first space and bit probe optimal worst case upper bound is given for the membership problem. We also give a new efficient membership scheme where the query algorithm makes just one adaptive choice, and probes a total of three words. A lower bound shows that two word probes generally do not suffice. For minimal perfect hashing we show a tight bit probe lower bound, and give a simple scheme achieving this performance, making just one adaptive choice. Linear range perfect hashing is shown to be implementable with the same number of bit probes, of which just  one is adaptive. In contrast, we establish that for sufficiently sparse sets, non-adaptive perfect hashing needs exponentially more bit probes. This is the first such separation of adaptivity and non-adaptivity.
