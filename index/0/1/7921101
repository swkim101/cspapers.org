Multipath TCP is an experimental transport protocol with remarkable recent past and non-negligible future potential. However the lack of available large-scale testbeds and publicly accessible multiple paths grossly prohibits the adoption of the technology. Here, we demonstrate a large-scale multipath playground deployed on PlanetLab Europe, which can be used either by experimenters and researchers to test and verify their multipath-related ideas (e.g. enhancing congestion control, fairness or even the arrangement of multiple paths) and also by early adopters to enhance their Internet connection even if single-homed.
