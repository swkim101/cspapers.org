This paper introduces X-Force, a novel binary analysis engine. Given a potentially malicious binary executable, X-Force can force the binary to execute requiring no inputs or proper environment. It also explores different execution paths inside the binary by systematically forcing the branch outcomes of a very small set of conditional control transfer instructions. X-Force features a crash-free execution model that can detect and recover from exceptions. In particular, it can fix invalid memory accesses by allocating memory on-demand and setting the offending pointers to the allocated memory. We have applied X-Force to three security applications. The first is to construct control flow graphs and call graphs for stripped binaries. The second is to expose hidden behaviors of malware, including packed and obfuscated APT malware. X-Force is able to reveal hidden malicious behaviors that had been missed by manual inspection. In the third application, X-Force substantially improves analysis coverage in dynamic type reconstruction for stripped binaries.
