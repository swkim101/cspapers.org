This work models Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) problem as a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP). To model WSD as a DCOP, we view information from various knowledge sources as constraints. DCOP algorithms have the remarkable property to jointly maximize over a wide range of utility functions associated with these constraints. We show how utility functions can be designed for various knowledge sources. For the purpose of evaluation, we modelled all words WSD as a simple DCOP problem. The results are competitive with state-of-art knowledge based systems.
