About 60% of the software development cost for online applications is related to developing user interfaces commonly used by the end users to interact with those applications. Frequent small changes to user interfaces (UIs) however easily break about 70% of the test cases intended to mimic users' interactions. Fixing broken tests results in extra costs of maintenance while lessening the benefits of test automation. One of the biggest challenges in creating resilient UI level test cases is to identify and locate the elements of the UI in a way that small UI changes do not break the way in which an element was originally located. In this paper, we present our early efforts in creating a test development framework that makes test cases independent of the internal structure of the UIs, so that a change in the structure does not break any test as long as the functionalities validated in the test are not changed. Our approach is inspired by the way human interact with the UIs of online applications and how those interactions are described and communicated in natural language to others. Visual landmarks such as texts (via a perceptual activity) help end users to locate their points of interest during their interaction with the application in a way that is independent of the internal structure of application.
