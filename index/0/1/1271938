Since 1967 there has again been great interest in chess programming. This paper demonstrates that the structure of today's most successful programs cannot be extended to play Master level chess. Certain basic requirements of a Master player's performance are shown to be outside the performance limits to which a program of this type could be extended. The paper also examines a basic weakness in the tree-searching model approach when applied to situations that cannot be searched to completion. This is the Horizon Effect, which causes unpredictable evaluation errors due to an interaction between the static evaluation function and the rules for search termination. The outline of a model of chess playing that avoids the Horizon Effect and appears extendable to play Master level chess is presented, together with some results already achieved.
