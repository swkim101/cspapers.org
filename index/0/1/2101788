The design process used to produce an innovative computer system is presented. The computer system that resulted from the process uses a circular motif both for the user interface and the input device. The input device is a dial and the user interface is visually organized around the concept of a circle. The design process itself proceeded in the presence of a great many constraints and we discuss these constraints and how an innovative design was achieved in spite of the constraints.
