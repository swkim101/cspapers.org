We give the first algorithm that (under distributional assumptions) efficiently learns halfspaces in the notoriously difficult agnostic framework of Kearns, Schapire, & Sellie, where a learner is given access to labeled examples drawn from a distribution, without restriction on the labels (e.g. adversarial noise). The algorithm constructs a hypothesis whose error rate on future examples is within an additive /spl epsi/ of the optimal halfspace, in time poly(n) for any constant /spl epsi/ > 0, under the uniform distribution over {-1, 1}/sup n/ or the unit sphere in /spl Ropf//sup n/ , as well as under any log-concave distribution over /spl Ropf/ /sup n/. It also agnostically learns Boolean disjunctions in time 2/sup O~(/spl radic/n)/ with respect to any distribution. The new algorithm, essentially L/sub 1/ polynomial regression, is a noise-tolerant arbitrary distribution generalization of the "low degree" Fourier algorithm of Linial, Mansour, & Nisan. We also give a new algorithm for PAC learning halfspaces under the uniform distribution on the unit sphere with the current best bounds on tolerable rate of "malicious noise".
