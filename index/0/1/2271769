There is a need to incorporate reasoning about time dependencies into program synthesis systems. Such dependencies have often been phrased in terms of temporal logic systems. We present an alternative method of specifying time dependencies, in a calculus of binary relations between time intervals [Lad86.1, Lad86.2]. We show how the interval calculus may be used to give very-high-level specifications of concurrent process protocols, and how these specifications may be automatically refined using interval calculus into a target specification language. We indicate how the target language may be executed, under certain sequencing assumptions.
