Current interfaces for manipulating curves typically use a standard point cursor to indirectly adjust curve parameters. We present an interface for far more direct manipulation of curves using a specialized high degree-of-freedom curve input device, called ShapeTape. This device allows us to directly control the shape and position of a virtual curve widget. We describe the design and implementation of a variety of interaction techniques that use this curve widget to create and manipulate other virtual curves in 2D and 3D space. The input device is also used to sense a set of user gestures for invoking commands and tools. The result is an effective alternate user interface for curve manipulation that can be used in 2D and 3D graphics applications.
