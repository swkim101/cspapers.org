In this paper, we present a twofold, open-loop method to explore, model and calibrate articulated robots equipped with artificial skin. We do so, using a 3-axis accelerometer per artificial sensor skin unit (SU) and special excitation pattern on every actuated degree of freedom (DoF) of the robotic joints. The first algorithm extracts the kinematic dependencies in between segments, equipped with artificial skin units, and joints, featuring one or multiple rotatory DoFs. A second algorithm uses this structural knowledge to automatically build and estimate kinematic models in between a static reference and an end effector segment. We show experimental results for the structural exploration with a KUKA light weight robotic arm equipped with our own SU prototypes. Additional simulation results, supporting our approach on estimating the kinematic parameters of the robot, are also presented.
