We introduce SoftGUESS, a code clone exploration system. SoftGUESS is built on the more general GUESS system which provides users with a mechanism to interactively explore graph structures both through direct manipulation as well as a domain-specific language. We demonstrate SoftGUESS through a number of mini-applications to analyze evolutionary code-clone behavior in software systems. The mini-applications of SoftGUESS represent a novel way of looking at code-clones in the context of many system features. It is our hope that SoftGUESS will form the basis for other analysis tools in the software- engineering domain.
