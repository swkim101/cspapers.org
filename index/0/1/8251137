In this paper, we propose a plugin-based framework for RDF stream processing (PRSP). With this framework, we can apply SPARQL engines to process C-SPARQL queries with maintaining the high performance of those engines in a simple way. Taking advantage of PRSP, we can process large RDF streams in a distributed context via distributed SPARQL engines. Moreover, we can evaluate the performance and correctness of existing SPARQL engines in handling RDF streams in a united way, which amends the evaluation of them ranging from static RDF to dynamic RDF. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the performance and correctness of PRSP on YABench. The experiments show that PRSP can still maintain the high performance with SPARQL engines in RDF stream processing although there are some slight differences among them.
