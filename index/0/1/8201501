A multidisciplinary design team at Hewlett-Packard (HP) has successfully designed a new user interface for a network troubleshooting tool. Users felt that the new interface let them focus on the task of network troubleshooting, thus freeing them from the details of the interface and its underlying implementation. The design team believes that the success achieved is due to the process used and the multidisciplinary aspect of the team. This design review describes the process followed by the design team, the difficulties encountered, the results obtained from a comparative evaluation of the new and existing product interfaces, and the lessons learned.
