In this paper, a mobile mechanism with driving capability and detecting function is proposed for in-pipe inspection task. Based on this mechanism, a robot is designed and fabricated. The advantage of this robot is that it has mobile ability in the pipe and detecting function for inspection, while only one DC motor is installed. This results in low energy consumption and low cost to make. The robot propels itself in the pipe under a driving mode, and it is used for finding the defect of the pipe under a detecting mode. By switching these two working modes, the robot performs the inspection task without other extra DC motors. Moreover, a velocity change mechanism is introduced to adapt the change of the payload through adjusting the incline angle of the roller. The characteristics of this mechanism are analyzed by comparison with a classical screw drive robot and a direct drive robot. Finally, basic experiments are conducted to testify the mobility and efficiency of this robot.
