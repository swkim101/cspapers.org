This paper addresses the basic behavior acquisition of the robot head based on the multisensor integration. A robot head generally has several degrees of freedom(D.O.E) of motions as well as different kinds of sensors. The head motion is planned based on all sensors' feedback. We take advantage of the Jacobian matrix to describe the differential relations between the sensor feedback and the motor motions. Hence, the relation between two sensors could be formulated by the two respective Jacobian matrices of both sensors to motors. Consequently, multisensor integration can be employed for better performance of the robot head. Experiments of basic behavior acquisition like gazing and head posture control are conducted. Performances of both basic behaviors of the robot head before and after multisensor integration are compared, which demonstrate that the proposed multisensor integration way improves the performance of control, robustness against some sensor's failure, and reduces the overall computation.
