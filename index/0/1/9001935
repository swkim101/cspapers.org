Numerous smart devices are deployed in smart grid for state measurement, decision-making and remote control. The security issues of smart devices attract more and more attention. In our work, the communication protocol, storage mechanism and authentication of smart devices are analyzed and a toolbox is developed to evaluate the security risks of smart devices. In this demo, our toolbox is applied to scan 3 smart meters/power monitor systems. A potential risk list is generated and the vulnerabilities are further verified.
