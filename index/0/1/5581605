At Johnson Space Center (JSC) we have developed automated control agents to reduce human workload by automating routine tasks such as system reconfiguration and FDIR. We have evaluated these control agents for extended periods during ground tests of regenerative crew life support systems that represent analogs of crew systems operating in space. In this paper we describe our experience with these ground tests at JSC, including our use of the automated control agents during these tests. We describe how humanagent teams can coordinate their activities when distributed physically. We also describe how human teams can maintain both situation and system performance awareness of the automated control agent when they are distributed physically and communicating asynchronously.
