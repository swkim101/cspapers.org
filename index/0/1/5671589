We present the Equi-Reward Utility Maximizing Design (ER-UMD) problem for redesigning stochastic environments to maximize agent performance. ER-UMD ﬁts well contemporary applications that require ofﬂine design of environments where robots and humans act and cooperate. To ﬁnd an optimal modiﬁcation sequence we present two novel solution techniques: a compilation that embeds design into a planning problem, allowing use of off-the-shelf solvers to ﬁnd a so-lution, and a heuristic search in the modiﬁcations space, for which we present an admissible heuristic. Evaluation shows the feasibility of the approach using standard benchmarks from the probabilistic planning competition and a benchmark we created for a vacuum cleaning robot setting.
