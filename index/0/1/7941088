A method for learning by practice, based on the transference of knowledge between domains, 16 discussed and illustrated in the context of a problem solver functioning in a domain of elementary physics. As an example of the application of this approach, it is shown how knowledge belonging to the domein of "symmetry of figures" cen be successfully used to solve problems in the first domein. This controlled transference of knowledge is accomplished in four steps: a) mapping certain components of the physics problem into the domain of figures, b) applying the available knowledge for that domain, c) mapping the results back into the original domain, and d) testing the validity of the transference.
