Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a nonparametric representation of functions. However, classical GP inference suffers from high computational cost for big data. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian approach, EigenGP, that learns both basis dictionary elements--eigenfunctions of a GP prior--and prior precisions in a sparse finite model. It is well known that, among all orthogonal basis functions, eigenfunctions can provide the most compact representation. Unlike other sparse Bayesian finite models where the basis function has a fixed form, our eigenfunctions live in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space as a finite linear combination of kernel functions. We learn the dictionary elements-- eigenfunctions--and the prior precisions over these elements as well as all the other hyperparameters from data by maximizing the model marginal likelihood. We explore computational linear algebra to simplify the gradient computation significantly. Our experimental results demonstrate improved predictive performance of EigenGP over alternative sparse GP methods as well as relevance vector machines.
