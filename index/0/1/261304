We developed an approach of learning from errors in CS1, taught in OOP. The approach is based on a set of principles, which include: cognitive conflict, constructivist characteristics, error attribution, self explanation, reflection, and refinement of concept images of fundamental OOP terms and mechanisms. The approach is presented, and some of its activities are illustrated. The developed activities aim at erroneous OOP conceptions that we have observed in a previous study. We applied the approach with CS1 college students, and conducted a comparative study, with an experiment group and a control group. We display a summary of the study's results, together with the students' opinions about the applied approach.
