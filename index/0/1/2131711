However, this often leads to tracking drift problem because of potentially corrupted samples: 1) contaminated/outlier samples resulting from large variations (e.g. occlusion, illumination), and 2) misaligned samples caused by tracking inaccuracy. Therefore, in order to reduce the tracking drift while maintaining the adaptability of a visual tracker, how to alleviate these two issues via an effective model learning (updating) strategy is a key problem to be solved. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel and optimal model learning (updating) scheme which aims to simultaneously eliminate the negative effects from these two issues mentioned above in a unified robust feature template learning framework. Particularly, the proposed feature template learning framework is capable of: 1) adaptively learning uncontaminated feature templates by separating out contaminated samples, and 2) resolving label ambiguities caused by misaligned samples via a probabilistic multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Experiments on challenging video sequences show that the proposed tracker performs favourably against several state-of-the-art trackers.
