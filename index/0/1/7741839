In teaching of Parallel Algorithms, emphasis is usually placed on algorithms that are based on parallel random access machine (PRAM) model, but those algorithms may or may not be efficiently implementable on real parallel machines. In this paper we design parallel algorithms in relation with the actual parallel machine models and show the importance of integrating parallel algorithms with parallel machine models. We discuss this approach using traveling salesperson problem (TSP) as an example.
