It is well known that kinematics can significantly affect the manipulation capabilities of robotic arms, traditionally illustrated by performance indices such as workspace volume, kinematic and force manipulability, and isotropy within the arm workspace. In the case of dual-arm systems and bimanual manipulation tasks, the kinematics effects to the above indices becomes even more apparent. However, in spite of the large number of dual-arm systems developed in the past, there is a little literature on the kinematic design analysis for the development of such systems. Particularly, the effects of configuration/ orientation of the shoulders' placement with respect to the torso structure have not sufficiently studied or considered, while many dual-arm systems with upward and/or forward tilt angle in shoulder base frame have been introduced. This paper addresses this problem and quantifies the effect of shoulders base frame orientation in a dual-arm manipulation system by looking at its effect on several important manipulation indices, such as the overall and common workspace, redundancy, global isotropy, dual-arm manipulability, and inertia ellipsoid index within the common workspace of the two arms. Consequently, a range of upward and forward tilt angles for the shoulder frames is identified for the design of a dual-arm torso system to render the most desired manipulation performance.
