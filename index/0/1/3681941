In the industry, the Dual Career Ladder allows employees to be promoted along either a supervisory or technical track. Such programs are common in the engineering, scientific and medical industries. In the Lightning Talk, I will borrow the metaphor of Dual Ladder and explore two kinds of experience -- academic and industrial experience -- that undergraduate computer science students can be offered to equip them with the needed tools for the future job market. Specifically, I will address the questions: What kind of real world experience should undergraduate students in computer science get and how? How should answers to this question be expressed in the computer science undergraduate programs? My talk will focus on the case of Israel -- the Start Up Nation (Senor and Singer, 2009) -- and the crucial role of computer science graduates in this job market. Data will be presented from the Technion -- Israel Institute of Technology, which is the ranked 1st among the Israeli universities. I will share our findings and data analysis, and propose possible ways to let students get both an academic and industrial experience in a way that prepare them both for academic and industrial careers.
