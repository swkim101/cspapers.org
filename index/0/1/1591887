Software product line engineering provides efficient means to develop variable software. To support program comprehension of software product lines (SPLs), we developed View Infinity, a tool that provides seamless and semantic zooming of different abstraction layers of an SPL. First results of a qualitative study with experienced SPL developers are promising and indicate that View Infinity is useful and intuitive to use.
