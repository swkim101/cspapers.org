We present our pilot research on automatically extracting subevents from a domain-speciÔ¨Åc corpus, focusing on the type of subevents that describe physical actions composing an event. We decompose the challenging problem and propose a two-phase approach that effectively captures sentential and local cues that describe subevents. We extracted a rich set of over 600 novel subevent phrases. Evaluation shows the automatically learned subevents help to discover 10% additional main events (of which the learned subevents are a part) and improve event detection performance.
