In this paper, we propose the concept of summary prior to define how much a sentence is appropriate to be selected into summary without consideration of its context. Different from previous work using manually compiled documentindependent features, we develop a novel summary system called PriorSum, which applies the enhanced convolutional neural networks to capture the summary prior features derived from length-variable phrases. Under a regression framework, the learned prior features are concatenated with document-dependent features for sentence ranking. Experiments on the DUC generic summarization benchmarks show that PriorSum can discover different aspects supporting the summary prior and outperform state-of-the-art baselines.
