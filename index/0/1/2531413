Many expert systems are now being written which rely on highly-compiled, empirical knowledge for their reasoning power. Model-based reasoning has significant theoretical advantages. I constructed two expert systems for the same domain, one using large-grained compiled knowledge, the second using model-based reasoning. The use of model-based reasoning resulted in improved knowledge accessibility and flexibility, and expanded problem-solving ability.
