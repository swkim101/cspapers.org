Production of functional microtools having an arbitrary shape by self-assembly of microparticles and heat treatment above the glass transition temperature of the microparticles was developed. Polystyrene microbeads were used as a material of the microtool. A solution including microparticles was dispersed onto the silicon substrate having microtool patterns fabricated by photolithography and etching. Dispersed particles were introduced to the pattern by gravity force. Microparticles in the pattern aggregate autonomously by surface tension through evaporation of the solution. Aggregated microparticles were fused by heating above the glass transition temperature (100 Celsius degrees). Fused microparticles were detached from the pattern by ultrasonic treatment and used as microtools. Produced microtool has spherical part since the microtool is made of microparticles. Spherical part is suitable for trapping point of optical tweezers. We demonstrated production of microtools using self-assembly and manipulation of the fabricated microtool on a chip. Position and attitude accuracy of the fabricated microtool controlled by TSS were evaluated by image processing. Finally, the transport speed of the fabricated microtool was compared with that of the photofabricated microtool. We confirmed the improvement of the transport speed and the effectiveness of our proposed microtool.
