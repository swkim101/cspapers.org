A system for computer-assisted space planning is presented. The capabilities of the computer assisted process are outlined and compared to traditional manual methods. A method for gathering data suitable for CAD is discussed, along with programs for the “stacking”, layout, and evaluation of plans. A methodology for the use of the system is also presented.
 The programs and techniques discussed have been implemented and used successfully in the space planning of two office facilities, each with nearly 1000 employees and over 250,000 square feet of space.
