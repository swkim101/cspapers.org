We propose a set of techniques leveraging mobile devices as lenses to explore, interact and annotate n-dimensional data visualizations. The democratization of mobile devices, with their arrays of integrated sensors, opens up opportunities to create experiences for anyone to explore and interact with large information spaces anywhere. In this paper, we propose to revisit ideas behind the Chameleon prototype of Fitzmaurice et al. initially envisioned in the 90s for navigation, before spatially-aware devices became mainstream. We also take advantage of other input modalities such as pen and touch to not only navigate the space using the mobile as a lens, but interact and annotate it by adding toolglasses.
