The paper describes a passivity based approach to the generation of virtual fixtures for robotic teleoperation schemes involving multiple masters and multiple slaves. Virtual fixtures considered in the paper aim to guide the user towards a geometric path, which is assumed to be collision-free by design, describing a desired execution of a given task. To preserve safe distance from obstacles and at the same time suggest the user a preferred direction to progress along the path, the virtual fixtures are generated by arbitrarily redirecting assistive forces obtained by summation of attractive and repulsive potential fields. The main result of the paper is the definition of a passivity preserving condition for this redirection, so that the behavior of the teleoperated systems remains safe and stable. The proposed assisted mode of teleoperation has been tested on a surgical robot prototype with dual arms configuration, since robotic surgery represents a suitable application domain for such control schemes.
