This work explores the viability and benefits of time dilation - providing the illusion to an operating system and its applications that time is passing at a rate different from real time. For example, we may wish to convince a system that for every 10 seconds of wall clock time, only one second of time passes in the host's dilated time frame. This enables external stimuli to appear to take place at higher rates than would be physically possible. For example, a host dilated by a factor of 10 receiving data from a network interface at a real rate of 1-Gbps believes it is receiving data at 10-Gbps.
