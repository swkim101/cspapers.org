Most mobile robots are subject to kinematic constraints (non-holonomic Joints), i.e., the number of degrees of freedom is less than the number of configuration parameters. Such navigate in very constrained space, but at the expense of backing up maneuvers [Laumond 86]. In this paper we study the original problem of finding collision-free smooth trajectories, i.e. with never backing up, for a circular mobile robot whose the turning radius is lower bounded.
