We recast syntactic parsing as a language modeling problem and use recent advances in neural network language modeling to achieve a new state of the art for constituency Penn Treebank parsing â€” 93.8 F 1 on section 23, us-ing 2-21 as training, 24 as development, plus tri-training. When trees are converted to Stanford dependencies, UAS and LAS are 95.9% and 94.1%.
