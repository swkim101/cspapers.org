In this paper, a probabilistic relational model is presented which combines relational algebra with probabilistic retrieval. Based on certain independence assumptions, the operators of the relational algebra are redefined such that the probabilistic algebra is a generalization of the standard relational algebra. Furthermore, a special join operator implementing probabilistic retrieval is proposed. When applied to typical document databases, queries can not only ask for documents, but for any kind of object in the database. In addition, an implicit ranking of these objects is provided in case the query relates to probabilistic indexing or uses the probabilistic join operator. The proposed algebra is intended as a standard interface to combined database and IR systems, as a basis for implementing user-friendly interfaces.
