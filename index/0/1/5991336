The problem of learning a discrimination aware model has recently received attention in the data mining community. Various methods and improved models have been proposed, with the main approach being the detection of a discrimination sensitive attribute. Once the discrimination sensitive attribute is identified, the methods aim to develop a strategy that will include the useful information from that attribute without causing any additional discrimination. Our work focuses on an aspect often overlooked in the discrimination aware classification - the scenario of an imbalanced dataset, where the number of samples from one class is disproportionate to the other. We also investigate a strategy that is directly minimizing discrimination and is independent of the class balance. Our empirical results indicate additional concerns that need to be considered when developing discrimination aware classifiers, and our proposed strategy shows promise in overcoming these concerns.
