KIPS is an automatic programming system which generates standardized business application programs through interactive natural language dialogue. KIPS models the program under discussion and the content of the user's statements as organizations of dynamic objects in the object-oriented programming sense. This paper describes the statement-model and the program-model, their use in understanding Japanese program specifications, and how they are shaped by the linguistic singularities of Japanese input sentences.
