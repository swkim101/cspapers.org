This paper, as a generalization of our previous works, presents a unified time-optimal path-following controller for Wheeled Mobile Robots (WMRs). Unlike other path-following controllers, we solve the path-following problem for all common categories of WMRs such as car-like, differential, omnidirectional, all wheels steerable and others. We show that the insertion of our path-following controller into the kinematic and non-holonomic constraints of the wheels, simplifies the otherwise impenetrable constraints, resulting in explicit monotonic functions between the velocity of the base and that of the wheels. Based on this foundation, we present a closed-form solution that keeps all the wheels' steering and driving velocities within their corresponding pre-specified bounds. Simulation data and experimental results from executing the controller in a real-time environment demonstrate the efficacy of the method.
