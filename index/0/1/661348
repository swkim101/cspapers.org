The Photolithography Advisor is a program for the diagnosis and correction of negative resist photolithography defects occurring during integrated circuit fabrication. Given a set of observed symptoms on a wafer, the Advisor diagnoses defects due to these symptoms and recommends corrective action for each. An early prototype of the program was tested in a research lab, where experimental ICs were processed. A more thorough experiment is now in progress to measure the system's performance in a manufacturing environment.
