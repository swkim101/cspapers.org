The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to become a global information and communication infrastructure for cyber physical systems and to bring numerous value-added services for modern society. However, the integration of heterogeneous devices and service models into a cohesive system significantly increases the complexity of design and deployment and introduces the new challenges for the security of systems and processed as well as the privacy of the collected data. The Workshop on Trustworthy Embedded Devices (TrustED) addresses all aspects of security and privacy related to embedded systems and the IoT. TrustED 2016 is a continuation of previous workshops in this series, which were held in conjunction with ESORICS 2011, IEEE Security & Privacy 2012, ACM CCS 2013, ACM CCS 2014, and ACM CCS 2015 (see http://www.trusted-workshop.de for details). The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts from academia and research institutes, industry, and government in the field of security and privacy in cyber physical systems to discuss and investigate the problems, challenges, and recent scientific and technological developments.
