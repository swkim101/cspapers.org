In the last 7 years at Microsoft Research in Silicon Valley we have constructed the DryadLINQ software stack for large-scale data-parallel cluster computations. The architecture of the ensemble is depicted in Figure 1. The goal of the DryadLINQ project is to make writing parallel programs manipulating large amounts of data (terabytes to petabytes) as easy as programming a single machine. DryadLINQ is a batch computation model, optimized for throughput; since it is targets large clusters of commodity computers faulttolerance is a primary concern. A primary tenet is that moving computation close to the data is much cheaper than moving the data itself. Here we discuss briefly the current architecture of the system (but more research is ongoing). Our software runs on relatively inexpensive computer clusters, using unmodified Windows Server. Our software makes minimal assumptions about the underlying cluster, and has
