SDR-4X is a small biped entertainment robot with expanded capabilities for a variety of motion performances. We developed the SDR motion creating system and the whole body adaptive motion control for SDR. This software system makes it easy to produce creative motion performances that include stable biped walking and dance steps synchronized to music. The motion creating system is composed of two parts: the motion editor used to edit upper body motion and whole body motion, and the foot trajectory editor used to create stable lower body motion. Once the upper and lower body motions are created, the system allows the motion designer to inspection the whole body motion before applying it to SDR-4X. The process of creating a fast-paced dance performance is introduced as an attractive application of this software system.
