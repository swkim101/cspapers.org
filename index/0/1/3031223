In today's world, many students are being encouraged not only to participate in class work and internships, but to travel and gain experiential knowledge. At Presbyterian College, students are required to complete either a research/internship class or an experiential/travel class as a part of their general education requirements. Computer science students were often going on trips with other departments to fulfill this need. This poster explores a course offered at Presbyterian College in May, 2010, which took students from our Physics and Computer Science department behind the scenes of Kennedy Space Center and Walt Disney World. It will include information both about course content and about the cost and overhead involved in planning such a course.
