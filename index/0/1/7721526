This paper presents a distributed algorithm for multiple robots to move as a group in a cluttered environment while searching for a target. The distributed algorithm consists of four reactive behaviors for obstacles negotiation, target homing, flocking and searching. Simulation and experimental studies of the algorithm show that the search efficiency is not a monotone function of the number of robots deployed.
