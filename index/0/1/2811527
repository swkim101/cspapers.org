In this paper, a grip-force control of an elastic object is proposed based on a visual slip margin feedback. When an elastic object is pressed and slid slightly on a rigid plate, a partial slip, called "incipient slip" occurs on the contact surface. The slip margin between an elastic object and a rigid plate is estimated based on the analytic solution of Hertzian contact model. A 1 DOF gripper consists of a camera and a force sensor is developed. The slip margin can be estimated from the tangential force measured by a force sensor, the deformation of the elastic object and the radius on the contact area both measured by a camera. In the proposed method, the friction coefficient is not explicitly needed. The grip force is controlled by a direct feedback of the estimated slip margin, whose stability is analytically guaranteed. As a result, the slip margin is maintained to a desired value without occurring the gross slip against a disturbance load force to the object.
