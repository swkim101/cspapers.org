Membership queries extended with the meta query concept is proposed as a method to acquire complex classification rules. Furthermore, relevent concept classes, where a small number of queries is sufficient, are characterized. In this paper we advocate and present the benefits of the use of queries in order to learn a target concept efficiently. Thus providing the foundations for automating the knowledge acquisition process. Based on these results, we developed a knowledge acquisition tool KAC-Z which uses queries about specific domain objects. The systems usefulness has been demonstrated by its application in the domain of manufacturing (cutting) industry.
