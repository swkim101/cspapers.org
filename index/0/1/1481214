In mobile multi-agent networks, connectivity is a crucial factor for network-wide collaborations. However, such connectivity can be easily sabotaged by a single or multiple simultaneous agent failure(s). To handle this problem, in this paper, a hybrid connectivity restoration framework, namely HERO, is developed. By integrating a distributed connectivity restoration algorithm with a potential function based motion controller, HERO can restore the connectivity of the disconnected networks subjected to a single or multiple simultaneous agent failure(s). In the mean-time, inter-agent collisions and further partitions of the underlying networks can also be effectively avoided.
