In present Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems, alignment is trained in a previous stage as the translation model. Consequently, alignment model parameters are not tuned in function of the translation task, but only indirectly. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative training of alignment models with automated translation metrics as maximization criterion. In this approach, alignments are optimized for the translation task. In addition, no link labels at the word level are needed. This framework is evaluated in terms of automatic translation evaluation metrics, and an improvement of translation quality is observed.
