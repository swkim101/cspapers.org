The memory wall problem is due to the imbalanced developments and separation of processors and memories. It is becoming acute as more and more processor cores are integrated into a single chip and demand higher memory bandwidth through limited chip pins. Optical memory interconnection network (OMIN) promises high bandwidth, bandwidth density, and energy efficiency, and can potentially alleviate the memory wall problem. In this paper, we propose an optical inter/intra-chip processor-memory communication architecture, called MOCA. Experimental results and analysis show that MOCA can significantly improve system performance and energy efficiency. For example, comparing to Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), MOCA can speedup application execution time by 2.6×, reduce communication latency by 75%, and improve energy efficiency by 3.4× for 256-core processors in 7 nm technology.
