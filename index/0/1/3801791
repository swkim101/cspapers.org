The amount of personal digital media is increasing, and managing it has become a pressing problem. Effective management of media content is not possible without content-related metadata. In this paper we describe a content metadata creation process for images taken with a mobile phone. The design goals were to automate the creation of image content metadata by leveraging automatically available contextual metadata on the mobile phone, to use similarity processing algorithms for reusing shared metadata and images on a remote server, and to interact with the mobile phone user during image capture to confirm and augment the system supplied metadata. We built a prototype system to evaluate the designed metadata creation process. The main findings were that the creation process could be implemented with current technology and it facilitated the creation of semantic metadata at the time of image capture.
