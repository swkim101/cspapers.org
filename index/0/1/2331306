Geometrically based methods for various tasks of machine learning have attracted considerable attention over the last few years. In this paper we show convergence of eigenvectors of the point cloud Laplacian to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the underlying manifold, thus establishing the first convergence results for a spectral dimensionality reduction algorithm in the manifold setting.
