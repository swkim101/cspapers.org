Modern CMOS technologies employ process-induced stress to improve carrier mobility and increase drive current. This stress has been shown to be strongly layout dependent; however there is a lack of physical models relating potential performance variation to critical layout parameters. This paper presents compact closed-form models that capture the layout dependence of mechanical stress induced in the device channel while considering all relevant sources of stress (STI, tensile/compressive nitride liners, and embedded SiGe). The models are calibrated using ring oscillator frequency data obtained from an experimental test chip to verify their accuracy. Results indicate that the models accurately capture the layout dependence of stress and carrier mobility for a variety of layout permutations and the root mean square error in the predicted ring oscillator frequency is less than 1% for the different layout experiments. These models can help drive layout optimization and timing/power analysis without the use of technology computer-aided design (TCAD) tools, which are slow and very limited in capacity.
