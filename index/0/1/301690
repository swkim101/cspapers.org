For natural language understanding systems designed for domains including relatively complex equipment, it is not sufficient to use general knowledge about this equipment. We show problems which can be solved only if the system has access to a detailed equipment model. We discuss the structure of such models in some detail and, in particular, the mixed static/dynamic nature of the model. As an illustration, we describe parts of a simulation model for an air compressor. Finally, we demonstrate how to find referents in this model for noun phrases.
