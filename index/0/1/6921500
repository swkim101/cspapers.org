This paper describes the scan line array processor (SLAP), a new architecture designed for high-performance yet low-cost image computation. A SLAP is a SIMD linear array of processors, and hence is easy to build and scales well with VLSI technology; yet appropriate special features and programming techniques make it efficient for a surprisingly wide variety of low and medium level computer vision tasks. We describe the basic SLAP concept and some of its variants, discuss a particular planned implementation, and indicate its performance on computer vision and other applications.
