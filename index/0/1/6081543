Finding participants for evaluations with specific demographics can be a problem for usability and user experience specialists. In particular, finding participants with disabilities is especially problematic, yet testing with disabled people is becoming increasingly important. Two case studies are presented that explore using asynchronous remote evaluation techniques with disabled participants. These show that while quantitative data are comparable, the amount and richness of qualitative data are not likely to be comparable. The implications for formative and summative evaluations are discussed and a set of principles for local and remote evaluations with disabled users is presented.
