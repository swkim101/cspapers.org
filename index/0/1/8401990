It is insufficient to search temporal text by only focusing on either time attribute or keywords today as we pay close attention to the evolution of event with time. Both temporal and textual constraints need to be considered in one single query, called Top-k Interval Keyword Query (TIKQ).In this paper, we presents a cloud-based system named INK that supports efficient execution of TIKQs with appropriate effectiveness on Hadoop and HBase. In INK, an Adaptive Index Selector (AIS) is devised to choose the better execution plan for various TIKQs adaptively based on the proposed cost model, and leverage two novel hybrid index modules (TriI and IS-Tree) to combine keyword and interval filtration seamlessly.
