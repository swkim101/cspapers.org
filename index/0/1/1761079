We present an intuitive and effective method for inducing style scores on words and phrases. We exploit signal in a phraseâ€™s rate of occurrence across stylistically contrasting corpora, making our method simple to implement and efficient to scale. We show strong results both intrinsically, by correlation with human judgements, and extrinsically, in applications to genre analysis and paraphrasing.
