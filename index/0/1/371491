We present the first demonstration of establishing mutual attention between an outdoor UAV in autonomous normal flight and an uninstrumented human user. We use the familiar periodic waving gesture as a signal to attract the UAV's attention. The UAV can discriminate this gesture from human walking and running that appears similarly periodic. Once a signaling person is observed and tracked, the UAV acknowledges that the user has its attention by hovering and performing a “wobble” behavior. Both parties are now ready for further interaction. The system works on-board the UAV using a single camera for input and is demonstrated working reliably in real-robot trials.
