We prove the following four results on communication complexity:
 1) For every k ≥ 2, the language L<subscrpt>k</subscrpt> of encodings of directed graphs of out degree one that contain a path of length k+1 from the first vertex to the last vertex and can be recognized by exchanging O(k log n) bits using a simple k-round protocol requires exchanging Ω(n<supscrpt>1/2</supscrpt>/k<supscrpt>4</supscrpt>log<supscrpt>3</supscrpt>n) bits if any (k−1)- round protocol is used.
 2) For every k ≥ 1 and for infinitely many n ≥ 1, there exists a collection of sets L<supscrpt>n</supscrpt><subscrpt>k</subscrpt> @@@@ {0,1}<supscrpt>2n</supscrpt> that can be recognized by exchanging O(k log n) bits using a k-round protocol, and any (k−1)-round protocol recognizing L<supscrpt>n</supscrpt><subscrpt>k</subscrpt> requires exchanging Ω(n/k) bits.
 3) Given a set L @@@@ {0,1}<supscrpt>2n</supscrpt>, there is a set L@@@@{0,1}<supscrpt>8n</supscrpt> such that any (k-round) protocol recognizing L@@@@ can be transformed to a (k-round) <underline>fixed partition</underline> protocol recognizing L with the <underline>same</underline> communication complexity, and vice versa.
 4) For every integer function f, 1 ≤f(n) ≤ n, there are languages recognized by a <underline>one round</underline> deterministic protocol exchanging f(n) bits, but not by any <underline>nondeterministic</underline> protocol exchanging f(n)−1 bits.
 The first two results show in an incomparable way an exponential gap between (k−1)-round and k-round protocols, settling a conjecture by Papadimitriou and Sipser. The third result shows that as long as we are interested in existence proofs, a fixed partition of the input is not a restriction. The fourth result extends a result by Papadimitriou and Sipser who showed that for every integer function f, 1 ≤ f(n) ≤ n, there is a language accepted by a deterministic protocol exchanging f(n) bits but not by any <underline>deterministic</underline> protocol exchanging f(n) − 1 bits.
