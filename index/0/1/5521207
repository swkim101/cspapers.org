The paper deals with computing frictional force-closure grasps of 3D objects problem. The key idea of the presented work is the demonstration that wrenches associated to any three non-aligned contact points of 3D objects form a basis of their corresponding wrench space. This result permits the formulation of a new sufficient force-closure test. Our approach works with general objects, modelled with a set of points, and with any number n of contacts (n Ã© 4). A quality criterion is also introduced. A corresponding algorithm for computing robust force-closure grasps has been developed. Its efficiency is confirmed by comparing it to the classical convex-hull method [26].
