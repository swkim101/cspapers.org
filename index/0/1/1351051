Smart homes will compose of multiple sensors that will sense, compute and transmit information to a central cloud, all of which are energy consuming tasks. We propose to demonstrate a software-defined solution for wirelessly charging these sensors using RF energy, thereby extending their lifetimes. In our demo, the actions of more than one energy transmitter (ET) are synchronized in phase and frequency in real time using periodic feedback from the target sensor, but without any common clock reference. The controller selects the optimal subset of ETs to satisfy the energy request from a given sensor, which cooperatively beamform RF energy towards that sensor. Our software-defined framework, implemented in Python, allows the central controller to automatically discover the installed sensors, obtain energy needs, and schedule charging tasks in an asynchronous and non-blocking manner that allows the network to scale. The demonstration includes advancements in design and fabrication of RF energy harvesting circuits that interface with the TI EZ430 sensors, implementation of a software-defined control and data plane, as well as a real-time distributed beamforming algorithm on USRP radios that results in a battery-free network of sensors.
