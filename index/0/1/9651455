For efficient and safe locomotion the gaits of legged robots should vary with the type of terrain. Hence, terrain surface classification is an important problem for this class of mobile robots. Prior research has developed approaches to proprioceptive terrain classification for both wheeled and limbed robots that use sensor measurements dependent upon the dynamics of the robot, which ultimately requires the classification system to be trained at a large number of operating conditions (e.g., vehicle speeds and loads). This research develops an approach to terrain identification based on pressure images generated through direct surface contact using a robot skin constructed around a high-resolution pressure sensing array. Terrain signatures for classification are formulated from the magnitude frequency responses of the pressure images. The methodology is used to train and test a classifier using dynamically measured pressure images from a one-legged hopping robot. Experimental tests yield high classification accuracies, which are independent with respect to changing robot dynamics (i.e., different leg gaits). The findings of this paper suggest the methodology can be extended to autonomous field robots, providing the robot with crucial information about the environment that can be used to aid stability over rough terrains and enhance motion planning over varying terrains.
