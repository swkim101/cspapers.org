This poster presents the homeset algorithm, a lightweight approach to estimate occupancy schedules of private households. The algorithm relies on the mobile phones of households' occupants to collect Wi-Fi scans. The scans are then used to determine if occupants are at home or not. The algorithm operates in an autonomous fashion using only information available locally on the mobile phones. We validate our approach using a data set from the Nokia Lausanne Data Collection Campaign.
