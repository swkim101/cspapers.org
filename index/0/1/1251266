Greedy importance sampling is an unbiased estimation technique that reduces the variance of standard importance sampling by explicitly searching for modes in the estimation objective. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of implementing this method and proved that the technique is unbiased in both discrete and continuous domains. In this paper we present a reformulation of greedy importance sampling that eliminates the free parameters from the original estimator, and introduces a new regularization strategy that further reduces variance without compromising unbiasedness. The resulting estimator is shown to be effective for difficult estimation problems arising in Markov random field inference. In particular, improvements are achieved over standard MCMC estimators when the distribution has multiple peaked modes.
