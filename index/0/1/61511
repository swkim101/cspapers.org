The "2007 SIGCSE Report On the Implementation of a Discrete Mathematics Course" recommends relocating some discrete structures topic areas to other courses, for the sake of coherency. Our implementation of the one semester course also relocates topics, but additionally features a focus on a significant computer science problem: regular language acceptors. This problem-directed course model promises superior coherency, motivation, and integration with computing.
