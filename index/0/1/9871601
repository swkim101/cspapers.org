This paper discusses the development of an expert system for diagnosing problems leading to sheet breaks on a papermaking machine. Such a system is expected to resultin both energy and monetary savings by reducing both the frequency and duration of unscheduled machine outages. The knowledge base for this system, which uses a commercial software shell, is still under construction and currently contains about 1600 rules. 
 
One of the unique features of this system is the fact that four experts are supplying the knowledge. These experts are the superintendents of the four paper machines at the mill participating in the project. The advantages and disadvantages of using this many experts are discussed, as is the method for handling the differences between them in the prototype system.
