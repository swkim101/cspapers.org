In history, the Moore's law effect has been used to describe phenomena of exponential improvement in technology when it has a virtuous cycle that makes technology improvement proportional to technology itself. For example, chip performance had doubled every 18-24 months because better processors support the development of better layout tools that support the development of even better processors. I will describe a new Moore's law effect that is being created in knowledge engineering and is driven by the self-reinforcing nature of three trends and technical advancements: big data, machine learning, and Internet economics. I will explain how we can take advantage of this new effect to develop a new generation of semantic and knowledge-based search engines. Specifically, my presentation will cover the following three areas:
 Knowledge acquisition - our goal is to build a comprehensive entity graph and knowledge graph to complement the web and social graphs. I will introduce techniques for entity extraction and knowledgebase construction through automatic and interactive mining and crowdsourcing.
 Managing knowledge - our goal is to support advanced analytical queries by combining probabilistic knowledge with a distributed platform. I will focus on technology for both online knowledge serving and offline knowledge inference.
 Knowledge-empowered search and applications - the knowledge we have acquired and curated enables applications like query understanding, entity-centric search experiences, and answers to natural language queries.
