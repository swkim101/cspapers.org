Currently, most data accessed on large servers is structured data stored in traditional databases. Networks are LAN based and clients range from simple terminals to powerful workstations. The user is corporate and the application developer is an MIS professional.
With the introduction of broadband communications to the home and better than 100-to-1 compression techniques, a new form of network-based computing is emerging. Structured data is still important, but the bulk of data becomes unstructured: audio, video, news feeds, etc. The predominant user becomes the consumer. The predominant client device becomes the television set. The application developer becomes the storyboard developer, director, or the video production engineer.
The Oracle Media Server supports access to all types of conventional data stored in Oracle relational and text databases. In addition, we have developed a real-time stream server that supports storage and playback of real-time audio and video data. The Media Server also provides access to data stored in file systems or as binary large objects (images, executables, etc.)
The Oracle Media Server provides a platform for distributed client-server computing and access to data over asymmetric real-time networks. A service mechanism allows applications to be split such that client devices (set-top boxes, personal digital assistants, etc.) can focus on presentation, while backend services running in a distributed server complex, provide access to data via messaging or lightweight RPC (Remote Procedure Call).
