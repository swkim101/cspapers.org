Parallel robots are generally said to be more accurate but to have a smaller workspace compared to serial robots. With the Gantry-Tau robot, a parallel robot with a large, reconfigurable workspace was presented. This article tries to identify the maximum achievable end-effector positioning accuracy of the Gantry-Tau robot. To this end, a couple of new kinematic error models are presented and evaluated. The sources of the remaining positioning errors (0.09 mm) are discussed.
