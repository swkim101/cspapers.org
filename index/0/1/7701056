Models of learning and performing by exploration assume that thesemantic similarity between task descriptions and labels on displayobjects (e.g., menus, tool bars) controls in part the users searchstrategies. Nevertheless, none of the models has an objective wayto compute semantic similarity. In this study, Latent SemanticAnalysis (LSA) was used to compute semantic similarity between taskdescriptions and labels in an applications menu system.Participants performed twelve tasks by exploration and they weretested for recall after a l-week delay. When the labels in the menusystem were semantically similar to the task descriptions, subjectsperformed the tasks faster. LSA could be incorporated into any ofthe current models, and it could be used to automate the evaluationof computer applications for ease of learning and performing byexploration.
