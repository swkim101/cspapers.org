Our research work concerns the definition of computational systems for the solution of complex scientific problems. In this work we present the analysis of a computing model for the definition and the implementation of microprogrammed prototypal machines. The computing model is expressed in terms of a system of equations. The structure and the control of a microprogrammed machine is directly implied by the formally defined properties of the system of equations.
