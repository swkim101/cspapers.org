Benchmarks are important because they provide a means for users and researchers to characterize how their workloads will perform on different systems and different system architectures. The field of file system design is no different from other areas of research in this regard, and a variety of file system benchmarks are in use, representing a wide range of the different user workloads that may be run on a file system. A realistic benchmark, however, is only one of the tools that is required in order to understand how a file system design will perform in the real world. The benchmark must also be executed on a realistic file system. While the simplest approach may be to measure the performance of an empty file system, this represents a state that is seldom encountered by real users. In order to study file systems in more representative conditions, we present a methodology for aging a test file system by replaying a workload similar to that experienced by a real file system over a period of many months, or even years. Our aging tools allow the same aging workload to be applied to multiple versions of the same file system, allowing scientific evaluation of the relative merits of competing file system designs.In addition to describing our aging tools, we demonstrate their use by applying them to evaluate two enhancements to the file layout policies of the UNIX fast file system.
