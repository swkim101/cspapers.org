Users often need to fill out a registration page with a variety of information, or fill in regular fixed data in a table. To reduce the amount of users input, the AutoComplete functionality is a feature providing the display of a list of suggested items that closely match what the user has typed most often or recently. It speeds up human-computer interactions in applications and reduces the number of keystrokes. The AutoComplete is only applied when there are text fields and the word being typed can be predicted. But for other items like options or selected columns, it will be hard to judge and remember what matches exactly the userpsilas option or selection. In this paper, an integrated design is developed to deal with certain complex Web forms and a timer can be set to submit the completed form automatically. It not only helps the user to keep track of the data to be reproduced at any time, but also allows the other interested researchers to realize this mechanism and expand this application easily.
