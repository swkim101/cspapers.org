There has long been interest in the idea of using syntactic information as part ‘of an information retrieval strategy. People clearly gather information about the meaning of text (e.g., a sentence) both from the meanings of the individual words contained in it and from the structure in which the individual pieces sic put together. Since syntax reflects this structure, it would seem that using syntactic information in addition to information about the presence of query terms would increase the performance of an information retrieval system. Conventional information retrieval systems do not employ syntactic information. They are primarily term based. Thesauri or similar methods can be used to generalize or speciaiize the actual terms included in the query. But or~ly crude constraints on the organizational relationships between terms may be expressed, such as that they must appear in the same sentence, or within a given number of words of each other, or in a certain order. There is no way to express syntactic relationships, such as which term is the head of a phrase and which terms arc its modifiers or what the scope of a modifier is. For example, consider the terms junior and iollege. A query requesting that they both appear in the same sentence could retrieve documenis about junior college and college juniors as well as documents in which the two are barely related. (e.g., high school juniors attending summer classes at a local college). A user interested in documents about junior college may well have no interest in college juniors per se, and certainly does not want documents in which the two terms are not related at all, but that “accidentally” fit the query.
