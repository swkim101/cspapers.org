Knowledge, the primary goal of data analysis and exploration, is most often discovered by generating information (structure) from data, and then abstracting non-trivial patterns (rules or associations for example) from the information. The discovery process can be done using numerous means that share the same goal: visualization, data mining, statistics, neural networks, or mathematical modeling and simulation [2].
