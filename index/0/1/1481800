This paper describes a system to estimate geographical locations for beach photos. We develop an iterative method that not only trains visual classifiers but also discovers geographical clusters for beach regions. The results show that it is possible to recognize different beaches using visual information with reasonable accuracy, and our system works 27 times better than random guess for the geographical localization task.
