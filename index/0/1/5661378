We present improved running times for a wide range of approximate high dimensional proximity problems. We obtain subquadratic running time for each of these problems. These improved running times are obtained by reduction to Nearest Neighbour queries. The problems we consider in this paper are Approximate Diameter, Approximate Furthest Neighbours, Approximate Discrete Center, Approximate Metric Facility Location, Approximate Bottleneck Matching, and Approximate Minimum Weight Matching.
