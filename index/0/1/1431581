We have a developed an analog VLSI system that models the coordination of neurobiological segmental oscillators. We have implemented and tested a system that consists of a chain of eleven pattern generating circuits that are synaptically coupled to their nearest neighbors. Each pattern generating circuit is implemented with two silicon Morris-Lecar neurons that are connected in a reciprocally inhibitory network. We discuss the mechanisms of oscillations in the two-cell network and explore system behavior based on isotropic and anisotropic coupling, and frequency gradients along the chain of oscillators.
