It is sometimes desirable to compute depth from unregistered pairs of images. I show that it is possible to calculate the two 'epicentres' and the relation governing pairs of epipolar lines, given 8 corresponding points in the two images in any coordinate system. This reduces the matching problem to one dimensional searches along pairs of epipolar lines and can be readily automated using any stereo algorithm. Depth, however, does not seem to be derivable without extra information. I show how to compute depth in two such instances, each involving two 'pieces' of information.
