With the emergence of massive information networks, graph data have become ubiquitous for various applications. Although many graph processing problems have been studied recently, entity linking on graph data has not received enough attention by the academia and industry, which finds vertex pairs that refer to the same entity from two graphs. There are two main research challenges arising in this problem. The first one is how to determine whether two vertices refer to the same entity which is rather hard for graph data, especially uncertain data, e.g., social networks. The second challenge is to efficiently link the vertices. As existing graph data are rather large, it is very important to devise efficient algorithms to achieve high performance. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a similarity-based method which takes the vertex pairs with similarity larger than a given threshold as linked entities. We extend existing textual similarity and structural similarity to evaluate similarity between vertices from different graphs. To achieve high quality, we also combine them and propose a hybrid similarity. We also discuss new algorithms to efficiently link entities. We conduct experimental studies on real datasets and the results proves show that our hybrid method achieves high performance and outperform the baseline approaches.
