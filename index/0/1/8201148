Automatic construction of knowledge graphs (KGs) from unstructured text has received considerable attention in recent research, resulting in the construction of several KGs with millions of entities (nodes) and facts (edges) among them. Unfortunately, such KGs tend to be severely sparse in terms of number of facts known for a given entity, i.e., have low knowledge density. For example, the NELL KG consists of only 1.34 facts per entity. Unfortunately, such low knowledge density makes it challenging to use such KGs in real-world applications. In contrast to best-eort extraction paradigms followed in the construction of such KGs, in this paper we argue in favor of ENTIty Centric Expansion (ENTICE), an entity-centric KG population framework, to alleviate the low knowledge density problem in existing KGs. By using ENTICE, we are able to increase NELLâ€™s knowledge density by a factor of 7.7 at 75.5% accuracy. Additionally, we are also able to extend the ontology discovering new relations and entities.
