We describe a short and easy to analyze construction of constant-degree expanders. The construction relies on the replacement product, applied by [14] to give an iterative construction of bounded-degree expanders. Here we give a simpler construction, which applies the replacement product (only twice!) to turn the Cayley expanders of [4], whose degree is polylog n, into constant degree expanders. This enables us to prove the required expansion using a new simple combinatorial analysis of the replacement product (instead of the spectral analysis used in [14]).
