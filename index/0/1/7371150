A new production approach to IC mask layout/checking is described which makes use of a combination of symbolic layout, computer checking and color graphics to resolve some of the problems in currently available layout systems. Techniques such as on-line design rule and connectivity checking, not found in other production systems, give the user "instant" feedback as he is designing.
