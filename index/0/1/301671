We study session key distribution in the three-party setting of Needham and Schroeder. (This is the trust model assumed by the popular Kerberos authentication system.) Such protocols are basic building blocks for contemporary distributed systems|yet the underlying problem has, up until now, lacked a de(cid:12)nition or provably-good solution. One consequence is that incorrect protocols have proliferated. This paper provides the (cid:12)rst treatment of this problem in the complexity-theoretic framework of modern cryptography. We present a de(cid:12)nition, protocol, and a proof that the protocol satis(cid:12)es the de(cid:12)nition, assuming the (minimal) assumption of a pseudorandom function. When this assumption is appropriately instantiated, our protocols are simple and e(cid:14)cient.
