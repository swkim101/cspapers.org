This paper describes the design process used for Netscape Communicator’s collapsible toolbars. To meet our design goals, we designed a new widget whose roots came from objects in the “‘real world” instead of the “software world”. The design of this widget illustrates how rapid prototyping and tight coupling behveen the visual design and interaction design are imperative to a widget’s success.
