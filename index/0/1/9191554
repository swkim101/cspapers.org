In this paper, the development and evaluation of the Urdu parser is presented along with the comparison of existing resources for the language variants Urdu/Hindi. This parser was given a linguistically rich grammar extracted from a treebank. This context free grammar with sufficient encoded information is comparable with the state of the art parsing requirements for morphologically rich and closely related language variants Urdu/Hindi. The extended parsing model and the linguistically rich grammar together provide us promising parsing results for both the language variants. The parser gives 87% of f-score, which outperforms the multi-path shift-reduce parser for Urdu and a simple Hindi dependency parser with 4.8% and 22% increase in recall, respectively.
