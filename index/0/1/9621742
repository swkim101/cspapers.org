Haase This paper describes the architecture, implementation and evaluation of NetSerf, a program for finding information archives on the Internet using natural language queries. NetSerf’s query processor extracts structured, disambiguated representations from the queries. The query representations are matched to hand-coded representations of the archives using semantic knowledge from WordNet (a semantic thesaurus) and an on-line Webster’s dictionary. NetSerf has been tested using a set of questions and answers developed independently for a game called Internet Hunt. The paper presents results comparing the performance of NetSerf and the standard IRs ystem SMART on this set of queries.
