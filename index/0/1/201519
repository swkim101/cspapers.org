The Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol provides confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a client and a server. We describe an efficient and full plaintext recovery attack against the OpenSSL implementation of DTLS, and a partial plaintext recovery attack against the GnuTLS implementation of DTLS. The attack against the OpenSSL implementation is a variant of Vaudenayâ€™s padding oracle attack and exploits small timing differences arising during the cryptographic processing of DTLS packets. It would have been prevented if the OpenSSL implementation had been in accordance with the DTLS RFC. In contrast, the GnuTLS implementation does follow the DTLS RFC closely, but is still vulnerable to attack. The attacks require new insights to overcome the lack of error messages in DTLS and to amplify the timing differences. We discuss the reasons why these implementations are insecure, drawing lessons for secure protocol design and implemen-
