We present a new system for plausible reasoning in expert systems. It is an extension of the Horn clause subset of first order logic, and is distinguished by its use of non-numeric certainties and the assignment of certainties to logical formula rather than events. Model theoretic and fixpoint semantics are sketched for this language. An implementation in the logic programming language Prolog is described and the advantages of the system are discussed.
