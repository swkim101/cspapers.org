The total number of processor cores in supercomputers is increasing while memory size per core is decreasing due to the adoption of processors with multiple cores. Shared Receive Queue is a technique that effectively reduces the memory usage of buffers, but the absence of flow control results in excess buffer pools. We propose a hardware-assisted flow control that reduces flow control latency by 95.1%, thus enabling scalable supercomputers with multi-core processors.
