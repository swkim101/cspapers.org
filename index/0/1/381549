APPGEN is a program which generates information systems. It is easy to use and powerful and runs on a VAX under VMS. It has been used with success in senior level courses on systems analysis and design. Using APPGEN, students are able to analyze and design systems of realistic size and still have time to implement them. Implementations give students important feedback about their designs and give additional focus to a class on systems analysis and design. Students get satisfaction from actually creating a working system.
