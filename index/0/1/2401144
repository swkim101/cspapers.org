We propose a unique gaming concentration to reenergize computer science(CS) education at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU), an HBCU. Nationally, many gaming concentration programs in the CS curriculum have been successfully developed. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, none has been established at any of the HBCUs. The proposed gaming concentration aims to educate minority students with the skills necessary to participate as computer scientists in a game development team and other software development projects. The concentration will help the enrollment and retention of underrepresented students and increase the quality of graduates in this field. A successful gaming concentration at WSSU will advance the knowledge in developing curricula for HBCUs and other minority institutions.
