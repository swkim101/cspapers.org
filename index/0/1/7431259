The typical workload in a database system consists of a mixture of multiple queries of different types, running concurrently and interacting with each other. Hence, optimizing performance requires reasoning about query mixes and their interactions, rather than considering individual queries or query types. In this paper, we show the significant impact that query interactions can have on workload performance. We present a new approach based on planning experiments and statistical modeling to capture the impact of query interactions. This approach requires no prior assumptions about the internal workings of the database system or the nature or cause of query interactions, making it portable across systems. As a concrete demonstration of the potential of capturing, modeling, and exploiting query interactions, we develop a novel interaction-aware query scheduler that targets report-generation workloads in Business Intelligence (BI) settings. Under certain assumptions, the schedule found by this scheduler is within a constant factor of optimal. An experimental evaluation with TPC-H queries on IBM DB2 demonstrates that our scheduler consistently outperforms (up to 4x) conventional schedulers that do not account for query interactions.
