The difference between a malicious and a benign Android application can often be characterised by context and sequence in which certain permissions and APIs are used. We present a new technique for checking temporal properties of the interaction between an application and the Android event system. Our tool can automatically detect sensitive operations being performed without the userâ€™s consent, such as recording audio after the stop button is pressed, or accessing an address book in the background. Our work centres around a new abstraction of Android applications, called a Permission Event Graph, which we construct with static analysis, and query using model checking. We evaluate application-independent properties on 152 malicious and 117 benign applications, and application-specific properties on 8 benign and 9 malicious applications. In both cases, we can detect, or prove the absence of malicious behaviour beyond the reach of existing techniques.
