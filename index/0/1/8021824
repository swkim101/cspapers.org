navigation systems, allow users to record their location history. The location history data can be analyzed to generate life patterns|patterns that associate people to places they frequently visit. Accordingly, an SSN is a graph that consists of (1) a social network, (2) a spatial network, and (3) life patterns that connect the users of the social network to locations, i.e., to geographical entities in the spatial network. In this paper we present a system that stores SNN in a graph-based database management system and provides a novel query language, namely SSNQL, for querying the integrated data. The system includes a Web-based graphical user interface that allows presenting the social network, presenting the spatial network and posing SSNQL queries over the integrated data. The user interface also depicts the structure of queries for the purpose of debugging and optimization. Our demonstration presents the management of the integrated data as an SSN and it illustrates the query evaluation process in SSNQL.
