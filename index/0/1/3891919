Stroke gestures are intuitive and efficient but often require gesture-capable input hardware such as a touchscreen. In this paper, we present GestKeyboard, a novel technique for gesturing over an ordinary, unmodified physical keyboard that remains the major input modality for existing desktop and laptop computers. We discuss an exploratory study for understanding the design space of gesturing on a physical keyboard and our algorithms for detecting gestures in a modeless way, without interfering with the keyboard's major functionality such as text entry and shortcuts activation. We explored various features for detecting gestures from a keyboard event stream. Our experiment based on the data collected from 10 participants indicated it is feasible to reliably detect gestures from normal keyboard use, 95% detection accuracy within a maximum latency of 200ms.
