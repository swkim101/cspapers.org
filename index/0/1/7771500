Aspect-oriented opinion mining detects the reviewers' sentiment orientation (e.g. positive, negative or neutral) towards different product-features. Domain customization is a big challenge for opinion mining due to the accuracy loss across domains. In this paper, we show our experiences and lessons learned in the domain customization for the aspect-oriented opinion analysis system OpinionIt. We present a customization method for sentiment classification with multi-level latent sentiment clues. We first construct Latent Semantic Association model to capture latent association among product-features from the unlabeled corpus. Meanwhile, we present an unsupervised method to effectively extract various domain-specific sentiment clues from the unlabeled corpus. In the customization, we tune the sentiment classifier on the labeled source domain data by incorporating the multi-level latent sentiment clues (e.g. latent association among product-features, domain-specific and generic sentiment clues). Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the accuracy loss of sentiment classification without any labeled target domain data.
