Until recently every Lisp implementation has had either a relatively large assembly language core or extensive microcode support. We have been working on a Common Lisp [Steele 1982] for the S-1 Mark IIA super-computer being developed at LLNL, producing an implementation that has high performance, exploits the complex architecture of the S-1, and which is almost entirely written in Lisp [Brooks 1982b]. We call such a Lisp a Lisp-in-Lisp.
