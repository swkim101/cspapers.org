These ideas have been embodied in a system called AURA, which has been used to engineer an expressive knowledge base for an intelligent biology textbook. The focus of the current paper is to abstract away from the specifics and, to instead describe the core ideas in such a manner that they can be transferred and applied in different contexts, and to relate those ideas to the ongoing research by others.
