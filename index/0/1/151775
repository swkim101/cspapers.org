This paper introduces a method for learning to find translation of a given source term on the Web. In the approach, the source term is used as query and part of patterns to retrieve and extract translations in Web pages. The method involves using a bilingual term list to learn source-target surface patterns. At runtime, the given term is submitted to a search engine then the candidate translations are extracted from the returned summaries and subsequently ranked based on the surface patterns, occurrence counts, and transliteration knowledge. We present a prototype called TermMine that applies the method to translate terms. Evaluation on a set of encyclopedia terms shows that the method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art online machine translation systems.
