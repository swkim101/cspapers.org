Large web-scale applications typically use a distributed platform, like clusters of commodity servers, to achieve scalable and low-cost processing. The Map-Reduce framework and its open-source implementation, Hadoop, is commonly used to program these applications. Since these applications scale well with an increased number of servers, the cluster size is an important parameter. Cluster size however is constrained by power consumption. In this paper we present a system that uses low-power CPUs to increase the cluster size in a fixed power budget. Using low-power CPUs leads to the situation where the majority of a server's power is now consumed by the I/O sub-system. To overcome this, we develop a virtualized I/O sub-system where multiple servers share I/O resources. An ASIC based high-bandwidth interconnect fabric, and FPGA based I/O cards implement this virtualized I/O. The resulting system is the first production quality implementation of cluster-in-a-box that uses low-power CPUs. The unique design demonstrates a way to build systems using low-power CPUs, allowing a much larger number of servers in a cluster in the same power envelope. To overcome software inefficiency and increase the utilization of virtualized disk bandwidth, optimizations necessary for the operating system are also discussed. We built hardware based on these ideas and experiments on this system show a 3X average improvement in performance-per-Watt-hour compared to a commodity cluster with the same power budget.
