Understanding software behaviour can help in a variety of software engineering tasks if one can develop effective techniques for analyzing the information generated from a system's run. These techniques often rely on tracing. Traces, however, can be considerably large and complex to process. In this paper, we present an innovative approach for trace analysis inspired by the way the human brain and perception systems operate. The idea is to mimic the psychological processes that have been developed over the years to explain how our perception system deals with huge volume of visual data. We show how similar mechanisms can be applied to the abstraction and simplification of large traces. Some preliminary results are also presented.
