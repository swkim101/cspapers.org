A magnetic resonance (MR) compatible surgical assistance robot system, designed to aid minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as positioning and directing a catheter or a laser pointer, has been built and is under preclinical evaluation. Two specific issues arise in the MR environment: (i) the reduced space in which to place the robot; and (ii) the MR compatibility. The main mechanical body is located above the head of the surgeon, with two rigid, hanging arms that reach into the workspace. This novel configuration contributes to a small occupancy in the workspace and to the MR compatibility. The robot is also carefully designed for safety and sterilization issues. Details of the kinematics and the design of the robot are given, and the MR compatibility is examined. This shows that the robot has no adverse effect on the imaging, even when it is in motion.
