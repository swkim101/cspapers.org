This paper proposes a method for matching road vehicles between two non-overlapping cameras. The matching problem is formulated as a same-different classification problem: probability of two observations from two distinct cameras being from the same vehicle or from different vehicles. We employ a measurement vector consists of three independent edge-based measures and their associated robust measures computed from a pair of aligned vehicle edge maps. The weight of each match measure in the final decision is determined by a unsupervised learning process so that the same-different classification can be optimally separated in the combined measurement space. The robustness of the match measures and the use of discriminant analysis in the classification ensure that the proposed method performs better than existing edge-based approaches, especially in the presence of missing/false edges caused by shadows and different illumination conditions, and systematic misalignment caused by different camera configurations. Extensive experiments based on real data of over 200 vehicles at different times of day demonstrate promising results.
