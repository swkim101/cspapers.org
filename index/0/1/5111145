"The search for biomarkers of stress and health remains a challenging task for researchers and clinicians alike," as noted in [9]. Against this backdrop, the recent emergence of medical devices that can collect time series for long durations at very high sampling rates makes it possible to study temporal patterns in biophysical signals. We demonstrate a functional system to collect and analyze physiological signals, and provide real-time feedback to the end user.
