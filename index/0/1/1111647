A conventional transaction manager implemented by a database management system (DBMS) was compared against one implemented within an operating system (OS) in a variety of simulated situations. Models of concurrency control and crash recovery were constructed for both environments, and the results of a collection of experiments are presented in this paper. The results indicate that an OS transaction manager incurs a severe performance disadvantage and appears to be feasible only in special circumstances.
