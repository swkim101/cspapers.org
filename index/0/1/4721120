By adding reflexion to the chemical machine of Berry and Boudol, we obtain a formal model of concurrency that is consistent with mobility and distribution. Our model provides the foundations of a programming language with functional and object-oriented features. It can also be seen as a process calculus, the join-calculus, which we prove equivalent to the Â¿-calculus of Milner, Parrow and Walker.
