Directory schemes and software schemes have been proposed to solve the cache coherence problem for the MIN-based large scale multiprocessor systems. Software schemes suffer due to conservative decisions made at compile-time. The directory schemes suffer due to false sharing caused by a non-trivial cache line size. In this paper, a software-based scheme with the assistance of directories is proposed which combines the advantages of both schemes and achieves higher hit ratios. It allows shared writes in the same line as software schemes and captures run-time sharing information as directory schemes. The performance of the new scheme is compared to those of a directory scheme and a software scheme with respect to hit ratios and total memory system traffic.
