Understanding the information need or intent encoded within a query has long been regarded as an essential factor of effective information retrieval. For better query representation and understanding, two intent roles (kernel-object and modifier) are introduced to structurally parse a class of role-explicit queries, which constitute a majority of common user queries. Furthermore, we focus on two research problems: RP-1: Given a role-explicit query, how to identify the kernel-object and modifier, namely intent role annotation; RP-2: How to determine whether an arbitrary query is role-explicit or not. To solve RP-1, we propose a simplified word n-gram role model (SWNR), which quantifies the generating probability of a role-explicit query and performs intent role annotation effectively. Using a set of discriminative features, we build classifiers to address RP-2 in a supervised manner. The experimental results show that: (1) SWNR can achieve a satisfactory performance, more than 73% in terms of different metrics; (2) The classifiers can achieve more than 90% precision in identifying role-explicit queries; (3) Compared with traditional techniques for query representation and understanding, e.g., name entity recognition in query and class-level query intent inference, intent role annotation provides a more flexible framework and a number of applications can benefit from annotating role-explicit queries, such as intent mining and diversified document ranking.
