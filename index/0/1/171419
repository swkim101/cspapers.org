Mobile phones have become an ideal platform for physiological and environmental sensing. A number of research and commercial smartphone "accessories" have emerged in recent years that try to extend the sensing capabilities of a mobile phone. However, the major drawback of these devices is that they either require the user to act in some specific way or change their lifestyle and habit to some extent. In this demo, we present Septimu V2 (Septimu2) -- a novel non-intrusive physiological and environmental sensing platform which is fully embedded in a conventional earphone, works with existing smartphones, and does not require the user to change habits in any way. Septimu2 is a continuation of [1], and integrates a suite of new sensors. In addition to 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope, Septimu2 incorporates remote IR temperature sensor, IR LED, IR photodiode and two additional microphones. The baseboard performs signal condition and sends the data to cellphone via Bluetooth. Septimu2 enables a number of applications, including heart-rate monitoring, fine grained posture detection, and external sound source localization and classification.
