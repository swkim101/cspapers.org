( ;iven n strings arranged in alphabetical order, how many characters must we probe to determine whether a k-character query string is present? If k is a constant, we can solve i IIe problem with @(log n) probes by means of binary search, .Ind this is optimal, but what happens for larger values of k? The question 1s a fundamental one; we are simply askiiig for the complexity of searching a dictionary for a string, ~vhere the common assumption that entire strings can be compared in constant time is replaced by the more conservative assumption that only single characters can be compmed in constant time. For s&iciently long strings, the latter assumption seems more realistic. At first glance the problem may appear easy â€” some liind of generalized binary search should do the trick. However, closer acquaintance with the problem reveals a surprising, intricacy. 13eing slightly more precise, we consider finite strings of characters drawn from an arbitrary, ordered alphabet.
