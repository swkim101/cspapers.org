The Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP) enables heterogeneous CORBA-compliant Object Request Brokers (ORBs) to interoperate over TCP/IP networks. The IIOP uses the Common Data Representation transfer syntax to map CORBA Interface Deﬁnition Language (IDL) data types into a portable network format. Due to the excessive marshaling/demarshaling overhead, data copying, and high-levels of function call overhead, conventional implementations of IIOP protocols have yielded relatively poor performance over high-speed networks. To meet the demands of emerging distributed multimedia applications, however, CORBA-compliant ORBs must support interoperable and highly ef-ﬁcient IIOP implementations. In addition, real-time ORB’s must provide efﬁcient and predictable demultiplexing of in-coming requests. This paper describes the design principles and optimizations we are using to develop a high-performance implementation of CORBA called The ACE ORB (TAO). We
