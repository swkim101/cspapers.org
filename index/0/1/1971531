We study the optimal wiresizing problem under the distributed Elmore delay model. We show that the optimal wiresizing solutions satisfy a number of interesting properties, including the separability, the monotone property, and the dominance property. Based on these properties, we develop a polynomial-time optimal wiresizing algorithm for arbitrary interconnect structures under the distributed Elmore delay model. Extensive experimental results show that our wiresizing solution reduces interconnection delay by up to 51% when compared to the uniform-width solution of the same routing topology. Furthermore, compared to the wiresizing solution based on a simpler RC delay model in our wiresizing solution reduces the total wiring area by up to 28% while further reducing the interconnection delays to the timing-critical sinks by up to 12%.
