We designed a crossdevice testing and reporting system, called cross-device testing and reporting system (CD-TRS), to facilitate the functional validation of protocol and application design in large-scale RTWNs. CD-TRS leverages the nice property of RTWNs that all devices in the network are fully synchronized. By specifying and retrieving events and device status from multiple devices in the runtime simultaneously, CD-TRS can further assemble them into a network-wide report on the detailed system behavior by aligning the records according to their associated network timestamps (or absolute slot number (ASN) in most RTWNs). By comparing this runtime network behavior report with the required protocol and application specifications, abnormal device/network behavior can be observed and their root cause(s) can be effectively located. This thus can significantly reduce the complexity of RTWN testing and reporting. In the following, we first describe the overall architecture of CD-TRS, and then demonstrate how CD-TRS helps with the functional validation of D2-PaS, a distributed and dynamic packet scheduling framework we recently developed for handling disturbances in real-time wireless networks.
