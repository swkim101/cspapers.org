Peculiarity oriented mining (POM), aiming to discover peculiarity rules hidden in a dataset, is a new data mining method. In the past few years, many results and applications on POM have been reported. However, there is still a lack of theoretical analysis. In this paper, we prove that the peculiarity factor (PF), one of the most important concepts in POM, can accurately characterize the peculiarity of data with respect to the probability density function of a normal distribution, but is unsuitable for more general distributions. Thus, we propose the concept of local peculiarity factor (LPF). It is proved that the LPF has the same ability as the PF for a normal distribution and is the so-called Âµ-sensitive peculiarity description for general distributions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the LPF, we apply it to outlier detection problems and give a new outlier detection algorithm called LPF-Outlier. Experimental results show that LPF-Outlier is an effective outlier detection algorithm.
