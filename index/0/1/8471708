—After treating the notiﬁcation of vulnerable par- ties as mere side-notes in research, the security community has recently put more focus on how to conduct vulnerability disclosure at scale. The ﬁrst works in this area have shown that while notiﬁcations are helpful to a signiﬁcant fraction of operators, the vast majority of systems remain unpatched. In this paper, we build on these previous works, aiming to understand why the effects are not more signiﬁcant. To that end, we report on a notiﬁcation experiment targeting more than 24,000 domains, which allowed us to analyze what technical and human aspects are roadblocks to a successful campaign. As part of this experiment, we explored potential alternative notiﬁcation channels beyond email, including social media and phone. In addition, we conducted an anonymous survey with the notiﬁed operators, investigating their perspectives on our notiﬁcations. We show the pitfalls of email-based communications, such as the impact of anti-spam ﬁlters, the lack of trust by recipients, and the hesitation in ﬁxing vulnerabilities despite awareness. However, our exploration of alternative communication channels did not suggest a more promising medium. Seeing these results, we pinpoint future directions in improving security notiﬁcations.
