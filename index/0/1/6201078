What is the 'correct' theoretical description of neuronal activity? The analysis of the dynamics of a globally connected network of spiking neurons (the Spike Response Model) shows that a description by mean firing rates is possible only if active neurons fire incoherently. If firing occurs coherently or with spatio-temporal correlations, the spike structure of the neural code becomes relevant. Alternatively, neurons can be gathered into local or distributed ensembles or 'assemblies'. A description based on the mean ensemble activity is, in principle, possible but the interaction between different assemblies becomes highly nonlinear. A description with spikes should therefore be preferred.
