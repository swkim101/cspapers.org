State-of-the-art semantic role labelling systems require large annotated corpora to achieve full performance. Unfortunately, such corpora are expensive to produce and often do not generalize well across domains. Even in domain, errors are often made where syntactic information does not provide sufficient cues. In this paper, we mitigate both of these problems by employing distributional word representations gathered from unlabelled data. While straight-forward word representations of predicates and arguments improve performance, we show that further gains are achieved by composing representations that model the interaction between predicate and argument, and capture full argument spans.
