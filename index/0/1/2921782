We investigate multiple many-to-many alignments as a primary step in integrating supplemental information strings in string transduction. Besides outlining DP based solutions to the multiple alignment problem, we detail an approximation of the problem in terms of multiple sequence segmentations satisfying a coupling constraint. We apply our approach to boosting baseline G2P systems using homogeneous as well as heterogeneous sources of supplemental information.
