Flexible endoscopes are used in many surgical procedures and diagnostic exams, like in gastroscopy or coloscopy. They have also been used recently for new surgical procedures using natural orifices called NOTES. While these procedures are very promising for the patients, they are quite awkward for the surgeons. The flexible endoscope allows the access to operating areas which are not easily reachable, with small or no incisions; but the manipulation of the system is complex. In order to help the practicians during NOTES or classical interventions with flexible endoscopes, we propose to motorize the system so as to partially robotize the movements. This paper presents the problems in the use of the flexible endoscope and explains how the system can be used to stabilize the endoscope on an area of interest despite physiological motions and therefore to improve the manipulation of the system.
