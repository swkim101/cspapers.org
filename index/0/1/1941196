This Design Briefing tells the story of the design and implementation of Mailer, an electronic mail application being built as part of the Common Desktop Environment, a UNIX-based desktop. The design is notable in that it incorporates past usability data, new toolkit widgets, and compliance with a user interface style that was being written at the time the interface was bei'ng designed. In addition, Mailer is the product of a collaborative effort within and across companies, where the design is orchestrated among software developers, human interface engineers, and technical writers across the hall and across the country.
