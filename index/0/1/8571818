A neural network based clothing style analysis method is proposed via deep filter bank in this paper. Clothing styles are complicated and high-level concept. We propose to construct the deep filter bank by combining Convolution Neural Network(CNN) with Fisher Vector(FV). Then, the extracted features from the body part are used to train the Part-CNN (p-CNN) model. Multiple p-CNNs are integrated along with the whole body model to train the Clothing Style Analysis Neural Network (CSANN). Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that the superior performance of the proposed method.
