The aim of this work is to determine the utility of Local Context Analysis (LCA)[5] for retrieval of relevant and novel sentences. LCA has been successful in different areas and we check here whether this method is also useful to drive the selection of novel material. We adopt the Novelty task as defined in the TREC conference [2, 4, 3]. Giving a set of documents associated to a topic, the task consists of finding the relevant and novel sentences. This problem is interesting for many areas, such as text summarization, web information access, question answering, etc. Some researchers have proposed that the estimation of novelty for a given sentence should be based on the set of seen sentences that share common meanings [6]. In this way, the degree of redundancy of a sentence si is not influenced by past sentences that are totally unrelated to si. The intuition is that novelty estimation might be more robust if focused on this set of terms. In our work we pursue a similar idea because we apply LCA to focus the estimation of novelty on query-related terms.
