Soft manipulators have been a rising focus of soft robotics research. Taking advantage of soft materials and flexible, continuous movements, they have promising applicable prospect. However, their highly internal nonlinearity and unpredictable deformation caused by environmental effects make it difficult to build an exact model for control. In this work, we propose a generalized controller for soft manipulators using an estimated Jacobian-based model derived from structural analysis. The model can be simplified from reasonable assumptions of manipulator structure, and updated to balance conformity to reality and stability. In prototype experiments on an 3D multi-segment soft manipulator, the control method exhibits accuracy as well as adaptability to self gravity and external loads.
