In this paper, we describe an innovative project where Web technologies are exploited to develop an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that uses a Learning Management System (LMS) as its learning interface. The resulting ITS has been instantiated into a specific system called STI-DICO which aims at helping future French primary school teachers to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to use the French dictionary. The learning process in the ITS takes place via a number of authentic learning scenarios that represent situations that the future teachers will face in the classroom. By using a LMS as the learning interface component of the system, we enable it to be directly deployable on the Web to a large population of students, all the while retaining the adaptive components of an ITS to deliver a personalized learning experience to its users.
