In the world of Linked Data, HTTP URIs are names. A URI is dereferenced to obtain a copy or description of the referred resource. If only a fragment of a resource should be referred, pointing to the whole resource is not sufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to be able to refer to fragments of resources, and to name them with URIs to interlink them in the Web of Data. This is especially helpful in the educational context where learning processes including discussion and social interaction demand for exact references and granular selections of media. This paper presents the specification of Linked Data Selectors, an OWL ontology for describing dereferenceable fragments of Web resources.
