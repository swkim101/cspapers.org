Conjunctions have always been a source of problems for natural language parsers. This paper shows how these problems may be circumvented using a rule-based, wait-and-see parsing strategy. A parser is presented which analyzes conjunction structures deterministically, and the specific rules it uses are described and illustrated. This parser appears to be faster for conjunctions than other parsers in the literature and some comparative timings are given.
