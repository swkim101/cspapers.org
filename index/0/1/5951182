In spite of decades of research on word sense disambiguation (WSD), all-words general purpose WSD has remained a distant goal. Many supervised WSD systems have been built, but the effort of creating the training corpus - annotated sense marked corpora - has always been a matter of concern. Therefore, attempts have been made to develop unsupervised and knowledge based techniques for WSD which do not need sense marked corpora. However such approaches have not proved effective, since they typically do not better Wordnet first sense baseline accuracy. Our research reported here proposes to stick to the supervised approach, but with far less demand on annotation. We show that if we have ANY sense marked corpora, be it from mixed domain or a specific domain, a small amount of annotation in ANY other domain can deliver the goods almost as if exhaustive sense marking were available in that domain. We have tested our approach across Tourism and Health domain corpora, using also the well known mixed domain SemCor corpus. Accuracy figures close to self domain training lend credence to the viability of our approach. Our contribution thus lies in finding a convenient middle ground between pure supervised and pure unsupervised WSD. Finally, our approach is not restricted to any specific set of target words, a departure from a commonly observed practice in domain specific WSD.
