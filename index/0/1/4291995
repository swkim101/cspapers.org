In this paper, we utilize tags in Twitter (the hashtags) as an indicator of events. We first study the properties of hashtags for event detection. Based on several observations, we proposed three attributes of hashtags, including (1) instability for temporal analysis, (2) Twitter meme possibility to distinguish social events from virtual topics or memes, and (3) authorship entropy for mining the most contributed authors. Based on these attributes, breaking events are discovered with hashtags, which cover a wide range of social events among different languages in the real world.
