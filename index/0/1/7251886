This paper describes a new device, the Intel®8087 Numeric Data Processor, with unprecedented speed, accuracy and capability. Its modified stack architecture and instruction set are explained illustrative examples are included. The 8087, which conforms to the proposed IEEE Floating-Point Standard, is a coprocessor in the Intel®8086 family. It supports seven data types: three REAL, three INTEGER and one packed BCD format, and performs all necessary numeric operations from addition to logarithmic and trigonometric functions.
