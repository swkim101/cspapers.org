In this paper, we propose privacy-enhancing technologies for medical tests and personalized medicine methods, w hich utilize patients’ genomic data. First, we highlight the pot ential privacy threats on genomic data and the challenges of provid ing privacy-preserving algorithms. Then, focusing specifical ly on a typical disease-susceptibility test, we develop a new arch ite ture (between the patient and the medical unit) and propose priva cypreserving algorithms by utilizing homomorphic encryptio n and proxy encryption. Assuming the whole genome sequencing is d one by a certified institution, we propose to store patients’ gen omic data encrypted by their public keys at a Storage and Processi ng Unit (SPU). The proposed algorithm lets the SPU (or the medic al unit) process the encrypted genomic data for medical tests a nd personalized medicine methods while preserving the privac y of patients’ genomic data. We extensively analyze the relatio nship between the storage cost (of the genomic data), the level of g enomic privacy (of the patient), and the characteristics of the gen omic data. Furthermore, we implement and show via a complexity analysi s the practicality of the proposed schemes. Finally, we evalu ate the security of the proposed schemes and propose new researc h directions on genomic privacy.
