The UNIQUE GAMES problem is the following: we are given a graph <i>G</i> = (<i>V, E</i>), with each edge <i>e</i> = (<i>u, v</i>) having a weight <i>w</i><inf><i>e</i></inf> and a permutation π<inf><i>uv</i></inf> on [<i>k</i>]. The objective is to find a labeling of each vertex <i>u</i> with a label <i>f</i><inf><i>u</i></inf> ∈ [<i>k</i>] to minimize the weight of unsatisfied edges---where an edge (<i>u, v</i>) is <i>satisfied</i> if <i>f</i><inf><i>v</i></inf> = π<inf><i>uv</i></inf>(<i>f</i><inf><i>u</i></inf>).The <i>Unique Games Conjecture</i> of Khot [8] essentially says that for each ε > 0, there is a <i>k</i> such that it is NP-hard to distinguish instances of Unique games with (1-ε) satisfiable edges from those with only ε satisfiable edges. Several hardness results have recently been proved based on this assumption, including optimal ones for Max-Cut, Vertex-Cover and other problems, making it an important challenge to prove or refute the conjecture.In this paper, we give an <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>)-approximation algorithm for the problem of minimizing the number of unsatisfied edges in any Unique game. Previous results of Khot [8] and Trevisan [12] imply that if the optimal solution has OPT = ε<i>m</i> unsatisfied edges, semidefinite relaxations of the problem could give labelings with min {<i>k</i><sup>2</sup>ε<sup>1/5</sup>, (ε log <i>n</i>)<sup>1/2</sup>}<i>m</i> unsatisfied edges. In this paper we show how to round a LP relaxation to get an <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i>)-approximation to the problem; i.e., to find a labeling with only <i>O</i>(ε<i>m</i> log <i>n</i>) = <i>O</i>(OPT log <i>n</i>) unsatisfied edges.
