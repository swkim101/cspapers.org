We introduce a Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) parser that finds semantic roles for a predicate together with the syntactic paths linking predicates and arguments. Our main contribution is to formulate SRL in terms of shortest-path inference, on the assumption that the SRL model is restricted to arc-factored features of the syntactic paths behind semantic roles. Overall, our method for SRL is a novel way to exploit larger variability in the syntactic realizations of predicate-argument relations, moving away from pipeline architectures. Experiments show that our approach improves the robustness of the predictions, producing arc-factored models that perform closely to methods using unrestricted features from the syntax.
