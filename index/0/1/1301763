Opinion mining has become recently a major research topic. A wide range of techniques have been proposed to enable opinion-oriented information seeking systems. However, little is known about the ability of opinion-related information to improve regular retrieval tasks. Our hypothesis is that standard retrieval methods might benefit from the inclusion of opinion-based features. A sentence retrieval scenario is a natural choice to evaluate this claim. We propose here a formal method to incorporate some opinion-based features of the sentences as query-independent evidence. We show that this incorporation leads to retrieval methods whose performance is significantly better than the the performance of state of the art sentence retrieval models.
