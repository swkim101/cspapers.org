This paper describes the development and content of a "VLSI Design" course. We had two main goals for the course: to develop a one-semester course for computer science (and other) majors, and to give the students practical experience with real industrial tools. To meet those goals, we provided only enough material on logic design and IC operation to orient the students, focused on FPLD-based design, and used high-quality design tools. We also found a wealth of free material available on the web, including course information, entire textbooks, and extensive technical data.
