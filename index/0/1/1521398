We are currently exploring technology that exploits database redo recovery to enabie applications to persist across system failures. While forms of program persistence have been proposed, the costs have been high in logging and checkpointing. Our techniques [ 1,2,3] substantially reduce these execution costs and leverage the databaseâ€™s recovery mechanisms to accomplish this. Phoenix continues the trend of expending system resources to conserve more expensive and error-prone human resources.
