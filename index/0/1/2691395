CRYSALIS is a knowledge-based system whose goal is to infer the three-dimensional structures of proteins from x-ray crystallographic data. The system uses both formal and Judgmental knowledge from experts to select appropriate procedures and to constrain the space of plausible protein structures. The hypothesis generating and testing procedures operate upon a variety of representations of the data, and work with several different descriptions of the structure being inferred. This paper focuses on the architecture of the system, and points out some of its Interesting features. An example of the system's performance is given.
