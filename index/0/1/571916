Successful machine diagnosis consists not only of sound diagnostic reasoning, but also the selection of appropriate repairs, sequencing the repairs correctly, interactively validating the success of each repair, and performing follow-on diagnosis in case of repair failure. We discuss some of the issues involved in formulating a repair strategy for an expert system, review some aspects of expert human behavior with respect to repair strategy in a complex domain, and finally describe an implementation of a repair strategy in the TEST diagnostic shell.
