We propose an unsupervised Local and Global feature extraction paradigm to approach the problem of facial expression recognition in thermal images. Starting from local, low-level features computed at interest point locations, our approach combines the localization of facial features with the holistic approach. The detailed steps are as follows: First, face localization using bi-modal thresholding is accomplished in order to localize facial features by way of a novel interest point detection and clustering approach. Second, we compute representative Eigenfeatures for feature extraction. Third, facial expression classification is made with a Support Vector Machine Committiee. Finally, the experiments over the IRIS data-set show that automation was achieved with good feature localization and classification performance.
