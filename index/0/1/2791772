Perceptual organization is scale-invariant. In turn, a segmentation that separates features consistently at all scales is the desired one that reveals the underlying structural organization of an image. Addressing cross-scale correspondence with interior pixels, we develop this intuition into a general segmenter that handles texture and illusory contours through edges entirely without any explicit characterization of texture or curvilinearity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only performs on par with either texture segmentation or boundary completion methods on their specialized examples, but also works well on a variety of real images.
