Insights from Web Science and Big Data Analysis have led many researchers to the conclusion that the Web not only represents an almost unlimited data store but also a remarkable multi-disciplinary laboratory environment. A new challenge is how to best leverage the potential of this experimental space. What are the procedures for defining, implementing and evaluating "Web-scale" experiments? What are acceptable measures of robustness and repeatability? What are the opportunities for experimental collaboration? What disciplines are likely to benefit from this new research model? The Web Laboratory model provides an exciting new and fertile model for future research.
