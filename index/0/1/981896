It is our pleasure to welcome you to the 3rd International Workshop on Graph and Model Transformations -- GraMoT '08. This year's workshop continues with the tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on graph and model transformations. The goal of the workshop is to foster interaction between the graph transformation and the model transformation community to facilitate exchange of results and challenge problems. The graph transformation research community has built up a significant body of knowledge over the past 30 years and in addition to the theoretical base several practical implementations have been created. The research area of model transformations has recently been identified as a key subject in model-driven development. Graph transformations could offer an elegant theory and powerful concepts for the model-driven engineering of software systems, while the software engineering community can generate interesting challenges for the graph transformation community. Therefore, there is a need for strong interaction and inter-operation between these communities: the intellectual interchange of ideas, problems, and solutions will lead to major advances in both fields. 
 
The call for papers attracted a number of submissions, seven of which have been accepted for presentation at the workshop. Each paper was peer-reviewed. The papers were grouped into the following categories: (1) Correspondence issues of model transformations, (2) Graph transformation for model transformation, and (3) Correctness Properties of model transformations. In addition to the presentations of the papers, the program includes discussion sessions on challenges of multi-directional model transformations, and on the maturity of model transformations. We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers in the area of graph and model transformations.
