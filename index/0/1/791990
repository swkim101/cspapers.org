There are fundamental limitations on using mental attitudes to formalise the semantics of an Agent Communication Language (ACL). Instead, we define a general semantic framework for an ACL in terms of protocols. We then argue that the proper role of mental attitudes is to link what an agent 'thinks' about the content of a message to what it 'does' in response to receiving that message. We formalise this connection through normative and informative specifications and demonstrate its use in communication between two BDI-style agents.
