This paper studies web object classification problem with the novel exploration of social tags. More and more web objects are increasingly annotated with human interpretable labels (i.e., tags), which can be considered as an auxiliary attribute to assist the object classification. Automatically classifying web objects into manageable semantic categories has long been a fundamental pre-process for indexing, browsing, searching, and mining heterogeneous web objects. However, such heterogeneous web objects often suffer from a lack of easy-extractable and uniform descriptive features. In this paper, we propose a discriminative tag-centric model for web object classification by jointly modeling the objects category labels and their corresponding social tags and un-coding the relevance among social tags. Our approach is based on recent techniques for learning large-scale discriminative models. We conduct experiments to validate our approach using real-life data. The results show the feasibility and good performance of our approach.
