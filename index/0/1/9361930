Full cross section calculations of ion-temperature-gradient-driven turbulence with Landau closure are being carried out as part of the Numerical Tokamak Turbulence Project, one of the U. S. Department of Energy's Phase II Grand Challenges. Calculations of cylindrical multihelicity ion-temperature-gradient-driven turbulence with previously unattainable resolution were completed on the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center's 160- processor distributed-memory CRAY T3E parallel computer. Both T3E benchmark results and physics results will be presented. Work is in progress to increase the resolution, improve the performance of the parallel code, and include toroidal geometry in these calculations for the new fully configured, 512-processor, T3E-900 model.
