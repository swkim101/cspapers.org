RCCL is a robot programming system that enables a user to specify robot manipulator tasks employing a set of primitive system calls similar in spirit to those of the UNIX input-output system. The goals addressed in the RCCL system are: manipulator task description; sensor integration; updatable world representation; flexibility; wide range of applications; medium level robot programming; off-line programming; efficiency; manipulator independence; portability; foreground-background programming; Cartesian path programming; arbitrary path specification; tracking; force control.
