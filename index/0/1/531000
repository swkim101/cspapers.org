This paper addresses the H∞ robust control problem for robot manipulators using unit dual quaternion representation, which allows an utter description of the end-effector transformation without decoupling rotational and translational dynamics. We propose three different H∞ control criteria that ensure asymptotic convergence, whereas reducing the influence of disturbances upon the system stability. Also, with a new metric of dual quaternion error in SE(3) we prove independence from robot coordinate changes. Simulation results highlight the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of performance, robustness, and energy efficiency.
