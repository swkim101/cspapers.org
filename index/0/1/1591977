A resource grammar is a standard library for the GF grammar formalism. It raises the abstraction level of writing domain-specific grammars by taking care of the general grammatical rules of a language. GF resource grammars have been built in parallel for eleven languages and share a common interface, which simplifies multilingual applications. We reflect on our experience with the Russian resource grammar trying to answer the questions: how well Russian fits into the common interface and where the line between language-independent and language-specific should be drawn.
