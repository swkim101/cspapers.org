We address in this paper the adaptation of a case when a complete constraint model of the underlying problem is given. The idea is to apply methods from constraint based reasoning that allows the detection of "similar" solutions, which can be used to adapt a selected case to a new situation. We consider applications like configuration where a complete constraint model is available. For these applications it is often advantageous to use a case-based approach because constructing a solution form scratch requires often more interaction than taking a complete solution (case) and adapt it fit the current requirements.
