In this work we introduce the usage of bilinear models as a means of factorising the shape variation induced by subject variability and the contraction of the human heart. We show that it is feasible to reconstruct the shape of the heart at a certain point in the cardiac cycle if we are given a small number of shapes representing the same heart at different points in the same cycle, using the bilinear model. Depending on pathology and the ratios between healthy and pathological hearts in the training set, RMS reconstruction errors measured between 1.39 and 16.58 millimetres, with a median of 6.79 and 90th percentile of 9.95 millimetres.
