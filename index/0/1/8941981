Resource sharing is one of the main tasks in high-level synthesis, and although many algorithms have addressed the problem there are still several limitations which restrict the generality and applicability of current algorithms. Most clique-partitioning-based algorithms use local and inaccurate cost-functions which result in inefficient results. This paper presents algorithms for the resource sharing problem on registers and functional units, and shows how they overcome the limitations of existing algorithms. The main characteristics of this work are: interleaved register and functional unit merging in a global clique partitioning based framework, accurate merging cost estimation, accurate interconnect cost estimation, relative control cost taken into account and efficient false loop elimination. The results obtained show significant improvements in the delay of designs, while also minimizing area, specially for large designs with many sharing possibilities.
