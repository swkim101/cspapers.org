Our understanding of how to use large amounts of knowledge to enhance the problem solving capabilities of computer programs is quite limited. Over the past several years a number of knowledge based systems have been developed, and this experience has provided us with a handfull of techniques we can apply in a few domains. What we don't have yet is much of an appreciation of why these techniques work or of the limits of their usefulness In order to take this next step, we need more data. Unfoitunately, the analyses of the expert systems currently being built tend to ignore questions that could provide precisely the data needed. This paper proposes a few questions that it might be worth asking and shows how answers to those questions could begin to give us the understanding we lack.
