As an important branch of production facilities, automated manufacturing systems are a promising perspective of modern factories which become increasingly complex and flexible. From the perspective of development, time variable is a significant concern. In this paper, we propose a class of time-varying systems, Tv-S4R. After involving a global time information loop, it can represent realistic system whose manufacturing process varies with time variables. Event-based control is introduced for serving two important purposes. First, it exerts time-varying specifications on the system, i.e., different processes are executed at different time stages. Second, it prevents the system from reaching any first-met bad marking which will eventually result in deadlocks. We will show that the event-based control can enhance our specifications' expressivity capability compared to their state-based counterparts in terms of generalized mutual exclusion constraints. At last, supervisors are simplified according to the identification of dependence and independence of inequalities. An experimental study illustrates the application of Tv-S4R and the effectiveness of event-based control method.
