The massive amount of visual inputs could easily go beyond the systemâ€™s computational limit. Visual attention provides an efficient way to discard the trivial inputs and achieve good performance. In this paper we develop a unified and consistent theoretical framework for the visual attention and inference with Bayesian decision theory. A visual attention scheme is simulated with an artificial retina mimicking biological ones. We test our model on a real world video clip. The experimental results indicate the promise of this visual attention model in complicated vision applications.
