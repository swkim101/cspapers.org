ASQ is a Web application for creating and delivering interactive HTML5 presentations. It is designed to support teachers that need to gather real-time feedback from the students while delivering their lectures. Presentation slides are delivered to viewers that can answer the questions embedded in the slides. The objective is to maximize the efficiency of bi-directional communication between the lecturer and a large audience. More specifically, in the context of a hybrid MOOC classroom, a teacher can use ASQ to get feedback in real time about the level of comprehension of the presented material while reducing the time for gathering survey data, monitoring attendance and assessing solutions.
