Pseudorandom generators are constructed which convertO(SlogR) truly random bits toR bits that appear random to any algorithm that runs inSPACE(S). In particular, any randomized polynomial time algorithm that runs in spaceS can be simulated using onlyO(Slogn) random bits. An application of these generators is an explicit construction of universal traversal sequences (for arbitrary graphs) of lengthnO(logn).
