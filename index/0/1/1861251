PICASSO is a graphical user interface development system that includes an interface toolkit end an application framework. The application framework provides high-level abstractions including modal dialog boxes end non-modal frames end partels simh.r to conventional programming language procedures and co-routines. These abstractions can be used to define objects that have local variables and that can be called with parameters. PICASSO also has a constraint system that is used to bind program variables to widgets, to implement triggered behaviors, and to itnplement multiple views of data. The system is implemented in Common Lisp using the Common Lisp Object System and the CLX interface to the X Window System.
