Despite rapid advances in face recognition, there remains a clear gap between the performance of still image-based face recognition and video-based face recognition, due to the vast difference in visual quality between the domains and the difficulty of curating diverse large-scale video datasets. This paper addresses both of those challenges, through an image to video feature-level domain adaptation approach, to learn discriminative video frame representations. The framework utilizes large-scale unlabeled video data to reduce the gap between different domains while transferring discriminative knowledge from large-scale labeled still images. Given a face recognition network that is pretrained in the image domain, the adaptation is achieved by (i) distilling knowledge from the network to a video adaptation network through feature matching, (ii) performing feature restoration through synthetic data augmentation and (iii) learning a domain-invariant feature through a domain adversarial discriminator. We further improve performance through a discriminator-guided feature fusion that boosts high-quality frames while eliminating those degraded by video domain-specific factors. Experiments on the YouTube Faces and IJB-A datasets demonstrate that each module contributes to our feature-level domain adaptation framework and substantially improves video face recognition performance to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. We demonstrate qualitatively that the network learns to suppress diverse artifacts in videos such as pose, illumination or occlusion without being explicitly trained for them.
