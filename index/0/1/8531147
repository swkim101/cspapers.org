The next generation video coding standard High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) provides better compression rate for high resolution videos, at the cost of substantially higher computational complexity. While some latest off-the-shelf consumer electronics support HEVC via ASIC solutions, software implementation of real-time HEVC remains an open challenge for resource-constraint embedded systems. In this work, we present an HEVC decoder design on a low-power embedded heterogeneous multiprocessor System-on-Chip (HMPSoC) with CPU and GPU. Our analysis shows that the massive parallel architecture of GPU leads to a relatively smooth fluctuation on the processing time between video frames. Moreover, the dynamic workload of each frame has a monotonic correlation with a particular coding parameter that can be obtained at decoding time. Based on these observations, we propose an application-specific userspace CPU-GPU DVFS scheme which effectively saves the energy consumption for HEVC decoding. Furthermore, given our accurate workload prediction, only a small frame buffer is required to ensure real-time video decoding.
