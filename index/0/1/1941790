Homotopy type theory is a version of Martin-Löf type theory taking advantage of its homotopical models. In particular, we can use and construct objects of homotopy theory and reason about them using higher inductive types. In this article, we construct the real projective spaces, key players in homotopy theory, as certain higher inductive types in homotopy type theory. The classical definition of ℝP<sup>n</sup>, as the quotient space identifying antipodal points of the n-sphere, does not translate directly to homotopy type theory. Instead, we define ℝP<sup>n</sup> by induction on n simultaneously with its tautological bundle of 2-element sets. As the base case, we take ℝP<sup>−1</sup> to be the empty type. In the inductive step, we take ℝP<sup>n+1</sup> to be the mapping cone of the projection map of the tautological bundle of ℝP<sup>n</sup>, and we use its universal property and the univalence axiom to define the tautological bundle on ℝP<sup>n+1</sup>.
