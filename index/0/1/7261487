Lexical chains provide a representation of the lexical cohesion structure of a text. In this paper, we propose two lexical chain based cohesion models to incorporate lexical cohesion into document-level statistical machine translation: 1) a count cohesion model that rewards a hypothesis whenever a chain word occurs in the hypothesis, 2) and a probability cohesion model that further takes chain word translation probabilities into account. We compute lexical chains for each source document to be translated and generate target lexical chains based on the computed source chains via maximum entropy classifiers. We then use the generated target chains to provide constraints for word selection in document-level machine translation through the two proposed lexical chain based cohesion models. We verify the effectiveness of the two models using a hierarchical phrase-based translation system. Experiments on large-scale training data show that they can substantially improve translation quality in terms of BLEU and that the probability cohesion model outperforms previous models based on lexical cohesion devices.
