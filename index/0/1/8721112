We present the tagFlake system, which supports semantically informed navigation within a tag cloud. tagFlake relies on TMine for organizing tags extracted from textual content in hierarchical organizations, suitable for navigation, visualization, classification, and tracking. TMine extracts the most significant tag/terms from text documents and maps them onto a hierarchy in such a way that descendant terms are contextually dependent on their ancestors within the given corpus of documents. This provides tagFlake with a mechanism for enabling navigation within the tag space and for classification of the text documents based on the contextual structure captured by the created hierarchy. tagFlake is language neutral, since it does not rely on any natural language processing technique and is unsupervised.
