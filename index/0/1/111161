In this paper we suggest a framework for teaching software development methods (SDMs). Specifically, based on our accumulative research and in-practice experience of teaching SDMs, a set of principles, that guides our teaching of SDMs in different settings and teaching experiences, has been formulated. The teaching framework consists of 14 principles that their actual implementation is varied and adjusted in different teaching environments. This paper outlines the principles and addresses their contribution to learners' understanding of the said software development method.
