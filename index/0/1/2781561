Ideally, multi-core instruction-set simulation should run in parallel to improve simulation performance. However, the conventional low-parallelism centralized scheduler greatly constrains simulation performance. To resolve this issue, we propose a high-parallelism distributed scheduling mechanism. The experimental results show that our proposed approach accelerates simulation by 6 to 20 times, depending on the number of cores.
