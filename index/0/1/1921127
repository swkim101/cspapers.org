Modal analysis of vibrating structures is a usual technique for design and monitoring in many industrial sectors: car manufacturing, aerospace, civil structures. We present COSMAD a software environment for in-operation situation without any measured or controlled input. COSMAD is an identification and detection Scilab toolbox. It covers modal identification with visual inspection of the results via a GUI or fully automated modal identification and monitoring. The toolbox offers a complete package for signal visualization, filtering and down-sampling, the tracking of frequency and damping over time, mode-shape visualization, MAC computation, etc. The detection part is also a comprehensive toolbox for modal diagnosis and physical localization of faulty components
