This workshop explored innovative ways of integrating commercial off-the-shelf software products into software systems for purposes often unimagined by their creators. It investigated the challenges and risks faced as well as the benefits gained in building COTS-based software systems. The papers accepted to this workshop described tools and techniques for plugging COTS software products into software systems safely, reliably, and predictably. In the past, researchers have predominantly investigated COTS software integration with respect to requirements engineering, risk assessment, and selection. The more recent integration of entire products into software systems complements traditional software development with techniques for designing, implementing, and testing COTS-based systems.
