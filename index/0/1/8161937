We consider the problem of how the CNS learns to control dynamics of a mechanical system. By using a paradigm where a subject's hand interacts with a virtual mechanical environment, we show that learning control is via composition of a model of the imposed dynamics. Some properties of the computational elements with which the CNS composes this model are inferred through the generalization capabilities of the subject outside the training data.
