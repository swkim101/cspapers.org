It is generally accepted that knowledge based systems would be smarter and more robust if they can manage inconsistent, incomplete or imprecise knowledge. This paper is about a four-valued fuzzy propositional logic, which is the result of the combination of a four-valued logic and a fuzzy propositional logic. Besides the nice computational properties, the logic enables us also to deal both with inconsistency and imprecise predicates in a simple way.
