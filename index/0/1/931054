We introduce bilingual word embeddings: semantic embeddings associated across two languages in the context of neural language models. We propose a method to learn bilingual embeddings from a large unlabeled corpus, while utilizing MT word alignments to constrain translational equivalence. The new embeddings significantly out-perform baselines in word semantic similarity. A single semantic similarity feature induced with bilingual embeddings adds near half a BLEU point to the results of NIST08 Chinese-English machine translation task.
