This paper proposes a Geo-distributed key-value datastore, named ChainReaction, that offers causal+ consistency, with high performance, fault-tolerance, and scalability. ChainReaction enforces causal+ consistency which is stronger than eventual consistency by leveraging on a new variant of chain replication. We have experimentally evaluated the benefits of our approach by running the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark. Experimental results show that ChainReaction has better performance in read intensive workloads while offering competitive performance for other workloads. Also we show that our solution requires less metadata when compared with previous work.
