Underground mining operations usually require a number of vertical (or near vertical) shafts to allow movement of rock (ore) or air (ventilation) between different levels within a mine. In most cases such shafts are not easily and safely accessible for surveying and inspection. A reliable and safe method of shaft monitoring is required. The Vertical Opening Inspection System (VOIS) provides a solution to this problem, incorporating cameras, laser range sensors (LIDAR) and inertial sensors within a robust enclosure deployable via winch and cable. This paper discusses the development of a second prototype (VOIS mk II), survey results from the first prototype (VOIS mk I), and plans for future work in the surveying of more general spaces within underground mines.
