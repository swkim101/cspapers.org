This work proposes a novel data reorganization strategy to enable petascale data analysis for large-scale scientific applications running on high-end leadership computers. This strategy achieves optimal data layout for scientific applications by: 1) using a Space Filling Curve to reorganize the data chunks of multidimensional datasets on large storage systems, thus achieving a consistent and balanced read performance for any access pattern; 2) harmonizing the optimal chunk size with underlying file system for more efficient data access. Experimental results demonstrate a maximum of 37 times speedup for S3D simulation on the Jaguar supercomputer.
