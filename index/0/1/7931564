The multidimensional Hierarchical Heavy Hitter (HHH) problem identifies significant clusters in traffic across multiple planes such as source and destination addresses, and has been widely studied in the literature. A compact summary of HHHs provides an overview on complex traffic behavior and is a powerful means for traffic monitoring and anomaly detection. In this paper, we present a new efficient HHH algorithm which fits operational needs. Our key insight is to revisit the commonly accepted definition of HHH, and apply the Z-ordering to make use of a recursive partitioning algorithm. The proposed algorithm produces summary outputs comparable to or even better in practice than the existing algorithms, and runs orders of magnitude faster for bitwise aggregation. We have implemented the algorithm into our open-source tool and have made longitudinal datasets of backbone traffic openly available.
