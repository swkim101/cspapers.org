In this work, we use AirFlip to undo text input on mobile touchscreen devices. AirFlip involves a quick double crossing in-air gesture in the boundary surfaces of hover zone of devices that have hover sensing capability. To evaluate the effectiveness of undoing text input with AirFlip, we implemented two QWERTY soft keyboards (AirFlip keyboard and Typical keyboard). With these keyboards, we conducted a user study to investigate the users? workload and to collect subjective opinions. The results show that there is no significant difference in workload between keyboards.
