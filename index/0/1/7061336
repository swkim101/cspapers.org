Contextual advertising on web pages has become very popular recently and it poses its own set of unique text mining challenges. Often advertisers wish to either target (or avoid) some specific content on web pages which may appear only in a small part of the page. Learning for these targeting tasks is difficult since most training pages are multi-topic and need expensive human labeling at the sub-document level for accurate training. In this paper we investigate ways to learn for sub-document classification when only page level labels are available - these labels only indicate if the relevant content exists in the given page or not. We propose the application of multiple-instance learning to this task to improve the effectiveness of traditional methods. We apply sub-document classification to two different problems in contextual advertising. One is "sensitive content detection" where the advertiser wants to avoid content relating to war, violence, pornography, etc. even if they occur only in a small part of a page. The second problem involves opinion mining from review sites - the advertiser wants to detect and avoid negative opinion about their product when positive, negative and neutral sentiments co-exist on a page. In both these scenarios we present experimental results to show that our proposed system is able to get good block level labeling for free and improve the performance of traditional learning methods.
