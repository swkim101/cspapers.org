@ mistakes while answering "I don't know" O(n2 log log n) times. On the lower bound side, we show that any algorithm making o(n/log n) mistakes must answer "I don't know" a superpolynomial number of times. By contrast, no previous lower bounds were known, and the best previous algorithms (by Sayedi et al. who introduced the model) either make at most 1/3n mistakes while answering "I don't know" O(n) times with linear running time per answer, or make O(n/log n) mistakes while answering "I don't know" O(n2) times with exponential running time per answer. Our lower bound establishes optimality of the latter mistake bound, assuming a polynomial number of "I don't know"s. The running time of our algorithms (per answer) are
