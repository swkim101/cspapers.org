The diameter of a simple polygon is the diameter of a smallest enclosing circle. The width of a simple polygon is the diameter of a largest inscribed circle. The aspect ratio of a simple polygon is the ratio of its diameter to its width. Polygons with a small aspect ratio have been called fat. In particular, for any positive real number a a simple polygon is said to be a-fat if its aspect ratio does not exceed a. Other related definitions of fatness are also possible [5]. Fatness turns out to be a surprisingly useful property in computational geometry. In the recent past, assuming fatness of the objects in the input, several papers have reported reductions in combinatorial complexity and significant efficiency gains for a variety of algorithms solving fundamental problems such as: range query and point location [3], motion planning among obstacles [5], and collision detection [4, 6]. For example, the results in [4] show that the bounding box heuristic in collision detection performs very well if the colliding objects are fat and have approximately the same size. The results in [6] prove the intuition that convexity of the colliding objects helps the bounding box heuristic further. These results motivate the a-fat decomposition problem: given a polygon P and positive real a decompose P into the fewest a-fat subpolygons. An algorithm that solves the a-fat decomposition problem can be used as a crucial preprocessing step in algorithms for problems in which fatness is useful.
