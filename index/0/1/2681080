This paper proposes a new torque sensing method, Cr-N alloy strain sensitive thin-film based torque sensors and distributed joint torque servo systems that enable human support robots to have capabilities to make physical interaction in adaptive and safe operation tasks. Stiffer torque sensing with stable and high-resolution sensing to meet practical level of the developed torque sensors have been achieved. We have developed the joint torque control based 4-DOF arm models in order to verify practical effectiveness of the proposed joint torque servo systems. We also demonstrated the joint torque control based bilateral master slave system exploring future applications.
