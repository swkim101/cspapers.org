This work deals with computer analysis of textured surfaces. Descriptions of textures are formalized from natural language descriptions. Local texture descriptions are obtained from the directional and non-directional components of the Fourier transform power spectrum. Analytic expressions are derived for orientation, contrast, size, spacing, and in periodic cases, the locations of texture elements. The local descriptions are defined over windows of varying sizes.
