Inside a Toulousian project on “Fault tolerant computing system”, we are interested by error confinement and error recovery at the operating system and software application levels. This paper will discuss the determination of a global system architecture by a top-down approach and the principles of protection by capability. We will detail management of synchronization and object sharing between processes, by generalized monitors and path expression in this hierarchized system. Then we will present error recovery mechanisms (rollback).
