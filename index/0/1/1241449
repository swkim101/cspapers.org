When engineering design is considered as a part of the more general study of system design or problem solving, it becomes apparent that it subdivides into the separate problems of design analysis, design synthesis and system identification.
 Rotating electrical machinery presents a uniquely complicated system of non-linear, constrained, discrete and discontinuous relationships. The economical solution of the design of electrical machines in our industrial society can only be achieved by a marriage of various numerical adaptive techniques in a man-machine interactive environment.
 The first applications of digital computers as aids in the design of electrical machines were to automate the field of design analysis. This was followed by the use of the computer to fulfill the role of design synthesis and design optimization. These approaches were suitable to the batch mode of computing which was the only available mode until recently. The advent of a closer symbiosis of man and machine by interaction in a “conversational” mode is opening the way to a much more satisfactory and economical solution of the design problem.
 Some recent experience with “conversational” mode access by means of time-shared consoles is described, together with some experience in the writing of language aids peculiar to the design of electrical machines.
 The “master designer” concept of C. L. Miller is proposed as being a logical evolution in the rotating electrical machines industry and the techniques described in the paper are concluded as leading, in a natural progression, to the fulfillment of this concept.
