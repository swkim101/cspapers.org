Computer-generated texts, whether from Natural Language Generation (NLG) or Machine Translation (MT) systems, are often post-edited by humans before being released to users. The frequency and type of post-edits is a measure of how well the system works, and can be used for evaluation. We describe how we have used post-edit data to evaluate SUMTIME-MOUSAM, an NLG system that produces weather forecasts.
