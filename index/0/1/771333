We propose a ‘layered-step” interior point (LIP) algorithm for linear programming. This algorithm follows the central path, either with short steps or with a new type of step called a “layered least squares” (LLS) step. The algorithm returns the exact global minimum after a finite number of steps—in particular, after *Department of Computer Science, Upson Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853.
