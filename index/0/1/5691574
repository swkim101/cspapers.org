Given $n$ elements with non-negative integer weights $w_1,..., w_n$ and an integer capacity $C$, we consider the counting version of the classic knapsack problem: find the number of distinct subsets whose weights add up to at most $C$. We give the first deterministic, fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for estimating the number of solutions to any knapsack constraint (our estimate has relative error $1 \pm \epsilon$). Our algorithm is based on dynamic programming. Previously, randomized polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPRAS) were known first by Morris and Sinclair via Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, and subsequently by Dyer via dynamic programming and rejection sampling. In addition, we present a new method for deterministic approximate counting using {\em read-once branching programs.} Our approach yields an FPTAS for several other counting problems, including counting solutions for the multidimensional knapsack problem with a constant number of constraints, the general integer knapsack problem, and the contingency tables problem with a constant number of rows.
