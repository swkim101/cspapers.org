This tutorial introduces dynamic web services as a solution to cope with the dynamism and flexibility required by many modern software systems. Current technologies (WSDL, WS-BPEL, etc.) have proven insufficient in addressing these issues; however, they remain a good starting point for the analysis of the current situation and for building for the future.The core part of the tutorial analyzes ---by looking at available technologies and prominent research proposals---the deployment and execution of these applications within three separate phases: a composition phase, to discover available services and implement the desired behavior, a monitoring phase, to understand if a given service is behaving correctly (with respect to both functional and non-functional requirements), and a recovery phase, to react to anomalies by means of suitable replanning or recovery strategies.In conclusion, the tutorial summarizes the main topics, presents a list of still-to-be-solved problems, and highlights possible directions for future research.
