We present a survey of the nominal motion generation schemes and of the associated simple control solutions for robots displaying flexibility effects. Two model classes are considered: robots with elastic joints but rigid links, and robots with flexible links. Model-based feedforward laws are derived for the two basic motion tasks of state-to-state transfer in given time and exact trajectory execution. In particular, we present a new solution to the finite-time reconfiguration problem for a one-link flexible arm. Finally, we use the developed commands into a simple feedback scheme that requires only standard sensors on the motors.
