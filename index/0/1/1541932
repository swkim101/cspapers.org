We present SketchREAD, a multi-domain sketch recognition engine capable of recognizing freely hand-drawn diagrammatic sketches. Current computer sketch recognition systems are difficult to construct, and either are fragile or accomplish robustness by severely limiting the designer's drawing freedom. Our system can be applied to a variety of domains by providing structural descriptions of the shapes in that domain; no training data or programming is necessary. Robustness to the ambiguity and uncertainty inherent in complex, freely-drawn sketches is achieved through the use of context. The system uses context to guide the search for possible interpretations and uses a novel form of dynamically constructed Bayesian networks to evaluate these interpretations. This process allows the system to recover from low-level recognition errors (e.g., a line misclassified as an arc) that would otherwise result in domain level recognition errors. We evaluated Sketch-READ on real sketches in two domains--family trees and circuit diagrams--and found that in both domains the use of context to reclassify low-level shapes significantly reduced recognition error over a baseline system that did not reinterpret low-level classifications. We also discuss the system's potential role in sketch based user interfaces.
