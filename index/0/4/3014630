The wide accessibility of the World Wide Web makes it a perfect base for developing computer science courseware modules. Since learning involves more than just receiving transmitted information, courseware must be interactive and encourage student engagement, which is a challenge on the Web architecture. This article describes an ongoing effort to develop World Wide Web-based computer science courseware modules that will use interactive components as integral parts of the material, in order to promote student involvement. It also discusses the proposed usage of new technology such as HotJava in this framework.
