As processor technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, the principal performance bottleneck of shared memory systems has become the memory access latency. In order to understand the e ects of cache and memory hierarchy on system latencies, performance analysts perform benchmark analysis on existing state-of-the-art multiprocessors. In this study, we present a detailed comparison of the memory system of two recent commercial ventures, the HP V-Class and the SGI Origin 2000. Our goal is to compare and contrast design techniques used in these multiprocessors to tolerate the e ect of memory latency. Our experimental methodology uses microbenchmarks as well as scienti c applications to characterize the user-level performance.
