Despite the continued expansion of tourism in Taiwan, the search systems used in the tourism sector lack the ability to recommend attractions. This means that users are required to spend additional time looking up information on numerous attractions before selecting their destinations. This study proposed a skyline query-based attraction recommendation system that takes into account the preferences and location of the user in the formulation of recommendations. The efficacy and feasibility of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated by applying it to a popular attraction query system referred to as the Demodulation and Encoding Heritage System.
