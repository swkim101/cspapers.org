Cable-suspended robots are structurally similar to parallel actuated robots but with the fundamental difference that cables can only pull the end-effector but not push it. From a scientific point of view, this feature makes feedback control of cable-suspended robots lot more challenging than their counterpart parallel-actuated robots. In the case with redundant cables, feedback control laws can be designed to make all tensions positive while attaining desired control performance. This paper describes these approaches and their effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations of a three degree-of-freedom cable suspended robots with four, five, and six cables.
