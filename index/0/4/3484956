Automated feedback needs instructor input to be most effective. The increasing demand in computing education necessitates automated feedback systems for teaching programming. However, most current automated feedback tools do not incorporate instructor input. Great strides are being made with identification and code edit steps for automated student feedback, but tools for instructor crafted feedback are lacking in the field of computing. My research, currently targeted at novice programmers aims to close that gap with a hybrid approach of a teacher in the loop feedback system I facilitate writing instructor feedback delivered to students in an automated fashion to give meaningful, instruction enhancing feedback. I also evaluate these mechanisms in classrooms by measuring learning gains, student perception, and other metrics.
