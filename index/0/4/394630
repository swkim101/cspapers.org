INTRODUCTION The traditional introductory course for computer science majors is a programming course in some high-level language. The emphasis in such a course has shifted over the years away horn the details of language syntax and toward a broader emphasis on problem solving, and algorithm design and development, as well as implementation. Thus the course now typically encompasses some of the phases of a software development life cycle. Nevertheless, the major emphasis on software engineering in most departments is usually found in a one semester or one year “software engineering” course taken by students in their senior year [6]. Most such courses emphasize a group software project [5], and many experiences have been reported on the management and organization of project-oriented courses [1, 2, 4].
