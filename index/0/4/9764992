This poster presents implementation details and performance of various collective operations using the low level communication interfaces of the BG/L Advanced Dignostic Environment(ADE). These collectives can be applied to, but are not limited to, N-body simulations, 3D Fast Fourier Transforms(3D FFT) and data intensive applications. We present performance data of these micro benchmarks up through 16384 nodes of BG/L.A number of these collectives are currently deployed in the BlueMatter molecular dynamics program to broadcast positions, reduce forces and redistribute data in the 3DFFT. We also present the status of current development of additional collectives targeting data intensive applications.
