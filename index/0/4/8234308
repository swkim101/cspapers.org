We learn models to generate the immediate future in video. This problem has two main challenges. Firstly, since the future is uncertain, models should be multi-modal, which can be difficult to learn. Secondly, since the future is similar to the past, models store low-level details, which complicates learning of high-level semantics. We propose a framework to tackle both of these challenges. We present a model that generates the future by transforming pixels in the past. Our approach explicitly disentangles the models memory from the prediction, which helps the model learn desirable invariances. Experiments suggest that this model can generate short videos of plausible futures. We believe predictive models have many applications in robotics, health-care, and video understanding.
