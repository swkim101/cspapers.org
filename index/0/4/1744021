This paper proposes a compact and fast hybrid signature scheme that can be used to solve the problem of packet source authentication for multicast. This scheme can be viewed as an improvement to off-line/on-line signature schemes, in that the signature size overhead is much smaller. Since this is a generic technique, it should have applications to several other practical problems as well.
