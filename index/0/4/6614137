The following results are presented: l With high probability the number of vertex disjoint paths from a vertex subset X to a vertex subset Y in a digraph equals the rank of the X-Y submatrix of A-‘, where A is the Laplacian matrix of the digraph with random weights and a perturbation. This theorem yields several physical tests for the number of vertex disjoint X-Y paths in graphs, e.g., using voltage differences in electric networks, or using random walks. l There are randomized algorithms to compute a minimum X-Y separator in a digraph, and a minimum vertex cover in a bipartite graph in time O(n2ss ) with high probability. This improves on the previous best bound of O(n2.5/ logn). l The sequential time complexity of computing a maximum bipartite matching is related to that of finding a Lovisz minimum digraph. A maximum bipartite matching can be computed in time O(L(n, Ic)+n3/Ic+lcn’.5) for any k, 0 < L < n, where L(n, k) is the time complexity of finding a Lovbz minimum digraph.
