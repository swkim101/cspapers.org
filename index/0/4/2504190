We discuss the types of functional knowledge about an environment an agent can use in order to act effectively. We demonstrate (1) the use of structural regularities for acting efficiently, and (2) the use of physical regularities for designing effective sensors. These ideas are described in the context of an everyday task: grocery store shopping. We discuss how SHOPPER, a program, uses regularities of grocery stores in order to act appropriately and sense efficiently in GROCERYWORLD, a simulated grocery store.
