High Performance Data Transfer is a core requirement of many Supercomputing applications. From basic FTP file transfers to P2P or Grid applications, moving data across wide area networks at high speed is critically important. This tutorial covers a wide range of approaches used to achieve this.The first half focuses on advanced networking technology and low-level performance issues such as delay, loss, switching/routing, TCP and UDP dynamics, system and network tuning. The second half looks at higher level approaches to improving performance, from improved protocols, parallel transfers, peer-to-peer and grid techniques, and abstract storage services.The attendee should come away with a detailed understanding of data transfer over wide area networks, and exposure to a great number of tools and utilities to tune, debug, and improve their ability to move data at high speed.
