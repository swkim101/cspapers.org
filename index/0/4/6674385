In this paper, a viahole structure is applied to realize dual band-notched characteristic in a compact planar monopole antenna for ultrawide band (UWB) applications. The proposed antenna consists of a modified radiating patch element and a ground plane. Three patches are etched on the back of the antenna and connected to the main patch by series of via holes to realize the WiMAX 3.5 GHz notched band and the WLAN 5.5 GHz notched band. The simulation and measurement show that the proposed antenna achieves an impedance bandwidth of 3.1â€“10.6 GHz with VSWR&#60;2, except the bandwidths of WiMAX and WLAN. A nearly omnidirectional radiation pattern and stable gain are also obtained except in the notched bands.
