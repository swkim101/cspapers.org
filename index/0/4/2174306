Previous sampling-based image matting methods typically rely on certain heuristics in collecting representative samples from known regions, and thus their performance deteriorates if the underlying assumptions are not satisfied. To alleviate this, in this paper we take an entirely new approach and formulate sampling as a sparse subset selection problem where we propose to pick a small set of candidate samples that best explains the unknown pixels. Moreover, we describe a new distance measure for comparing two samples which is based on KL-divergence between the distributions of features extracted in the vicinity of the samples. Using a standard benchmark dataset for image matting, we demonstrate that our approach provides more accurate results compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
