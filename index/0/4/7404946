Traditional approaches to system management have been largely based on domain experts through a knowledge acquisition process that translates domain knowledge into operating rules and policies. This has been well known and experienced as a cumbersome, labor intensive, and error prone process. In addition, this process is difficult to keep up with the rapidly changing environments. In this paper, we will describe our research efforts on establishing an integrated framework for mining system log files for automatic management. In particular, we apply text mining techniques to categorize messages in log files into common situations, improve categorization accuracy by considering the temporal characteristics of log messages, develop temporal mining techniques to discover the relationships between different events, and utilize visualization tools to evaluate and validate the interesting temporal patterns for system management.
