In bilateral teleoperation system, conventional position sensor based force reflection method, known as position error feedback, may generate inaccurate force reflection directions, when motion of a slave robot is constrained by unexpected obstacles and link collisions. Restriction Space Projection method is a novel position sensor based force reflection framework that was proposed to address this issue. It provides accurate force reflection in unstructured environments when motion of a slave robot is constrained by unexpected obstacles and link collisions, regardless of kinematic dissimilarity between the master and slave manipulators of the bilateral teleoperation system. This paper discusses the applications and limitations of the Restriction Space Projection method through examples.
