The specification and modeling of software systems, of their aspects, and their development processes is at the heart of software engineering. Over the years, we have achieved a much deeper and more comprehensive understanding of software and its models as a basis for its specification. However, there is still a way to go to make sure that all we know right now is transferred into practice, and that all we do not understand so far is investigated in depth. The goal is a tractable scientific basis for modeling and specification in programming, software and system engineering and its employment in engineering methods.
