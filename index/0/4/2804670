The complexity of such systems comes not only from the number of their elements, but also from the unavoidable emergence of new properties of the system, which are not just a simple summation of the properties of its elements. The behavior of complex systems can be fitted with a number of well developed models, which, however, do not incorporate the modularity and the evolution of a system simultaneously. In this work, we propose a generalized model that addresses this issue. Our model is developed within the Random Set Theoryâ€™s framework and allows for reconstructing the stochastic evolution diagrams of complex systems.
