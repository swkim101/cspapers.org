Large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs) are both compute and memory intensive. As the size of DNNs continues to grow, it is critical to improve the energy efficiency and performance while maintaining accuracy. For DNNs, the model size is an important factor affecting performance, scalability and energy efficiency. Weight pruning achieves good compression ratios but suffers from three drawbacks: 1) the irregular network structure after pruning, which affects performance and throughput; 2) the increased training complexity; and 3) the lack of rigirous guarantee of compression ratio and inference accuracy.To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes CirCNN, a principled approach to represent weights and process neural networks using block-circulant matrices. CirCNN utilizes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based fast multiplication, simultaneously reducing the computational complexity (both in inference and training) from $\mathrm {O}(n^{2})$ to $\mathrm {O}(n$ log n) and the storage complexity from $\mathrm {O}(n^{2})$ to O(n), with negligible accuracy loss. Compared to other approaches, CirCNN is distinct due to its mathematical rigor: the DNNs based on CirCNN can converge to the same “effectiveness” as DNNs without compression. We propose the CirCNN architecture, a universal DNN inference engine that can be implemented in various hardware/software platforms with configurable network architecture (e.g., layer type, size, scales, etc In CirCNN architecture: 1) Due to the recursive property, FFT can be used as the key computing kernel which ensures universal and small-footprint implementations. 2) The compressed but regular network structure avoids the pitfalls of the network pruning and facilitates high performance and throughput with highly pipelined and parallel design. To demonstrate the performance and energy efficiency, we test CIR-CNN in FPGA, ASIC and embedded processors. Our results show that CirCNN architecture achieves very high energy efficiency and performance with a small hardware footprint. Based on the FPGA implementation and ASIC synthesis results, CirCNN achieves 6 - 102X energy efficiency improvements compared with the best state-of-the-art results.CCS Concepts• Computer systems organization$\rightarrow $ Embedded hardware;
