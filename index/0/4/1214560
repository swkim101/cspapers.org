Autonomous Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator Systems (AUVMS) operating in shallow waters or near-surface environments may be exposed to wave disturbances which will cause undesired motion of the end effector. This paper presents a method to maneuver the manipulator joints and counteract undesired motion of the vehicle body, in order to maintain a steady end-effector position in the inertial frame. An Autoregressive (AR) model is used to predict vehicle motion, and then combined with Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize joint motion. Simulation was conducted using real data to verify the efficacy of this method.
