Locating bugs is important, difficult, and expensive, particularly for large-scale systems. To address this, natural language information retrieval techniques are increasingly being used to suggest potential faulty source files given bug reports. While these techniques are very scalable, in practice their effectiveness remains low in accurately localizing bugs to a small number of files. Our key insight is that structured information retrieval based on code constructs, such as class and method names, enables more accurate bug localization. We present BLUiR, which embodies this insight, requires only the source code and bug reports, and takes advantage of bug similarity data if available. We build BLUiR on a proven, open source IR toolkit that anyone can use. Our work provides a thorough grounding of IR-based bug localization research in fundamental IR theoretical and empirical knowledge and practice. We evaluate BLUiR on four open source projects with approximately 3,400 bugs. Results show that BLUiR matches or outperforms a current state-of-the-art tool across applications considered, even when BLUiR does not use bug similarity data used by the other tool.
