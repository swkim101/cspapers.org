Several techniques for addressing the state space explosion problem in model checking have been studied. One of these is to use distributed memory and computation for storing and exploring the state space of the model of a system. In this report, we present and compare different multi-thread, distributed, and cloud approaches to face the state-space explosion problem. The experiments report shows the convenience (in particular) of cloud approaches.
