In this paper we present TEAPOT, a full system GPU simulator, whose goal is to allow the evaluation of the GPUs that reside in mobile phones and tablets. To this extent, it has a cycle accurate GPU model for evaluating performance, power models for the GPU, the memory subsystem and for OLED screens, and image quality metrics. Unlike prior GPU simulators, TEAPOT supports the OpenGL ES 1.1/2.0 API, so that it can simulate all commercial graphical applications available for Android systems.
 To illustrate potential uses of this simulating infrastructure, we perform two case studies. We first turn our attention to evaluating the impact of the OS when simulating graphical applications. We show that the overall GPU power/performance is greatly affected by common OS tasks, such as image composition, and argue that application level simulation is not sufficient to understand the overall GPU behavior. We then utilize the capabilities of TEAPOT to perform studies that trade image quality for energy. We demonstrate that by allowing for small distortions in the overall image quality, a significant amount of energy can be saved.
