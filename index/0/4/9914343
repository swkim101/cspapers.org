The main contribution of this paper is to bridge the gap between passive monocular SLAM and autonomous robotic systems. While passive monocular SLAM strives to reconstruct the scene and determine the current camera pose for any given camera motion, not every camera motion is equally suited for these tasks. In this work we propose methods to evaluate the quality of camera motions with respect to the generation of new useful map points and localization maintenance. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our measures using a low-cost quadrocopter. The proposed system only requires a single passive camera as exteroceptive sensor. Due to its explorative nature, the system achieves autonomous way-point navigation in challenging, unknown, GPS-denied environments.
