This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a course teaching Computer Science majors about teaching Computer Science. The course was designed to address the need for teachers and resources to support rapid changes in topics being taught in high schools. It also helped prepare students for research in Computer Science Education, and for careers involving computing and education. The course is described in detail, and is evaluated based on student feedback and the outcomes from the course.
