In this paper, we extend the deep representation learning to domain adaptation scenario, and propose a novel deep model called ``Deep Adaptive Exemplar AutoEncoder (DAE$^2$)''. Different from conventional denoising autoencoders using corrupted inputs, we assign semantics to the input-output pairs of the autoencoders, which allow us to gradually extract discriminant features layer by layer. To this end, first, we build a spectral bisection tree to generate source-target data compositions as the training pairs fed to autoencoders. Second, a low-rank coding regularizer is imposed to ensure the transferability of the learned hidden layer. Finally, a supervised layer is added on top to transform learned representations into discriminant features. The problem above can be solved iteratively in an EM fashion of learning. Extensive experiments on domain adaptation tasks including object, handwritten digits, and text data classifications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
