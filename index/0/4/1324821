As physical implementation of electronic circuits has evolved from discrete component printed circuit boards to very large scale integrated circuits, there has been increasing economic pressure to automate the layout design process. Early efforts to use computer-based layout focused on relatively simple PCB's, while recently developed layout tools address the demands of quite complex IC layout tasks. It has become evident that it is economically impractical to develop comprehensive layout systems that focus on a single circuit style or technology. Hence, increasing attention has been given to layout tools that are relatively technology independent. That is, they may be successfully applied to a diversity of layout problem styles having different floorplans, design rules, and component attributes.
 We would prefer to develop and support design tools that are “technology independent”; in the sense that for both printed circuit boards and integrated circuits having these diverse characteristics the software basis for these tools is common.
