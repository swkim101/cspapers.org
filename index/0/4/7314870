Recently, deep learning has been successfully applied to the problem of hashing, yielding remarkable performance compared to traditional method-s with hand-crafted features. However, most of existing deep hashing methods are designed for the supervised scenario and require a large number of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised hashing method for image retrieval, named Deep Hashing with a Bipar-tite Graph (BGDH), to simultaneously learn embeddings, features and hash codes. More speciÔ¨Å-cally, we construct a bipartite graph to discover the underlying structure of data, based on which an embedding is generated for each instance. Then, we feed raw pixels as well as embeddings to a deep neural network, and concatenate the resulting features to determine the hash code. Compared to existing methods, BGDH is a universal framework that is able to utilize various types of graphs and losses. Furthermore, we propose an inductive variant of BGDH to support out-of-sample extensions. Experimental results on real datasets show that our BGDH outperforms state-of-the-art hashing meth-ods.
