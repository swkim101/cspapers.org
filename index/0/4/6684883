The importance of bringing causality into play when designing feature selection methods is more and more acknowledged in the machine learning community. This paper proposes a filter approach based on information theory which aims to prioritise direct causal relationships in feature selection problems where the ratio between the number of features and the number of samples is high. This approach is based on the notion of interaction which is shown to be informative about the relevance of an input subset as well as its causal relationship with the target. The resulting filter, called mIMR (min-Interaction Max-Relevance), is compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Classification results on 25 real microarray datasets show that the incorporation of causal aspects in the feature assessment is beneficial both for the resulting accuracy and stability. A toy example of causal discovery shows the effectiveness of the filter for identifying direct causal relationships.
