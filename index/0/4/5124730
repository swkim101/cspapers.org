This paper describes the technique to grasp the micro transparent objects, such as crystal and cell, using the integrated vision system. At first, several 3D modeling techniques for transparent object are surveyed, which were mainly applied to use the polarization technique. Secondly, polarization characteristics on micro transparent object are evaluated. Thirdly, integrated vision system for micro objects is briefly reviewed. Then, to solve the problem of the transparent object with this integrated vision system, several new methods based on the volume rendering and edge methods information using the integrated vision system is proposed. Finally, the modeling and handling technique are proposed.
