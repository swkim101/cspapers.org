Lexical simpliﬁcation of scientiﬁc terms represents a unique challenge due to the lack of a standard parallel corpora and fast rate at which vocabulary shift along with research. We introduce SimpleScience, a lexical simpliﬁca-tion approach for scientiﬁc terminology. We use word embeddings to extract simpliﬁcation rules from a parallel corpora containing sci-entiﬁc publications and Wikipedia. To evaluate our system we construct SimpleSciGold, a novel gold standard set for science-related simpliﬁcations. We ﬁnd that our approach out-performs prior context-aware approaches at generating simpliﬁcations for scientiﬁc terms.
