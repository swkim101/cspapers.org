The automatic summarization of long-running events from news steams is a challenging problem. A long-running event can contain hundreds of unique 'nuggets' of information to summarize, spread-out over its lifetime. Meanwhile, information reported about it can rapidly become outdated and is often highly redundant. Incremental update summarization (IUS) aims to select sentences from news streams to issue as updates to the user, summarising that event over time. The updates issued should cover all of the key nuggets concisely and before the information contained in those nuggets becomes outdated. Prior summarization approaches when applied to IUS can fail, since they define a fixed summary length that cannot effectively account for the different magnitudes and varying rate of development of such events. In this paper, we propose a novel IUS approach that adaptively alters the volume of content issued as updates over time with respect to the prevalence and novelty of discussions about the event. It incorporates existing state-of-the-art summarization techniques to rank candidate sentences, followed by a supervised regression model that balances novelty, nugget coverage and timeliness when selecting sentences from the top ranks. We empirically evaluate our approach using the TREC 2013 Temporal Summarization dataset extended with additional assessments. Our results show that by adaptively adjusting the number of sentences to select over time, our approach can nearly double the performance of effective summarization baselines.
