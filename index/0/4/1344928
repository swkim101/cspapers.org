Robots understand the world around them through sensing. To process the data produced by sensors we propose to use Procedural Parameters and Complex Event Processing (CEP). End-users model applications for robots as a CEP Graph, in which the end-users specify how input from the sensors of the robot is transformed to output for the actuators of the robot. Between input and output is a network of streams connected together by operators. By using Procedural Parameters a set of generic operators can be used within the CEP Graph. The CEP Graph can be executed on the robot or on a PC remotely controlling the robot.
