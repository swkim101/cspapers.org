The explosive growth of knowledge in the many diverse fields comprising electrical engineering has resulted in an undergraduate curriculum that is overflowing in specialized courses, increasingly hard to complete in four years, showing a decrease in social and humanistic courses, and providing fewer electives courses. At the same time the enrollment and retention in electrical engineering departments is decreasing nationwide, with a significant difficulty in recruiting and retaining under-represented students (women and minorities). These two major areas combine with increasing complaints on the part of industry that todayâ€™s students are not prepared, cannot write and speak clearly, and cannot think through problems in a fundamental way. Furthermore, the increasing global nature of the electronics industry requires greater awareness of history, cultures and languages.
