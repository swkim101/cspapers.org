In this important application, the current residence is typically used to define the location of individuals from the population. Considering the mobility of humans at various temporal and spatial scales, using only information about the current residence may be an insufficiently informative proxy because it ignores a multitude of exposures that may occur away from home, or which had occurred at previous residences. In this paper, we propose a spatial scan statistic that is appropriate for disease mapping on mobile populations. We formulate a computationally efficient algorithm that uses the proposed statistic to find significant high-risk regions from mobile population's disease status data. The algorithm is applicable on large populations and over dense spatial grids. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and outperforms the traditional disease clustering approaches at discovering high-risk regions in mobile populations.
