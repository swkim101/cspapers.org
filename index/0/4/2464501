We study diagnosis of segments on speedpaths that fail the timing constraint at the post-silicon stage due to manufacturing variations. We propose a formal procedure that is applied after isolating the failing speedpaths which also incorporates post-silicon path-delay measurements for more accurate analysis. Our goal is to identify segments of the failing speedpaths that have a post-silicon delay larger than their estimated delays at the pre-silicon stage. We refer to such segments as “failing segments” and we rank them according to their degree of failure. Diagnosis of failing segments alleviates the problem of lack of observability inside a path. Moreover, root-cause analysis, and post-silicon tuning or repair, can be done more effectively by focusing on the failing segments. We propose an Integer Linear Programming formulation to breakdown a path into a set of non-failing segments, leaving the remaining to be likely-failing ones. Our algorithm yields a very high “diagnosis resolution” in identifying failing segments, and in ranking them.
