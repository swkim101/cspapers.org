In this paper we present a method by which to organize the interactions of autonomous assembly agents in intelligent self-assembly (ISA). Each assembly agent has limited and local sensing and local rule-based control. A transition rule set (TRS) compiler is presented which takes a desired goal structure as input and gives as output a set of rules. When each assembly agent utilizes these rules, the desired goal structure is assembled. We show that the TRS compiler is scalable, efficient, and is capable of producing rules for a large class of goal structures.
