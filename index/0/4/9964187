Courses in Computer Science and Information Systems are constantly in need of revision to remain relevant. Often entire new courses become needed as an area develops. These can be the most challenging alterations to a curriculum. In some cases, while provisions are being made to introduce a new course, key components of the course can be introduced as modules of already existing courses. An example is considered in which seemingly dissimilar courses meet, and new material is given a forum in a standard curriculum. An extension to a standard file processing course to include the files-affecting impact of computer networks is proposed.
