Robot control systems consist of a feedback controller and reference motion pattern. They are designed based on the robot dynamics and coupled with each other, and it requires lots of calculation to obtain them. So far, we have proposed controller design method based on orbit attractor of nonlinear dynamics. Because the controller yields one motion for one robot, we can assume that the controller includes information of motion and body elements. If those elements can be decomposed from the controller, a new controller can be easily designed by the combination of these elements. So in this paper, we propose the motion and body elements design method with Lagrange's method of undetermined multipliers based on robot dynamics, and combination design method of a new controller using these elements. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by experiments with tapping dance robots.
