The main problem in robotics is strengthening of robot artificial intelligence (I A ) system. Its solution will facilitate cooperation of man with robot. Authors suggest advanced technology for I A development. It borrows method of universal (deep) tutoring (T U ) relying on semantic axiomatic method (AM). By method T U knowledge understanding is achieved by rational consciousness formation. It uses the utmost mathematical abstractions expressed on language of categories (L C ). Being functional one L C is destined for intellectual processes (P IR ) description due to its universal constructions. Following T U robot educational space (S ER ) is class of categories. Its I A sophistication occurs through new categories inclusion as required in robot I A multilevel hierarchical orientated network (N C ) of concepts. Universal laws of robot functioning are embodied as operations of algebraic structures being objects of N C . It creates integrated environment of applications (IE A ). Robot intercourse with man and its interaction with working space (S WR ) make active P IR happening in N C . Processes of assignments execution (P ER ) begin just when satisfaction to a set of relations in S WR and in robot space of notions is a success. Possibility of P IR to climb up the highest levels of N C and down the lowest ones endows robot with capability to generate P ER making decisions in unfamiliar S WR .
