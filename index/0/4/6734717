Motivated by the observation that channel assignment for multiradio multi-channel mesh networks should support both unicast and local broadcast1, should be interference-aware, and should result in low overall switching delay, high throughput, and low overhead, we propose two flexible localized channel assignment algorithms based on s-disjunct superimposed codes. These algorithms support the local broadcast and unicast effectively, and achieve interference-free channel assignment under certain conditions. In addition, under the primary interference constraints2, the channel assignment algorithm for unicast can achieve 100% throughput with a simple scheduling algorithm such as the maximal weight independent set scheduling, and can completely avoid hidden/exposed terminal problems under certain conditions. Our algorithms make no assumptions on the underlying network and therefore are applicable to a wide range of MR-MC mesh network settings. We conduct extensive theoretical performance analysis to verify our design.
