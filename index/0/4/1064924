The authors discuss ditch crossing control for a quadruped walking robot. The authors analyze the common gait of a quadruped robot on a flat floor, then research for a usable transition gait from walking on a flat floor to crossing a ditch using computer simulation. The authors used the transition gait to test a quadruped robot weighing 86 Kg. The quadruped robot recognizes a ditch with tactile sensors and adjusts its gait automatically. The width of the ditch is 200 mm. It is proven that the control scheme can have the quadruped robot cross the ditch safely and stably. The maximum width of the ditch the robot can cross in various cases is studied.
