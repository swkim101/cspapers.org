The aim of the present paper is to reveal the interrelation between general patterns of nonmonotonic reasoning and multiple belief revision. For this purpose we de ne a nonmonotonic inference frame in which individual inference rules have been proposed in the literature but their combination as a system has not been investigated. It is shown that such a system is so strong that almost all the rules (including the supracompactness) suggested for nonmonotonic inference relations in the literature hold in it. We prove that this nonmonotonic inference frame is strictly correspendent with multiple belief revision operation. On the basis of this result we analyse a speci c paradigm of defult theory which satis es all the rules under consideration and discuss limitations of methods based on consequence relations for the study of nonmonotonic reasoning.
