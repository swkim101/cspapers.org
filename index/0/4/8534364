In wave-variable-based teleoperation systems, the perceived force at the master side is biased due to the nature of wave-variable-based communication. This paper proposes an augmented wave-variable-based approach that can partially cancel the bias portion and improve the fidelity of force feedback significantly. In this approach, the returning wave is augmented by the velocities of the both sides of the communication channel. The steady-state position tracking is not affected by the modification. Passivity of the new teleoperation scheme can be obtained by tuning the bandwidth of a low-pass filter. Hence stability is always achievable. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme.
