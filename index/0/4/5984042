We discuss different strategies for smoothing the phrasetable in Statistical MT, and give results over a range of translation settings. We show that any type of smoothing is a better idea than the relative-frequency estimates that are often used. The best smoothing techniques yield consistent gains of approximately 1% (absolute) according to the BLEU metric.
