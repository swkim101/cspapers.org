With the strategic early adoption of IT infrastructure technologies such as the broadband and the CDMA wireless communication in Korea, IT industry has been the major contributor to the recent Korean economic growth, accounting for 15.8% of the real GDP in 2005.In 2004, Korean Ministry of Information and Communication has established the so-called IT839 strategy as its new IT initiative. IT839 means 8 new IT services which will be deployed within the next three to four years so that service operators invest on 3 new wireless broadband and secure communication infrastructures to offer high-quality ubiquitous service. For rich user experience, 9 hardware and software component industries are defined as the growth engine. The total twenty industry sectors of the IT839 strategy form the IT industry value chain.In 2005, Korean Ministry of Information and Communication updated its IT839 structure by replacing some of its components to explicitly address the u-Korea framework.This IT839 strategy will contribute not only to IT industry but bring qualitative changes to the economic and social paradigm. It ultimately aims to realize a ubiquitous world by forming a virtuous circle of developing new services, infrastructure, and growth engines.To sustain the current momentum, Korea must become proactive in the global collaboration. Korean Ministry of Information and Communication invests in drawing leading global IT companies into Korea for cooperation with Korea R&D partners. During the past two years, twelve global companies established local R&D laboratories in Korea with partial funding from Korean government.
