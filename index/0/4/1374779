Unlike regular interfaces on touch screens or desktop computers, tangible user interfaces allow for more physically rich interactions that better uses the capacity of our motor system. On the flipside, the physicality of tangibles comes with rigidity. This makes it hard to (1) use tangibles on systems that require a variety of controls and interaction styles, and (2) make changes to physical interfaces once manufactured. In my research, I explore techniques that allow users to reconfigure and fabricate tangible interfaces in order to mitigate these issues.
