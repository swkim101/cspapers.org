At last year's SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, we were struck by three things. First, many people were struggling with how to best teach introductory computer science to a population that is predominantly not potential computer science majors (1). Second, there is great value in the exchange of information about how we are attacking the problem, why we chose this path, and how we feel it's working (2). Third, motivation is a key element in learning (3). Many things we heard last year acted as a catalyst for us to make some changes in the core computer science course (Comp Sci 100) at the Air Force Academy. In this paper, we discuss these changes and offer a candid, but preliminary, evaluation of our success in serving the needs of a large and diverse student population.
