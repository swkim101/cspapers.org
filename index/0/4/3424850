We present a new scaling algorithm for maximum (or minimum) weight perfect matching on general, edge weighted graphs. Our algorithm runs in O(m√nlog(nN)) time, O(m√ n) per scale, which matches the running time of the best cardinality matching algorithms on sparse graphs [16, 20, 36, 37]. Here, m,n, and N bound the number of edges, vertices, and magnitude, respectively, of any integer edge weight. Our result improves on a 25-year-old algorithm of Gabow and Tarjan, which runs in O(m√nlog nα (m,n) log(nN)) time.
