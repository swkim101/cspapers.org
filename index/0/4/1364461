This paper proposes a path planning algorithm and a velocity control algorithm for underwater gliders to persistently monitor a patch of ocean. The algorithms address a pressing need among ocean scientists to collect high-value data for studying ocean events of scientific and environmental interest, such as the occurrence of harmful algal blooms. The path planner optimizes a cost function that blends two competing factors: it maximizes the information value of the path, while minimizing the deviation from the path due to ocean currents. The speed control algorithm then optimizes the speed along the planned path so that higher resolution samples are collected in areas of higher information value. The resulting paths are closed circuits that can be repeatedly traversed to collect long term ocean data in dynamic environments. The algorithms were tested during sea trials on an underwater glider operating off the coast of southern California over the course of several weeks. The results show significant improvements in data resolution and path reliability compared to a sampling path that is typically used in the region.
