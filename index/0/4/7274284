One of the main objections to existing proposals for key escrow is that the individual's privacy relies on too high a level of trust in the law enforcement agencies. In particular, even if the government is trustworthy today, it may be replaced by an un-trustworthy government tomorrow which could immediately and suddenly recover the secret keys of all users. \Partial key escrow" was suggested to address this concern, in the context of DES keys. Only some part of a user key is escrowed, so that the authority must make a computational e(cid:11)ort to (cid:12)nd the rest. We extend this idea and provide schemes to perform partial key escrow in a veri(cid:12)able manner in a public-key encryption setting. We uncover some subtle issues which must be addressed for any partial key escrow scheme to be secure, the most important of which is the danger of early recovery. We show that other proposals for veri(cid:12)able partial key escrow su(cid:11)er from the early recovery problem, and thus do not in fact o(cid:11)er an advantage over standard key-escrow schemes. Our veri(cid:12)able partial key escrow scheme for the Di(cid:14)e-Hellman cryptosystem does not su(cid:11)er from early recovery. Political debate will not make the user versus law-enforcement con(cid:13)ict on privacy vanish. Today we are seeing corporations, pushed by their business needs, ready to accept some form of key escrow. The realistic and urgent question is to (cid:12)nd the form which guarantees the most privacy. Our schemes are candidates.
