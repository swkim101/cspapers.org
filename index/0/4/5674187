For many distributed applications, it is not sufficient for programs to be logically correct. In addition, they must satisfy various timing constraints. This paper discusses primitives that support the construction of distributed real-time programs. Our discussion is focused in two areas: timing specification and communication. To allow the specifications of timing constraints, we introduce the language constructs for defining temporal scope and specifying message deadline. We also identify communication primitives needed for real-time programming. The issues underlying the selection of the primitives are explained, including handling of timing exceptions. The primitives will eventually be provided as part of a distributed programming system that will be used to construct distributed multi-sensory systems.
