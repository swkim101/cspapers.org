With the development of Semantic Web in recent years, an increasing amount of semantic data has been created in form of Resource Description Framework (RDF). Current visualization techniques help users quickly understand the underlying RDF data by displaying its structure in an overview. However, detailed information can only be accessed by further navigation. An alternative approach is to display the global context as well as the local details simultaneously in a unified view. This view supports the visualization and navigation on RDF data in an integrated way. In this demonstration, we present ZoomRDF, a framework that: i) adapts a space-optimized visualization algorithm for RDF, which allows more resources to be displayed, thus maximizes the utilization of display space, ii) combines the visualization with a fisheye zooming concept, which assigns more space to some individual nodes while still preserving the overview structure of the data, iii) considers both the importance of resources and the user interaction on them, which offers more display space to those elements the user may be interested in. We implement the framework based on the Gene Ontology and demonstrate that it facilitates tasks like RDF data exploration and editing.
