Packet collisions have gone from something to be avoided to something that can be embraced. We build upon recent results that employ intentional packet collisions for synchronized flooding to show how multi-hop wireless networks can support real-time actuation and control. First, we show how a network of nodes can synchronize their LED transmissions to extend the range of a visual light communication (VLC) system. Second, we show how buffer-free, streaming audio is possible over a multi-hop wireless mesh network.
