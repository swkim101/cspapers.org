This paper introduces IQPs (Integer Quadratic Programs) as a way to model joint inference for the task of concept recognition in clinical domain. IQPs make it possible to easily incorporate soft constraints in the optimization framework and still support exact global inference. We show that soft constraints give statistically significant performance improvements when compared to hard constraints.
