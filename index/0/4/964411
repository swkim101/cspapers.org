Recently, computer security has come to the forefront of public awareness. With the onslaught of worms such as Code Red, national (U.S.) concern has increased about cyber terrorism and the information infrastructure. One educational response has been the emergence of a number of computer security degree programs - at the undergraduate level, e.g., East Stroudsburg State University of PA, and at the graduate level, e.g., the Heinz School at Carnegie-Mellon University.The panel members were all participants in the Cyber security faculty development Workshop[1] held at Indiana University of PA in August, 2001. Among the goals of the workshop was the development of courses that would teach the theory and application of security, including the use of specially designed (quarantined) "attack" and "defend" computer labs. Additional goals include development of modules related to security for CS core courses, and an interdisciplinary minor for Computer Science and Criminology majors.It was the consensus of the panel participants that many institutions would be unable to implement special degree programs or tracks, and, in a significant number of cases, might be unable to immediately implement even one specialized course. Yet, all the participants also believed strongly that security-related content in our computer courses can, and should, be improved. Even if no security-based courses are added, major and non-major courses in computer science, CIS, etc., can do a better job of raising awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, and risks.Each panel member will address a specific course or sub discipline and describe how security was infused or added to the current curriculum. The intent is to foster discussion regarding appropriateness and pedagogy while relating individual experiences, successes and failures. Audience and panel members will be encouraged to discuss the relative merits of this approach.
