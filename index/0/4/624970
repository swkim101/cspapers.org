This work proposes an approach to manipulate unknown objects based on tactile information. The manipulation can have three goals: the optimization of the hand configuration, the optimization of the grasp quality and the optimization of the object configuration. Three different motion strategies are introduced in order to move the fingers trying to deal with each of the three goals. The strategies can be applied independently or combined in a sequential way. The feasibility of the motion strategies was proven in real experimentation using the Schunk Dexterous Hand SDH2.
