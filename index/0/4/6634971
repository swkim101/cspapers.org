An analogy between the dynamics of a cart-pole system and vehicle rollover dynamics is used to derive a controller for tipping up and stabilizing a planar model of a passenger vehicle near rollover by controlling lateral tire friction forces. The controller is based on a previously published controller for stabilizing a cart-pole using partial feedback linearization and energy shaping. A necessary condition for tip-up is given based on the surface friction coefficient and the location of the vehicle center of gravity (c.g.). A multi-body vehicle model with suspension is presented in the form of the robotic manipulator equations. Simulation results are presented demonstrating the effect of friction and suspension properties on the tip-up problem.
