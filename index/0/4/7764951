This idea introduces a tilting angle amplification system for the cable planar parallel robots. The end-effector rotation capability is increased by adding a serial linkage to the parallel platform. The hybrid serial-parallel robot has the features of both of the parallel manipulator and the serial manipulator. The manipulator is modeled in terms of full dynamics using Newton-Euler and Lagrange methods based analytical approaches.
