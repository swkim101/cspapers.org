As emerging Software Product Line (SPL) technologies have evolved, Model-Driven Development (MDD) has remained an under-served part of the SPL portfolio development lifecycle, making it difficult to simultaneously leverage the benefits of both practices. The Telelogic Rhapsody®/BigLever Gears™ Bridge is the industry's first solution to provide fully integrated MDD and SPL technologies. With the Bridge's innovative capabilities, you can achieve new levels of efficiency by utilizing: (1) Rhapsody MDD models, rather than working with conventional source code, and (2) Gears' SPL consolidation, first-class model variation points, and automated production capabilities -- rather than creating "clone-and-own" copies of MDD models for each product or building "one-size-fits-all" models for all products. This increased efficiency enables you to deliver more new products and features faster, while reducing the development effort and optimizing product quality.
