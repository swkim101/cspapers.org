Many learning-to-rank~(LtR) algorithms focus on query-independent model, in which query and document do not lie in the same feature space, and the rankers rely on the feature ensemble about query-document pair instead of the similarity between query instance and documents. However, existing algorithms do not consider local structures in query-document feature space, and are fragile to irrelevant noise features. In this paper, we propose a novel Riemannian metric learning algorithm to capture the local structures and develop a robust LtR algorithm. First, we design a concept called ideal candidate document to introduce metric learning algorithm to query-independent model. Previous metric learning algorithms aiming to find an optimal metric space are only suitable for query-dependent model, in which query instance and documents belong to the same feature space and the similarity is directly computed from the metric space. Then we extend the new and extremely fast global Geometric Mean Metric Learning (GMML) algorithm to develop a localized GMML, namely L-GMML. Based on the combination of local learned metrics, we employ the popular Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain~(NDCG) scorer and Weighted Approximate Rank Pairwise~(WARP) loss to optimize the ideal candidate document for each query candidate set. Finally, we can quickly evaluate all candidates via the similarity between the ideal candidate document and other candidates. By leveraging the ability of metric learning algorithms to describe the complex structural information, our approach gives us a principled and efficient way to perform LtR tasks. The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed L-GMML algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art metric learning to rank methods and the stylish query-independent LtR algorithms regarding accuracy and computational efficiency.
