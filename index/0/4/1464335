Properties of ensemble classification can be studied using the framework of Monte Carlo stochastic algorithms. Within this framework it is also possible to define a new ensemble classifier, whose accuracy probability distribution can be computed exactly. This paper has two goals: first, an experimental comparison between the theoretical predictions and experimental results; second, a systematic comparison between bagging and Monte Carlo ensemble classification.
