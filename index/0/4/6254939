In <italic>O(n</italic> log <italic>n)</italic> time we compute a triangulation with <italic>O(n)</italic> new points, and no obtuse triangles, that has length within a constant factor of the minimum possible. We also approximate the minimum weight Steiner triangulation using triangulations with no sharp angles. No previous polyonomial time triangulation achieved an approximation factor better than <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>).
