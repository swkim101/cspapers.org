Web search results often integrate content from specialized corpora known as verticals. Given a query, one important aspect of aggregated search is the selection of relevant verticals from a set of candidate verticals. One drawback to previous approaches to vertical selection is that methods have not explicitly modeled user feedback. However, production search systems often record a variety of feedback information. In this paper, we present algorithms for vertical selection which adapt to user feedback. We evaluate algorithms using a novel simulator which models performance of a vertical selector situated in realistic query traffic.
