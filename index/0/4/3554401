SOFIS is a software system intended for processing of statistical data in national statistical information systems. The data base management system (DBMS) of SOFIS has been designed to meet two objectives: to process efficiently separate voluminous files resulting from statistical surveys and at the same time to provide the possibility of complex exploitation of data bases consisting Of these files, i.e. the materialisation of relations among data, up to the network structure of these relations. In this paper, we present the architecture of SOFIS DBMS. It is essentially a file management system with a relational interface, equipped with a data dictionary/directory system. The modular structure of SOFIS DBMS permits, as indicated in this paper, its gradual implementation in the statistical information system.
