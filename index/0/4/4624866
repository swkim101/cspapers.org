Fast-growing high-throughput applications, such as web services, are characterized by high-concurrency processing, hard real-time response, and high-bandwidth memory access. The newly-born applications bring severe challenges to processors in datacenters, both in concurrent processing performance and energy efficiency. To offer a satisfactory quality of services, it is of critical importance to meet these newly emerging demands of high-throughput applications in the future datacenters in a more efficient way. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, called SmarCo, which allows high-throughput applications to be processed more efficiently in datacenters. Based on the dominant characteristics of high-throughput applications, we implement large-scale many-core architecture with in-pair threads to support high-concurrency processing; we also introduce a hierarchical ring topology and laxity-aware task scheduler to guarantee hard real-time response; furthermore, we propose high-throughput datapath to improve memory access efficiency. We verify the efficiency of SmarCo by using simulators, large-scale FPGA and prototype with TSMC 40-nm technology node. The experimental results show that, compared to Intel Xeon E7-8890V4, SmarCo achieves 10.11X performance improvement and 6.95X energy-efficiency improvement with higher throughput and a better guarantee of real-time response.
