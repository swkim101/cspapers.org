In micromanipulation, lots of methods have been developed to manipulate objects in microscale. However, few of them can be applied in both the transportation and the rotation of the micro objects. In this paper, we present a novel method to realize the non-contact transportation and rotation of the micro objects based on the vibration-induced swirl flow. A piezo actuator is set between the glass needle and a metal rod. The sine wave with controlled frequency and amplitude is input into the piezo actuator to drive the glass needle to move circularly, which is caused by resonance of the actuator and the metal rod. We place the glass needle under water and keep a limited distance to the bottom. The circular vibration of the glass needle can generate a swirl flow and low pressure around it. The low pressure can trap and transport the micro objects vertically to the glass needle, and the swirl flow can rotate the objects continuously. Finally, we realize the trap and rotation of micro object with only one piezo actuator. Experiments of transportation and rotation of microbeads are carried out, and the results demonstrate it is a simple, low-cost, effective micromanipulation method.
