Administrative rights are more powerful permissions and checking accountability of execution of admin rights is an important security measure. Most of the administrative RBAC models distribute rights to multiple administrators. Though such decentralized security management has difficulties in checking admin accountability, it is more efficient compared to centralized approach, particularly in large organizations. We introduced administrative obligations in ARBAC as a way to improve the accountability of admin users in the decentralized systems. The proposed approach would reduce the potential of security risk and improve accountability of security administrators. As the cloud and mobile applications are becoming integral part of business information systems, ensuring the accountability of admins play a vital role in system security. Obligations are well studied feature in the security literature and adding them into security administration would open up many possibilities for future developments in this direction.
