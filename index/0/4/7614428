The role of Web search queries has been demonstrated in the extraction of attributes of instances and classes, or of sets of related instances and their class labels. This paper explores the acquisition of opendomain commonsense knowledge, usually available as factual knowledge, from Web search queries. Similarly to previous work in open-domain information extraction, knowledge extracted from text - in this case, from queries - takes the form of lexicalized assertions associated with open-domain classes. Experimental results indicate that facts extracted from queries complement, and have competitive accuracy levels relative to, facts extracted from Web documents by previous methods.
