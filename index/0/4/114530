We provide techniques to help vendors, independent testing agencies, and others verify critical security properties in direct recording electronic (DRE) voting machines. We rely on specific hardware functionality, isolation, and architectural decision to allow one to easily verify these critical security properties; we believe our techniques will help us verify other properties as well. Verification of these security properties is one step towards a fully verified voting machine, and helps the public gain confidence in a critical tool for democracy. We present a voting system design and discuss our experience building a prototype implementation based on the design in Java and C.
