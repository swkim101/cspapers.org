This paper examines the applicability and benefits of various data compression techniques to a large bibliographic database that forms the core of The University of California's public access on-line Union Catalog. Particular attention is given to the interplay between compression and retrieval, and to the feasibility of implementing high performance Huffman coding algorithms in microcode.
