In this poster, we propose an emotion analysis method using context information gathered from sensor data. We observe that there are certain situations in which a specific emotion is strongly felt, i.e. dominant. We develop a "scenario-based" approach that focuses on creating such situations with dominant emotion, using a set of context information from sensor data. These "scenarios" undergo validation process through a preliminary survey. Finally, an application prototype detects these scenarios to return the analyzed emotion to the user.
