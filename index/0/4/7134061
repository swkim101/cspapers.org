The augmented data manipulator (ADM) is a multistage interconnection network designed for large-scale, parallel processing systems. This paper is an extension of an earlier work in which the use of the inverse ADM (IADM) network in an MIMD environment was investigated. Dynamically rerouting messages to avoid busy or faulty links is explored for both the ADM and IADM networks. Several schemes are presented. In some cases, there is no increase in tag overhead, but the switching elements are more complex. In other cases, the size of the routing tag is increased by one bit, but the switching elements are not as complex. A new broadcasting capability is developed that allows one processor to send a message to any number of other processors (with some restriction on the destination addresses). Finally, a scheme for dynamically rerouting a broadcast message is presented.
