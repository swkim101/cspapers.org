This paper discusses the functionality of GraphicsMentor. GraphicsMentor permits a student to modify many parameters of the camera, objects, and light sources interactively, and to visualize the rendered result on-the-fly. It also supports basic keyframe animation. With GraphicsMentor, a student should be able to grasp the fundamentals of computer graphics quickly and easily in a learning-by-doing way.
