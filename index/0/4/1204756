Previous work on dependency parsing used various kinds of combination models but a systematic analysis and comparison of these approaches is lacking. In this paper we implemented such a study for English dependency parsing and find several non-obvious facts: (a) the diversity of base parsers is more important than complex models for learning (e.g., stacking, supervised meta-classification), (b) approximate, linear-time re-parsing algorithms guarantee well-formed dependency trees without significant performance loss, and (c) the simplest scoring model for re-parsing (unweighted voting) performs essentially as well as other more complex models. This study proves that fast and accurate ensemble parsers can be built with minimal effort.
