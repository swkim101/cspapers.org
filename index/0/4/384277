We define and study a geometric graph over points in the plane that captures the local behavior of Delaunay triangulations of points on smooth surfaces in IR<sup>3</sup>. Two points in a planar point set <i>P</i> are neighbors in the <i>empty-ellipse graph</i> if they lie on an axis-aligned ellipse with no point of <i>P</i> in its interior. The empty-ellipse graph can be a clique in the worst case, but it is usually much less dense. Specifically, the empty-ellipse graph of <i>n</i> points has complexity Θ(Δ<i>n</i>) in the worst case, where Δ is the ratio between the largest and smallest pairwise distances. For points generated uniformly at random in a rectangle, the empty-ellipse graph has expected complexity Θ(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>). As an application of our proof techniques, we show that the Delaunay triangulation of <i>n</i> random points on a circular cylinder has expected complexity Θ(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>).
