CoDecide is an experimental user interface toolkit that offers an extension to spreadsheet concepts specifically geared towards support for cooperative analysis of the kinds of multi-dimensional data encountered in data warehousing. It is distinguished from previous proposals by direct support for drill-down/roll-up analysis without redesign of an interface; more importantly, CoDecide can link multiple views on a data cube for synchronous or asynchronoous cooperation by multiple analysts, through a conceptual model visualizing the problem dimensions on so-called tapes. Tapes generalize the ideas of ranging and pivoting in current data warehouses for the multi-perspective and multi-user case. CoDecide allows the rapid composition of multi-matrix interfaces and their linkage to underlying data sources. A LAN version of CoDecide has been used in a number of design decision support applications. A WWW version representing externally materialized views on databases is currently under development.
