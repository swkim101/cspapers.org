While world knowledge has been shown to improve learning-based coreference resolvers, the improvements were typically obtained by incorporating world knowledge into a fairly weak baseline resolver. Hence, it is not clear whether these benefits can carry over to a stronger baseline. Moreover, since there has been no attempt to apply different sources of world knowledge in combination to coreference resolution, it is not clear whether they offer complementary benefits to a resolver. We systematically compare commonly-used and under-investigated sources of world knowledge for coreference resolution by applying them to two learning-based coreference models and evaluating them on documents annotated with two different annotation schemes.
