In 1980 B. Monien and E. Speckenmeyer ([ll]) proved that satisfiability of a propositional formula consisting of K clauses can be checked in time of the order 2K’3. Recently 0. KuIlmann and H. Luckhardt ([S]) proved the bound 2L’g, where L is the length of the input formula. The algorithms leading to these bounds (like many other SAT algorithms) are based on splitting, i.e., they reduce SAT for a formula F to SAT for several simpler formulas Fl, Fz, . . . , F,. These algorithms simplify each of FI, Fz, . . . , F, according to some transformation rules such as the elimination of pure literals, the unit propagation rule etc. In this paper we present a new transformation rule and two algorithms using this rule. These algorithms have the bounds 2°.30897K and 2°.‘0537L respectively.
