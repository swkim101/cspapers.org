We are demonstrating the Demeter Tools/C++, a CASE researchprototype developed at Northeastern University, including thelatest tools described in papers presented at ECOOP 91, ER 90, CSM89 and OOPSLA 89 and in the Software Engineering Journal(1991).
The Demeter system has been under development since 1985 and hasbeen regularly used and refined with support from companies such asIBM, Mettler- Toledo and SAIC.
Demeter Tools/C++ consists of the following tools:<br>
1. Design level (programming language independent):<br>
<ul><li>cddraw: to draw a class dictionary</li><li>learn: Learns class dictionary for object examples</li><li>optimize: Optimizes class dictionary</li><li>sem-check: Checks class dictionary for violations and proposeschanges to the class dictionary</li><li>parse-generate, run-parser: Checks conformance between classdictionary and objects</li><li>cd-compare: Compares two class dictionaries</li><li>cd-abstract: Finds the largest class dictionary</li><li style="list-style: none">common to both input classdictionaries</li><li>xref: Draws a graphical representation of a classdictionary</li></ul><br>2. Generation level (C++ specific):<br><ul><li>generate: Generates C++ class library from input classdictionary</li><li>propagate: Generates C++ member functions from propagationpattern</li><li>headers: Generate C++ function interfaces fromimplementation</li></ul><br> 3. Implementation level (C++ specific):<br><ul><li>Class library of predefined member functions for objectmanipulation (e.g., reading, writing, drawing, accessing,etc.)</li></ul><br><br>
