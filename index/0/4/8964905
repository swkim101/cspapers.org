In the context of low-power wireless sensor networks, this paper presents multi-hop network tomography (MNT), a novel, non-intrusive algorithm for reconstructing the path, the per-hop arrival order, and the per-hop arrival time of individual packets at runtime. While explicitly transmitting this information over the radio would negatively impact the performance of the system under investigation, information is instead reconstructed after packets have been received at the sink.
