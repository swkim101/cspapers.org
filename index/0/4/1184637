The Universum sample, which is defined as the sample that doesn't belong to any of the classes the learning task concerns, has been proved to be helpful in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. The former works treat the Universum samples equally. Our research found that not all the Universum samples are helpful, and we propose a method to pick the informative ones, i.e., in-between Universum samples. We also set up a new semi-supervised framework to incorporate the in-between Universum samples. Empirical experiments show that our method outperforms the former ones.
