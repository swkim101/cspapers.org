Previous research in wireless ad hoc networks typically assumes the use of omnidirectional antennas at all nodes. With omnidirectional antennas, while two nodes are communicating using a given channel, MAC protocols such as IEEE 802.11 require all other nodes in the vicinity to stay silent. With directional antennas, two pairs of nodes located in each other's vicinity may potentially communicate simultaneously, depending on the directions of transmission. This can increase spatial reuse of the wireless channel. In addition, the higher gain of directional antennas allows a node to communicate with other nodes located far away, implying that messages could be delivered to the destination in fewer hops. In this paper, we propose a MAC protocol that exploits the characteristics of directional antennas. Our design focuses on using multi-hop RTSs to establish links between distant nodes, and then transmit CTS, DATA and ACK over a single hop. Results show that our directional MAC protocol can perform better than IEEE 802.11, although we find that the performance is dependent on the topology configuration and the flow patterns in the system.
