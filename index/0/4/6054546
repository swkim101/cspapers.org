The classical multiwinner rules are designed for particular purposes. For example, variants of k - Borda are used to ﬁnd k best competitors in judging contests while the Chamberlin-Courant rule is used to select a diverse set of k products. These rules represent two extremes of the multiwinner world. At times, however, one might need to ﬁnd an appropriate trade-off between these two extremes. We explore continuous transitions from k -Borda to Chamberlin-Courant and study intermediate rules.
