Totsuka, Kanagawa, Omika and Musashi Works of Hitachi Limited have developed CAD (Computer Aided Design) systems for electronic parts and equipment. Also Hitachi Central Laboratory and Hitachi Laboratory, which are engaged in basic and application research, have developed CAD systems for other purposes.
 As these systems are designed exclusively for particular products and research objects, it is difficult to describe a representative CAD system of Hitachi Limited.
 This paper describes the WIDAS, which is one of the subsystems of the CAD system developed by the Totsuka Works for ESS (Electronic Switching System).
