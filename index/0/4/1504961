Combinatorial Complexity of the Central Curve Peter A. Beling* Sushil Vermat We study certain combhatorial properties of the centraJ curve szsociated with interior point methods for linear optimization. The central curve forms the basis for a large class of interior point algorithms, most of which follow the central curve in discrete steps. In the context of convex quadratic programming, the number of discrete steps needed to follow the central curve to its conclusion is known to be bounded by a polynomial in the size of the problem data. Rather than studying a discretization scheme, we examine the central curve directly. A measure of complexity for the curve is defined in terms of the number of turns it makes with respect to an arbitrary coordinate system. An average case analysis of this measure is performed for a large class of linear complement arity problems. We show that under a mild transversity condition the expected number of turns taken by the central curve is bounded by nz – n, where the expectation is taken with respect to a sign-invariant probability distribution on the problem data. As an alternative messure of complexity, we also consider the number of times the central curve intersects with a wide class of algebraic hypersurfaces, including such objects ss spheres and boxes. As an example of the results obtained, we show that the primal and dual variables in each coordinate of the central curve cross each other at most once, on average. As a further example, we show that the central curve intersects any sphere centered at the ●Department of Systems Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903.
