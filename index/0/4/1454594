We describe an automatic Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) system that disambiguates verb senses using syntactic and semantic features that encode information about predicate arguments and semantic classes. Our system performs at the best published accuracy on the English verbs of Senseval-2. We also experiment with using the gold-standard predicate-argument labels from PropBank for disambiguating fine-grained WordNet senses and course-grained PropBank framesets, and show that disambiguation of verb senses can be further improved with better extraction of semantic roles.
