We propose a convex optimization based strategy to deal with uncertainty in the observations of a classification problem. We assume that instead of a sample (xi, yi) a distribution over (xi, yi) is specified. In particular, we derive a robust formulation when the distribution is given by a normal distribution. It leads to Second Order Cone Programming formulation. Our method is applied to the problem of missing data, where it outperforms direct imputation.
