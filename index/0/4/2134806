CUE, an input interface system which permits the computer to utilize natural but restricted English as input, is presented. In addition, an experimental model for CUE, Proto-RELADES, which can "understand" and execute English sentences about the content of the library at IBM's Boston Programming Center is described. These sentences can be query, command, or conditional sentences. The linguistic component of the system is based on a transformational grammar of English that performs a full syntactic and semantic analysis of each input sentence and translates it into relevant computer operations. The capabilities and limitations of this system are described.
