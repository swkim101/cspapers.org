Analogical reasoning is the method by which solutions to old problems are adapted to solve new problems. In this paper we illustrate how analogy can be used in a non-trivial problem solving domain. Though we restrict ourselves here to the domain of computer programming, we argue that the principal idea is applicable to a broad class of problem solving situations.
