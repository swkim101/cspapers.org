People often like to express their unique personalities, interests, and opinions. This poster explores new ways that allow a user to express her feelings in both physical and virtual settings. With our Tweeting Halo, we demonstrate how a wearable lightweight projector can be used for self-expression very much like a hairstyle, makeup or a T-shirt imprint. Our current prototype allows a user to post a message physically above their head and virtually on Twitter at the same time. We also explore simple ways that will allow physical followers of the Tweeting Halo user to easily become virtual followers by simply taking a snapshot of her projected tweet with a mobile device such as a camera phone. In this extended abstract we present our current prototype, and the results of a design critique we performed using it.
