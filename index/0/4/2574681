This paper proves the correctness of a translation from HISEL, a relational database query language, to HI, a hierarchical query language.The four components of Morris' [7] program are established. Appropriate semantics for the two languages are defined. A translation function is defined and an L-attributed grammar capturing the translation function is exhibited. The transformation of database trees into database relations is specified.
