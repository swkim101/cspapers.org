Euclidean spanners are important data structures in geometric algorithm design, because they provide a means of approximating the complete Euclidean graph with only O(n) edges, so that the shortest path length between each pair of points is not more than a constant factor longer than the Euclidean distance between the points. In many applications of spanners, it is important that the spanner possess a number of additional properties: low tot al edge weight, bounded degree, and low diameter. Existing research on spanners has considered one property or the other. We show that it is possible to build spanners in optimal O (n log n) time and O(n) space that achieve optimal or near optimal tradeoffs between all combinations of these *Max-Planck-Institut fiir Informatik, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany.

We achieve these results in large part because of a new structure, called the dumbbell tree which provides a method of decomposing a spanner into a constant number of trees, so that each of the O(n2) spanner paths is mapped entirely to a path in one of these trees.
