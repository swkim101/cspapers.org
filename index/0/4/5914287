This paper presents a statistical model which trains from a corpus annotated with Part Of Speech tags and assigns them to previously unseen text with state of the art accuracy The model can be classi ed as a Maximum Entropy model and simultaneously uses many contextual features to predict the POS tag Furthermore this paper demonstrates the use of specialized fea tures to model di cult tagging decisions discusses the corpus consistency problems discovered during the implementation of these features and proposes a training strategy that mitigates these problems
