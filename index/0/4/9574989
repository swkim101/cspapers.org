With the popularity of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, the amount of useful data in these sources is rapidly increasing, making them promising places for information acquisition. This research aims at the customized organization of a social media corpus using focused topic hierarchy. It organizes the contents into different structures to meet with users' different information needs (e.g., "iPhone 5 problem" or "iPhone 5 camera"). To this end, we introduce a novel function to measure the likelihood of a topic hierarchy, by which the users' information need can be incorporated into the process of topic hierarchy construction. Using the structure information within the generated topic hierarchy, we then develop a probability based model to identify the representative contents for topics to assist users in document retrieval on the hierarchy. Experimental results on real world data illustrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods for both information organization and retrieval tasks.
