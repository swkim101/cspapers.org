In this paper, given the scenario of a mobile sensing system for air pollution monitoring, we aim at the cause and influence of delay effect on measurement and present a filter-based solution to calibrate the sensing data. We also validate the idea and solution by a real-data experiment. It indicates that the solution decreases deviation on spatial measurement and can be applied in mobile sensing systems to improve the sensing data quality.
