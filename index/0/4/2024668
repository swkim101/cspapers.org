In a mam memory database (WB), the primary copy of the database may be stored in a volatile memory When a crash occurs, a reload of the database from archive memory to main memory must be performed. It is essential that an efficient reload scheme be used to ensure that the expectations of high performance database systems are met. This implies that the overall performance measures of any potential reload algorithm should not be measured simply by reload time, but by its impact on overall system performance. This paper presents four different reload algorithms that aim at fast response time of transactions and high throughput of the overall system, Simulation studies comparing the algorithms indicate that the best overall approach is one based on frequency of access.
