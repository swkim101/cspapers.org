We investigate Global Index Grammars (GIGs), a grammar formalism that uses a stack of indices associated with productions and has restricted context-sensitive power. We discuss some of the structural descriptions that GIGs can generate compared with those generated by LIGs. We show also how GIGs can represent structural descriptions corresponding to HPSGs (Pollard and Sag, 1994) schemas.
