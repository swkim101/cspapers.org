Along with the development of microchip and sensing technologies, more and more Context-Aware applications have been introduced to our daily life to engage us in information-rich environments. Unlike many desktop applications, Context-Aware applications have usually been used to support users in dynamic situations by utilizing many resources available through physical environments. This research takes a user's perspective on Context-Aware activities, to focus on user's motivation and perception among dynamic surroundings, and aims to demonstrate the role and importance of user involvement for Context-Aware services.
