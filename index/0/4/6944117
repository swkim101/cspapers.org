We examine the problem of routing wires on a VLSI chip, where the pins to be connected are arranged in a regular rectangular array. We obtain tight bounds for the worst-case "channel-width" needed to route an n Ã— n array, and develop provably good heuristics for the general case. An interesting "rounding algorithm" for obtaining integral approximations to solutions of linear equations is used to show the near-optimality of single-turn routings in the worst-case.
