This paper presents the EXMalgorithm, which locates multiple logic design errors in a combinational circuit with multiple output. An error possibility index and a six-valued simulation method have been introduced to reduce the number of error candidates without missing real errors. Experimental results have shown that this algorithm locates all errors at high hit ratio for benchmark circuits.
