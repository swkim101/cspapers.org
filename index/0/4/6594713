Not only are the two problems inherently correlated and often appear concurrently, they are also exacerbated by incomplete data. We develop a novel algorithm to solve these two problems jointly under a unified framework, which helps reduce the impact of graph noise and benefits both tasks individually. We reduce multi-label learning problem into an additional link prediction task and solve both problems with marginalized denoising, which we co-regularize with Laplacian smoothing. This approach combines both learning tasks into a single convex objective function, which we optimize efficiently with iterative closed-form updates. The resulting approach performs significantly better than prior work on several important real-world applications with great consistency.
