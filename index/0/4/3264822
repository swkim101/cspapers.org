This paper presents a method for the automatic extraction of subgrammars to control and speeding-up natural language generation NLG. The method is based on explanation-based learning EBL. The main advantage for the proposed new method for NLG is that the complexity of the grammatical decision making process during NLG can be vastly reduced, because the EBL method supports the adaption of a NLG system to a particular use of a language.
