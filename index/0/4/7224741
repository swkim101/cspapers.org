Architectures are the structuring paradigms of software systems. Envisioning a product family involves creating an appropriate architecture. This is one of the weakest areas in current software development processes. Designing these architectures involves an interplay between technical understanding and artistry. A handbook is an expression of the knowledge, understanding and agreement of a professional community. We are experimenting with community-building, and with technical ideas, by attempting to write a handbook before it is time. The community for the current handbook is a group of colleagues and students, and a looser network of participants in workshops and interviews and discussions (some by email), and authors (of books and papers we read). It is very much a " work-in-progress. " Another direction is to collaborate with designers and architects in closer working teams, especially in large companies, to shift the culture in order to value and work more at the architectural level. This organizational development work is still in the conceptual stage, but we long to do more of it. The main body of the Handbook contains three sections on components and structures, three sections on properties and principles, and a collection of system descriptions.
