This paper considers the design of state estimators for dynamic balancing systems using a Linear Inverted Pendulum model with unknown modeling errors such as a center of mass measurement offset or an external force. A variety of process and output models are constructed and compared. For a system containing modeling error, it is shown that a naive estimator (one that doesn't account for this error) will result in inaccurate state estimates. These state estimators are evaluated on a force-controlled humanoid robot for a sinusoidal swaying task and a forward push recovery task.
