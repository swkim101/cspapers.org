We consider the problem of determining robot manipulation plans when sensing and control uncertainties are specified as conditional probability densities. Traditional approaches are usually based on worst-case error analysis in a methodology known as preimage backchaining. We have developed a general framework for determining sensor-based robot plans by blending ideas from stochastic optimal control and dynamic game theory with traditional preimage backchaining concepts. We argue that the consideration of a precise loss (or performance) functional is crucial to determining and evaluating manipulation plans in a probabilistic setting. We consequently introduce a stochastic, performance preimage that generalizes previous preimage notions. We also present some optimal strategies for planar manipulation tasks that were computed by a dynamic programming-based algorithm.<<ETX>>
