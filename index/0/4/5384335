One of the largest challenges facing educators teaching undergraduate software engineering courses is providing the students with meaningful experiences they will find useful when they complete their undergraduate education. Those experiences should include all phases of the software development process, and to be as realistic as possible they should also include the uncertainty and continual change present in any real project. In addition, those experiences need to include working with others in a team, which can affect the morale of some students and also poses challenges to the professor when the time to assign grades arrives. In this paper we discuss how we have tailored the software engineering capstone sequence at the U.S. Air Force Academy to address these issues.
