Academic computer science is at a critical juncture that offers both challenges and opportunities. More students than ever before are choosing to major in computer science and an even larger number of students are taking computer science courses in recognition of the fact that knowledge of computing is essential in the modern world. That interest, of course, is exciting. At the same time, most computer science departments are overwhelmed by the growing demand from students. In this talk, I draw on my own experience as a young faculty member in the similarly challenging 1980s to offer advice on how to make the most of the opportunities that are intrinsic to teaching in such a vibrant field.
