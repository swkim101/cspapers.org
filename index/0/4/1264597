In fields such as medicine, geography, and mechanics, spatial reasoning involves reasoning about entities—for example cavities and invading particles—that may coincide without overlapping. The purpose of this paper is to develop a mereotopology for domains that include coincident entities, such as material objects, holes, geopolitical entities and spatial regions. In addition, I construct mathematical models of this mereotopology in which nontrivial coincidence relations are defined.
