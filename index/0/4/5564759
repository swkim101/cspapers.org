This paper presents data about three facets of a recently-completed VLSI design containing 45000 transistors. The first set of data describes the mask-level features of the circuit, from which it is seen that almost all features have at least one small dimension. The second set of data analyzes the hierarchical cell structure used by the designers to specify the circuit. The measurements show that composite cells have a different structure from primitive cells, and that, outside of arrays, cells are rarely re-used. The third set of data concerns the usage of an interactive layout program during the circuit's design. In spite of the circuit's size, the most frequently invoked commands were all simple.
