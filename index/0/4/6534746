Supervised learning of a parts-based model can be formulated as an optimization problem with a large (exponential in the number of parts) set of constraints. We show how this seemingly difficult problem can be solved by (i) reducing it to an equivalent convex problem with a small, polynomial number of constraints (taking advantage of the fact that the model is tree-structured and the potentials have a special form); and (ii) obtaining the globally optimal model using an efficient dual decomposition strategy. Each component of the dual decomposition is solved by a modified version of the highly optimized SVM-Light algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we learn human upper body models using two challenging, publicly available datasets. Our model accounts for the articulation of humans as well as the occlusion of parts. We compare our method with a baseline iterative strategy as well as a state of the art algorithm and show significant efficiency improvements.
