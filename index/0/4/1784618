In this paper, we address the problem of classifying tweets into topical categories. Because of the short, noisy and ambiguous nature of tweets, we propose to collectively conduct the classification by exploiting the context information (i.e. related tweets) other than individually as in conventional text classification methods. In particular, we augment the content-based representation of text with tweets sharing same #hashtag or URL, which results in a tweet graph. We then formulate the tweet classification task under a graph optimization framework. We investigate three popular approaches, namely, Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP), Relaxation Labeling (RL), and Iterative Classification Algorithm (ICA). Extensive experiment results show that the graph-based tweet classification approach remarkably improves the performance, while the ICA model with relationship of sharing the same #hashtag gives the best result on separate tweet graph.
