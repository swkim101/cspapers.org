Hafez is an automatic poetry generation system that integrates a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a Finite State Accep-tor (FSA). It generates sonnets given arbitrary topics. Furthermore, Hafez enables users to revise and polish generated poems by adjusting various style conﬁgurations. Experiments demonstrate that such “pol-ish” mechanisms consider the user’s intention and lead to a better poem. For evaluation, we build a web interface where users can rate the quality of each poem from 1 to 5 stars. We also speed up the whole system by a factor of 10, via vocabulary pruning and GPU computation, so that adequate feedback can be collected at a fast pace. Based on such feedback, the system learns to adjust its parameters to improve poetry quality.
