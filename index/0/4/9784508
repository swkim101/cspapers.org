PageRank has been broadly applied to get credible rank sequences of nodes in many networks such as the web, citation networks, or online social networks. However, in the real world, it is usually hard to ascertain a complete structure of a network, particularly a large-scale one. Some researchers have begun to explore how to get a relatively accurate rank more efficiently. They have proposed some local approximation methods, which are especially designed for quickly estimating the PageRank value of a new node, after it is just added to the network. Yet, these local approximation methods rely on the link server too much, and it is difficult to use them to estimate rank sequences of nodes in a group. So we propose a new method called DIGRank, which uses global Degree to facilitate Ranking in an Incomplete Graph and which takes into account the frequent need for applications to rank users in a community, retrieve pages in a particular area, or mine nodes in a fractional or limited network. Based on experiments in small-world and scale-free networks generated by models, the DIGRank method performs better than other local estimation methods on ranking nodes in a given subgraph. In the models, it tends to perform best in graphs that have low average shortest path length, high average degree, or weak community structure. Besides, compared with an local PageRank and an advanced local approximation method, it significantly reduces the computational cost and error rate.
