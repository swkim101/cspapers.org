The objective of this paper is to present lessons learned from a case study conducted in a Brazilian software development unit owned by a multinational organization. The focus of this study is to understand the factors that enable multinationals and virtual corporations to operate successfully across geographic and cultural boundaries. Since the number of organizations distributing their software development processes worldwide keeps increasing, this change is having a profound impact not only on marketing and distribution but also on the way products are conceived, designed, constructed, tested, and delivered to customers. Our results show empirical results towards the identification of problems the organizations involved in offshore insourcing of IT projects have faced when going global.
