Event tracking is the task of discovering temporal patterns of popular events from text streams. Existing approaches for event tracking have two limitations: scalability and inability to rule out non-relevant portions in text streams. In this study, we propose a novel approach to tackle these limitations. To demonstrate the approach, we track news events across a collection of weblogs spanning a two-month time period.
