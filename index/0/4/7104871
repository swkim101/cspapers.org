Comandos is a project within the European Strategic Programme for Research on Information Technology - ESPRIT and it stems from the identified need of providing simpler and more integrated environments for application development in large distributed systems.
The fundamental goal of the project is the definition of an integrated platform providing support for distributed and concurrent processing in a LAN environment, extensible and distributed data management and tools for monitoring and administrating the distributed environment.
An object oriented approach was used as the ground level for the integration of the multidisciplinary concepts addressed in the project.
This paper starts by describing the basic model and architecture of Comandos, which results from a common effort by all the partners in the project. We focus then on the description of a first prototype of the system, which implements a subset of the architecture and is currently running on a set of personal computers and workstations at INESC. The prototype is a testbed for the architecture, providing dynamic linking, access to persistent objects and transparent distribution. Special attention is given to the performance aspects of object invocation in virtual memory.
