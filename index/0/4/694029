Lifelogging services are emerging as promising mobile applications, pursuing to build a user's autobiographical memories. To date, initial attempts of lifelogging services have been proposed, capturing what I see, hear, meet, and visit. These empirical and environmental contexts, surrounding contexts, may help a user reminisce about the past. On the other hand, we focus on an important key feature of lifelogging which has been unexplored so far, i.e., appearance context. The appearance context is about one's facial expression, body image, gaze, posture, gesture, etc. Appearance monitoring in a fine-grained and momentary manner enables total recall of a user, i.e., not only what the user perceives but also how the user is perceived by others. In this poster, we propose FaceLog, a face logging service which automatically and opportunistically captures user's everyday face.
