Recently, research on control and architecture co- design has been drawing increasingly more attention. This is because these techniques integrate the design of the controllers and the architecture and explore the characteristics on both sides to achieve more efficient design of embedded control systems. However, there still exist several challenges like the large design space and inadequate trade-off opportunities for different objectives like control performance and resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a co-optimization approach for FlexRay-based distributed control systems, that synthesizes both the controllers and the task and communication schedules. This approach exploits some FlexRay protocol specific characteristics to reduce the complexity of the whole optimization problem. This is done by employing a customized control design and a nested two-layered optimization technique. Therefore, compared to existing methods, the proposed approach is more scalable. It also allows multi-objective optimization taking into account both the overall control performance and the bus resource utilization. This approach generates a Pareto front representing the trade-offs between these two, which allows the engineers to make suitable design choices.
