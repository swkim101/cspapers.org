A new method for adjusting positions of signal points of a traditional signal constellation used in the BICM-ID (Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation with Iterative Decoding) system is proposed. Optimal rotation angle versus SNRs (Signal-to-Noise Power ratios) in the sense of providing the system with attainable lowest BER (Bit Error Rate) are reported.
