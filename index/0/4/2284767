We construct a deterministic fully polynomial time approximationscheme (FPTAS) for computing the total number of matchings in abounded degree graph. Additionally, for an arbitrary graph, weconstruct a deterministic algorithm for computing approximately thenumber of matchings within running time exp(O(âˆšn log2n)),where n is the number of vertices.
 Our approach is based on the correlation decay technique originating in statistical physics. Previously thisapproach was successfully used for approximately counting thenumber of independent sets and colorings in some classes of graphs [1, 24, 6].Thus we add another problem to the small, but growing, class of P-complete problems for whichthere is now a deterministic FPTAS.
