A number of recent technological trends have made data intensive applications such as continuous media (audio and video) servers a reality. These servers are expected to play an important role in applications such as video-on-demand, digital library, news-on-demand, distance learning, etc. Continuous media applications are data intensive and might require storage subsystems that consist of hundreds of (multi-zone) disk drives. With the current technological trends, a homogeneous disk subsystem might evolve to consist of a heterogeneous collection of disk drives. Given such a storage subsystem, the system must continue to support a hiccup-free display of audio and video clips. This study describes extensions of four continuous display techniques for multi-zone disk drives to a heterogeneous platform. These techniques include IBM's Logical Track [21], HP's Track Pairing [4], and USC's FIXB [9] and deadline driven techniques [10]. We quantify the performance tradeoff associated with these techniques using analytical models and simulation studies. The obtained results demonstrate tradeoffs between the cost per simultaneous stream supported by a technique, the wasted disk space, and the incurred startup latency.
