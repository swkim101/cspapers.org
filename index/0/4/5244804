Little attention has been given to the issues raised in teams that consist of both computerized agents and people. In such situations different considerations are in order, as people tend to make mistakes and they are affected by cognitive, social and cultural factors. In this paper we present a novel agent designed to proficiently coordinate with a human counterpart. The agent uses a neural network model that is based on a pre-existing knowledge base which allows it to achieve an efficient modeling of a human's decisions and predict their behavior. A novel communication mechanism which takes into account the expected effect of communication on the other member will allow communication costs to be minimized. In extensive simulations involving more than 200 people we investigated our approach and showed that our agent achieves better coordination when involved, compared to settings in which only humans or another state-of-the-art agent are involved.
