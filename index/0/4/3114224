1. SUMMARY The ACM K-12 Task Force Curriculum Committee recognized that the lack of integration of computer science into the K-12 curriculum played an important role in the serious shortage of information technologist at all levels [2]. Much effort from the computing community has been devoted to improve the content and delivery of AP Computer Science. However, AP Computer Science is an elective at the high school level, isolating computer science from the standard curriculum. Jane Margolis argued that this has led to minority students “stuck in the shallow end”, missing the opportunities to engage in a computer science experience prior to college [3]. After-school and summer camp activities designed for underrepresented groups are wonderful venues for students to participate in fun and exciting computer science activities. However, only a limited number of students may be reached by extracurricular programs. This panel brings together principle investigators of three National Science Foundation projects to share their experience of working with middle school language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies teachers. The panelists’ presentations will be followed by open discussion on the challenges and solutions for effective delivery of computing curriculum in middle schools.
