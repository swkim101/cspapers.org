Study of large size electronic switching systems (ESS) commenced in 1964 in Japan, expecting it to be a center of communication and processing in the near future information innovation. During this period, DEX-1, DEX-2, DEX-21 and D10 systems were designed, refining them step by step. The final one, somewhat improved over the DEX-21, is now commercially available in the field.
 Two features required in designing DEX systems. One is very high quality in reliability and maintainability as well as effectively low cost. The second is as follows. The development of large scale system, such as Cross-bar system or DEX system, requires an enormous amount of manpower and design refinement by various competitive groups.
 The present design involved close cooperation between NTT Laboratories(ECL) and several manufacturers. On the other hand, in spite of these conditions, NTT requires a unity of devices or components in purchase and repair and requires unity of training from the standpoint of system maintenance and administration. These special NTT requirements were added to the general ones in the design of Design Automation (DA) system for DEX, and exactly the some devices or equipments for high quality ESS can be made by the several manufacturers.
