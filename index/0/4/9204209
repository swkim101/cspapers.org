Today's Internet based businesses need a level of interoperability which will allow trading partners to seamlessly and dynamically come together and do business without ad hoc and proprietary integrations. Such a level of interoperability involves being able to find potential business partners, discovering their services and business processes, and conducting business "on the fly". This process of dynamic interoperation is only possible through standard B2B frameworks. Indeed a number of B2B electronic commerce standard frameworks have emerged recently. Although most of these standards are overlapping and competing, each with its own strenghts and weeknesses, a closer investigation reveals that they can be used in a manner to complement one another.In this paper we describe such an implementation where an ebXML infrastructure is developed by exploiting the Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) registries and RosettaNet Partner Interface Processes (PIPs). ebXML is an ambitious effort and produced detailed specifications of an infrastructure both for B2B and B2C e-commerce. However a public ebXML compliant registry/repository mechanism is not available yet. On the other hand, UDDI's approach to developing a registry has been a lot simpler and public registries are available. In ebXML, trading parties collaborate by agreeing on the same business process with complementary roles. Therefore there is a need for standardized business processes. In this respect, exploiting the already developed expertise through RosettaNet PIPs becomes indispensable. We show how to create and use ebXML "Binary Collaborations" based on RosettaNet PIPs and provide a GUI tool to allow users to graphically build their ebXML business processes by combining RosettaNet PIPs. In ebXML, trading parties reveal essential information about themselves through Collaboration Protocol Profiles (CPPs). To conduct business, an agreement between parties is necessary and this is expressed
