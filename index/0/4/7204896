Active learning for ranking, which is to selectively label the most informative examples, has been widely studied in recent years. In this paper, we propose a general active learning for ranking strategy called Variance Maximization (VM). The algorithm relies on noise injection to perturb the original unlabeled examples and generate the rank distribution of each example. Using a DCG-like gain function to measure each ranked list sampled from the rank distribution, Variance Maximization selects the unlabeled example with the largest variance in the gain. The VM strategy is applied at both the query level and the document level, and a two-stage active learning algorithm is further derived. Experimental results on both the LETOR 4.0 dataset and a real-world Web search ranking dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed active learning approach.
