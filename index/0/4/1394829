Dependency-based Compositional Semantics (DCS) provides a precise and expressive way to model semantics of natural language queries on relational databases, by simple dependency-like trees. Recently abstract denotation is proposed to enable generic logical inference on DCS. In this paper, we discuss some other possibilities to equip DCS with logical inference, and we discuss further on how logical inference can help textual entailment recognition, or other semantic precessing tasks.
