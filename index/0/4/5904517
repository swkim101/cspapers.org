Object-oriented programming environments are increasingly needed for programming 0Is applications. A prototype object-oriented language has been implemented, and we are refining the language and its imple- mentation. The environment integrates a number of database and operating system concepts, in partic- ular, abstract data types, database constraints, atomic transactions, data persistency, triggering of events, reli- ability and crash recovery, and a large virtual memory. We outline the object model, discuss a number of imple-mentation issues, and give some examples of objects useful in an 0Is application environment.
