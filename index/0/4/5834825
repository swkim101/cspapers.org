Stochastic device noise has become a significant challenge for high-precision analog/RF circuits, and it is particularly difficult to correctly include both white noise and flicker noise in the traditional transient verification with an efficient numerical solution. In this paper, a Non-Monte-Carlo transient noise analysis is developed. Both white noise and flicker noise are considered in It√¥ integral based stochastic differential algebraic equation (SDAE), which is solved by one-time calculation of variance using stochastic orthogonal polynomials (SoPs). Our work is the first in literature to provide the SoP-based SDAE solution with application for transient noise analysis. Experiments on a number of different analog circuits demonstrate that the proposed method is up to 488X faster than Monte Carlo method with similar accuracy, and achieves on average 6.8X speedup over the existing non-Monte-Carlo approaches.
